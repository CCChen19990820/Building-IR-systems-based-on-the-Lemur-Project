<center><h3>FOR-PROFIT PUBLIC SCHOOL MANAGEMENT SPREADS</h3></center><p> 
The Minneapolis School Board recently voted to hand over the 
management of all the city's public schools to Public Strategies 
Group, Inc., a private consulting firm that specializes in operating 
public organizations. The Minneapolis-based firm will manage the 
school district's 75 schools and $220 million budget. The school board 
would continue to set policy. The Minneapolis plan is the first 
district-wide privately run program in the country. Elsewhere, only a 
single school or small group of schools is run privately. <p>
Peter Hutchinson, President of Public Strategies, will replace 
the school superintendent if the state grants a waiver to allow a 
person without the traditional credentials to head the school system. 
Hutchinson's pay and the firm's fee will be tied to completion of 
goals such as gains in test scores, improved attendance, and declines 
in violent school incidents.<p>
Public Strategies hopes to revolutionize the way schools are run. 
The firm's CEO, Babak Armajani, says "We want to change the schools 
from the culture of bureaucracy to a culture that focuses on customer 
service, where the parents and students are the customers."<p>
Using management techniques from private schools, companies such 
as Public Strategies are confident they can provide better services 
than publicly run school districts for the same or even less money. 
Critics claim profits will take precedence over quality and 
efficiency. "There is a cynicism about the companies," says Albert 
Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers. "In every 
other sphere of life, if someone came along and said they have a 
special potion to fix schools, you wouldn't treat them as wonderful 
innovators. You would call them hucksters." <p>
But the experience to date suggests Shanker's view is unfounded. 
An earlier venture by Education Alternatives, Inc. (see BEI #8, 11, 
18, 19), a Minneapolis-based private, for-profit company, is in its 
third year of running the South Pointe Elementary School in Dade 
County, Florida, and has run nine public schools in Baltimore, 
Maryland, since August 1992. The company's plan is to test students to 
determine whether they learn best by doing, reading, or hearing, and 
then devise an individual learning plan for each student. Preliminary 
data from April-June 1993, indicate that the students in the Education 
Alternatives schools on average advanced at almost three times the 
rate of those in comparable classes in reading and math. <p>
These early results have satisfied many of the earlier critics 
about the motives of Education Alternatives, Inc. Elijah E. Cummings, 
a Maryland legislator whose district includes the neighborhood where 
the company has taken over the schools, states, "I was the company's 
No. 1 opponent because I had reservations about their profit motive. 
But it has changed the attitude not only of children but of teachers. 
Never have I seen this kind of turnaround."<p>
Parents and students also praise the new arrangement. Pamela 
Brown, a mother, told The New York Times recently, "A lot of parents 
say their kids come home singing. Kids are excited about going to 
school." Adds Sean Urquhart, a fifth grader, "It used to be a boring 
old school. Now its fun and exciting."<p>
Another company hoping to duplicate this Baltimore performance is 
the Edison Project (see BEI #18, 20, 24), headed by entrepreneur 
Christopher Whittle. Its original goal was to build two hundred for-
profit schools by 1996, at a cost of $2.5 billion. But this ambitious 
plan failed to draw sufficient investors, and the plan has now been 
scaled back to a joint public-private partnership, with public school 
systems providing 80 percent to 100 percent of the funds they 
currently spend on students, and private investors spending up to $3.5 
million to upgrade each school. Its new goal is to run six to ten 
charter schools by 1995.<p>
The Edison plan envisions a teacher-student ratio of one to 
sixteen, hiring and firing of teachers based on performance, school 
days of eight hours, school years of 210 days, a six-week summer 
break, a personal computer for each student that parents can also use 
to interact with school officials, stricter discipline, and a core 
curriculum.<p>
School districts intrigued with the idea of private management 
hope the ventures will provide better services at lower cost. Many 
will be looking carefully at Minneapolis to see if this proves to be 
the case. <p>

<h3><center>NATIONAL SCHOOL CHOICE IN SWEDEN</h3></center>
While America debates school choice, Sweden, the model of 
socialist experimentation, has opened up its entire school system to 
genuine competition.<p>
Before the advent of the school choice plan, which was introduced 
in 1992, Swedish government schools enjoyed a virtual monopoly in the 
education system: 99 percent of the Swedish school-age population 
attended public schools. Swedish officials concluded, however, that a 
monopolistic system does not work. "Monopoly is just as disastrous in 
schools as in any other area," says Under Secretary of Education Odd 
Eiken. "We need an alternative, competing system."<p>
Under the new national school choice plan, Swedish parents can 
choose any public or private school anywhere in Sweden. If a student 
chooses to attend a school other than a public school, he gets a 
voucher worth 85 percent of the average cost per student in his 
municipality. Swedish officials insist that a voucher worth 85 percent 
is better than one worth 100 percent, because it creates an incentive 
for parents to find more effective and less expensive schools.<p>
All private schools participating in the voucher program must be 
approved by the Ministry of Education. The basic requirements include 
a core curriculum, no racial or religious discrimination, and an 
agreement that the student's performance will be monitored and 
evaluated by the national evaluation system. Religious schools may 
participate in the voucher program.<p>
Since parliament approved the reform, the number of private 
schools has doubled in response to the demands of Swedish students and 
parents dissatisfied with the quality of government education. Says 
Eiken, "We get a new private school every week."A variety of 
organizations are starting these new schools. Christian and Montessori 
groups are taking the lead. But many have been formed by groups of 
low- and middle-income parents, who have formed companies or co-
operatives to operate schools in their own communities.<p>
Sweden plans to extend the school choice idea to its university 
system. Today, the Swedish government is deeply involved in university 
decision-making -- from faculty appointments to the type of research a 
university pursues. The Swedish government aims to replace this with 
an American-style system, in which universities will decide their own 
admission procedures as well as the way courses and study programs are 
organized. According to Per Unckel, the Swedish Minister of Science 
and Education, this is the only way to improve the system: "Higher 
education and research must be given extensive freedom, and the 
incentives to attain high standards."<p>

<h3><center>SLOW REFORM WORRIES BUSINESS LEADERS</h3></center><p>
A recent report by the Conference Board, a New York City-based 
business organization, says that business leaders are very concerned 
about the lack of progress in American schools. The report, entitled 
"Ten Years After A Nation At Risk," is based on a survey and 
interviews of business leaders and educators.<p>
Authored by Conference Board researchers Leonard Lund and 
Cathleen Wild, the report says that, "While affirming the good 
intentions and the effort in workplace programs," business leaders 
"are deeply disturbed by the lack of broad-based measurable results." 
According to the study, business leaders believe there must be a 
stronger commitment to systematic change, including deregulation and 
school choice. For example, retired IBM education director Jack 
Bowsher told the authors that, "The business leaders of this country 
must demand a total restructuring of the American public school system 
in future years. Then, the C.E.O.s and other well-intentioned leaders 
could decide if they wish to continue to support 'quick-fix feel-good' 
programs that only fine-tune the existing paradigm."<p>
Lund and Wild note that although huge amounts of money have been 
poured into the public school system by business over the past ten 
years since the Department of Education's A Nation At Risk report was 
released, there has been little measurable progress. As Bowsher puts 
it, "The return on investment in education is minimal when one applies 
real quality-control measurements to the public school system."<p>

<h3><center>PRIVATE VOUCHER PROGRAMS FLOURISH </h3></center><p>
The Scholarship Fund for Inner-City Children, a private group 
based in Newark, New Jersey, is making school choice a reality for 
poor children who need it most. Founded in 1984, the Fund already has 
provided 13,700 scholarships.<p>
The fund will disburse $480,000 in scholarships during the 1993-
1994 school year to allow needy students to attend one of the 95 
Catholic inner-city elementary and secondary schools within the 
Archdiocese of Newark, which covers Essex, Hudson, Union, and Bergen 
counties. Only just over half of the scholarship students are 
Catholic. As Kevin Moriarty, the Fund's executive director, notes, 
"Most of our scholarship recipients live in areas where the public 
schools are ineffective and unsafe. For these children a Catholic 
school education represents a golden opportunity to escape from 
poverty and join the mainstream of society. The Fund together with 
Catholic schools gives thousands of children a choice of schools and a 
chance for a brighter future."<p>
In almost every case, a scholarship student graduates and goes on 
to college. "The graduation rate for Catholic high schools within the 
Archdiocese is more than 99 percent," says James H. Lynch, Jr., 
president of the Fund's Board of Trustees, "and 92 percent of their 
graduates enter college immediately upon graduation. If our 
organization can help children in need and at risk to attend schools 
that good, I know that we are doing something worthwhile." <p>
In addition to offering scholarships for elementary and secondary 
education, the Fund participates in programs with Fairleigh Dickinson 
University and Kean College, through which more than $250,000 in 
college scholarships have been awarded to Catholic high school 
graduates for the coming school year.<p>
The Scholarship Program also gives grants to schools to develop 
programs and curricula that address the particular needs of their 
students. For example, one recent grant was given to St. Patrick High 
School in Elizabeth to help establish a Special Education Program for 
students with learning disabilities. The Fund is providing $62,000 
this year to support twelve school-based educational programs similar 
to the one in Elizabeth.<p>
All of the money distributed by the Fund is the result of 
personal, foundation, and corporate donations. The DeWitt Wallace-
Reader's Digest Fund is the largest supporter of the Fund's 
scholarship program. The Samuel I. Newhouse Foundation and the Public 
Service Electric and Gas Company are the largest supporters of its 
school-based programs.<p>
Along with the Scholarship Fund, there are major programs in 
several other cities which help poor children attend the school of 
their choice. Among the private sponsors who perform this role are the 
Indiana-based Golden Rule Insurance Company (BEI #12, 17, 19), the 
Texas Public Policy Foundation (BEI #19), the Milwaukee-based Lynde 
and Harry Bradley Foundation (BEI #6, 21), the Georgia Public Policy 
Foundation (BEI #23), the Student/Sponsor Partnership in New York 
City, and the Washington, D.C.-based Charity for Choice (BEI #23). In 
addition, Bob Woodson, President of the National Center for 
Neighborhood Enterprise, is busy setting up a similar program in 
Newark. Low-income parents have been very eager to seize the 
opportunity to give their children a private alternative to failing 
inner-city schools.<p>

<h3><center>THE QUIET CRISIS:  SCHOOLS FAIL AMERICA'S BRIGHTEST</h3></center><p> 	
A recent report, "National Excellence: A Case for Developing 
America's Talent," published by the U.S. Department of Education, 
claims that America's public schools are failing their smartest 
students.  Many bright students, particularly poor and minority 
students, are not encouraged to work hard or master complex material, 
thereby learning less than their counterparts around the world. The 
result: an absence of high-achieving graduates, particularly in 
mathematics and science. <p>
According to the Department's report, "The U.S. shortage of 
graduate students in mathematics and science forces many large 
companies -- such as Texas Instruments, Bell Laboratories and IBM -- 
to fill jobs, particularly in research, with people educated outside 
the United States."<p>
Most gifted elementary school children have mastered from a third 
to half of the year's curriculum before the first day of class. But 
most teachers make little provision for the special needs of these 
children. In fact, the report finds that 84 percent of assignments for 
gifted students are the same as those for the rest of the class. In 
addition, a survey of gifted high school students finds that they 
spend less than an hour a day doing homework. As Secretary of 
Education Richard Riley writes in the foreword to the report, 
"Youngsters with gifts and talents that range from mathematical to 
musical are not challenged to work to their fullest potential."<p>
The official report urges public schools to let all children 
progress through challenging material at their own pace, and grouping 
students based on their interests and needs.<p>

<h3><center>BIG MONEY BEATS PROPOSITION 174 </h3></center><p>
While California's Proposition 174, which would have created a 
voucher system for California's schools, lost heavily on November 2, 
exit polls indicate that school choice in California is not dead. 
According to an election day exit poll by Luntz Weber Research and 
Strategic Services, more than half of those who voted against 
Proposition 174 would support a different school choice initiative, 
while only 18 percent of Californians are fully opposed to the concept 
of choice in education. The measure gained only 29 percent of the 
vote.<p>
Money appears to have been the biggest factor in Proposition 
174's defeat. School choice advocates were outspent by a 10-to-1 
margin; opponents raised over $16 million for an anti-voucher media 
blitz. Heading up the opposition campaign was the California Teacher's 
Association, who raised $12.5 million by assessing each of its members 
$57. The ad blitz began in mid-September, causing the Proposition to 
slip in the polls. With only $2.6 million available for its 
activities, the pro-voucher campaign could not fight the deluge of 
negative publicity.<p>
While anti-voucher forces had no trouble collecting money for 
their campaign, proponents of Proposition 174 had great difficulty. 
One reason for this is that business leaders were noticeably absent 
from the effort. Ken Kachigian, campaign manager for Proposition 174, 
summed up the situation: "The business community wimped out." Many in 
the business community do not realize the great amount of money the 
present education system is costing them. By not supporting true 
reforms like school choice, they have, in effect, played into the hand 
of the education establishment. Former Education Secretary William 
Bennett notes, "Business always likes to present itself as a friend of 
education, but ends up as a friend of the education establishment."<p>
Despite these difficulties and Proposition 174's defeat, a future 
choice initiative could pass. According to exit polls, 73 percent of 
voters would have voted for the choice measure if they had not felt 
that it would cut the per-pupil spending for public schools. In 
addition, nearly three-fourths of all California voters grade the 
California education system with a "C" or less. There also seems to be 
political capital in endorsing school choice, since 49 percent of the 
electorate say they would be more likely to vote for a public official 
who supports it. Finally, California voters rank the PTA as the single 
most credible organization in the education debate by a 2-to-1 ratio 
over the California Teacher's Association and a 5-to-1 ratio over the 
American Federation of Teachers.<p>
Although the statewide voucher plan was defeated, the threat of 
passage pushed the California state legis-lature into adopting several 
choice reforms to blunt the momentum. These included a mandate on 
school districts to permit choice within their districts, an expansion 
of inter-district choice, and a charter school measure. None of these 
would have been enacted, say choice proponents, without the threat of 
174.<p>
<hr>
<br>
<h3><center>SPEAKER'S CORNER </h3></center><p>
Do the teacher unions represent the ideas and interests of teachers?  
You decide:  <p>
A thousand public school teachers were asked, "If you had to pick one 
of the following as the area that should be given the highest priority 
in public education policy for the next few years, what would it be?" 
 Fully 80 percent of the teachers questioned replied that 
strengthening parents' roles in their children's education should 
receive priority.  <p>
The teacher unions, however, oppose letting parents choose the schools 
their children attend and other education reforms which increase 
parental involvement.  <p>
Seventy-three percent of teachers support expanding alternative 
certification to open the teaching field to qualified professionals 
with degrees in areas other than "education," such as scientists, 
historians, and writers.  <p>
The teacher unions oppose alternative teacher certification.  <p>

<center>
<h2>Private School Choice: <br>
Governor Thompson's Philosophy </h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br> 
<h3><center>Improve Education </h3></center><p>
Milwaukee Public Schools are in dire straits.  Nearly half of its students 
don't graduate, and those who do graduate with an average of 1.6 grade 
point average, which breaks out to a D+. Therefore we need to try new 
ideas geared to breaking the status quo and improving education in 
Milwaukee, particularly for inner city students.  Keep in mind, the 
governor only sees School Choice as one element to the solution; there is 
no silver bullet for this problem. That is why it is imperative that new 
ideas and initiatives be given a chance in Milwaukee. We need to be 
innovative.  <p>
<center><h3>Parent Power </h3></center>
The governor believes that parents need to be empowered as an important 
first step in improving education. Getting parents more  
involved in choosing the school their child attends and monitoring how  
they are doing at that school is a gigantic plus toward making sure  
students are more dedicated to learning and getting a better education.  
The school choice program empowers parents -- particularly poor  
parents -- by giving them a choice. Right now, they don't have a choice.  
They're stuck with the public school the state says their child must  
attend. <p>
<center><h3>Opportunity/Equity </h3></center>
This is at the core of the governor's beliefs. He believes that poor parents 
in Milwaukee should have the same opportunities to educate their 
children as more wealthy parents. Right now, if a wealthy parent is 
unsatisfied with the child's public school, she can afford to send her to a 
private school of higher quality. She has a choice. A poor mother at the 
corner of Sixth and North in Milwaukee doesn't have a choice because 
she cannot afford to send her child to a private school. She's stuck. The 
governor believes that is unfair and detrimental to that child's education 
and future opportunities. The governor sees school choice as just one 
vehicle to provide more opportunities for poor children and families -- 
opportunities that will hopefully enable them to climb out of poverty and 
break the generational cycle. <p>
As a related issue, it's very interesting that a study by the Center for  
Education Reform showed that 33 percent of Milwaukee public school  
teachers send their own children to private schools. First, they can afford  
it and have a choice, unlike poor parents. Second, what's good enough  
for school teachers' kids should be good enough for poor kids. Yet, the  
teachers union is the biggest opponent of school choice. <p>
<center><h3>Constitutionality </center></h3>
If anything is inconsistent in the constitutional question it is that religious 
school choice is not allowed at the K-12 level. Currently, public money is 
allowed to be spent at private, religious pre-schools and day care centers 
(via day care grants) and at religious colleges and universities (via Pell 
grants, G.l. Bill, student loans.) It is only at the K-12 level that we say 
"no," public money can't be spent on private education. Why? School 
choice is very consistent with past practices in this country when it comes 
to education. Also, the voucher system helps address constitutionality 
questions. The parents control the voucher; they decide where it is spent. 
All we're saying is that if they want to spend that voucher at a religious 
school, that is allowable. <p>

<br>
<h2>Gov. Thompson's Religious School Choice Plan Passes</h2><p>
<i><b>Wisconsin becomes first state to offer real education choices to poor 
parents</b></i> 
</center>
<hr>
<br> 
MADISON -- Gov. Tommy G. Thompson's watershed religious school 
choice program was passed by the Wisconsin Legislature on Thursday, 
making Wisconsin the first state in the nation to give poor parents  
the full opportunity to choose where to send their children to school. <p>
The religious school choice program is limited to the city of Milwaukee, 
where the state's current non-sectarian school choice program is already 
in operation. In 1990, Wisconsin became the first state to pass private, 
non-sectarian school choice. <p> 
"The expansion of our school choice program to include religious schools 
will truly empower the poor parents of Milwaukee, giving them the same 
educational choices for their children as other parents," Gov. Thompson 
said. "If a poor inner city mother wants to send her child to the private 
school across the street, rather than busing her child across town to a 
public school she is dissatisfied with, she should have that opportunity 
regardless of her income." <p> 
"Religious values aren't our problem. Drop out rates and low test scores 
are," the governor added. "School choice is a belief that parents know 
best when it comes to their children, not bureaucrats." <p> 
The religious school choice program will accommodate 7,000 students 
beginning with this fall's school year, with an increase to 15,000 students 
in the 1996-97 school year and thereafter. <p> 
The state Legislative Fiscal Bureau estimates the program will cost $17 
million the first year and $39 million the second year for a total of $56 
million. The money will come from a reduction in state aid to Milwaukee 
Public Schools commensurate with the number of students participating 
in the choice program In other words, the money follows the child. The 
payment for each participating student would be equal to whichever is 
less: the private school's operating cost as determined by the state 
education department (on average about $2,800), or the states per pupil 
aid to MPS (about $4,000 in l995-96). <p> 
The religious school choice program gives vouchers to parents who then 
choose the school for their child, thus addressing any constitutionality 
concerns. The governor notes that the state and federal government  
currently pays for children to attend religious preschools or day care 
centers and for students to attend religious colleges and universities, so 
it's now time to include K-12 schools in the mix. <p> 
To be eligible for the program, a student must come from a family whose 
income- is at or below 175 percent of the poverty level (about $26,000 
for a family of four ) For schools to be eligible, they must be  
located within the city of Milwaukee.<p>   
Religious school choice was passed as part of Gov. Thompson's 1995-97 
biennial budget bill. The governor plans to sign the bill within the next 
month. <p>

<h2>A Speech by Gov. Tommy G Thompson of Wisconsin</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
THANK YOU, BROTHER BOB. <p>
WHAT A DAY! <p>
 THIS MORNING I SIGNED INTO LAW THE MOST  
REVOLUTIONARY BUDGET IN OUR STATE'S HISTORY ... <p>
 AND THIS AFTERNOON WE ARE HER; TO CELEBRATE ONE OF  
THE MOST REVOLUTIONARY PARTS OF THAT BUDGET ... THE  
EXPANSION OF THE MILWAUKEE PARENTAL SCHOOL CHOICE  
PLAN. <p> 
"REVOLUTIONARY" IS NOT OVER-STATING THE CASE: THE  
MILWAUKEE SCHOOL CHOICE PROGRAM WAS "THE SHOT  
HEARD ROUND THE WORLD." WE WERE THE FIRST. <p> 
AND NOW OTHERS ARE FOLLOWING OUR LEAD ... OHIO IS  
STARTING SCHOOL CHOICE IN CLEVELAND ... WASHINGTON  
D.C. IS TALKING ABOUT A VOUCHER PROGRAM. <p> 
(YOU KNOW YOU'RE MAKING PROGRESS WHEN WE  
WASHINGTON POST FINALLY ADMITS YOU MIGHT  
ACTUALLY HAVE A GOOD IDEA.) <p> 
WHAT SCHOOL CHOICE IS DOING, LADIES AND GENTLEMEN,  
IS VERY SIMPLE: IT IS REDEFINING PUBLIC EDUCATION.  <p> 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS MUST NO LONGER BE GOVERNMENT-RUN 
SCHOOLS. THEY WILL BE SCHOOLS THAT SERVE THE PUBLIC.  <p> 
SCHOOL CHOICE IS MORE THAN A PROGRAM .. IT IS A  
PHILOSOPHY. <p>
IT IS THE BELIEF THAT PARENTS KNOW BEST WHEN IT COMES  
TO THEIR CHILDREN ... <p> 
AND IT IS THE BELIEF THAT POOR PARENTS HAVE THE SAME  
RIGHT TO CHOOSE THAT OTHER PARENTS DO. <p> 
THAT'S EDUCATION THAT IS SERVING THE PUBLIC. <p> 
WHY SHOULD WE BUS OUR CHILDREN ACROSS TOWN WHEN  
THERE ARE PERFECTLY GOOD SCHOOLS RIGHT IN THEIR OWN  
NEIGHBORHOODS? SCHOOLS LIKE MESSMER. <p> 
THAT DOESN'T MAKE ANY SENSE. AND IT ALSO DOESN'T  
MAKE ANY SENSE TO CROSS VERY GOOD SCHOOLS OFF THE  
LIST SIMPLY BECAUSE THEY HAVE A RELIGIOUS 
AFFILIATION.<p> 
RELIGIOUS VALUES ARE NOT OUR PROBLEM, LADIES AND 
GENTLEMAN, DROP-OUT RATES ARE. <p> 
I AM NOT NAIVE. I KNOW WE ARE GOING TO FACE A FIGHT  
ON THIS. <p> 
BUT I ALSO KNOW WE ARE GOING TO WIN ... BECAUSE WE 
ARE RIGHT! <p> 
OUR OPPONENTS WILL THROW UP SMOKE SCREENS. THEY'LL  
SAY THE ISSUE HERE IS THE SEPARATION OF CHURCH AND   
STATE. <p> 
LET ME TELL YOU WHAT THE ISSUE IS HERE -- TO MAKE SURE  
MILWAUKEE SCHOOL CHILDREN RECEIVE THE BEST  
EDUCATION POSSIBLE... PERIOD. <p> 
THAT'S THE ISSUE ... THAT'S WHY WE ARE HERE TODAY ...  
AND THAT'S WHY WE WILL WIN ANY COURT BATTLES THEY  
THROW IN OUR WAY. <p> 
ONE-THIRD OF MILWAUKEE PUBLIC SCHOOL TEACHERS SEND  
THEIR CHILDREN TO PRIVATE SCHOOLS. <p> 
IT SEEMS TO ME WHAT'S GOOD ENOUGH FOR THEM OUGHT  
TO BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR ALL OF YOU. <p>
THE PHONES ARE RINGING OFF THE HOOK. THOUSANDS OF  
PARENTS HAVE ALREADY CALLED TO MY "GIVE US A  
CHANCE ... GIVE US A CHOICE." <p> 
MEANTIME, OUR OPPONENTS ARE FIGHTING US. THEY'RE  
GOING TO SPEND THEIR MONEY ... THEY'RE GOING TO SUE ...  
THEY'RE GOING TO STAND IN THE WAY OF CHANGE. <p> 
THEY CAN AFFORD TO ... THEY ALREADY HAVE THE CHOICE. <p> 
SO TODAY, WE ARE LEVELING THE PLAYING FIELD. <p> 
WE ARE SAYING IT DOESN'T MATTER IF YOU LIVE ON LAKE  
DRIVE ... OR 35TH AND NORTH ... <p> 
YOU ARE GOING TO HAVE THE RIGHT TO CHOOSE THE BEST  
SCHOOL FOR YOUR OWN CHILD. <p> 
TOGETHER, YOU AND I HAVE TURNED MILWAUKEE INTO THE  
LEXINGTON AND CONCORD OF THE EDUCATION REFORM  
BATTLEFRONT. <p>
TODAY, WE ARE TAKING THE NEXT STEP. EVERYONE IS  
LOOKING TO US. <p> 
LETS SHOW THEM WHAT WE'VE GOT! <p>
THANK YOU. <p>

<title>THE CASE AGAINST 
THE US EDUCATION DEPARTMENT</title>
<center><h2>THE CASE AGAINST <br>
THE US EDUCATION DEPARTMENT</h2>

<h4><i>by</i><br>
<i>Jennifer A. Marshall and Eric Unsworth</i>
</h4></center>
<hr size="3" width="30%"><br>
A century and a half ago, Alexis de Tocqueville recognized that increased centralization and bureaucratization take away civic and individual responsibility: "[A] centralized administration is fit only to enervate the nations in which it exists, by incessantly diminishing their local spirit."<p>

It isn't just fiscal crisis that necessitates the latest round of proposed budget cuts -- our social crisis demands that the role of the federal government be cut back.  Bureaucracies like the US Education Department breed local apathy and mediocrity and should be eliminated -- even if we had a budget surplus.<p>

Once upon a time the federal role in education was constitutional: it had none. Things began to change in the 1930s when the New Deal brought increasing federal involvement.  Later, under President Eisenhower, Congress created the cabinet-level Department of  Health, Education and Welfare.  In 1965, Lyndon Johnson rammed through Congress the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which vastly expanded federal involvement.<p>

Then, in 1976, candidate Jimmy Carter promised a separate education department and received the backing of the National Education Association (NEA) as a result.  In 1979, President Carter, facing a liberal challenge from Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.), set about to make good on his promise.  But there was strong opposition from the American Federation of Teachers, from much of higher education, and from the general public.  The AFL-CIO attacked the idea and even the <i>Washington Post </i>argued that bureaucratic costs would increase.<p>

Marvin Stone, writing for <i>U.S. News & World Report</i>, articulated the fears of many Americans:  "Would the Education Department have the power to tamper with America's traditional local control of education?  Of course it would.  Where there is money to be given, there is the implicit responsibility to make sure that it is spent according to the purposes of the donors -- or else."  Though the bill establishing the department stated emphatically that state and local control would not be undermined, Stone was not convinced, citing a "subtle schizophrenia meandering through the legislation" that revealed the authors' true intentions.<p>
									

The US Education Department, then, is a bureaucracy with a dubious past.  Its conception was of doubtful legitimacy, given the strictures of the Constitution and tradition.  The circumstances of its birth were also suspect -- more or less a political payoff to the NEA.  And the US Education Department has not improved American education.<p>

Before its creation, President Carter could point to "[o]ur Nation's pluralistic education system" as "the most competent and open in the world."  No longer so.  According to former Secretary of Education William Bennett, more than 90 percent of the students entering US colleges today would not be admitted to institutions of higher learning anywhere else in the world.<p>

Meanwhile, the US Education Department has grown into a huge bureaucratic "blob,"  elbowing its way into places it does not belong.  Federal intrusiveness reached a new height with passage of Goals 2000, which John Jennings, director of the Center on National Education Policy, calls "a monumental movement <i>away</i> from local control of education" (emphasis added).<p>

Goals 2000 promotes national education goals and standards that override local priorities and ignore the fact that many private entities have developed gauges for student learning.  University of Virginia professor E.D. Hirsch has written a series of books on cultural literacy, describing fundamentals of education at each grade level.  The Family Research Council has published an outline of US history entitled <i>Let Freedom Ring</i>.  William Bennett's best-selling <i>Book of Virtues</i> is a wonderful source on America's literary heritage.  All of these examples meet the need for a high academic standard.<p>

How is it possible that a program like Goals 2000 -- quite inimical to American tradition -- has become the manual for running local schools?  Partly through subterfuge:  the insistent repetition that it is entirely voluntary.  Partly because the profound crisis of American education has convinced many that only an enormous federal initiative can cope with it.  But this conviction is based on a fallacy: <i> the fallacy that the federal government has money of its own</i>.  Our culture of dependency has forgotten that the only money the US Education Department or any other federal agency has, is money that citizens have earned.<p>

Tocqueville's lesson has been relearned in our times:  centralization and huge bureaucracies don't work very well. That truth swept away the regimes of the Soviet Union and half a host of other countries.  Finally, it's beginning to hit home, too.<p>  

Today, no politician would dare highlight the facts which President Carter touted in his proposal for a US Education Department:  over 150 programs, 16,200 employees, and a budget of more than $13 billion, making Education larger than five other departments.  Such big-government philosophy has been rightfully stigmatized.<p>  

Bureaucracy must be pruned back to effect a renewal of the local spirit that Alexis de Tocqueville praised so highly in 1835:<p>

<blockquote>I know of no people who have established schools so numerous and efficacious, places of public worship better suited to the wants of the inhabitants, or roads kept in better repair.  Uniformity or permanence of design, the minute arrangement of details, and the perfection of administrative system must not be sought for in the United States; what we find there is the presence of a power which, if it is somewhat wild, is at least robust, and an existence checkered with accidents, indeed, but full of animation and effort.</blockquote>

It's time to disestablish the US Education Department -- for the sake of American education, our fiscal health, and the renewal of local spirit.<p><br>

<title>DISESTABLISHING THE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</title>
</head>
<BODY>
<center><h2>DISESTABLISHING THE<br> DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</h2></center>
<h4><center>Testimony of Robert G. Morrison<br>
Education Policy Analyst<br>
Family Research Council<br>
before the House Committee on Economic<br>
and Educational Opportunities <br>
June 29, 1995</center>
</h4><hr size="3" width="30%"><br>
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee:  my name is Robert G. Morrison and I am here to represent Gary Bauer and the Family Research Council.  Our organization serves more than 250,000 members nationwide.  I served with Gary Bauer in the U.S. Department of Education from 1985-87.  My testimony today will call for the disestablishment of the Department of Education and the repeal of Goals 2000, the Educate America Act. <p>

In 1979, when President Jimmy Carter first proposed the creation of a U.S. Department of Education to repay the National Education Association for its political support,  columnist Marvin Stone warned of  the centralization of power over education:  writing for <i>U.S. News & World Report</i>, Stone asked:  "Would the Education Department have the power to tamper with America's traditional local control of education?  Of course it would.  Where there is money to be given, there is the implicit responsibility to make sure that it is spent according to the purposes of the donors -- or else."  Despite half-hearted objections at the time, the Department has moved inexorably toward greater and greater control over local education.  With Goals 2000, the U.S. Education Department and other federal bureaucracies seek to tighten their grip on the genuine education reform movement and extinguish it. <p>

Of course, these ceaseless efforts at centralization will fail.  They must fail, because they sap local community spirit and individual responsibility.  They must fail because, as Mr. Jefferson said:  "If we waited for Washington to tell us when to sow and when to reap, we should soon want bread."  They must fail for an even more profound reason.  Alexis de Tocqueville has been recently quoted both by President Bill Clinton and by Speaker Gingrich.  But Tocqueville, as a genius of political science, explained <i>why</i> the attempt to centralize administration ultimately fails.<p>

<i>However enlightened and skillful a central power may be, it cannot of 
itself embrace all the details of the life of a great nation.  Such vigilance exceeds the powers of man. And when it attempts unaided to create and set in motion so many complicated springs, it must submit to a very imperfect result or exhaust itself in bootless efforts. <br>
							- - Alexis de Tocqueville
							Democracy in America, 1835
</i><p>
"Imperfect results" and  "bootless efforts" pretty well describe the record of the U.S. Education Department.  Under the spur of Goals 2000, the Department has seen fit to endorse the new national history standards.  These politically-correct standards seek to teach all American students that Madonna and the Simpsons are significant figures, while neglecting Paul Revere, the Wright Brothers, Marian Anderson and Jonas Salk.  They speak of "Soviet advances in space" and the <i>Challenger</i> disaster, while completely omitting the U.S. landing on the moon even though Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., a respected liberal historian, has said that the moon landing may be the most significant event of the twentieth century.  Worse, the standards could be fairly termed "anti-American" history standards because they teach young people that U.S.-Soviet "swordplay" led to the American involvement in Korea, Vietnam and U.S. interventions around the world.  Never do the standards speak of Soviet invasions of Hungary, Czechoslovakia or Afghanistan.  Never do the standards acknowledge communist efforts at subversion in the U.S. or Western Europe.  We urge this committee and the full House to join the Senate in denouncing these history standards.<p>

Not only do we at Family Research Council believe that the national history standards that have been produced are unacceptable, we believe that <i>any</i> effort of the federal government to dispense official truth is misguided and dangerous.  We have only to look at the Clinton administration's recently reported failure in the area of childhood immunizations to recognize the harm that government can do when it manufactures a crisis based on faulty data and a political agenda.  Yet, if there are any of our liberal friends who still defend the idea of a political determination of  U.S. history, we would ask them to consider this:  what if national history and economics standards were to be devised by Professor Gingrich, Professor Gramm and Professor Armey?<p>

The reality in contemporary American life is that parents, taxpayers and citizens generally are not of one accord about all education programs.  There is broad support, measured by polls, for safe and drug-free schools.  There is consistent public backing for schools which teach children reading, writing, arithmetic and history, for schools which impart reliable standards of right and wrong.  But there is no stable consensus on many other hotly-debated issues.   Family life and sex education continue to be points of contention.  Methods of teaching reading, similarly, divide Americans.  So, too, does the teaching of evolution.  Even bilingual education is fraught with controversy.  What the Education Department and Goals 2000 do is put the federal government in the middle of all these controversies. <p>

When the federal government becomes an antagonist, it is viewed increasingly as hostile to one or another group of parents or interests.  That is why we at Family Research Council support the <i>disestablishment</i> of the U.S. Department of Education and the <i>repeal</i> of Goals 2000.  We seek the return of decision-making  authority  to local communities -- to elected school boards which are close to the people they serve.  We also strongly support parental choice of schools.  Only when every parent can freely choose a safe and effective public, private, religious or home school will we have an end to the interminable clashes over education and values. <p>

Many in the education establishment, we know, question whether parents are capable of
wisely choosing a school for their children.  To this we can only answer:  if parents are capable of choosing presidents, governors and members of congress, then surely they can choose a school.  Further, if advocates of a public school monopoly persist on this point, we must challenge them.  If Americans cannot make an <i>educated </i>choice of schools for their own children, whom they love, then who bears the responsibility for their failure? We have had compulsory public schools in this country for a century and a half.  Nearly ninety percent of Americans attend those schools.  The fact is, of course, parental choice works.  That's why some of those most knowledgeable about education -- including teachers' union members, the Clintons and the Gores -- choose their own children's' schools. <p>

Our vision for education reform includes a de-centralization of decision-making which will not only be effective in getting us "back to basics,"  but which will also reinvigorate democracy at the grassroots.  One of the reasons why Goals 2000 will fail is because it saps local initiative and disperses accountability.  There are also historical reasons.  We have attempted a more modest, arguably a more realistic national goals effort before.<p>

 In 1984, the Reagan administration sought to set out Goals 1990.  It hoped to have American students recoup just <i>one-half </i>of the points lost in the SATs since the mid-60s.  Initially, there were some hopeful upticks.  But, by the end of the decade of the 80s, it became clear that American students were not listening to even the best lectures from the Bully Pulpit.  In 1990, President Reagan had retired to California, deservedly honored for his central role in the defeat of communism, respected throughout the world for unleashing a great and productive economy and looked to with gratitude by millions of American families for his championing of parental rights and traditional values.  No one criticized Ronald Reagan for the failure of U.S. students to achieve Goals 1990. <p>

The education establishment says that "kids deserve a place at the table with the President."  It's an attractive soundbite.  But it would be far better for us to have a nation of  "education mothers and fathers" and empowered local education leaders than it would be to hold out a role for the President or Congress that is neither realistic nor constitutionally appropriate.  The truth is, the President and Congress are always going to be preoccupied with taxing and trading, with national defense and international cooperation.  We need to move beyond "kids as props" to show Washington's intimate concern for education. <p>

This Congress has before it legislation which will disestablish the Department of Education and repeal Goals 2000.  Family Research Council shares these objectives.  We look forward to working with the members of this committee and with your staff to perfect it.  We urge this committee to give the resources and the responsibility back to the parents, taxpayers and locally elected leaders who can most effectively act to improve education. <p>

To de-centralize education decision-making is to recognize once again "the genius of the people" of which Madison spoke in <i>The Federalist Papers</i>.  By disestablishing the U.S. Department of Education and repealing Goals 2000, this Congress will demonstrate its respect for the Constitution and, especially, the Tenth Amendment.  This Congress will show that it listens to the petitions and the concerns of millions of parents.  Congress will also prove that it is serious about cutting wasteful federal spending.  While this action may not gain this body the title of  the "Education Congress" from the vested interest, it will win for this Congress a new measure of gratitude and respect for restoring "Democracy in America."<p><br>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<h2>NEA Yearly Report: Agenda for 1995</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
The Association believes that closed public school buildings should be 
sold or leased only to those organizations that do not provide direct 
educational services to students and/or are not in direct competition 
with public schools. <p>
A-11.  Federal Financial Support for Education. <p>
The Association asserts that a major federal role is to collect basic 
data to be used in public schools and to engage in research, 
development, and consultation activities.  The Association further 
believes that funding for federal programs should be substantially 
increased. <p>
A-13.  Basic Financial Support of Public Education. <p>
Funds must be provided for programs to alleviate race, gender, and 
sexual orientation discrimination and to eliminate portrayal of race, 
gender, and sexual orientation stereotypes in the public schools.<p> 
A-27.  Deleterious Programs. <p>
The National Education Association believes that the following 
programs and practices are detrimental to public education and must be 
eliminated:  privatization, performance contracting, tax credits for 
tuition to private and parochial schools, voucher plans (or funding 
formulas that have the same effect as vouchers), planned program 
budgeting systems (PPBS), and evaluations by private, profit-making 
groups. <p>
 A-28.  Federally or State-Mandated Choice/Parental Option Plans. <p>
The Association opposes federally or state-mandated choice or parental 
option plans. <p>
A-29.  Tuition Tax Credits. <p>
The Association believes that all federal and state legislation 
designed to establish or implement plans for prekindergarten through 
grade 12 tuition tax credits is detrimental to the public interest and 
urges it affiliates to work for the defeat of such legislation. <p>
A-30.  Voucher Plans. <p>
The Association beleives that legislation or ballot 
initiatives/referenda designed to establish or implement 
prekindergarten through grade 12 voucher plans are detrimental to the 
public interest and calls upon its affiliates to work for the defeat 
of such actions. <p>
B-1.  Early Childhood Education. <p>
The National Education Association supports early childhood education 
programs in the public schools for children from birth through age 
eight.  The Association supports a high-quality program of transition 
from home and/or preschool to the public kindergarten or first grade.  
The Association further believes that early childhood education 
programs should include a full continuum of services for parents and 
children, including child care, child development, developmentally 
appropriate and diversity-based curricula, special education, and 
appropriate bias-free screening services.  The Association believes 
that federal legislation should be enacted to assist in organizing the 
implementation of fully funded early childhood education programs 
offered through the public schools.  These programs should be 
available to all children on an equal basis and should include 
mandatory kindergarten with compulsory attendance. <p>
B-7.  Sexism in Education. <p>
The Association endorses the use of nonsexist language by all schools.  
The Association further believes that sexism and sex discrimination 
must be eliminated from the curriculum. <p>
B-8.  Sexual Orientation Education.   <p>
The National Education Association recognizes the importance of 
raising the awareness and increasing the sensitivity of staff, 
students, parents, and the community to sexual orientation in our 
society.  The Association therefore supports the development of 
positive plans that lead to effective ongoing training programs for 
education employees for the purpose of identifying and eliminating 
sexual orientation stereotyping in the educational setting.  Such 
programs should attend to but not be limited to - <p>
<ul>	
<li> Accurate portrayal of the roles and contributions of gay, 
lesbian, and bisexual people throughout history, with acknowledgement 
of their sexual orientation, 
<li>  The acceptance of diverse sexual orientation and the 
awareness of sexual stereotyping whenever sexuality and/or tolerance of diversity is 
taught, 
<li>  Elimination of sexual orientation name-calling and jokes in 
the classroom. 
<li>  Support for the celebration of a Lesbian and Gay History 
Month as a means of acknowledging the contributions of lesbians, gays, 
and bisexuals throughout history. 
</ul><p> 
B-20.  Educational Programs for Limited English Proficiency Students. <p>
The Association urges that those students whose primary language is 
other than English be placed in bilingual education programs to 
receive instruction in their native language from qualified teachers 
until such time as English proficiency is achieved.  The Association 
believes bilingual education programs should be promoted and supported 
at the federal, state, and local levels. <p>
B-22.  Adolescent Pregnancy and Parenting. <p>
The Association recommends that special programs for adolescents be 
implemented to include - <p>
<ul>
<li>Development of positive self-esteem and self concept. 
<li>Establishment of on-site child care services. 
</ul><p>
B-27.  Multicultural/Global Education. <p>
The National Education Association believes that multiculturalism is 
the process of valuing differences and incorporating these values into 
behavior for the goal of achieving the common good.  The Association 
further believes that multicultural/global education is a way of 
helping students perceive the cultural diversity of U.S. citizenry so 
that they may develop pride in their cultural legacy.  
Multicultural/global education develops an awareness of cultures and 
an appreciation of our interdependency in sharing the world's limited 
resources. <p>
B-30.  Career Education. <p>
The career education concept needs to include programs in gender-free 
career awareness.  The Association believes that educational programs 
for all students should be developed that will enhance self-esteem. <p>
B-34.  Family Life Education. <p>
The Association recommends that programs be established for both 
students and parents and supported at all educational levels to 
promote - <p>
<ul>
<li>The development of self-esteem. 
<li>Education in human growth and development. 
</ul><p>
The Association believes that education in these areas must be 
presented as part of an antibiased culturally sensitive program. <p>
B-35.  Sex Education. <p>
The Association recognizes that the public school must assume an 
increasingly important role in providing the instruction.  Teachers 
and health professionals must be qualified to teach in this area and 
must be legally protected from censorship and lawsuits.  The 
Association urges its affiliates and members to support appropriately 
established sex education programs, including information on sexual 
abstinence, birth control, and family planning, diversity of culture, 
diversity of sexual orientation, parenting skills, prenatal care, 
sexually transmitted diseases, incest, sexual abuse, sexual 
harassment.  To facilitate the realization of human potential, it is 
the right of every individual to live in an evironment of freely 
available information, knowledge, and wisdom about sexuality. <p>
B-36.  AIDS Education. <p>
The National Education Association recommends that educational 
institutions establish comprehensive acquired immunodeficiency syndrom 
(AIDS) education programs as an integral part of the school 
curriculum. <p>
B-38.  Environmental Education. <p>
The Association further urges the development and improvement of 
educational programs that will - <p>
<ul>	
<li>  Promote the concept of the interdependence of humanity and 
nature. 
<li>  Develop an awareness of the effects of past, present, and 
future population growth patterns on world civilization, human 
survival, and the environment. 
<li>  Promote an understanding of the necessity to protect 
endangered, threatened, and rare species. 
<li>  Promote an understanding of the necessity to protect the 
earth's finite resources. 
</ul><p>
The Association urges its affiliates to support environmental programs 
n school systems. <p>
B-52.  Standardized Testing of Students. <p>
The National Education Association opposes standardized testing that 
is mandated by local, state, or national authority.  The Association 
also opposes the use of these tests to compare one student, staff 
member, school, or district with another. <p>
B-63.  Home Schooling. <p>
The National Education Association believes that home schooling 
programs cannot provide the student with the comprehensive education 
experience.  The Association believes that if parental preference home 
schooling study occurs, students enrolled must meet all state 
requirements.  Instruction should be by persons who are licensed by 
the appropriate state education licensure agency, and a curriculum 
approved by the state department of education should be used.  The 
Association further believes that home schooling programs should be 
limited to the children of immediate family, with all expenses being 
borne by the parents. <p>
First New B.  Diversity. <p>
The National Education Association believes that diversity is any 
combination of similarities and differences of people in community, 
work places, school systems, or similar environments.  Some examples 
are race, ethnicity, color, national origin, language, geographic 
location, religion, gender, sexual orientation, age, physical ability, 
size, and marital, parental, or economic status.  The Association 
further believes that all education employees must recognize and 
respect diversity that exists among students and all the peoples. <p>
Second New B.  Global Education. <p>
The National Education Association beleives that global education 
increases respect and awareness of planet earth and its people.  
Global education imparts information about cultures and an 
appreciation of our interdependency in sharing the world's resources 
to meet mutual human needs. <p>
C-1.  Health Care for All Children. <p>
The National Education Association believes that every child should 
have direct and confidential access to comprehensive health care.  The 
Association urges its affiliates to support legislation to provide 
comprehensive health care to all children. <p>
C-7.  Day Care. <p>
The National Education Association believes that all child care 
centers should be examined and monitored on a continuous basis, and 
additiona legislation should be sought as necessary to maintain the 
highest quality child care.  The Association encourages school 
districts and educational institutions to establish on-site child care 
for preschoolers, students, the children of students, and the children 
of staff members. <p>
C-23.  Comprehensive School Health Programs and Services. <p>
The National Education Association believes that every child should 
have direct and confidential access to comprehensive health, social, 
and psychological programs and services.  The Association also 
believes that programs in the schools should provide a planned 
sequential, K-12 health education curriculum that integrates various 
health topics (such as drug abuse, violence, universal precautions, 
and HIV education).  The Association believes that services in the 
schools should include - <p>
<ul>
<li> Counseling programs that provide developmental guidance and 
broad-based interventions and referrals, 
<li>Comprehensive school-based, community-funded student health 
care clinics, 
<li> If deemed appropriate by local choice, family-planning 
counseling and access to birth control methods with instruction in 
their use. 
</ul><p>
C-24.  School Counseling Programs. <p>
The National Education Association believes that guidance and 
counseling programs should be integrated into the entire education 
system, beginning at the prekindergarten level. <p>
C-29.  Student Sexual Orientation. <p>
The Association believes that every school district and educational 
institution should provide counseling and suicide prevention programs 
by trained personnel for students who are struggling with their 
sexual/gender orientation. <p>
C-30.  Placement of Students with HIV/AIDS. <p>
The Association believes that students should not be refused 
admittance to school or subjected to any other adverse action solely 
because they have tested positive for HIV or have been diagnosed as 
having AIDS. <p>
C-31.  Suicide Prevention Programs. <p>
The National Education Association believes that suicide prevention 
programs including prevention, intervention, and postvention must be 
developed and implemented.  The Association urges its affiliates to 
ensure that these programs are an integral part of the school program. <p>
C-34.  Drug and Alcohol Testing of Students. <p>
The National Education Association believes that mandatory drug and 
alcohol testing of students without probable cause is an unwarranted 
and unconstitutional invasion of privacy and opposes such testing. <p>
C-40.  Gender Equity in Athletic Programs. <p>
The National Education Association believes that at all educational 
levels female and male students must have equal opportunity to 
participate in athletic programs.  The Association urges that athletic 
funds for facilities, equipment, and remuneration of staff be 
allocated equally between female and male programs. <p>
D-18.  Competency Testing and Evaluation. <p>
The National Eduation Association believes that competency testing 
must not be used as a condition of employment, license retention, 
evaluation, placement, ranking, or promotion of licensed teachers. <p>
E-9.  Academic and Professional Freedom. <p>
The National Education Association believes that academic freedom is 
essential to the teaching profession.  Academic freedom includes the 
rights of teachers and learners to explore and discuss divergent 
points of view.  The Association further believes that legislation and 
regulations that mandate or permit the teaching of religious doctrines 
and/or groups that promote anti-public education agendas violate both 
student and teacher rights.  The Association urges it affiliates to 
seek repeal of these mandates where they exist. <p>
F-4.  Affordable Health Care. <p>
The Association urges its affiliates to do all they can to enroll our 
members, their dependents, domestic partners, and retired education 
employees in comprehensive, affordable health insurance plans. <p>
F-34.  Drug and Alcohol Testing.  <p>
The Association believes that 
mandatory and/or random drug and alcohol testing of employees and job 
applicants is an unwarranted and unconstitutional invasion of privacy 
and opposes such testing. <p>
F-36.  Employees with HIV/AIDS. <p>
The National Education Association believes that education employees 
shall not be fired, nonrenewed, suspended (with or without pay), 
transferred, or subjected to any other adverse employment action 
solely because they have tested positive for the human 
immunodeficiency virus/acquired immunodeficiency syndrom (HIV/AIDS) 
antibody or have been diagnosed as having HIV/AIDS. <p>
H-6.  National Health Care Policy. <p>
The Association supports the adoption of a single-payer health care 
plan for all residents of the United States, its territories, and the 
Commonwealth of Puerto Rico. <p>
H-10.  Statehood for the District of Columbia. <p>
The Association urges its affiliates to support efforts to achieve 
statehood for the District of Columbia. <p>
New H.  Celebration of Diversity in Thanksgiving. <p>
The National Education Association believes that Thanksgiving is the 
recognition of unity and the rich American diversity that was embodied 
in the settlement of America.  The Association further believes that 
this national holiday must celebrate the coming together of peoples 
and the inclusion of all immigrants as a part of this great diverse 
country. <p>
I-11.  Civil Rights. 
The Association calls upon Americans to eliminate - by statute and 
practice - barriers of race, color, national origin, religion, 
philosophical beliefs, political beliefs, gender, sexual orientation, 
age, disability, size, marital status, and economic status that 
prevent some individuals, adult or juvenile, from exercising rights 
enjoyed by others. <p>
I-13.  Family Planning. <p>
The National Education Association supports family planning, including 
the right to reproductive freedom.  The Association further urges the 
implementation of community-operated, school-based family planning 
clinics that will provide intensive counseling by trained personnel. <p>
I-18.  Immigration. <p>
The Assocation opposes any policies that deny human rights, civil 
rights, or educational opportunities to imigrants and their children 
regardless of their immigration status. <p>
I-22.  Freedom of Creative Expression. <p>
The National Education Association supports freedom of expression in 
the creative arts and therefore deplores any efforts by government to 
suppress, directly or indirectly, such expression.  The Association 
further supports the freedom of publicly funded agencies to exercise 
judgment in the awarding of grants to individuals and organizations. <p>
I-25.  Human Relations in the School. <p>
The Association calls for school recruitment and staffing policies 
that will ensure culturally diverse school employees [and] appropriate 
classroom and other student-related activities, particularly those 
that are responsive to the cultural diversity and historical 
backgrounds of our society. <p>
I-27.  Sectarian Practices in the School Program. <p>
The National Education Association believes that the constitutional 
provisions on the establishment of and the free exercise of religion 
in the First Amendment require that there be no sectarian practices in 
the public school program. <p>
I-28.  Control of Guns. <p>
The National Education Association believes that stricter legislation 
is needed to control guns and other deadly weapons. <p>
I-46.  English as the Official Language. <p>
The National Education Association recognizes the importance of an 
individual's native language and culture and the need to promote and 
preserve them.  The Association believes that efforts to legislate 
English as the official language disregard cultural pluralism; deprive 
those in need of education, social services, and employment; and must 
be challenged. <p>
I-49.  Equal Opportunity for Women. <p>
The Association supports the proposed Equal Rights Amendment to the 
U.S. Constitution.  The Association urges its affiliates to support 
ratification of such an amendment.  Personnel policies must include 
family leave, maternity leave, paternity leave, leave for adoption of 
a child, child-care leave, and professional leave.  The Association 
believes that sexism and sex discrimination must be eliminated and 
endorses the use of nonsexist language. <p>
New I.  Freedom of Religion. <p>
The Association opposes federal or state legislation or other mandates 
that would require school districts to schedule a moment of silence.  
The Association particularly opposes a moment of silence as a 
condition for receiving federal, state, or other funds. <p>
<hr>
Typist's note: - So...there you have it.  Kind of makes you wonder, 
when exactly is it that these good folks have time to believe, urge, 
recommend, promote the instruction of students in such obviously 
unimportant areas as math, science, reading, writing, comprehension.   <p>
My suggestion -  TAKE YOUR KIDS AND RUN FOR THE NEAREST EXIT FROM THE 
PUBLIC SCHOOLS!  <p>

If further centralization of education and added bureaucracy will improve America's schools, if federal coercion will promote school autonomy, if government nannies are expert teachers of parenting skills -- then Goals 2000 is exactly what the ailing American education system needs.<p>

But Americans overwhelmingly rejected last fall the "government knows best" philosophy of which Goals 2000 is another manifestation.  If this Congress intends to keep its campaign promises of decentralizing authority, returning power to states and localities, empowering American families, balancing the budget, and reducing the deficit, then Goals 2000 must be repealed.  It is an impediment to these goals.  Leaving intact the Goals 2000 formula for restructuring American education will undo any education reform this Congress hopes to accomplish. <p>

Goals 2000 (P.L. 103-227) is the Clinton Administration's plan to drastically restructure the American education system.  "Goals 2000 establishes overall direction for a new local-state-federal partnership in education," writes Gordon M. Ambach, executive director of the Council of Chief State School Officers.1 It increases the federal role by imposing a congressional formula for reform on any state, school district, or school that wishes to receive funding under this act.  <p>

The priority of the restructuring agenda can be seen in the appropriations.  Less than half the funding for Goals 2000 will reach local schools in this first year of its existence.  Of the $105 million appropriated for Goals 2000 in FY 94, $92.4 million (88 percent) is targeted toward state grants.  Stipulations in the law require that only 45 percent of each state's grant be filtered down to individual schools.2  That means only $42 million, or 40 percent of the original appropriation, will ever reach the schools.  The other 60 percent constitutes the bureaucratic skim that is being used at each level to create the new framework for the educational system. <p>
The danger of the Goals 2000 restructuring agenda is that all future federal experimentation with education will be easily inculcated into the new network.  Local schools will be extremely vulnerable to manipulation and have little, if any, autonomy.<p>


									
The bureaucratic waste and ominous restructuring agenda of Goals 2000 are just the beginning of the argument against this legislation that will radically change American education.  Its ten titles contain dozens of problem areas that warrant the repeal of Goals 2000.<p>

<center>	<h3><a name="goals"></a>TITLE I -- NATIONAL EDUCATION GOALS</h3></center>
			
This title codifies eight national education goals.  Six were developed by 49 governors and President Bush in 1989 at the Charlottesville education summit.  The other two goals, parental participation and teacher education, were added as bait to sell the Goals 2000 legislation to interest groups, such as teacher unions and the PTA, which supposedly represent the views of teachers and parents. <p>
<ul>
<li>The concept of national education goals is based on faulty logic.  If the federal government is setting goals, that presupposes that it has the authority and ability to ensure the accom-plishment of the goals.  Reaching national education goals will require an unprecedented federal intrusion in schools. <p> 

  <li>Had the goals been popularly developed and had Americans asked for federal supervision in achieving them, Goals 2000 might be procedurally, if not philosophically, a legitimate plan.  They did not and it is not.  Secretary Riley reveals this as he retells the history of the Goals 2000 legislation:<p>
</ul><br>
<blockquote>In the first place, educators had not been in on the ground floor when the National Education Goals were developed in 1989 and 1990.  The goals were viewed by many as a classic example of a top-down reform imposed on localities....  Nor had parents, citizens, or the business community been brought into the picture in a meaningful way....  Finally, neither members of Congress nor state legislators had a hand in crafting the goals....  The truth was that the reform movement at the national level had absolutely no statutory basis....  The National Education Goals, three years after their announcement, had no legal standing of any kind.</blockquote>
<ul>
<li>National education goals cannot be reached through a <i>voluntary </i>program.  If the Clinton Education Department intends to reach these goals, they certainly cannot believe that Goals 2000 is voluntary, or at least they do not intend that it will be optional for long.  The goals are stated in section 102 using all-inclusive language:  "all students will leave grades 4, 8, and 12 having demonstrated competency over challenging subject matter...," and "every school in the United States will be free of drugs...."  These goals absolutely cannot be accomplished through a voluntary program.  The crafters of this legislation were either deceived or deceptive when they touted Goals 2000 as voluntary.<p></ul>


<center>	<h3><a name="reform">TITLE II -- NATIONAL EDUCATION REFORM LEADERSHIP,
 	STANDARDS AND ASSESSMENTS</a></h3></center> 			

Understanding title II is key to understanding the significance and danger of the Goals 2000 legislation.  This title is the heart of the restructuring agenda.  It creates two new national bureaucracies:  the National Education Goals Panel (NEGP) and the National Education Standards and Improvement Council (NESIC).<p>

The driving force of the Goals 2000 reform plan lies in title II:  <i>standards</i>.  Three types of national standards are defined:  content standards, performance standards and opportunity-to-learn standards.  In order to apply for a grant under Goals 2000, each state must develop its own content, performance and opportunity-to-learn standards, or adopt the national standards in each of the three areas (see title III).<p>  

Title II is very problematic for anyone who believes in a decentralized system of education:<p>
<ul>
<li>Clearly, adding bureaucracy is contrary to the goals of this Congress.  It will not lead to better education, only waste.	<p>

<li> Goals 2000 called for the creation of the National Education Standards and Improvement Council (NESIC) within 120 days of the law's enactment (March 31, 1994) [Sec. 212(e)].  The council was not named during that time, nor has it been since then, yet in FY 94 
$2 million was appropriated for its use.  To what end are these funds being used? <p>  

<li>NESIC was to "identify areas in which voluntary national content standards need to be developed" [Sec. 213(a)(1)(A)].  Since NESIC has not been formed it obviously has not performed this function.  Which bureaucrat decided what standards projects would be funded?  With such anonymity there is no accountability.<p>

<li>The content standards are being presented to school personnel and the general public as though they have been officially and legally approved.  Neither of these can happen because the body set up by law to certify the standards -- NESIC -- does not exist.  It is misleading to present these as <i>the </i>"national standards" when they have been neither federally nor popularly approved.<p></ul>

The <i>National Standards for United States History</i>, produced by the Center for History in the Schools, are a case in point.  A politically correct account of American history, these standards are being presented to history teachers as<i> the national standards</i>.  While Congress may believe it has addressed the issue with the Senate's 99 to 1 vote to reject the U.S. history standards, this non-binding resolution was merely symbolic.  In Goals 2000, Congress gave authority over the standards to NESIC.  That makes the Senate's resolution only a good gesture.  Congress should follow this vote to reject the history standards with a vote of much greater significance: the repeal of the entire Goals 2000 legislation, which calls for national standards and has the potential to produce more material like the U.S. history standards.  <p>

The federal government should not be involved in the creation of standards.  Government-endorsed standards are by nature coercive, not voluntary, and will create a body of "official knowledge."  This is contrary to the American tradition of freedom of thought.  Furthermore, content standards deal with curriculum, an area which the federal Department of Education was expressly forbidden to enter when it was created in 1979.  The creation, critique and usage of standards must remain a community endeavor.  No further federal money should be spent on standards projects, and there should be no federal certification or endorsement of existing standards.<p>

Opportunity-to-learn (OTL) standards are an especially troublesome element of title II:<p>
<ul>
<li>These standards shift the focus of reform back to increasing inputs into education, a tried-and-failed method.  OTL standards chosen by states and school districts will require schools to provide adequate resources -- including such things as gender-equitable materials, curriculum aligned with national content standards, and anything else NESIC deems appropriate. <p> 

<li>OTL standards are measuring sticks for schools and teachers, not for students.  They are not a reliable method for improving student achievement.  Indeed, numerous studies linking dramatically increased spending and declining test scores indicate that spending does not drive academic success.<p>
<li>OTL standards invite further federal intrusion in American education.  Diane Ravitch, an assistant secretary of education in the Bush administration, wrote, "[T]he new standards, euphemistically called 3opportunity-to-learn3 standards, would permit Federal regulation of curriculum, textbooks, facilities and instructional methods....  The bill describes the Federal 3opportunity-to-learn3 standards as 3voluntary,3 but litigation would quickly turn them into mandates."</ul><p>
The idea of lawsuits and mandates is not an alarmist fabrication; an Alabama state court recently declared the state school system unconstitutional for not providing adequate education to its students.  The judge's 125-page opinion imposes OTL-type standards on the state's schools.<p>
<center><h3><a name="local">Title III -- STATE AND LOCAL EDUCATION SYSTEMIC IMPROVEMENT</a></h3></center>
This title authorizes block grants to states and subgrants to local school boards [Sec. 309(a)].<p>
<ul>
<li>In order to receive a grant under Goals 2000, a state is obligated to adhere to the federal outline for reform:  opportunity-to-learn standards, content and performance standards, assessments, etc.  State improvement plans must be approved by the Secretary of Education.  Never before have states had to submit such lesson plans to the federal government for approval.  Contrary to the rhetoric of Goals 2000, this is not a formula for local authority over school reform; it makes the word <i>voluntary </i>moot.<p>

<li>In its grant application, a state must include "an assurance that State law provides adequate authority to carry out each component of the State's improvement plan..." [Sec. 305(a)(2)(B)].  In other words, the state must explain how it will impose the Goals 2000 agenda on each of its school districts, voiding the voluntary option for them as well.<p>

<li>The Goals 2000 prescription for reform encourages states to include plans to transform schools into "one-stop shopping" centers which offer a variety of social services, including health care and child care [Sec. 306(f)(2)].   This coordination of services tends toward a collectivism which is contrary to our nation's history as a free society.  Concentrating the services in one place and on one group of people may lead to a sense of dependency.  <p>
	
<li>Advancing social services, health care and related services likely includes the promotion of school-based clinics (SBC).  The term "coordinated services" has been used by proponents to refer to school-based clinics.   These clinics commonly distribute contraceptives and, when these measures fail, the clinics refer for abortion. <p> 
  </ul>
<center>	<h3><a name="parental">TITLE IV -- PARENTAL ASSISTANCE</a></h3></center>
		
This title provides for parental information and resource centers and describes parental involvement in education.  Laudable as it sounds, this title is problematic:
<ul>		
<li>Goal 8 (parental participation) and title IV (Parental Assistance) assume that schools and parents have equal authority over and responsibility for children.  The legislation denies the fact that parents' authority over their children is intrinsic and that schools have only a delegated authority.  <p>

<li>To improve family life and help parents, Goals 2000 suggests more programming, more meetings, more time at school and with school personnel, and more home visits from professionals.  All of this leaves less time for parents and children to spend together. <p>

<li>With their Goals 2000 grants, states must spend money on "parent education."  Parents as Teachers (PAT), which advocates home visits by counselors beginning at birth, is one of the programs specifically endorsed by the law.  Not only are states encouraged to use their "parent education" money to fund PAT programs, but the objectionable organization was directly appropriated $10 million under Goals 2000 for FY 1995.  The House Education, Labor, HHS Subcommittee for Appropriations is to be commended for targeting this program for termination.  Its rationale for proposing cuts to parent education programs is that "these are the very paternalistic and 3government knows best3 programs that the American people rejected last year."<p>

<li>Publicly-funded institutions like PAT are not equipped to improve families because they cannot speak to the values issues inherent in the breakdown of families.  Private voluntary associations and individuals must take responsibility in this arena.<p>
</ul>	
<center>	<h3><a name="skill">TITLE V -- NATIONAL SKILL STANDARDS BOARD</a></h3></center>

Title V is devoted to linking education to business and industry.  It authorizes the creation of another national bureaucracy:  the National Skill Standards Board (NSSB).  NSSB will establish business-education partnerships and oversee development of skill standards and assessments.  <p>
<ul>
<li>The $3 million spent in 1994 to develop skill standards is another misguided appropriation of funds.  It also calls for the development of national assessments to certify achievement of the skill standards.  These additions, however, will not produce better candidates for business.  According to a <i>Chicago Tribune</i> article, employers seek critical thinking and creativity, but when it comes to promoting those skills, "most of the visible school reform efforts, such as uniform national testing schemes, head 180 degrees in the wrong direction."</ul><p>
<center><h3><a name="international">TITLE VI -- INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION PROGRAM</a></h3></center>

Title VI calls for evaluation of foreign education systems.  It also sets up a program of education personnel exchange with central and eastern European countries and any country formerly a part of the Soviet Union.<p>
<ul>
<li>The United States does not have the resources to "provide Department of Education personnel and technical experts to assist eligible countries to establish and implement a database or other effective methods to improve educational delivery systems, structure and organization" [Sec. 601(c)(5)].  Moreover, U.S. envoys should not be pushing the Goals 2000 agenda, unproven in our own country, on eastern European countries.<p></ul>

<center>	<h3><a name="safe">TITLE VII -- SAFE SCHOOLS</a></h3></center>
			
This title provides grants to local school districts to achieve safe and drug-free schools.  Section 705 describes types of programs to be implemented to prevent violence.<p>
<ul>
<li>Conflict resolution, anger management, and peer mediation are cited as "programs of demonstrated effectiveness in addressing violence"  (Sec. 705).  In reality, experts are skeptical of these soft-approach violence prevention programs.<p>
 <li>We cannot afford to spend millions on a violence prevention strategy that 
includes programs of no proven effectiveness.  Serious efforts must be made to curb violence, but conflict resolution and peer mediation will not get to the real solution:  changed lives and families. <p></ul>
<center>	<h3><a name="minority">TITLE VIII -- MINORITY FOCUSED CIVICS EDUCATION</a></h3></center>
This title provides grants for teacher seminars on minority-focused civics and government.<p>
<ul>
<li>Minority-focused courses will likely promote versions of history similar to that produced by the Center for History in the Schools in its <i>National Standards for United States History</i>:  politically correct, victim-focused, anti-American, and inaccurate.  Claiming to be multicultural, the standards selectively include minority figures from American history who are currently in vogue.  Teaching minorities using such curriculum will not produce acculturation but cultural friction and fragmentation.</ul><p>

<center>	<h3><a name="research">TITLE IX -- EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH AND IMPROVEMENT</a></h3></center>
			
Title IX makes organizational changes in the Department of Education's Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI); prescribes OERI's functions in relation to Goals 2000; establishes within OERI a National Educational Research Policy and Priorities Board, five National Research Institutes, and a National Education Dissemination System linking federal and local agencies.  It also authorizes expansion of research grants for comprehensive school health education (Sec. 971).<p>
<ul>
<li>Once again, Goals 2000 aims to improve education by adding and reshuffling bureaucracy.<p>

<li>Health education, which includes sex education, has already been a major source of grief to parents.  Advancing these programs will undoubtedly lead to an increase in challenges to parental authority.  <p>
</ul>
<center>	<h3><a name="miscellaneous">TITLE X -- MISCELLANEOUS</a>
</h3></center>
This catch-all title contains a gun-free school act, a non-smoking policy for children's services in schools, a policy for distribution of contraceptive devices, and authorization of grants for Midnight Basketball programs.<p>
<ul>
<li>The Goals 2000 policy on contraceptive devices further marginalizes parents.  Section 1018 states that "all federally funded programs which provide for the distribution of contraceptive devices to unemancipated minors [shall] develop procedures to encourage, <b>to the extent practical</b>, family participation in such programs" (emphasis added).  How unlikely is it that a school administrator will find it impractical to listen to parental objections to its condom distribution policy?<p>

<li>Midnight Basketball was originally a private sector plan.  There is no need for government to get involved in these charitable efforts and regulate them to death.  <p>
	
</ul>
<Center><h3><a name="conclusion">CONCLUSION</a>   </h3></center>

The proposed rescissions and terminations in Goals 2000 appropriations are good:  reduction in state grants, terminating Parents as Teachers, cutting back school-to-work activities, etc.  Especially significant is the $21.5 million proposed cut in the Goals 2000 National Programs, wiping out all FY 95 funding for this account which supports development of standards and assessments.<p>

The proposals do not go far enough, however.  The Goals 2000 restructuring agenda will continue to spread like kudzu throughout America as long as states receive Goals 2000 grants.  Furthermore, zero-funding the Goals 2000 programs individually leaves open the possibility of future funding.  Complete repeal of Goals 2000 is the only solution.<p>

Education reform at this historic moment calls for a reduction in the role of the federal government in the system and a return to the traditional role of school:  teaching students basics like reading, writing, and arithmetic.  A decisive first step will be the repeal of Goals 2000, which subverts education reform with more federal regulation and spending.<p>

<h2><center>
	OUT OF THEIR OWN MOUTHS:<br>
	SELECTED QUOTATIONS ON THE<br>
	SIGNIFICANCE OF GOALS 2000</h2>
<b><hr size="3" width="30%"></center><br>
"The enactment of the Goals 2000: Educate America Act and the School-to-Work Opportunities Act signaled the beginning of a new era in education reform that <u>will over time touch all schools</u>."<br>    
	<i>--Department of Education Justifications of Appropriation Estimates to   	the Congress Fiscal Year 1996 Volume I</i><p><br><br>

America 2000, President Bush's educational reform plan, was the predecessor of Goals 2000.  "It was a self-proclaimed conservative Republican... who was advocating <u>a monumental movement away from local control of education</u>."<br>    
	<i>--John F. Jennings, Institute for Educational Leadership</i><p><br><br>

"When the legislative dust settles and future historians examine the Clinton Administration, they will devote a major chapter to the Goals 2000: Educate America Act.... Like President Lincoln's Morrill Act of 1862 and President Johnson's Elementary and Secondary Education Act of 1965, President Bill Clinton's Goals 2000 Act will stand as an education beacon."<br>     
	<i>--Richard W. Riley, U.S. Secretary of Education</i><p><br><br>

"[Goals 2000 is] the most important education legislation we've ever had." <br>   
	<i>--Albert Shanker, President, American Federation of Teachers</i><p><br><br>

"In the first three titles, Goals 2000 establishes overall direction for a new local-state-federal partnership in education." <br>   
	<i>--Gordon M. Ambach, Executive Director, Council of Chief State School 	  Officers</i><p><br><br>

"Perhaps most important, Goals 2000 lays the conceptual groundwork for other federal legislation, establishing a model for coherence among federal and 
national endeavors in education that has never been seen before...." <br>   
	<i>--Jennifer O'Day, Associate Director, Pew Forum on Education Reform </i><p><br><br>


"Goals 2000 is a new way of doing business in America.  It represents the direction our government must take in many problems in the 21st century."  <br>  
	<i>--President Bill Clinton </i></b><p><br><br>

<h4>ACTION:  Set up an appointment to meet with your Congressman or Senator at their district offices during the August recess, which lasts from now until Labor Day. Use this outline of issues for your meeting:</h4>


<b>I.  Ending federal programs for America's schools</b>. Of the 552 education programs the federal government runs at a cost of $70 billion (244 in the Education Department, 308 in 30 other agencies), it's difficult to point to many that have been successful, let alone cost-effective. It's time to question the federal role in education, and two bills are doing just that:<p>   
<ul>
<li>The Back to Basics bill (H.R. 1883) goes after most of the programs in the U.S. Education Department, consolidates them into a block grant to be administered by the Department of Health and Human Services and moves remaining programs to other departments.<p>

<li>The Restoring Local Schools bill goes further.  Developed by conservatives, this bill would immediately eliminate the U.S. Education Department and repeal many of the 552 federal education programs.  Three block grants, to end within four years, would replace them.  The highlight of this bill is its provision for enactment of a tax cut to replace $60 billion in federal education spending. <p></ul>

<b>II.  Resist the Urge to Merge</b>.  Merging the U.S. Education and Labor Departments will not solve the problems created by the federal role in schools.  Equally objectionable is any merging of programs which might lead to a philosophy that does not differentiate between education and workforce preparation.  Two plans are moving in that direction:<p>
</ul>
<li>Congressmen Bill Goodling (R-Penn.) and Steve Gunderson (R-Wis.) have developed a plan to merge the U.S. Education and Labor Departments and fold in the EEOC as well.  They have determined that the federal government's legitimate role in education is workforce preparation, so that the country may benefit economically.  On that basis they would relocate the Education Department, reorganized but not reduced in size, in the Labor Department.  By maintaining the federal education bureaucracy and its current status as director of education in America, yet prioritizing its functions in such a way as to benefit labor, this plan sends a dangerous message that education is merely economic development.<p></ul>
									<h4>August 11, 1995</h4><br>
<ul><li>The CAREERS bill (H.R. 1617) is the first step toward the Goodling-Gunderson plan.  It would combine 90 job training programs into four block grants, but retain many School-to-Work ideas, including government-endorsed skill standards and skill certificates and career counseling for elementary students.  In addition, it creates an unneeded and wasteful "workforce development infrastructure," which would include creation of one-stop career centers.<p>
</ul>
<b>III.  Defund and Repeal Goals 2000</b>.  America has seen a new height in federal directives in education since the passage of Goals 2000 during the spring of 1994.  While rhetoric touts this program as voluntary, upon entry into the Goals 2000 contract a state will be compelled to follow the federal prescription for school restructuring:  development of standards and aligned assessments and submission of state plans to the U.S. Secretary of Education.  Efforts to end this inappropriate federal program are meeting with some success:<p>
<ul>
<li>The Labor/HHS/Education Appropriations Bill (H.R. 2127) passed the House late last week without funding for Goals 2000.  This bill also makes several important strides to reduce abortion.  The bill will go through the gauntlet of debate and mark-up on the Senate side when Congress reconvenes in September, beginning with the Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor/HHS/Education, then the full Appropriations Committee, and finally, the full Senate.  Subcommittee Chairman Sen. Arlen Specter (R-Penn.) has vowed his intention to reverse the victories that pro-family Americans achieved in this bill.  <p>

<li>Rep. John Shadegg (R-Ariz.) has been a leader in the charge against Goals 2000 on the House side. Earlier this summer he drummed up support for the elimination of Goals 2000 funding in the appropriations bill and also expressed his desire to see the program repealed.  <p></ul>

<a name="disappoint"><h3>DISAPPOINTMENTS AND DISSENTERS:  104TH CONGRESS ON EDUCATION</h3></a><a href="#contents">[ Contents ]</a><br><br>
	Conservatives have reason to be dismayed with the "Republican Revolution" which has little influenced the education theory coming out of this Congress.  A prime example is the Education Reform Consolidation Grant, which would combine over 50 elementary and secondary education programs into a single block grant, presumably in an attempt to reduce the federal role in education.  In current draft form, however, the bill maintains a Washington-knows-best philosophy by following the pattern of Goals 2000, including prescriptions for states to submit standards and assessments to the National Education Goals Panel, which would report to the U.S. Secretary of Education.  The education bureaucracy would be largely untouched by this supposed improvement.  <p>
	While most conservatives find the efforts of this Congress lacking when it comes to education, a few notable education theorists say the opposite.  Chester Finn of the Hudson Institute and Diane Ravitch of the Brookings Institution charge that "Republican anti-governmentalism occasionally becomes overwrought," referring to the effort to end the federal role in education.   In a report entitled "Education Reform 1994-95," they praise "reinvention" strategies like school choice and charter schools, yet cling to the status quo--federal oversight of America's schools.  Finn and Ravitch also support national standards and assessments. Unfortunately, standards and assessments will not directly improve student achievement; they will simply make it easier to evaluate and compare schools, thus empowering the beureaucrats that control the system.<p>

<h2>CAN THE MARKETPLACE SAVE OUR SCHOOLS?</h2> 
<i><b>By James R. Rinehart and Jackson F. Lee, Jr.</b></i><p> 
</center>
<hr>
<br> 
Problems continue to mount in our public schools. Should we give 
private schools more of a chance?<p> 
 Sometimes it's hard not to feel smug. The current struggle to 
move from central planning to a free market approach within the 
former Soviet Union and its neighboring countries has led some 
Americans to get that "we told you so" feeling. It's not that we 
revel in the misery and uncertainty faced by the residents of 
these countries, but many of us have known all along of the 
incredible deficiencies in central planning and the enormous 
power embodied in free markets. We have no problem understanding 
that the collapsing economies of Eastern Europe owe their failure 
to government ownership and control. <p>
Surprisingly, the lessons that are still being learned at such a 
high cost to the Eastern Europeans seem to be lost on most 
Americans. We continue to call for, and support government 
solutions to problems that would be solved better through private 
enterprise. Somehow, we just don't get it. Either we fail to 
recognize the costs associated with government involvement in the 
production and distribution of goods and services, or we know 
what is happening but feel unable or unwilling to do anything 
about it. The answer is probably both. Year after year, the 
influence of American government on the lives of Americans 
continues to grow. A telling measure of that growth is government 
spending as a percentage of GNP, which has tripled since 1929. <p>
We take it for granted that in the United States, the very cradle 
of free enterprise, governments should own and operate such wide 
ranging enterprises as parks, roads, postal services, buses, 
trains, hospitals, airports, sewer and water systems, garbage 
disposal services, jails, fire departments, and schools. We are 
even willing to tolerate the ever expanding regulation of 
thousands of private firms and individuals. At the state level 
alone, we license and control more than 4,000 occupations and 
professions. <p>
As we watch the centrally planned economies around the world 
disappear and move toward privatization, we see little real 
progress toward lessening the reach of government here at home. 
Some favorable signs, however, are appearing on the horizon. Many 
local and state governments are divesting themselves of 
activities that used to fall almost exclusively within the domain 
of the state. Private companies are beginning to take over such 
diverse services as prisons, garages, refuse collection 
facilities, transit systems, fire departments, waste disposal 
units, ambulance services, and low-cost housing. The driving 
Economic Report of the President, U.S. Superintendent of 
Documents, force behind these efforts is the U.S. Government 
Printing Office, Washington D C (various years) growing 
realization that privatization is more efficient and provides 
better quality service. <p>
<center><h3>WHY GOVERNMENT CONTROL DOESN'T WORK </center></h3><p>
The current interest in educational vouchers and choice 
represents the application of privatization in the area of 
education. Choice involving private schools shows real promise 
for educational reform. Of the many critics making vitriolic 
complaints about the quality of American public schools, most 
fail to see that government monopolization of education is a 
significant contributor to these poor results. A brief look at 
the government's involvement in education illustrates just how 
desperately we need to privatize our schools. <p>
Although local government schools go back to colonial times, 
until the mid-19th century, the general thrust was toward private 
schools. The transformation to our current system began when 
Horace Mann became Secretary of the newly created Board of 
Education in Massachusetts in 1837. He immediately started 
Massachusetts and this nation on a course that resulted in 
centralized, state controlled, and government owned public 
schools financed by property taxes. The net effect of universal 
free education supported by compulsory taxes and compulsory 
attendance laws was to entice, and sometimes force, parents to 
send their children to public schools. It also led many parents 
to forfeit control over their children's education under the 
mistaken assumption that responsibility lies with the schools. 
Today, fewer than 12 percent of American elementary and secondary 
students attend private schools. <p>
Everyone more or less agrees that public schools are failing 
miserably to reach even the most modest expectations set for 
them. The massive but largely ineffective school reform movement 
of the 1980s is a manifestation of this fact. What is not so well 
recognized is that public schools are failing largely because of 
the government's involvement in the production of education -- 
precisely the same phenomenon that has caused the collapse of the 
economies of many Eastern European countries. <p>
We are well aware of the fact that changing social conditions 
caused by weakened families, increased crime, and drugs have 
adverse effects on the educational achievement of children, but 
schools must adjust to educate students in any environment, and 
government schools find it almost impossible to do that. 
Government must perform a few functions, but managing the 
education of more than 40 million youngsters is just not one of 
them. <p>
The absence of effective incentives on the part of those who 
consume and those who produce education explains the poor results 
we get. The consumers of education, the students and parents, 
have little power to influence what educators do. This feeling of 
powerlessness often results in apathy and neglect. The producers 
of education, on the other hand, have few direct incentives to 
satisfy students and parents. Educators are not consistently or 
tangibly rewarded or penalized on the basis of how well their 
students learn. Instead, they are rewarded on the basis of the 
number of degrees held, and years of teaching experience. Neither 
of these factors correlates very well with student achievement or 
satisfaction. <p>
Educational decisions are largely political, and rest primarily 
in the hands of the state and local departments of education. 
Everyone from members of boards of education and superintendents 
to principals and teachers try to satisfy their superiors. 
Although educational leaders are often aware of community 
demands, nowhere are they forced to be responsive to the wishes 
of their student and parent clients. Educators actively try to 
influence school board members and state and local politicians 
because these people have the power to provide pay raises, job 
security, and better working conditions. Politicians, in turn, 
appeal to voters and special interest groups in an attempt to get 
reelected. Students and parents find themselves at the bottom of 
the hierarchy with little influence and even less clout. <p>
<center><h3>WHY FREE COMPETITIVE MARKETS DO WORK </center></h3><p>
The marketplace comes to terms with how to meet customer demands. 
Free competitive markets exhibit a power hierarchy significantly 
different from that seen in the public school system. The 
emphasis, from the owner of a company to the lowest paid 
employee, is on customer satisfaction, because everyone realizes 
that the customer always has the option of taking his or her 
business elsewhere. Failure to retain and satisfy customers leads 
to losses. Success in retaining and satisfying customers 
generates profits. The incentive system gives central importance 
to the customer. <p>
No similar incentive operates within the public school system. 
Rewards for educators, such as they are, follow regardless of 
student achievement. Salaries are based almost exclusively on 
degrees held and years of experience. Rewards can even come as a 
direct result of poor quality. Educators often argue that poor 
results are due to inadequate funding, so, the weaker the 
results, the greater the financial need. It is an interesting 
fact that we heap accolades on schools with high per capita 
spending while deprecating those with low spending per capita. 
Imagine a private firm such as IBM complaining because their cost 
of making computers is too low! <p>
If we really want to improve education, we need to rediscover the 
power of unregulated markets. At a minimum, we should provide 
parents with credit vouchers so they can choose between public 
and private school alternatives. But an even better solution can 
be found in the privatization of the entire educational system. <p>
Under privatization, state and local governments could sell their 
school properties. Parents could be given a coupon equal to the 
average amount currently spent on education. The coupon could 
then be used to pay tuition at any school (all would be private) 
selected. Competition among schools would keep tuition levels 
under control and force them to satisfy the wishes of students 
and parents. Schools that successfully satisfied their consumers 
would make money, and those that did not would lose money. No 
longer would educational decisions be largely a function of 
political considerations. Instead, the focus would be on (1) 
meeting the educational demands of parents and students and (2) 
controlling costs. <p>
No educational plan is perfect, including the privatization 
option: we live in a world without panaceas. But some solutions 
are clearly better than others. <p>
After the relevant benefits and costs of current alternatives are 
weighed, the evidence continues to mount that an educational 
system involving private school options has the best chance of 
producing the outcomes we want at a minimum expenditure of 
resources. There are three specific types of evidence that lead 
us to believe such a system would give parents the kind of 
education they want at lower costs than would be the case for 
public schools. <p>
<center><h3>COMPETITION</center></h3><p> 
The first type of evidence comes from microeconomic theory 
concerning monopolies. In general, monopoly firms restrict 
output, raise prices above the marginal cost of production, 
underutilize plant capacity, waste resources, and often produce 
inferior quality products or services. Since public schools are a 
monopoly, one would expect public schools to function less 
efficiently than private schools. Replacing public schools with 
private schools would impose competitive restraints, forcing them 
to pay closer attention to client demands and the cost of 
satisfying those demands. Most public schools lack the incentives 
necessary to cause them to pay closer attention to their clients' 
wishes. <p>
<center><h3>EFFICIENCY</center></h3><p>
Empirical evidence represents a second type of support for the 
proposition that private schools operate more efficiently than 
public schools. Robert Genetski, for example, examined the costs 
of public and private schools in Chicago. His figures put the 
cost of private schools in that city at anywhere from 45 to 77 
percent of the cost of public schools. These figures resulted 
even after adjustments were made for the fact that public schools 
usually pay higher salaries than private schools, and must deal 
with students who have disabilities, language problems, financial 
deprivation, and social and intellectual disadvantages. <p>
According to a 1978 study of New York City schools, public 
schools spend $4,785 per pupil per year for non-handicapped 
students, while private schools spend $4,512. The difference in 
cost is even greater for handicapped students. The per student 
cost for handicapped students was $6,196 in public schools -- and 
$4,730 in private schools. One of the reasons for the cost 
differential with both handicapped and non-handicapped students 
is that public schools generally are more labor intensive than 
private schools, especially at the staff level. The New York 
study found this to be the case. <p>
<center><h3>COST </center></h3><p>
The third source of support for private options can be found in 
the success of privatization in other government functions. Many 
other traditional activities of government, from protective and 
custodial services to health care and transportation services, 
have already been privatized by some cities and counties. <p>
The evidence that privatized services are generally provided at 
lower cost than public services is overwhelming. In Privatizing 
the Public Sector, E.S. Savas provides many examples of 
successful privatization. Studies covering the United States, 
Canada, and Switzerland, for example, show that municipal solid 
waste collection is 61-71 percent more expensive when government 
provides it. Scottsdale, Arizona, found that a private firm could 
provide fire protection for 52 percent of the government agency's 
cost. In the Federal Republic of Germany, municipal bus service 
costs 160 percent more per kilometer than private service. <p>
In another study, nursing homes operated by the U.S. Veterans 
Administration had a per patient cost that was 83 percent higher 
than that for comparable private nursing homes. Reports on 
privatization efforts in Indianapolis, Indiana, and Newark, New 
Jersey, also point to improved service at lower cost. <p>
Often the debate over choice is muddled because of an inability 
to separate choice limited to pubic schools from public-private 
choice via vouchers, and either of these from a privatized 
system. For example, the empirical studies on choice published in 
a special issue of the Economics of Education Review are devoted 
to either public school choice or public-private choice via 
vouchers, but do not address a system consisting only of private 
school alternatives such as we describe. <p>
<center><h3>WHY SOME PEOPLE ARE CONCERNED</center></h3><p> 
Some of the controversy over the efficiency of private schools 
stems from the fact that while most private schools operate at 
lower cost than public schools, the kinds, amounts, and types of 
education they produce may not be comparable. While most private 
school supporters would be content to let the judgment about 
school product rest with parental choice in much the same way 
consumers judge supermarket standards, most critics of private 
school choice would be unwilling to accept such a proposition. 
Public school advocates have a strong philosophical bias against 
school variety and parents possessing the power to choose schools 
and programs of study. The steady march of school consolidation 
and standardization over the decades attests to this fact. <p>
Of course, there are valid concerns that do arise from, and often 
strong opposition that does surface to, options involving private 
schools. Even advocates see some problems to be overcome if 
schools are to introduce any meaningful choice system. <p>
<center><h3>THE BAD NEWS </center></h3><p>
The following list represents some of the concerns related to the 
implementation of a private school choice system. <p>
1. At least some students, teachers, and staff would find 
themselves temporarily or permanently dislocated as the new 
system was brought "on line" and new schools opened and/or 
ineffective schools restructured or closed. <p>
2. Schools in some areas could resegregate even though the net 
effect would probably be increased integration, especially for 
the inner city schools. <p>
3. Some parents might give only marginal thought to school 
choices, and they might need assistance in making their choices. <p>
4. Under any choice system, there would be the ever-present risk 
of state governments taking over more and more power through 
increased regulation.  <p>
5. The diversity of types of schools and curricula represents a 
potential danger. Some "fringe groups" would no doubt want to 
establish their own special schools. <p>
6. In the education market, as with markets in general, the 
public would need to be vigilant against fraud and deceit. <p>
7. Students in more populous areas would have far more options 
than students in rural areas. <p>
<center><h3>THE GOOD NEWS </center></h3><p>
Each of these concerns, along with others yet to be discovered, 
will deserve our attention. None of them, however, represents a 
"deal buster." The benefits of private school choice derive 
primarily from the increased flexibility and sensitivity of the 
system. Rather than a static bureaucratic monopoly, a system of 
choice would permit rapid and efficient change and growth. <p>
Even without the advantages of publicly provided funding, some 
private schools are forging ahead with newer and better ways of 
providing education. Jim Boyle formed Ombudsman Educational 
Services Ltd. and now operates 22 schools in Illinois, Minnesota, 
and Arizona, servicing a total of 800 students. The American 
Association of Educators in Private Practice, a new professional 
association of teachers in private enterprise schools, was formed 
recently by 50 teachers. Education Alternatives Inc. currently 
contracts with local authorities to operate specific public 
schools. This firm now has contracts to operate public schools in 
Florida, Maryland, Minnesota, and Arizona. <p>
Some private firms are already moving into position to take 
advantage of any opportunities that may arise from the school 
choice movement. The most widely publicized effort is that of 
Christopher Whittle, Chairman of Whittle Communications. This 
company has invested $60 million in The Edison Project, which 
plans to open 200 schools with 150,000 students by 1996 at a 
total investment of $2.45 billion. By the year 2010, this firm 
expects to have 2 million students coast to coast. Whittle has 
received financial commitments from a number of partners, and has 
put in place a team of advisors and specialists, i.e., 100 well-
known educators, businessmen, and other personalities. <p>
Several other major firms have also entered the for-profit 
education business. Sylvan Learning Centers, Huntington Learning 
Systems, and Britannica Learning Centers are franchised 
operations with schools operating across the nation. Even Burger 
King is operating quasi-private secondary schools in 14 cities 
under the name "Burger King Academies!" And IBM and Apple have 
recently expressed serious interest in starting profit-making 
schools, too. <p>
Definite signs are emerging that local, state, and federal 
governments are willing to encourage the movement toward public 
school privatization. The town of Epsom, New Hampshire, has 
instituted a $1,000 tax rebate for families sending their 
children to any school other than the local public school. 
Milwaukee, Wisconsin, has a voucher system already in place for 
1,000 ghetto children. For two years now, parents of these 
children have been allowed to select private schools and have the 
government pay $2,500 per student per year to the school 
selected. Colorado had a voucher proposal on the ballot in the 
1992 general election, but lost because of strong opposition from 
teachers' unions. California's proposal suffered a similar fate. <p>
<center><h3>WHY THE TIME IS NOW </center></h3><p>
Can the marketplace save our schools? <p>
In the United States, private school enrollment traditionally has 
been restricted by the fact that parents sending their children 
to private schools have had to pay private tuition AND public 
school taxes. Most parents have been unwilling or unable to 
shoulder such a financial burden. Statutory restrictions have 
also discouraged the formation of private schools. <p>
In recent years, however, a move appears to have gotten under way 
to remedy this situation through options involving choice. This 
trend should be openly encouraged. Real reform will come to the 
nation's schools only through free markets that permit private 
schools to compete for the students they educate. <p>

<h2>Education: A Plan for the Next Generation</h2><br>
<i><b>Robert L. Montgomerie </b></i>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
There is the large debate within the right concerning education. Much 
of the focus is the funding of education and the result we're getting 
from the sea of dollars that is spent on it. Much of the main focus is 
on the lack of certain skills on the part of youngster as opposed to 
older generations who seemed to have gotten a far more superior 
education then present generations. Quite a bit of anger is directed 
towards liberal policy with respect to the social part of education 
while many of the actually grade figures are more or less used in a 
rather curious way to justify the need for social reform in public 
education. Many of these arguments include the once practiced early 
morning prayer by students in the morning. Also it includes such 
things as an end to handing out condoms, an end to education regarding 
alternative lifestyles, and another broad practice that doesn't 
necessarily include alternative lifestyles but should is 
multiculturalism. Many camps within the right competing for jobs in 
the next two or three elections will be faced with these issues 
perhaps much more seriously in the future. Nativists who are a curious 
breed of quasi-conservatives are latching on to the ideas of changing 
the face of public school as we know it. Perhaps it should be changed. 
The only thing about education that will change will probably be a 
shift in liberal to conservatives policy regarding education to fit a 
more explicitly moral overtone linked to Christianity.<p>  
Much of the proposed reform that was been thrown around is the 
standard approach to cultural literacy that is proposed by many 
nativists calling for an end to revisionist history being taught 
currently. Many do not like the idea of Columbus being depicted as 
anything other than a visionary, or a Lincoln who personally didn't 
think blacks should hold elective office but it all boils down to a 
point of that they dislike the current thought in place of teaching 
other histories not pertaining entirely to the founding of the nation 
as we know it or of the origins of that nation. Much of this is linked 
to nationalist thought and it is linked to an idea of America as a 
Christian nation. It is known that America was here long before 
Europeans came just as it is known that George Washington's cherry 
tree story is not a very truthful story. Those of us who grew up with 
ideas of a Benjamin Franklin working hard are very astonished to find 
out that he had a very unpuritian stay in France and was a little bit 
of a ladies man while he was there. When faced with ideas of slave 
holding founding fathers would considered blacks and Indians as lesser 
men than them and even went so far as to write that into the 
Constitution as opposed to the idealized view of moral founding 
fathers who were straight edged to the end is a hard thing to take in. 
Especially when it may be true. <p>
The original purpose of public education was to create citizens who 
could speak a common language necessary for the smooth operation of a 
nation entering into the industrial revolution, have a literate 
population, and to instill the meaning of America and to explain the 
civil duties and benefits of being a citizen. Noble enough until you 
enter the agent of politics which of course seems to run any good idea 
into the rocks when given what seems to be a simple task. Funding 
education was simple also in the pre-industrial era and even into 
modern times so what went wrong when SAT scores have fallen 
consistently since 1960? Are schools adequate enough to teach students 
in these times? Is it a lack of work ethic among teachers to teach 
students in the classroom sitting? Is it a lack on the behalf of 
parents to teach children the importance of education which may 
include helping with homework or among other things personally 
insuring that children even participate in what many children in other 
country's don't get; a free education. <p>
In 1996 the Republican Party committed to social issues has to address 
the issue of education with a plan that takes necessary strains off of 
the budget plus aid in improving the quality of not only education but 
of schools and the institutions that run them. It would be easy to 
make this an ugly political background but it is hoped that out of a 
sense of decency that in front of young eyes there will be serious 
debate and little rhetoric bouncing. The Republican Party has to 
address ambitiously the issue of crime in schools all across the 
board, teaching, institutional social policy, curriculum, and cost and 
that isn't an easy job when so much special interest is at stake. The 
changes made in public education will affect a whole generation of 
young minds needed to shape a nation of the future and hopefully the 
reform of today will aid in this process and not in effect some to an 
institutional "rubber check" to show the true ineffectiveness of this 
generation in handling the challenges of today. <p>
Many of the contemporary ideas include such things as vouchers and 
reassigning responsibilities, including funding, to the states. Much 
of the idea concerning empowerment of the states fully in the 
education process as a statement in itself is a reasonable idea. One 
because states have a better idea of the field of endeavor children 
was go on such as banking, farming, and roping horses. States also 
have a better idea of  what children, residing in that state, need to 
work on and can create a better, more personalized plan to better 
attack these weaknesses and hopefully show an improvement in that 
general area. Conversely will states be able to cover the cost the 
federal government spends on education. In fiscal 1992 the federal 
government spent 26.04 billion for education. Will states be able to 
supply the needed resources to properly educate every child in every 
setting without federal help. Perhaps if states intend on opening more 
magnet type schools and even then access would still be limited. 
Lastly will states act with integrity in the social education of 
children. If the Federal Government leaves any indication then it is 
reasonable to expect that state governments will conduct themselves 
similarly. This is not to say that the states might not do a better 
job with education because of the fact that they haven't been given a 
chance. But nevertheless tax burden for education won't be taken off 
the backs of the taxpayer and there is reason to suspect that this tax 
burden will increase. Best case scenario will be that it won't change. 
It will just be collected by a different source. <p>
Should the federal government get out of the business of education? 
The answer is that the federal government should provide a leadership 
role in education, but the federal government should not be so 
financially committed to education as it has been in the past ten to 
twenty years. Realistically we can expect that the federal government 
won't be out of the education business within the next twenty years 
and this is where now the Republican Party can take a crucial role in 
molding the face of education of years to come.  <p>
One of the main objectives of the Republican Party is tax relief. Part 
of that is in ensuring that as much of a standard of equality exists 
in funding as well as in collecting funds. <p>
It should be considered unconstitutional to collect property taxes 
from all property owners in order to fund education. Many people who 
are paying for education don't even have children attending public 
school or don't have children at all or anymore. Why should they pay? 
Empowerment has to fit into the framework somewhere with regard to 
funding. As long as we know that it is here and that someone has to 
pay why can't those who participate pay for the system? Those who pick 
up the tab for public school should also have a larger say in what 
goes on in that which they are a partner of therein. Many in public 
life are clamoring for "vouchers" that will give families the right to 
take their children to any school they wish to attend. A voucher 
system is in itself an interesting idea; families taking their 
children to any school they wish and using this voucher to pay for it. 
How will this change the face of funding education? It won't. Vouchers 
are simply another form of government handout like free lunch tickets. 
There are three things that are a problem in public school that won't 
be cured by vouchers and one is overcrowded classrooms. In the 
meanwhile perfectly good schools will sit largely dormant and will be 
too expensive to run after a time mainly because of low attendance. 
Vouchers will also affect private school education with this same 
overcrowded problem the public schools are having. Currently 
classrooms are comprised of one teacher attempting to teach thirty or 
more students. Vouchers will only aid in this madness.  <p>
Since segregation many schools have been closed in order to achieve 
racial balance in communities especially in the south. That is very 
present in large cities where it isn't uncommon to find old school 
buildings dotting neighborhoods. Perhaps  federal money should be 
spent to reopen some of these buildings rather than that money being 
spent on chasing suburbanites into the countryside in order to insure 
the schools they open will meet a standard of equality. Opening 
schools will spread out the population and thus spread out the 
classrooms and those attending those classrooms. More schools would 
mean more funding to run these schools. If  it is already expensive to 
pay for the schools that exist then why expand on that problem. 
Simple. We know some reasons why there are the problems within many 
public schools. They are packed into classrooms, and hallways, and 
cafeterias like sardines. Teachers are expected to successfully teach 
roughly a classroom of thirty or more students so it is wise to note 
that not every student is getting the proper attention that student 
deserves. Are we interested in coming to at least as close of a 
solution as possible? If we are then we have to address the 
fundamental problems that currently exist. <p>
The important issue with respect to the last paragraph is in funding. 
We know that as fiscal conservatives we are committed to freeing up 
incomes. We are also committed to finding an equitable fair system of 
funding that will be efficient and as self sustaining as possible 
which is no easy task. Adding other principles such as personable 
responsibility and empowerment we can come to a partial solution of 
funding public education while achieving all goals. That partial 
solution would be The Public School Funding Act. This would create a 
middle ground to both tax relief, empowerment, personal 
responsibility, and improvement of institution. Part of the PSFA would 
include cutting property taxes used to fund education by half in order 
to ensure fairness in taxation and to also remove "penalties" on 
owning property. It would include cuts in the Department of Education 
budget on a graduated basis for five years by three million a year so 
that states will have ample time to absorb new budgetary demands. 
After the five year period the Department of Education would then 
operate at roughly half  of it present cost in fiscal 1996 and would 
retain a  cap on it's budget not to exceed  60% of the fiscal 1996 
budget. Funding will be used solely as aid to build schools, refurbish 
closed schools, and to provide grants as budgetary restraints allow. 
It will also require a user fee to be imposed on families who 
participate public schools with regards to income, cost of living 
within a particular area, and amount of children within that family 
who attend public school. This fee will be payable by the beginning of 
the next school year and that fee will be payable pass or fail. If 
they cannot afford the fee then arrangements will be made for their 
child to attend while they pay the fee. The PSFA will also call for an 
end of Magnet Schools as they will not be needed. States will be able 
to hold lotteries to fund education and will be required to relinquish 
all proceeds for that purpose if it is originally intended for that 
purpose. The PSFA will also allow neighborhood schools to solicit 
private business for contributions of funds and equipment such as 
computers, and any other items suitable for either liberal arts 
education or vocational education. This plan will ensure that fairness 
in funding public school will be paramount and that no one group will 
carry the entire burden.  <p>
The major objective of the PSFA is to return to  a more communities 
based education by diminishing the demand on few schools that exist in 
many cities. Families will have schools that they can be proud of and 
they will have schools that they will feel obligated to take an active 
interest in because they are a partner of that school. Also as 
partners who directly pay into their neighborhood school they will 
hopefully take a more active interest in their child's education and 
will hopefully take an active leadership role in insuring the success 
of their child in his academic endeavors. <p>
The need for an end to social experimentation in public schools is 
very relevant because it does not encourage children to be 
individuals. It is no more right to use schools for indoctrination 
purposes than it is to segregate them and make them exclusionary if 
they are provided by government at any level. Individuals come into 
agreement to form governments for the common good of those who choose 
live within that government therein. So to insure that the civil 
liberties of all students who attend public school won't be abridged 
within reason there is a need for an Ethics in Public School Act. This 
act would allow religious expression in public school. It would allow 
for groups who share a common religious bond to assemble for religious 
activities. The limits on these activities would be decided by local 
and state administrations. It will also protect any philosophical 
expression, speech, and belief as supported by the first amendment of 
the constitution. Anti-Discriminatory policies still apply. It will 
not provide for lead prayer in classrooms but it will not discourage 
any expression in private during a moment of silence. The EPSA would 
also make students who engage in a Felony such as murder, attempted 
murder, or dealing drugs within public school property will be 
punished as a mature adult. <p>
It is important for children and families to believe in the schools 
they are directly or indirectly taking a part in. It is also important 
for children not only to know that their civil liberties won't be 
abridged beyond absurdity, but it is important of all to know that 
they are individuals and that they live in a society of individuals. 
Part of knowing that is in being able to see the differences people 
possess. To know that all beliefs are supported will insure that 
mutual respect exist among students as long as they are in public 
school. <p>
These are ideas that the Republican Party should consider advocating 
in the up and coming election in 1996. They are fair and they would be 
simple to implement. As Republicans we can all agree it should be our 
purpose to limit government as much as possible while trying to be as 
fair as possible at the same time. We should also not be fearful of 
experimentation especially when the future of our children is at 
stake. <p>

IN THE WAKE OF THE PC NAVY </H2>

<P>
The Navy has become so politically correct (PC) since the Tailhook
debacle that now sailors can't even express their opinion about
a controversial policy.
<P>
Last August, Navy pilot Lt. Cmdr. Kenneth Carkhuff told his boss
that he objected to women serving in combat and that his views
were based on religious convictions. As a result, Carkhuff was
removed from his unit and now faces dismissal for failing to &quot;demonstrate
leadership.&quot;
<P>
Since when does expressing an opinion translate into a leadership
failure? According to the Navy, Carkhuff's disagreement with its
full-steam-ahead women in combat policy warrants a discharge without
benefits after 13 years of outstanding service.
<P>
Carkhuff believes that women should not be subjected to the violence
of combat. His religiously-motivated beliefs are shared by many
less vocal members of the military who understand that PC reigns
and stating a contrary belief is grounds for dismissal.
<P>
This case is really about Constitutionally guaranteed free speech.
During the Second World War the Supreme Court heard a case involving
religiously based speech. In <I>Barnette v. West Virginia State
Board of Education</I>, the high court found that education authorities
could not force a Jehovah's Witness to pledge allegiance to the
American flag. The court ruled that, &quot;Freedom to differ is
not limited to things that do not matter.&quot;
<P>
Women in combat matters to Cmdr. Carkhuff because it's contrary
to his religious beliefs. The 34-year-old Naval Academy graduate
does not dispute the Navy's authority to place women in combat,
but he respectfully disagrees and exercised his Constitutional
right to express that opinion privately.
<P>
The Clinton Administration has erased more than 250,000 combat
exemptions for women. Today, women can serve in 95 percent of
all Navy billets. Feminists say this is progress, but combat veterans
and our combat-hardened allies know this portends future disaster.
<P>
In 1992, uniformed female military officers descended on Capitol
Hill to lobby against the female combat ban labeling it an &quot;equal
opportunity&quot; issue. The

Pentagon ignored the regulations which restrict uniformed sailors
from lobbying.
<P>
These women won their fight. But in contrast, when a lone man
objects to the same radical changes, suddenly an anchor from Washington
drops on his berth threatening to sink him along with his wife
and five children.
<P>
Cmdr. Carkhuff was assigned to an SH60B Seahawk unit which had
five pilots; two were female. He disagreed with the Navy's women-in-combat
policy but agreed to fly with female pilots if ordered. His boss
chose the PC route and booted Carkhuff overboard.
<P>
On January 25th, the Chief of Naval Personnel sent Carkhuff a
letter charging him with &quot;substandard performance&quot; and
failure to demonstrate leadership for not supporting the Navy's
female policy. A board of three Naval captains will soon determine
his fate.
<P>
The issue for Congress is whether the Navy has so embraced political
correctness that it no longer stands by objective truth. Sample
evidence of the Navy's ongoing PC revolution.
<UL>
<LI>Top admiral Jeremy Boorda made one of his first visits to Capitol
Hill a session with Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Co.) -- Tailhook's
grand inquisitor -- and promised to do better. He now oversees
the rapid feminization of the Navy.
<P>
<LI>Three top admirals -- Kelso, Arthur and Mauz -- suffered direct
hits from unsubstantiated feminist accusations. These wounded
warriors were put to sea by the PC Navy.
<P>
<LI> The Navy deceived the public about the pregnancy problem aboard
the first aircraft carrier with women. Five pregnancies became
29 and the count is still climbing.
<P>
<LI>The Navy wrote a pregnancy policy that all but endorses abortion
and takes no position on out-of-wedlock births much less pregnancies
that result from extramarital affairs. But two-thirds of all uniformed,
one-time mothers have never been married and more than half of
all pregnant women who abandon ship never return.
<P>
<LI>The Navy hosted &quot;Diversity Day '94&quot; last September
which was attended by six PC admirals and included seminars that
promoted homosexuality as the moral equivalent of heterosexuality.
<P>
<LI>The Navy leads the services in the number of open homosexuals
serving. This violates the military homosexual law signed by President
Clinton in 1993.</UL>
<P>
The Clinton Administration's decision to place more women in combat
is not based on military necessity. It is a political decision
to buy feminist favor and in time it will backfire. In the meantime,
we must pretend.
<P>
Cmdr. Carkhuff should be awarded a medal for declaring the &quot;emperor
has no clothes.&quot; 
Instead, the Pentagon's PC crowd is working overtime ridding the
Navy of people of character who dare oppose a misguided policy.

<title>PARENTS WANT HELP FIGHTING THE POP CULTURE'S ADVERSE INFLUENCE</title>

<h2>PARENTS WANT HELP<br>
FIGHTING THE POP CULTURE'S<br>
ADVERSE INFLUENCE</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>
<p>
Most parents applauded when Procter &amp; Gamble recently withdrew
all advertising from four popular talk shows because they feature
&quot;gratuitous sex, foul language, and references to violence.&quot;
 Apparently, P&amp;G now understands that consumers are convinced
that these shows represent the decay of pop culture.
<p>
According to an October 1995 national public opinion survey commissioned
by the Family Research Council, four of every five parents believe
pop culture negatively affects children.  Single parents, especially,
say they need outside help shielding their children from pop culture's
emphasis on sex, violence, and vulgarity.
<p>
Even when Generation Xers (age 18 to 30) were asked &quot;to assess
the degree to which today's movies, television, and music lyrics
encourage teenage sex&quot;, 63 percent said &quot;a great deal&quot;
or &quot;quite a lot.&quot;  Programs like <I>Melrose Place</I>
and <I>Beverly Hills, 90210</I> flaunt sexual themes and vulgarity
and even family-hour shows such as <I>The Nanny</I> are laden
with sexual innuendo.
<p>
Three of every four Americans told Voter/Consumer Research (a
Maryland-based national pollster) that they either strongly or
somewhat agree with the statement, &quot;The values promoted in
today's movies, on television, and in music lyrics do not represent
my own views.&quot;  This widely shared view might explain Proctor
&amp; Gamble's move to dump trash talk shows.
<p>
Parents intuitively know what the scientific community confirms:
the messages of pop culture are &quot;persuasive&quot; in affecting
behavior.
<p>
In 1995, Robert McAfee, president of the American Medical Association,
stated: &quot;If you combine television, motion pictures, rap
music and video games, there's a continuing influence of violence....[and]
violence is indeed a learned behavior.&quot;  More than half of
young adults told FRC they agree that &quot;movies, television
and music lyrics contribute to violent crimes.&quot;
<p>
The National Institute of Mental Health reported that the consensus
in scientific literature is that exposure to television violence
increases children's physical aggressiveness.  Senate Judiciary
Committee member Paul Simon (D-Ill.) said he found &quot;nearly
3,000 scholarly articles and studies on the harmful effects of
television violence on children and adults.&quot; 
<p>
Science isn't as conclusive regarding television's impact on drug
abuse and teen sex, although the Center on Addiction and Substance
Abuse at Columbia recently released a national survey showing
that 76 percent of adolescents blame popular culture for encouraging
illegal drug use.
<p>
Researchers have found that <I>MTV</I>, the marriage between television
and music, is especially corrosive.  According to the authors
of the book <I>Dancing in the Dark</I>, music television is &quot;one
of the most powerful forms of contemporary propaganda.&quot;
<p>
Dr. Joseph Stuessey, professor of music history at the University
of Texas, told the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, &quot;Music
affects behavior.... It affects our moods, our attitudes, our
emotions, and our behavior.&quot;  It is estimated that the average
teen listens to rock music four to six hours each day.
<p>
The Parent's Music Resource Center reports that teens listen to
an estimated 10,500 hours of rock music between the seventh and
12th grades alone -- just 500 hours less than the total time they
spend in school over 12 years.
<p>
Dr. Sheila Davis, a professor of lyric writing at New York University,
states that songs &quot;are more than mere mirrors of society;
they are a potent force in the shaping of it....[p]opular songs...provide
the primary 'equipment for living' for America's youth.&quot;
<p>
Child psychologist Dr. David Elkind writes in <I>The Hurried Child</I>,
&quot;Music can influence young people as much as any visual media.&quot;
<p>
The loudest cry for help to battle pop culture's negative influence
comes from single parents.  Nearly two of every three single parents
told FRC they agree with the statement, &quot;These days, it is
too difficult for parents to deal with this [the pop culture]
alone.&quot;
<p>
Ultimately, parents are responsible and should monitor what kids
consume.  They should also explore technical devices that control
what kids watch  -- The Telecommander or TV Guardian -- and express
their views to the entertainment industry.
<p>
The entertainment industry is not without responsibility, however.
It demonstrated good citizenship when it created the ratings
now assigned to movies.  Comic book producers banned certain material,
and recently two national music distributors announced renewed
efforts to improve the Parental Advisory Program that flags sound
recordings which contain explicit lyrics.
<p>
More needs to be done.  TV networks ought to eliminate objectionable
programming or re-establish a &quot;family viewing hour&quot;
or &quot;safe harbor&quot; during which no objectionable material
is shown or advertised.  They should also cut gratuitous violence
and sexually explicit material.   By endorsing V-chip technology
they could help parents better control what enters the living
rooms of America.
<p>
Clear majorities told FRC they want an independent rating system
for television and music and the ability to block objectionable
cable television and computer material from their homes.

<title>LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION'S WAR ON THE FAMILY</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">
<p>
<h2>LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION'S<br>
WAR ON THE FAMILY</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Gary L. Bauer</i></center>
<p>
In Pennsylvania, a rapist brought a custody suit against the family
who had adopted the child he fathered by his rape of a 13-year-old
girl.  In Georgia, a transsexual attempted to sue the state health
department to pay for a sex change operation.  In New York, a
public housing tenant who had committed a drug crime fought his
eviction on the grounds that he could not be evicted without 30
days' prior notification.  And in another Georgia case, a petition
was filed to release a murderer who had killed his grandparents,
because they refused to give him their car keys.
<P>
What do all of these disturbing cases have in common?  You and
I paid for them.  That's right, our tax dollars, channeled through
the Legal Services Corporation (LSC), funded these cases and many
more like them over the past twenty-one years to the tune of $5
billion.  
<P>
LSC, which is a non-profit corporation set up by the federal government,
supposedly helps poor people gain access to expensive legal services.
 In actuality, it has been a deep well of anti-family litigation
that has helped to expand welfare dependency, divorce, abortion,
and the homosexual political agenda.  LSC has also been active
in eroding legal protections for the traditional family, pushing
the radical &quot;children's rights&quot; agenda, and making prisons
cozy for criminals.
<P>
When it comes to families in crisis, LSC grantees seem to be more
interested in facilitating divorce than in helping to repair marriages.
 LSC grantees have argued that mediation, an important way of
resolving domestic disputes, &quot;should be avoided because the
woman is always at a disadvantage.&quot;  They have also advised
lawyers working on divorce agreements to reduce the father's visitation
time and to avoid cash settlements so that the mother can be eligible
for welfare.  The agenda here is clear:  break up the family and
replace dad with a welfare check.
<P>
While encouraging welfare dependence, LSC programs have also blocked
attempts at welfare reform.  The most well-known case is in New
Jersey, where LSC once again joined its frequent co-litigators,
the ACLU and the National Organization for Women's Legal Defense
Fund.  They argued that the state's capping of welfare payments
to mothers who have additional children while on welfare violated
a woman's right to procreate.  Likewise, LSC programs have put
their muscle behind efforts to block welfare reform in California,
Massachusetts, Maryland, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Iowa, Kansas,
and Maine.
<P>
LSC lawsuits have also helped subsidize the destructive habits
of alcoholics and drug addicts.  In recent years, LSC grantees
have helped thousands of substance addicts obtain monthly disability
checks courtesy of employers and taxpayers.
<P>
Criminals often find a friend in LSC.  Throughout the years, LSC
grantees have worked hard to make sure that prisons look more
like country clubs than places to incarcerate dangerous offenders.
 Such efforts have increased the costs of jailing criminals, putting
many back on the streets where they prey mainly on the very people
LSC is supposed to protect.
<P>
Since 1977, LSC grantees have been prohibited from involvement
in abortion-related cases.  Nonetheless, LSC programs have remained
firm in their commitment to abortion on demand and have worked
around the law, attempting to secure unlimited taxpayer-funded
abortions.  In several cases throughout the country, LSC grantees
have worked against waiting periods, parental consent, and parental
notification.  LSC programs have been involved in most of the
major cases in the history of abortion litigation, including <I>Doe
v. Bolton</I>, the companion case to <I>Roe v. Wade</I>.  
<P>
You would think that the new Republican-controlled Congress, with
its mandate to control spending and reduce government intervention
in people's lives, would be chomping at the bit to defund such
nonsense.  But even among Republicans, this pot of gold for the
far left has its supporters who are working to ensure its survival.
 Rep. Hal Rogers (R-Ky.), chairman of a House appropriations subcommittee,
has been working to save LSC by retaining funding along with some
new &quot;reform&quot; provisions.  Meanwhile, in the Senate,
Sen. Nancy Kassebaum's Labor and Human Resources Committee has
held hearings aimed at extending LSC's life.
<P>
Saving LSC would be a big mistake for Congress.  LSC should be
defunded, saving the taxpayers $415 million a year, plus untold
billions in legislative impact and litigation costs.  It doesn't
make sense for Congress to fund the groups that will turn around
and sue to undo the reforms it was elected to enact.
<P>
The legal profession itself should do more to help the poor. 
For too long, taxpayers have subsidized one of the most lucrative
professions by relieving it of a portion of its responsibility
to do pro bono work for the poor.  The $255 million a year in
non-federal support for LSC-type programs demonstrates that there
is great potential to meet the legitimate legal needs of the poor
without burdening the taxpayer.
<P>
LSC is remarkably resistant to reform and oversight.  The structure
of the program guarantees that it will remain unaccountable and
uncontrollable until Congress pulls the plug.  There are better
ways to help the poor.  LSC <I>should </I>be abolished.

<title>ARE TEXAS' ILLEGITIMACY NUMBERS LEGITIMATE?</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">
<p>
<h2>ARE TEXAS' ILLEGITIMACY NUMBERS LEGITIMATE?</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>William R. Mattox, Jr.</i></center>
<p>
As the welfare reform debate turns increasingly to the states,
a number of folks interested in finding effective ways to combat
illegitimacy have been intrigued by something going on deep in
the heart of Texas.  Apparently, when it comes to having babies,
women seldom go it alone in the Lone Star State.
<p>
Whereas nearly one in three babies (31 percent) nationally is
born to a single mother, the most recent data available from the
National Center for Health Statistics show that roughly one in
six Texas tots (17 percent) is born out of wedlock.  Only Utah
(15 percent) has a lower ratio of non-marital to marital births.
<p>
What is remarkable -- and somewhat curious -- about the Lone Star
State's relatively low illegitimacy ratio is that it runs counter
to nearly every major national trend.  Generally, illegitimacy
tends to be higher in states with populations that are disproportionately
young, poor, or black -- all of which are true of Texas.
<p>
Indeed, New Mexico, Louisiana, Mississippi, and the District of
Columbia have the nation's highest illegitimacy ratios, while
Idaho, New Hampshire, and North Dakota follow Utah and Texas in
the Top Five for low illegitimacy.
<p>
So what explains the Lone Star State's apparent success?  Why
is Texas the only state along America's southern border that has
an illegitimacy ratio below the national average?
<p>
No one knows for sure.  But those hoping that Texas has found
some magic bullet for dramatically reducing our nation's serious
illegitimacy problem are apt to be disappointed.
<p>
Here's why:  NCHS shows that while Texas has a non-marital birth
rate well below the national average, it also has a teen pregnancy
rate well above the national average.  In fact, 45 states have a lower teen
pregnancy rate than Texas.  Thus, the Lone Star State's low illegitimacy
ratio apparently is not due to the success of its teen pregnancy
prevention programs.  Nor is it apparently attributable to rampant
abortion, since the abortion rate in Texas is below the national
average.
<p>
How, then, does one explain the fact that the Lone Star State
simultaneously has one of the highest teen pregnancy rates in
the country and one of the lowest illegitimacy ratios?  Here are
three possible explanations:
<p>
<b>1. The Shotgun Marriage Theory</b>. It used to be that girls
who got pregnant out of wedlock would, with the aid of their enraged
fathers, convince their boyfriends to marry them prior to the
arrival of their child.  Thus, many out-of-wedlock pregnancies
ended up being in-wedlock births.
<p>
In recent years, of course, shotgun marriages have fallen out
of fashion.  And while NCHS does not have data comparing the age
of first marriage for Texas women to that of women from other
states, there is little reason to believe shotgun marriages are
making a major comeback in Texas -- even though the Lone Star
State does have a disproportionate number of shotgun owners.
<p>
<b>2. The Chevy Suburban Theory</b>.  Not only does Texas have
more shotgun owners than other states, but it also has more of
those gas-guzzling, road-hogging Chevy Suburbans that some like
to call &quot;Texas Station Wagons.&quot;  Why is this important?
 Because nine-passenger Chevy Suburbans are the ultimate Big Family
Car for married couples who have lots of children -- and when
marrieds have lots of children, the ratio of non-marital to marital
births is lowered.
<p>
Indeed, the reason Utah has the lowest illegitimacy ratio in the
country is not just because its highly-Mormon unmarried population
is less likely to engage in the kind of hanky-panky that leads
to early pregnancy.  It is also because its highly-Mormon married
population is very reproductive by today's standards.
<p>
The most recent stats from the Census Bureau show that Texas women
are bearing children at a rate well below that of Utah women.
 But these stats are several years old, so it is at least conceivable
that Texas couples have recently started reproducing like rabbits
to fill their Suburbans.  It is more likely, of course, that many
Texas families are driving those gas-guzzling Suburbans (instead
of more practical seven-passenger minivans) because a good Texan
would never own a &quot;mini&quot; anything.
<p>
<b>3. The Texans Tell Tall Tales Theory</b>.  Another possibility
is that Texas' illegitimacy numbers are illegitimate -- that the
Lone Star State's data reflect that time-tested Texas tendency
to tell tall tales.  Sad to say, one need not hail from the &quot;Show
Me State&quot; (Missouri) to be skeptical about the veracity of
Texas' numbers.  The reason?  NCHS reports that Texas is one of
six states that does not require a mother's marital status to
be identified on her child's birth certificate.
<p>
Thus, NCHS says the illegitimacy numbers Texas reports to NCHS
are &quot;inferred.&quot;  This is a fancy way of saying the numbers
are made up.  They are educated guesses, to be sure.  By educated
people no doubt.  But they are, in the end, still guesses.
<p>
Curiously, Texas leaped from 23rd in the nation in low teen illegitimacy
in 1989 to 9th nationally in 1990 -- the very year Texas made
it easier for births to be &quot;inferred&quot; as marital.  Thus,
Texas' dramatic &quot;improvement&quot; in illegitimacy in recent
years is almost surely due to the fact that Texas officials have
been &quot;inferring&quot; lots of births incorrectly.
<p>
To their credit, some straight-shooters at the Texas Bureau of
Vital Statistics recently changed the procedure for reporting
birth information so that a mother's marital status must be identified.
 The effects of this change won't be reported by NCHS until next
spring, but preliminary indications are that Texas' illegitimacy
ratio will climb to about 29 percent.
<p>
That is significantly higher than the Lone Star State's current
ratio, but it is still lower than the national average -- and
lower than all of its neighbors.
<p>
Which is to say Texas probably doesn't have a magic bullet in
its fight against illegitimacy, but it does have an illegitimacy
ratio just good enough to give Texans reason to do what Texans
do best: boast.

  DRUG LEGALIZATION</H2>

<I> Robert L. Maginnis</I></CENTER>
<P>
ABC television recently aired a documentary which suggested that
America has lost the drug war and now must embrace legalization.
 &quot;America's War on Drugs: Searching for Solutions&quot; includes
a litany of distortions:
<P>
<LI>Anti-drug programs are called a failure.  In fact, America's
balanced strategy of prevention-treatment-enforcement turned the
drug problem around in the 1980s.  Drug pushers are gaining today
because the Clinton Administration has abandoned the offensive.
   
<P>
<LI>ABC argues that legalizing drugs will reduce crime.  It cites
anecdotal information from foreign countries as proof.  But these
&quot;facts&quot; are refuted by reports from the same countries
and from America's own experience.
<P>
<LI> ABC touts drug treatment as a better alternative to enforcement.
 It profiles closely controlled and very limited foreign experiments
as evidence.  But those countries still have major illicit drug
problems and ABC admits that drug treatment more often fails than
it succeeds.  
<P>
<LI>ABC labels those opposed to legalization or &quot;harm reduction&quot;
as motivated by fear.  In fact, there is clear scientific evidence
to demonstrate that even &quot;mild&quot; drugs like marijuana
have serious health consequences.
<P>
ABC correctly reports that drug abuse is once again on the rise,
especially among children, and that &quot;America shows few signs
of rethinking its drug strategy.&quot;  Although hostess Catherine
Crier claimed that her objective is to &quot;stir up public debate&quot;
and &quot;not to advocate any specific policy,&quot; many of the
program's guests are known members of the drug legalization movement.
 The program promoted a drug philosophy called &quot;harm reduction&quot;
which includes legalization.
<P>
Harm reduction, endorsed by most legalizers and to a certain extent
by the Clinton Administration, calls for more treatment and less
enforcement.  It views the use of illegal drugs as a health issue
rather than be a crime problem.  
<P>
ABC's presentation ignores history.  The U.S. experimented with
legalization from 1919 to 1922, when government-sponsored clinics
handed out free drugs to addicts in hopes of controlling their
behavior.  The effort failed.  Society's 
revulsion against drugs, combined with enforcement, virtually
eradicated the menace at the time.
<P>
Crier cites society's high cost for illegal drug use each year
at $67 billion.  But she fails to compare those costs with the
high costs of two popular legal drugs: alcohol, $99 billion and
smoking, $72 billion.  At the program's end, Crier admits that
decriminalization will lead to more use. 
<P>
The Drug Enforcement Administration estimates that drug decriminalization
will cost society more than alcohol and tobacco combined, perhaps
$140-$210 billion a year in lost productivity and job-related
accidents. 
<P>
An article in the <I>Journal of the American Medical Association</I>
found that marijuana users had &quot;55 percent more industrial
accidents, 85 percent more injuries and a 78 percent increase
in absenteeism.&quot;  Insurance companies would pass accident
expenses on to consumers.
<P>
Once drugs are legal, it will be very difficult, if not impossible,
to turn the clock back.  Today, there are few calls for recriminalization
of alcohol even though the evidence shows that prohibition saved
lives.  Alcohol use declined by 30 to 50 percent during prohibition
and deaths from cirrhosis of the liver fell dramatically.  Mark
Moore, Harvard professor of criminal justice, wrote: &quot;The
real lesson of prohibition is that society can, indeed, make a
dent in the consumption of drugs through law.&quot;
<P>
Unfortunately, ABC provides one sympathetic anecdotal account
of a drug abuser entrapped by stiff laws; meanwhile, it ignores
thousands of families who have been devastated by drug abuse.
 There was no reference to diminished public safety, increased
victimization, or increased family violence and child abuse caused
by individuals under the influence of illegal drugs.  And statistics,
such as the claim that 15 percent of the population smoke pot,
go unsubstantiated.
<P>
Instead, the viewer is introduced to &quot;harm reduction&quot;
programs in Holland and Britain and told that tolerance rather
than punishment works.  A Dutch official explains that legalizing
marijuana resulted in no increase in crime.  
<P>
ABC was either unaware of or ignored a study by Dr. K. F. Gunning,
President of the Dutch National Committee on Drug Prevention,
who found a 250 percent increase in cannabis use among students
from 1984 to 1992.  During the same period, shootings rose 40
percent, car thefts increased 62 percent, and hold-ups rose 69
percent.
<P>
American social scientists have confirmed a relationship between
drug use and juvenile delinquency.  A 1990 study published in
the <I>Journal of Drug Issues</I> found a strong association between
the severity of the crime and the type of substance used -- the
more intoxicating the substance, the more serious the incident.
<P>
Although ABC reported that in Britain, heroin addicts in small
experimental programs have not committed many crimes, Great Britain's
previous &quot;harm reduction&quot; efforts dispute these claims.
 The British sponsored a program of controlled distribution of
heroin between 1959 and 1968.  According to the <I>British Medical
Journal</I>, the number of heroin addicts doubled every 16 months
and the increase in addicts was accompanied by an increase in
criminal activity as well.
<P>
Undoubtedly, getting money for drugs is a motive for some crime,
but many criminals use drugs when committing crimes.  For example,
the U.S. Justice Department reports that most inmates (77.4 percent
male and 83.6 percent female) have a drug history and the majority
were under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of their
current offense.  
<P>
ABC cited California's experiment with marijuana legalization
which allegedly saved a billion dollars in law enforcement costs.
 What it didn't mention is a study that found that within the
first six months after decriminalization, arrests for driving
under the influence of drugs rose 46 percent for adults and 71.4
percent for juveniles.  Decriminalizing marijuana in Alaska and
Oregon in the 1970s resulted in the doubling of use and efforts
to recriminalize.
<P>
Crier reports that we have more than 300,000 people in jail for
drug-related offenses and later says that drug use would rise
with legalization.  She fails to reconcile more abuse with less
crime.  In fact, the 1993 Justice Department &quot;Sourcebook&quot;
shows 97,999 inmates charged with a drug offense and that most
inmates (79.4 percent) have used drugs. 
<P>
ABC also failed to mention that if drugs were legalized some restrictions
still would be necessary.  For example, Holland restricts the
sale of legalized drugs to minors, pregnant women, police, military,
pilots and prisoners.  There is no way the government could legally
sanction demonstrably harmful drugs like PCP and LSD, and less
potent marijuana would not satisfy users when far stronger pot
became available on the black market.  A black market niche for
these drugs would be inevitable.
<P>
Former Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare Joseph Califano
cautions that in a post-legalization world, &quot;Madison Avenue
hucksters would make it as attractive to do a few lines [of cocaine]
as to down a few beers.&quot;  This would line the pockets of
legal drug producers and clearly hurt the American taxpayer and
American families.
<P>
Despite significant evidence that all hard drug users used gateway
drugs (alcohol, tobacco, marijuana) before they used hard drugs
(cocaine, PCP, heroin), ABC includes comments by &quot;harm reduction&quot;
advocates who dismiss the &quot;gateway&quot; theory of drug abuse
and the health risks associated with marijuana.
<P>
A 1992 article in <I>The Journal of Primary Prevention</I> found
that marijuana use is essentially a &quot;necessary&quot; condition
for the occurrence of cocaine use.  Other research shows that
involvement with illicit drugs is a developmental phenomenon,
age correlates with use, and cigarette and alcohol use precedes
marijuana use.  Polydrug use is often an indication of transition
to the more addictive substance.   
<P>
Dr. Carlton Turner, former  director of the National Institute
on Drug Abuse and head of the Marijuana Research Project at the
University of Mississippi, warns, &quot;There is no other drug
used or abused by man that has the staying power and broad cellular
actions on the body that cannabis [marijuana] does.&quot;
<P>
Since the 1970s there have been more than 10,500 scientific studies
which demonstrate the adverse consequences of marijuana use. 
The short term effects of marijuana include impairment in motivation
learning and memory, perception, judgment and complex motor skills.
 Pot consumption can cause difficulty in speaking, listening effectively,
thinking, retaining knowledge, problem-solving, and forming concepts.
<P>
The long-term effects are far more serious.  One study found large
numbers of marijuana smokers among younger cancer patients.  A
study in <I>Cancer</I> found that children of women who smoke
marijuana are 11 times more likely to contract leukemia.  Mothers
who smoke marijuana also contribute to low birth weight and developmental
problems for their children and increase by as much as 500 percent
the risk of abnormalities similar to those caused by fetal alcohol
syndrome. 
<P>
ABC may stir up public debate but &quot;America's War on Drugs&quot;
was not a responsible and balanced presentation.  &quot;Harm reduction&quot;
creates more problems than it solves.  Although a balanced policy
of treatment, prevention and strong enforcement works, the Clinton
administration has cut enforcement while Congress is cutting prevention
programs.  
<P>
America needs leaders committed to the drug war.  At present,
the debate is mired down in rhetoric while drug abuse among children
worsens.

<TITLE>A GENERATION XER'S</TITLE>

<P>
<H2>A GENERATION XER'S<BR>
 PERSPECTIVE<BR>
  ON PROMISE KEEPERS</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<CENTER>
<I>by</I>
<P>
<I>Gracie S. Hsu</I></CENTER>
<P>
Thirteen &quot;Promise Keepers&quot; events will be held across
the nation this summer, equipping and encouraging an estimated
half-million men to keep their promises to God, to their wives
and children, and to their fellow man.  While this laudable movement
to honor one's word is not aimed at a particular age group, some
might believe its &quot;traditional values&quot; message would
have more appeal among older generations.  Perhaps.  But public
opinion data indicate that one age group which might be especially
receptive to this message are young adults -- the so-called &quot;Generation
X.&quot;
<P>
In fact, Generation Xers (adults aged 18-29) are more likely than
any other adult age group to say that &quot;divorce should be
harder [rather than easier] to obtain,&quot; according to a recent
compilation of public opinion polls by the American Enterprise
Institute.
<P>
This finding is significant because it deviates from previous
generational trends.  Those in the younger age ranges have typically
held more liberal views toward divorce than their elders.  For
example, Baby Boomers (those between age 30 and 48 today) said
20 years ago that divorce should be easier to obtain -- a view
to which fewer of their elders subscribed.
<P>
Why, then, would Generation X be <I>more</I> likely than their
elders to hold traditional values on the permanence of marriage?
 The reasons are admittedly complex.
<P>
Some attempt to explain this anomaly by remarking that Gen Xers
are too young to understand the difficulties of marriage, and
that once Gen Xers are exposed to the hardships of married life,
their attitudes toward liberalized divorce policies would also
change.
<P>
But a more compelling reason -- the one on which most people agree
-- is that far from being ignorant about the hardships of marriage,
Gen Xers personally understand the devastating effects of <I><B>divorce</B></I>.
<P>
Indeed, Generation Xers are more likely than any other adults
to be children of divorce.  During the years in which today's
Generation Xers were born (1965-1977), the divorce rate in the
U.S. doubled.  The percent of children born
outside of wedlock also doubled during that time period -- the
result not so much of a broken <I>marriage</I> vow as of a broken
promise to <I>love</I>.  Consequently, more than 40 percent of
today's young adults spent at least some time in a single-parent
family by age 16.
<P>
The argument that Generation X's aversion to divorce developed
from their witnessing too many broken marriage promises is strengthened
by the attitudinal consistency which Generation X exhibits in
other areas of life.
<P>
For example, articles analyzing the Gen X culture often describe
Xers as &quot;skeptical,&quot; &quot;insecure,&quot; or &quot;cautious&quot;
-- attitudes which have largely been influenced by broken or flippantly-made
promises.
<P>
To expound, Generation X analysts say young adults are &quot;skeptical&quot;
of media hype because too many commercials and advertisements
make far-flung promises which they cannot deliver.  Analysts also
say that Xers are &quot;insecure&quot; about finances and future
stability because the American dream they were promised of surpassing
the wealth of their parents has, in reality, dim prospects.  And,
according to a recent <I>American Demographics</I> article, Gen
Xers are &quot;cautious romantics.&quot;  They marry at later
ages, increasing their economic and emotional stability in the
hopes of avoiding divorce and the broken promises of a marriage
vow.
<P>
Clearly, the message of Promise Keepers responds to the anxieties
of today's young adults.  But the fact that Promise Keepers is
not limited to the young should make the young, in particular,
celebrate.  For, perhaps now more than ever, young adults <I>need</I>
role models.  Far too many of their primary role models (i.e.
parents) have failed to model successful marriages.  And as a
result, Generation X could well be the most well-intentioned but
least-equipped adult age group in terms of keeping their marriage
vows.
<P>
Thus, encouraging older men to be &quot;Promise Keepers&quot;
will, among other benefits, help the young maintain their resolve.
 And that is the hope of the Promise Keepers movement -- that
the advancements begun by these rallies will positively impact
generations to come.
<P>
Lest there be any misunderstanding:  I am not suggesting that
the Promise Keepers movement is a cure-all for divorce or that
it is the singular solution for eradicating broken promises. 
But, this movement is definitely promising...for both young and
old alike.

<P>
<H2>A PRO-LIFE DEFENSE<BR>
  OF THE FAMILY CAP</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<CENTER>
<I>by</I>
<P>
<I>Jennifer E. Marshall</I></CENTER>
<P>
Again, in the course of the welfare debate, the abortion issue
has demonstrated its unique capacity to mobilize and divide.
<P>
Pro-life advocates who resist the so-called family cap, which
would freeze benefits to mothers who bear additional illegitimate
children while on welfare, fear with some justification that the
cap could promote an increase in abortions.  Pro-life advocates
who support the measure share both the concern and the long-term
goal of driving abortions to the point of zero.
<P>
All right-to-life activists should realize that, as one of the
few weapons in the anti-illegitimacy arsenal, the family cap not
only serves their cause in the long-term but deserves their active
support in the present debate -- subject to the critical qualification
that there must be no attendant funding for abortions.
<P>
No hard data is available to demonstrate that the family cap stimulates
the abortion rate.  And there is reason to think that the family
cap will <U>not</U> increase abortions, even in the short-term.
<P>
Feminists and welfare rights activists argue that the current
benefits level is already far too low to cover the costs associated
with a new baby.  If so, it is illogical to maintain that a cap
would have a sufficiently significant impact on the &quot;affordability&quot;
of another child to necessitate such a drastic measure as abortion.
<P>
The decision to abort, anyhow, is far more than an economic calculation.
 Twenty years of spiraling illegitimacy rates in the face of liberalized
abortion laws demonstrate that many individuals do not regard
abortion as a viable option.
<P>
Policy data collected by the Family Research Council suggests
that abortion is even less acceptable to poor women; and an article
recently published in <U>Family Planning Perspectives</U> found
that abortion rates for teen welfare mothers are <U>lower</U>
than national averages for all teenage girls.
<P>
Other research suggests that, whether conception was intended
or not, most illegitimate births to underclass women today are
&quot;wanted.&quot;  Certainly, there is 

anecdotal evidence to suggest that some girls have babies because
they want &quot;something to love&quot; -- or, worse yet, because
their peer group has perversely defined a baby as a status symbol.
<P>
Others simply believe that abortion is wrong and choose not to
compound their first mistake by committing another.  While poverty
dispirits some lives, in others it serves to highlight the intangibles
that make life most sacred.  The point of decrying moral deterioration
among the underclass is to assert an easily forgotten truth: every
person, regardless of economic status, is capable of the very
moral commitments that argue most forcefully against abortion.
<P>
Even assuming that our ultimate objective is to save as many lives
as possible, it is by no means clear that the appropriate operational
measure of success in assessing the family cap is the number of
lives saved in the short-term.  The question itself is a red herring
because it obscures the larger and more important issue: &quot;What
constitutes progress toward ending altogether the culture that
finds abortion acceptable?&quot;
<P>
While there is no point at which the short-term perspective loses
relevance, few would dispute that there exists some point at which
the long-term implications demand consideration.  If it is true
that preserving the current benefits package will save lives,
presumably we could save even more lives by increasing the entitlements
tenfold.  Yet, most right-to-life activists intuitively understand
that there is an alternative good to be served by restricting
benefits that will in no way compromise our commitment to life.
<P>
Liberal observers with a vested interest in dividing conservative
support have manufactured a pernicious myth that reducing illegitimacy
and eliminating abortion are mutually exclusive goals.  Pro-lifers
should combat that perception at all costs, short of suspending
our principles, because there is no question that reducing illegitimacy
by reducing the federal subsidy will serve the over-arching purpose
of the pro-life movement.
<P>
The vast majority of abortions are performed on unmarried women
-- and the proportion is growing.  To reduce abortions, we must
reduce the premarital sex and out-of-wedlock pregnancy that create
a perceived &quot;need&quot; for abortion.
<P>
By gradually eliminating federal benefits, poor women who are
pregnant out of wedlock will be forced to turn to local organizations,
including right-to-life crisis pregnancy groups, that will counsel
against abortion and discourage further irresponsible behavior.
<P>
Launching the arguments against illegitimacy in the context of
the current debate over those benefits will give new rhetorical
emphasis and more widespread attention to the arguments against
abortion; for, the two ills spring from the same misconception
that life is cheap and motherhood bears no sacred responsibility.
<P>
Indeed, the bipartisan focus on illegitimacy is one of the most
golden opportunities we have had in quite some time to reverse
the message of the counterculture that has made abortion &quot;rights&quot;
seem palatable.
<P>
We should bear in mind that what we think about the right to life
has an organic relationship with our vision of the kind of society
we should institute.  Not by coincidence, the Declaration speaks
of &quot;life&quot; in the same breath with &quot;liberty&quot;
and &quot;the pursuit of happiness&quot; -- two conditions that
speak directly to the question of how best to organize society.
<P>
By opposing the current system of welfare benefits, we advocate
a transformation of the political and social culture that will
sustain both &quot;happiness&quot; and a more enduring pro-life
consensus than even legal reform can hope to accomplish.

<P>
In the welfare debate last year, President Clinton himself stated
that &quot;the real source of the problem is the inordinate number
of out-of-wedlock births in this country.&quot;  He also conceded
that &quot;there's no question that ending welfare for unwed mothers
would work.  The question is `Is it morally right?'&quot;
<P>
While the President's proposed policies leave much to be desired,
he has formulated precisely the right question to frame the current
debate over welfare reform in general and illegitimacy in particular.
 There exists a striking public consensus that the welfare state's
practice of subsidizing illegitimacy is not only a massive problem,
but a moral problem at root.
<P>
No moral judgment even need be adduced to acknowledge that intact
families bestow upon individuals and communities advantages that
simply come no other way.  Empirical evidence amassed by social
scientists in the last ten years has confirmed in exquisite detail
what those who have lived in broken families already know.  A
single woman with children is not a viable economic unit for the
vast majority, but children need biological fathers for far more
than the extra dollars they add to the family budget.
<P>
If those on the welfare rolls have suffered most conspicuously,
it is also true that the welfare system has corrupted the ideals
and narrowed the vision of many who live well beyond the bounds
of the inner city -- even as it is now threatening our most cherished
civic institutions.  One obvious casualty is the weakening of
our conviction that the so-called &quot;bourgeois virtues&quot;
are available to all, regardless of race or class.  Early American
social workers, like Mary Ellen Richmond, understood that the
way to reintegrate the deviant into society is to cultivate in
them the values of the mainstream culture.
<P>
The role of the traditional two-parent family is essential in
sustaining the institutions of a free society precisely because
it is the vehicle by which values are transmitted from generation
to generation.  If the family fails to impart 
virtues that temper and restrain behavior, broad legal freedoms
must give way.  So, too, human dignity and equality, as the Founders
understood it.  Virtue, historian Gertrude Himmelfarb has said,
is the only true basis of equality and 

the only requisite for citizenship.  Either we act now to reduce
illegitimacy and to reinfuse our public policy with a commitment
to higher and nobler things -- or we run the risk of sabotaging
the entire experiment in democratic self-government.  Given the
consequences for the individual child, the surrounding community,
and the national polity, bringing a baby into this world without
a sense of sacred responsibility cannot long be regarded as a
morally neutral act.  Congress should now recognize that it is
also wrong to sanction such activity by subsidizing it.  Himmelfarb
writes that &quot;after making the most arduous attempt to objectify
the problem of poverty, to divorce poverty from any moral assumptions
and conditions, we are learning how inseparable the moral and
material dimensions of that problem are.&quot;
<P>
In sending his welfare package to Congress more than 30 years
ago, President Kennedy articulated contemporary liberals' fundamental
misunderstanding of the causal role welfare plays in boosting
illegitimacy rates.  &quot;Welfare programs,&quot; he said, &quot;must
contribute to the attack on . . . family breakdown [and] illegitimacy.
. . .  Unless such problems are dealt with effectively, they fester,
and grow, sapping the strength of society as a whole and extending
their consequences in troubled families from one generation to
the next.&quot;  Kennedy's insight about the consequences has
proven historically accurate; but his &quot;service&quot; approach
to curbing illegitimacy worked no better than the current President's
will.
<P>
While the President advocates a massive and expensive public relations
campaign against out-of-wedlock births, an unnamed aide on the
Clinton welfare task force confided to <U>Newsweek</U> reporter
Joe Klein: &quot;We looked at a hundred different programs around
the country that were trying to deal with this problem, and not
one of them moved the needle.  There just weren't any results.&quot;
 A formal study of the Teenage Parent Demonstration, sponsored
by the Department of Health and Human Services in response to
&quot;persistently high rates of teenage pregnancies and births,&quot;
found that &quot;[t]he program had an unusual and disappointing
pattern of impacts on pregnancy and birth rates . . . despite
. . . the substantial efforts of the programs to empower [the]
young mothers to take control of their fertility.&quot;
<P>
Charles Murray anticipated the problem in his 1988 book <U>In
Pursuit of Happiness and Good Government</U>.  &quot;The task,&quot;
he concludes, &quot;is not to devise a public relations campaign
to discourage single teenage girls from having babies, but to
neutralize whatever is impeding the age-old impulse of human beings
to form families. . . .  A major change in the behavior of young
women and the adults in their lives will occur only when the prospect
of having a child out of wedlock is once again so immediately,
tangibly punishing that it overrides everything else.&quot;  Eliminating
grants to unwed teenage mothers will be necessary, but not sufficient,
to restore the integrity of the family unit.
<P>
Only by historical accident were unwed mothers - of any age -
ever included in the AFDC program.  Frances Perkins, President
Roosevelt's Secretary of Labor and chief architect of welfare
policy, opposed extending federal entitlements to unmarried mothers
because she foresaw that subsidizing illegitimacy would escalate
family breakdown.  It would be ironic at best if the current majority
in Congress were to find themselves to the left of the most liberal
member of the Roosevelt Administration because they rejected that
intuition, now confirmed by years of sad experience.
<P>
As the one policy option that promises to effect change in the
current system, restrictions on benefits by definition constitute
the compassionate alternative.  If compassion is once again properly
understood, perhaps then it will become more obvious that the
object of our concern must be &quot;misery&quot; and &quot;sorrow,&quot;
not economic poverty, and that the &quot;misery&quot; most evident
today is the spiritual and moral deprivation visited upon dependents
of the welfare system.  It is time that we stop suppressing the
moral responsibilities that make life precious for a resident
of the inner city just the same as for a middle-class suburbanite.
 It is time, in short, to secure equal access to the central satisfactions
of family, virtue, and freedom.

<P>
<H2> FEDERAL GOVERNMENT USES<BR>
 TAXPAYER MONEY TO PROMOTE<BR>
 FEMINIST AGENDA</H2>

<P>
The federal government used taxpayer money to buy packets of radical
feminist literature that denigrates men, promotes abortion on
demand, and declares homosexuality to be the moral equivalent
of heterosexuality.
<P>
The Postal Service and the United States Information Agency have
purchased these packets from the feminist Ms. Foundation for Women
and distributed them nationwide.  The materials were designed
to help plan the annual &quot;Take Our Daughters to Work Day,&quot;
which occurred Thursday, April 27th.  
<P>
The Ms. material:
<P>
<LI> Demonizes men and makes girls appear to be uniformly victimized
in a patriarchal society.
<P>
<LI> Presents an unbalanced analysis of educational opportunities
for the sexes.
<P>
<LI>Promotes abortion and warns that unnamed factions want to take
away the &quot;right to choose.&quot;
<P>
<LI> Severely exaggerates statistics.
<P>
The 136-page packets include parent, employer and school guides;
lesson plans for girls and boys; a synopsis of gender bias research;
and merchandise and literature order forms.  
<P>
The Ms. Foundation claims responsibility for creating and sponsoring
&quot;Take Our Daughters to Work Day&quot; as a public-education
campaign about girls and self-esteem.  According to its mission
statement, the Ms. Foundation &quot;directs resources to break
down barriers based on ...sexual orientation...[and promotes]
reproductive rights.&quot;  &quot;Sexual orientation&quot; is
code for homosexuality.
<P>
The packets include books such as <U><I>Medicine Women</I></U>,
for girls age 13 and up, which teaches about women who were midwives,
witches, high priestesses, female warriors and more.  Another
book, <U><I>Reinventing the Family: the Emerging Story of Lesbian
and Gay Parents</I></U> &quot;dramatize[s] the ingrained antipathy
of the larger society toward homosexuals [and] refute[s] the
detrimental assumptions hampering wider acceptance of gay parenting.&quot;

<P>
The packet further profiles facts about &quot;male dominance,&quot;
e.g., &quot;Between 1980 and 1990, the number of senior girls
in high school interested in engineering dropped by 25%.  Nationally,
the number of college women going into science and graduating
in science is declining.  Women and girls continue to be enrolled
in education and training programs that prepare them for low-wage
jobs in traditionally female occupations.&quot;
<P>
The materials often lack balance.  For example,  no mention is
made that more bachelor's and master's degrees are awarded to
women; boys get better scores in math and science, but girls get
higher scores in reading and writing; boys in eighth grade are
50 percent more likely to be held back a grade; and boys in high
school constitute 68 percent of the &quot;special education&quot;
population.
<P>
Feminist heroines like professor Anita Hill, Planned Parenthood
founder Margaret Sanger and activist Gloria Steinem are highlighted,
as are events like the Supreme Court decision, <I>Roe v. Wade</I>,
which legalized abortion.
<P>
Anita Hill is accorded &quot;victim&quot; status in the Clarence
Thomas Supreme Court confirmation hearing because she testified
&quot;before an all-male, all-white Senate judiciary committee.&quot;
<P>
Ms. Founder Gloria Steinem is credited with the statement: &quot;A
woman without a man is like a fish without a bicycle.&quot;  What
does this have to do with the self-esteem of little girls?
<P>
The pro-abortion message is clear.  Under the name of Margaret
Sanger the material reads: &quot;Still, in the 90s, 40,000 teenage
girls drop out of school each year because of pregnancy.&quot;
 Next to <I>Roe v. Wade</I>: an &quot;estimated 1.2 million additional
unintended pregnancies would occur each year in absence of publicly
funded women's health services.&quot;
<P>
The material also includes the statement: &quot;10% of American
women are lesbians and approximately 3.5 million lesbian and gay
Americans have had children.&quot;  The 10% figure is based on
Alfred Kinsey's thoroughly discredited estimate of the incidence
of homosexuality in the population.  Kinsey, an Indiana University
zoologist who authored <U><I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</I></U>
in 1948, based his research on 12,000 interviews, relying heavily
on data gleaned from criminals.  He extrapolated his findings
to the general population.  A number of recent studies have found
the population indulging in homosexual behavior to be considerably
less than 10 percent, and probably no more than 1 to 2 percent.
 
<P>
In a blatant attempt to redefine the family, the material lists
an unknown court case that declared &quot;[t]wo women make up
a `family of affinity.'&quot;  Also, the wildly exaggerated estimate
that 3.5 million children are being raised in homosexual homes
has no foundation in fact.
<P>
On another &quot;hot&quot; feminist issue, the Ms. Foundation
claims that &quot;Every 15 seconds in the U.S. a woman is battered.
 It is the greatest single cause of injury to women, more than
car accidents, muggings and rapes combined.&quot;  This, too,
is an exaggeration.
<P>
There are 31,536,000 seconds in a year.  If an American woman
is battered every 15 seconds then there are 2,124,000 such incidents.
 According to the Justice Department there are only 133,228 single-offender
assaults each year attributed to an offending spouse.  That's
one every 237 seconds.  
<P>
The Justice Department's 1994 report, &quot;Violence Against Women,&quot;
found that women are almost twice as likely to be victimized by
a boyfriend or ex-spouse than by a current spouse.  It projects
each year that there are 367,462 assaults by boyfriends or ex-spouses
compared to 195,980 by spouses.  And women are more likely to
be assaulted by a friend than by an intimate or relative.
<P>
Although the Ms. Foundation claims that &quot;girls are 4 to 5
times more likely to attempt suicide,&quot;  it neglects to mention
that boys actually kill themselves at a rate six times that of
girls.
<P>
The Census Bureau found that for all Americans 15 to 24 years
old in 1991, 11.8 percent of boys and 9.8 percent of girls used
cigarettes.  But Ms. says, &quot;Girls smoke more than boys.&quot;
<P>
While the feminist organization claims that girls are neglected
in classrooms, the fact is that most of the attention boys receive
is disciplinary.  Factoring-out conduct-related exchanges makes
the numbers similar.
<P>
The Ms. Foundation is a highly partisan political advocacy organization
which relies on unvetted research.  Ms. literature routinely has
promoted division between the sexes and has denigrated women who
do not work outside the home.  The federal government should not
embrace -- and thereby endorse -- materials which are anti-male,
pro-abortion, and pro-homosexual.

<title>FBI CHILD PORN STINGS AND A VIRTUAL DENIAL OF REALITY</title>

<h2>FBI CHILD PORN STINGS AND A<br>
VIRTUAL DENIAL OF REALITY</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Cathleen A. Cleaver, Esq.</i></center>
<p>
&quot;Disheartening&quot; is how Steve Case, president of America
Online, describes his members' actions.  What did they do to deserve
this polite reproof?  They consumed and distributed the precious
merchandise of the child pornography meat market.
<p>
For some time now, pictures of  young bodies have been swapped
like baseball trading cards over computer networks.   It's time
to get serious, folks.  The Justice Department has, and deserves
praise for its efforts.
<p>
Laws prohibiting computer-transmitted child pornography have been
in place for years, but there has been a defacto decriminalization
of this material due to lack of enforcement.  That is finally
being corrected, but there is little to no prohibition of other
pornography-related activity in cyberspace.
<p>
Sure, there are obscenity laws that might apply, but the specter
of those laws does not loom large in cyberspace.  There is a &quot;freedom&quot;
there that exists nowhere else with regard to pornography -- an
environment virtually untroubled by legal injunction or deterrent.
 Indeed, if we consider cyberspace to be a little world of its
own, it is the type of world for which groups like the ACLU have
long fought, but fought in vain.
<p>
It will not remain this way.  Congress will soon make some final
decisions about how to address obscenity and indecency.   But
while it lasts, we ought to look closely at this &quot;control-group&quot;
society, if for no other reason than to assure ourselves that
our decades-old decisions to control pornography through law were
good ones.
<p>
With a few clicks of the mouse, today's computer novice can get
raw, even violent, sexual images once difficult to find without
exceptional effort and material risk. The user can go to popular
&quot;erotica&quot; sites to fill his screens with photographs of group sex 
scenes, close-up shots of genital mutilation, eroticized defecation 
scenarios, or vulgar videotape stills of
animals with young women.  He can sell these pictures, or swap
them, or send them to disturb a neighbor, or post them to shock
the unwary.  The user can meet inquisitive children in chat rooms
and send them lewd photographs of himself.  He can write detailed
accounts of rape and murder and display them for all to read.
 The user can do these things in near anonymity, and with the
comfort of knowing that he is not at risk of legal sanction. 
This is cyberspace now, and it is the free speech absolutist's
dreamworld.
<p>
Most concede that obscenity -- hard-core sexual material so graphic
and unredeeming that it fails the Supreme Court's test -- should
be illegal on computers as it is elsewhere.  Others balk, however,
at the proposition of laws to keep computer indecency from children.
It is a feigned reaction.  &quot;Indecency&quot; is legal for
adults, but can be regulated so that it is kept from children.
It has been defined as <I>a pattern of patently offensive depictions
or descriptions of sexual or excretory activities or organs</I>.
The hysterical arguments about indecency laws banning serious
works of literature or library art are no more credible now than
they were when unsuccessfully lobbed at such laws in other contexts.
Society has long embraced the principle that those who peddle
harmful material have the obligation to keep the material from
children.  Moreover, to charge, as some do, that indecency regulation
will bring the developing technology to a screeching halt is to
maintain that its advancement <I>depends upon</I> unfettered
exhibition of offensive sexual material.  This cannot be true.
<p>
Opponents of computer pornography laws say we should simply &quot;empower&quot;
parents instead.  They would empower parents by forcing them to
purchase expensive software products to try to combat the pornographers
themselves.  This is a bad idea for several reasons.  It is bad
philosophically because it advocates <I>restricting</I> the behavior
of the &quot;good guys&quot; (families and children) while giving
license to the &quot;bad guys&quot; to litter cyberspace with
pornography.  It also represents a drastic departure from time-honored
principles of the role of law in protecting children from exploitation.
Outside cyberspace, laws restrain people from displaying sexually
explicit images in public places and from selling alcohol, tobacco,
or porn magazines to children.  No one suggests that parents are
absolved from parental responsibility because of these laws. 
Yet, in the cyberporn debate, a small chorus of angry voices bellows:
&quot;It's the responsibility of <I>parents</I>, not government!&quot;
when identical laws are considered.
<p>
It is also a bad idea to leave the burden completely on the parent,
because it will not work.  Without liability and penalty disincentives,
the ability to restrict pornography would depend upon the character
of pornography distributors.  Already there are electronic &quot;how-to&quot;
pamphlets to circumvent blocking devices.  As technical restrictions
increase, so too will these aids, and they will be marketed and
used with impunity.
<p>
We can observe first-hand what the result of a purely market-based,
non-regulatory solution would look like, for we are looking at
it now.  Those advocating technofixes in place of laws aren't
earnestly seeking to empower parents to protect children.  Rather,
they want to force parents by the power of their arrogance to
kick kids off of this universal system so that nothing need inhibit
the free porn trade.
<p>
Opponents of pornography laws implore that the laws simply cannot
apply to this new medium.  This tattered old argument is pulled
out and dusted off with each new technological advance.  We saw
it last in the early '80s with the advent of the commercial videotape
market, and we see it now again.  Scientific change mandates legal
change only insofar as it affects the justification for a law.
The notion that people who disseminate harmful material have
the obligation to restrict the material from children is one which
transcends specific technology.  Old laws might need definition
and renovation, but old principles stand firm. 
<p>
Cyberspace is a work in progress.  We should not squander the
opportunity to examine and appreciate a world where pornography
knows no bounds.  The information superhighway does not belong
to pornographers.  Failure to enact strong laws is a concession
that it should.

<h2>AMERICA AND THE SELLING OF<br>
PEDOPHILIA</h2>

<p>
Calvin Klein pulled its kiddie porn ads from the market this week,
but not before millions of Americans were treated to a new low
in the ongoing campaign to sexualize children. 
<P>
One ad features a young blonde teen-ager on the floor of a cheaply
furnished room. Her panties are exposed under a short skirt. 
She looks like a kidnap victim, about to be raped.  Her eyes convey
hurt and fear.  Another photo shows a boy clad in purple underpants.
His nails are painted black.  His eyes convey lust.  The ads were
shot by the same photographer that did Madonna's pornographic
book, <U>Sex.</U>
<P>
The television ads are even more suggestive.   In fact, the TV
ads are eerily similar to tapes that were the center of the controversy
last year when the Clinton Justice Department tried to weaken
the definition of child pornography.  In the <I>U.S. v. Knox</I>
case, Janet Reno argued that children had to be completely nude
for material to be considered child pornography, and furthermore,
that the children had to be purposely acting lasciviously.  The
material in <I>Knox</I> was videotapes produced by the Nather
Company, which described them as &quot;erotic beyond belief,&quot;
containing &quot;tender&quot; teens and pre-teens in &quot;savage&quot;
panty shots.  The Nather Tapes were found by the courts to be
child pornography, a verdict agreed to by the U.S. Senate, which
voted 100-0 to  condemn the Reno interpretation.  
<P>
Like the Calvin Klein ads, Nather Tape Two opens with images of
a clothed adolescent girl tentatively striking poses, responding
to off-camera directions from an adult male voice.  The camera
repeatedly focuses on her panties.  At one point, she says, &quot;I
don't know what to do.&quot;  The off-camera voice asks her to
sit down and push her knees up.  Another panty shot follows, and
another voice off camera says, &quot;We love it.&quot;  In another
tape, the off-camera voice asks a pre-teen girl to dance as the
camera focuses on parts of her body.  In the Calvin Klein ads,
a teen girl stands nervously in a basement room, responding to
off-camera directions from an adult male voice.  The off-camera
voice asks why she's nervous.  She 
replies,  &quot;I don't know what you're going to do.&quot;  The
voice asks her if she's a good dancer.  When she replies that
she is, he asks her to dance for him.  Other ads show a boy in
t-shirt and jeans.  The off-camera voice compliments the boy on
his body, and tells him he looks strong.  The voice then goads
him to prove his strength by ripping his t-shirt open, and the
boy complies.  The similarity between the porn tapes and the Klein
ads is uncanny.        
<P>
Before public pressure forced Klein to shelve the ads, many Americans
watched in dismay, asking how a nation came to allow its children
to be fodder for crude commercials by unscrupulous vendors.  Then
again, some ask, why has America allowed its children to be exposed
to graphic materials in public schools in the name of  &quot;AIDS
prevention&quot; and  &quot;sex education?&quot; 
<P>
The sexualization of children in America had its beginnings not
on a Madison Avenue drawing board or even in Hollywood but in
the pages of one of the best-known (and least-read) books of the
century -- Alfred C. Kinsey's <U>Sexual Behavior in the Human
Male</U>.  In 1948, Kinsey, an Indiana University zoologist, shocked
the world with the publication of  what came to be known as the
Kinsey Report.  A companion volume on females was published in
1953.
<P>
Both books ignited a controversy that persists to this day.  Both
paint a picture of people of all ages awash in secret sexual experimentation.
 The Kinsey Reports formed the &quot;scientific&quot; basis of
Hugh Hefner's destructive Playboy Philosophy, which brought pornography,
adultery, pre-marital and homosexual sex into the American mainstream.

<P>
But the most disturbing element of the Kinsey Reports is the overlooked
chapter in the male volume entitled &quot;Early Sexual Growth
and Activity.&quot;   Featuring charts in which &quot;trained
persons&quot; measured incidences of &quot;orgasm&quot; in children
as young as two months, the Kinsey child sex material contains
the seeds of a growing cultural movement to regard children as
not only sexually viable but entitled to sex with adults.  
<P>
In 1981, Dr. Judith Reisman delivered a paper on the Kinsey child
sexuality data at the Fifth World Congress of Sexuality in Jerusalem.
 Nine years later, Dr. Reisman, along with sex therapist Edward
W. Eichel,  research physician Dr. J. Gordon Muir and psychologist
Dr. John Court wrote <U>Kinsey, Sex and Fraud: The Indoctrination
of a People</U>.   The authors, according to the British medical
journal <I>The Lancet</I>, &quot;demolish the foundations of the
two [Kinsey] reports.&quot;   They also expose the foundation
of the Kinsey philosophy, which views all sexual acts as essentially
equal &quot;outlets.&quot;  To Kinsey, the sex between a husband
and wife is no different morally, physically or socially from
that of  sex between the same genders, between children and adults,
or even between humans and animals.  
<P>
And to Kinsey, age is not much of a factor.  In the Female volume,
he remarks, &quot; It is difficult to understand why a child,
except for its cultural conditioning, should be disturbed at having
its genitalia touched.&quot; 
<P>
 
<P>
Since the Kinsey books remain the most influential works in the
study of sex, their philosophy has spilled over, first to academia,
then to the larger culture.  Kinsey disciples went on to found
the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States
(SIECUS), which peddles the Kinsey philosophy in its sex education
materials.  In 1980, SIECUS co-founder Mary Calderone told the
Association of Planned Parenthood Physicians that SIECUS' primary
mission was to educate society &quot;very broadly and deeply with
awareness of the vital importance of infant and childhood sexuality.&quot;
 SIECUS President Debra Haffner has even envisioned a &quot;national
petting project,&quot; in which young teens are taught how to
stimulate each other sexually -- without having intercourse. 
With such novel approaches, SIECUS recently snagged a major federal
grant from the Clinton Administration to evaluate all sex education
programs in the United States.  
<P>
In 1991, <I>Child</I> magazine featured an article by then-Kinsey
Institute President June Reinisch called &quot;Sensuality and
Kids.&quot;  Reinisch counsels parents to foster sex play and
masturbation among children because it &quot;develops self-esteem&quot;
and for which some children &quot;use to relax and get ready for
sleep.&quot;  In the same vein, former Surgeon General Joycelyn
Elders advocated teaching children to masturbate. 
<P>
Other signs that the Kinsey philosophy is destroying cultural
protections for children abound:
<UL>
<LI>The American Psychiatric Association's latest <U>Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual</U> has redefined pedophilia so that a
person who molests children is no longer a &quot;pedophile&quot;
unless he feels bad or anxious about what he is doing.   The &quot;stress&quot;
triggered by feeling bad is now considered the marker for a paraphilic
disorder.  So a well-adjusted molester is okay because he feels
okay about what he does.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>In <I>The New Republic</I>, the mainstream liberal political
weekly, Hanna Rosin offers a defense of the pro-pedophile North
American Man-Boy Love Association in a recent review of the documentary
film <I>Chickenhawks</I>.  Regarding sex between boys and men,
she asks, &quot;is the idea of mutual consent so absurd?&quot;
 Then she quotes a NAMBLA member who advocates treating children
&quot;in a different way.&quot;  Rosin's comment:  &quot;Certainly
a self-serving view, but still plausibly on the continuum of,
say, a defense of children's legal autonomy.&quot; 
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>The New York Times </I>devoted several pages in its Sunday
magazine last year to Sally Mann's &quot;provocative&quot; nude
photos of her own children.  This week, incidentally, the Times'
fashion supplement includes a MAC Viva Glam lipstick ad with a
spread-legged crotch shot of a leather-stockinged Ru Paul, the
transvestite. The paper still carries this phrase on its banner:
 &quot;All the news that's fit to print.&quot;
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Movies and television increasingly portray children as sexual
actors.  In the 1994 film <I>Milk Money</I>, for example, young
boys watch and sell pornographic videos and pool their milk money
to buy the services of a prostitute.  In the film <I>Blank Check</I>,
a preadolescent boy schemes to have sex with a woman twice his
age. A Disney affiliate, Miramax,  has released an NC-17 film,
<I>Kids</I>, which shows young teens indulging in indiscriminate
sex and drug-taking.  The film's makers frankly admit that their
work is perverse, and that its gritty tone might offend some people.
 Precisely.  And have you noticed how often young children now
emit vulgarities and obscenities, even in &quot;family films?&quot;
</UL>
<P>
As for Calvin Klein, the designer rebukes the charges against
his filthy ads, saying that he was not intending a pornographic
message.  Klein says that &quot;some people are taking away a
different perception&quot; of the ads than the &quot;intended
message.&quot;   Coming from the man who began high-fashion kiddie
porn back in 1980 when he had 15-year-old Brooke Shields say suggestively
that &quot;nothing&quot; came between her and her Calvins, this
does not pass the straight face test.  He is lying, or is so personally
corrupt that he is unable to recognize the depravity of his own
message.  In a full-page ad in <I>The New York Times</I>, Klein
defended the ads, describing their &quot;positive message&quot;
as &quot;that young people today, the most media savvy generation
yet, have a real strength of character and independence.  They
have very strongly defined lines of what they will and will not
do -- and have a great ability to know who they are and who they
want to be.&quot;  Pretty rhetoric, and very similar to that employed
 by the North American Man-Boy Love Association, which contends
that children ought to be &quot;independent&quot; and &quot;make
their own decisions&quot; about having sex with adults.  The nice
men at NAMBLA want to &quot;empower&quot; children.  Talk about
&quot;the Hurried Child.&quot;   The child-sex movement is all
too eager to &quot;free&quot; children from the constraints of
their parents' morality.
<P>
Certain features of the Klein photo ads scream of child pornography.
 The off-color carpet and wood paneling suggest a basement room
-- child molesters often use the seclusion and privacy of a basement
to photograph their victims.  The blonde girl in the ad has a
frightened look on her face, and her hand is raised to her mouth,
where her lips appear slightly blue.  When children are sodomized,
they are often left bruised. 
<P>
Between Alfred Kinsey, Calvin Klein, and their disciples in Hollywood,
the entire nation is getting bruised -- beginning with our children.

National Center for Policy Analysis 
Saving the Medicare System with Medical Savings Accounts 
September 15, 1995
</center><p>
 
Earlier this year, the National Center for Policy Analysis addressed 
the Medicare financing crisis with a proposal similar to the one now 
being considered by the Republican leadership in Congress.  Under this 
plan, the elderly would be given a voucher allowing them to obtain 
coverage from a full range of private sector options, including a 
Health Maintenance Organization (HMO).  However, the most interesting 
option would be catastrophic insurance paired with a Medical Savings 
Account (MSA).  
<p>
Patient power through Medical Savings Accounts.  
 Under the MSA alternative, the elderly would have catastrophic 
insurance plus a Medical Savings Account.  They would control more of 
their own health care dollars without answering to a health care 
bureaucracy and would likely become more value-conscious shoppers in 
the health care marketplace.  
<p>
What could private insurers do with voucher money?  Milliman & 
Robertson analyzed the cost of high-deductible policies with and 
without a managed care element for Medicare beneficiaries and 
estimated the amount of money that would remain for the MSA.  
According to the analysis:

<p>Without managed care, private insurers could put about $1,500 in a 
Medical Savings Account for each beneficiary and the insurance policy 
would pay for all expenses above $3,000.
<p>
With managed care, private insurers could put about $2,100 in a 
Medical Savings Account and pay for all medical bills above $3,000. 
[See Figure I.]
<p>
Protection against health care costs. 
 One problem with the current Medicare system is that it leaves 
seniors exposed to thousands of dollars in catastrophic health care 
expenses.  By contrast, the MSA plan would allow beneficiaries to 
obtain real catastrophic insurance.
<p>
For example, more than 418,000 Medicare beneficiaries currently pay 
more than $5,000 out of pocket every year.  Under the plan illustrated 
in Figure I, their out-of-pocket expenses could not exceed about $900 
in 1996.
<p>
Cash refunds for being prudent purchasers of care.  Under the current 
Medicare system, if a patient does something to eliminate waste, the 
benefit of that action goes to the government.  But under the MSA 
option, elderly patients who make wise and frugal choices would 
realize financial benefits.  They would keep any money they had not 
spent at the end of each year.  Thus, Medicare beneficiaries would 
receive up to $2,100 a year in cash.
<p>
Coverage for prescription drugs and other services.  Under the current 
system, Medicare does not pay for most prescription drugs and this 
leaves the elderly at risk for limitless pharmaceutical expenses.  But 
under the MSA plan, beneficiaries could have coverage for services not 
currently covered by Medicare by accepting a modest decrease in their 
MSA balance.  For example, the voucher plan would allow private 
insurers to extend coverage to drugs and other items.  Instead of a 
$2,100 MSA deposit, people could have drug coverage and receive a 
Medical Savings Account deposit of about $1,500. 
<p>
Meeting the congressional budget goals without any loss of benefits.  
A peer-reviewed analysis by Milliman & Robert-son demonstrates that 
this proposal for reforming Medicare could save $270 billion over the 
next seven years, and that Medicare beneficiaries would get more - not 
less - protection against health care costs.  Specifically, a voucher 
plan allowing the elderly to switch from Medicare to Medical Savings 
Accounts and catastrophic health insurance would save as much as $195 
billion without any other changes.
<p>
Extending the program to the disabled and making modest reductions in 
the amount of the voucher would save an additional $40 billion.  
<p>
Such options as means-testing benefits by requiring the highest-income 
elderly to pay higher premiums or increasing the age of eligibility 
(currently 65) by one month per year would save at least $30 billion 
more.  
<p>
More savings and an economic boost. 
<p> Currently, Medicare costs are growing faster than private sector 
health care costs, causing medical inflation for everyone.  [See 
Figure II.]  Less health care spending by the elderly would ease the 
pressure on all medical prices and slow the rate of increase in health 
spending.  Using the National Center for Policy Analysis/Fiscal 
Associates Health Care Model, the NCPA finds that by the year 2005, 
Medicare spending would be 18 percent lower than currently projected 
spending, and total U.S. health care costs would be 8.7 percent lower.  
Spending on all health care would decrease by $186 billion and the 
output of other goods and services would increase by $241 billion.
<p>
Best news of all:  seniors would benefit.  This MSA plan is better 
than traditional Medicare in at least five ways:
<p>
<ul><li>The plan provides full coverage for expenses over the deductible, 
while Medicare leaves seniors exposed to catastrophic expenses that 
could devastate their savings.  
<p>
<li>With the MSA, out-of-pocket exposure could be virtually eliminated 
by encouraging the 70 percent of the elderly now paying for private 
Medigap insurance to contribute their Medigap premiums (about $1,200 
per year) to their MSA.
<p>
<li>The MSA funds could be used to pay for health expenses such as 
prescription drugs, which are not covered by Medicare.
<p>
<li>At the end of the year, the beneficiaries could withdraw and spend 
their remaining MSA funds for any purpose, thus sharing directly in 
the reward for keeping Medicare costs down.
<p>
<li>People with MSAs plus catastrophic insurance would be free from 
Medicare rationing restrictions and from concerns about quality of and 
access to care.

This Brief Analysis was prepared by NCPA President John Goodman, 
Senior Fellow Peter Ferrara and Health Policy Director Merrill 
Matthews Jr.  
<p>
Institute Description
<p>
The National Center for Policy Analysis is a nonprofit, nonpartisan 
public policy research institute founded in 1983 and internationally 
known for its studies on public policy issues. It draws on an 
international network of academic advisors, including several Nobel 
Prize winners, to address the most critical policy issues in the 
world. Additionally, the NCPA has several policy experts readily 
available for media inquiries.
<p>
The Center concentrates on health care, tax and environmental issues. 
It is probably best known in the U.S. for its work on tax policy and 
health policy. The NCPA is the only private sector organization that 
prepares a formal forecast of every major bill before Congress. The 
NCPA's concept of Medical Savings Accounts has been endorsed by more 
than 150 members of Congress as the alternative to the Clinton health 
reform plan. And, the NCPA's task force report on pro-free-enterprise 
approaches to environmental problems is being republished in countries 
around the world.
<p>
The NCPA was founded by John C. Goodman, an economist who serves as 
its president, and the late Sir Anthony Fisher. It's primary goal is 
to, "discover and promote private alternatives to government 
regulations and control, solving problems by relying on the strengths 
of the competitive, entrepreneurial private sector."

<hr><br>
In 1984, the Under Secretary of Education, Gary Bauer, released a report, Disorder in Our Public Schools, which highlighted the problem of school discipline with these startling facts:<br>
<ul>
<li>Teachers spent 30 to 80 percent of their time on discipline. <p>
<li>Half of all teachers felt misbehavior interfered with teaching to a "moderate or greater extent."<p>
<li>Three million high school students were victims of in-school crimes each month.<p>
<li>Eight percent of high school students missed at least one day each month because they were afraid of violence.<p>
<li>Four out of every 10 high school students had been a crime victim the previous year.<p>
<li>Each month 1,000 teachers re
Required medical attention because of in-school assaults 
and 125,000 were threatened.</ul><p>

Today, ten years after the Bauer report, the problems are worse.  America's schools are battlegrounds where children are too often physically harmed and deprived of a good education.  Teachers are more at risk than ever before.  Consider some recent examples of school violence.

<ul>
<li>A St. Louis student, 14, was stabbed at school.<p>
<li>An Atlanta student, 12, was shot at school by a friend showing off a stolen gun.<p>
<li>A 5-year-old and two 7-year-olds were suspended from school in Rockville, Maryland for bringing knives to school.<p>
<li>A 15-year-old fatally shot a schoolmate in a Los Angeles school.<p>
<li>A 14-year-old seventh grader was arrested in Wichita, Kansas after a pistol was found in his school locker.<p>
<li>Two Denver, Colorado high school students detonated a pipe bomb outside their school.<p>
<li>A New York City student was shot during a school basketball game.<p>
<li>The 1994 National Teacher of the Year helped her California students hide weapons "so they won't get killed after school."<p>
<li> A Maryland teacher caught a student with a pistol inside a school restroom.  The student shot the teacher.<p>
<li>A Dartmouth, Massachusetts high school student was knifed and clubbed to death during a government class.<p>
<li> An Atlanta student opened fire in a crowded school cafeteria, killing one student and wounding another.<p>
</ul>Violence at school is worse today than ten years ago.  The growing epidemic of school violence frightens children and their parents, undermines the education process, and threatens the future competitiveness of this country.  <p>

The school violence epidemic is rooted in larger societal problems.  Consider the current school violence trend, its impact on the education environment, an analysis of the changed nature of school violence, and the roots of the problem.<p>

<h3><center><a name="trend">SCHOOL VIOLENCE TREND</a></center></h3>

Michael Resnick, spokesman for the National School Boards Association (NSBA) states, "Just as the incidences of violence are increasing, so is the severity of the violence, so that this is becoming a much more serious problem in terms of numbers, location, and severity."<p>
School Superintendent Octavio Vistedof for Dade County, Florida, states, "There are children that witness more violence on their way to school on any given day than we as adults have witnessed in a lifetime, and yet we expect that child to come in and be, you know, summa cum laude and basically go in and graduate with honors.  It doesn't work that way."<p>
An NSBA survey shows that violence has increased each year over the last five years in 82 percent of the nation's school systems.<p>
The growing problem is especially felt by students.  The Institute for Social Research reports that 91.6 percent of high school seniors worry about crime and violence, and their greatest concern is drug abuse (77.8 percent).  Black female students from the South are the most likely to be worried.<p>
The indicators of school violence are everywhere.  For example, a recent Gallup poll found that in the past year one teen in five had a friend who was attacked by someone who was wielding a knife or gun, seven percent had been assaulted, 14 percent had their property vandalized, and 24 percent lived in a state of fear at school.<p>
Nearly 135,000 guns are brought into schools every day.19  About three million crimes occur on or near school property each year.20  Nearly a fifth of schools report student-on-teacher assaults.  And illegal drugs are available in at least 70 percent of our schools.<p>
The rising incidences of school violence also affect student views about law enforcement.  For example, at the time of Mr. Bauer's report, 36.9 percent of high school seniors had a positive attitude toward the performance of local police, but in 1992 confidence had declined to 26.9 percent.  It is especially low (12.4 percent) among black students.<p>
<center><h3><a name="impact">IMPACT OF VIOLENCE IN THE CLASSROOM</a></h3></center>
The 1984 Bauer report linked effective learning with a disciplined school environment.  Metropolitan Life Chairman Harry P. Kamen announced a recent nationwide public education survey which said that violence is so roiling the waters of public education that students cannot learn and teachers cannot teach.<p>
Kenneth Trump, coordinator of the Youth Gang Unit for the Cleveland Public Schools, states: "Besides the obvious physical harm caused by assaults and fights, the psychological impact to both staff and students can be damaging.  Students who are victims of school crimes or who perceive the school environment to be unsafe may not attend regularly and may not adequately concentrate on classwork when they do attend."  The National Education Goals Report found that in 1992 seven percent of 8th graders reported staying home from school at least once during the previous month because of concerns for their physical safety.<p>
Moreover, "teachers are not able to focus their efforts on instruction if they are preoccupied with disruptions and altercations.  Additionally, prolonged work in such environments is likely to increase teacher stress and reduce their overall classroom effectiveness."  The National Education Goals report shows that teachers were more often subject to physical and verbal abuse and in cities they tend to feel unsafe in their buildings after school hours.<p>
American Federation of Teachers President Albert Shanker explains, "The thread that ties this mixed bag of findings together is that, across the board, real or feared violence and a quality education are recognized as incompatible.  Schools have a primary mission -- to provide high standards, a challenging academic experience and maximum achievement for all students, but it won't work when the specter of violence is afoot.  The daunting effort to improve academic achievement is undermined every time a teacher is confronted by threatened or perpetrated trauma in the classroom or on school grounds, every time a student is afraid to go to school, and every time a parent neglects to set a good example at home."<p>
<h3><a name="nature">NATURE OF SCHOOL VIOLENCE</a></h3>
Dissecting school violence requires an examination of the types and frequency of violent incidents, a profile of the victims and offenders, and a profile of the crime sites.  

<h4><a name="frequency">TYPES AND FREQUENCY OF VIOLENT INCIDENTS</a></h4>

The Justice Department found that two percent of students reported experiencing one or more violent crimes and seven percent reported at least one property crime during the first half of 1989.29  The most common types of violence involved were simple assaults: pushing, shoving, grabbing, and slapping.  But more students than ever before brought weapons, including guns, to school.<p>

A Louis Harris poll found that 19 percent of central city schoolchildren report having had a physical fight in the past year and nine percent of suburban children have been suspended for the same reason.  A parallel finding shows that 32 percent of central city students have been physically threatened in the past month, compared to 29 percent in the suburbs.<p>
There are an estimated 71 weapon-carrying incidents per 100 students per month.  Typically boys carry weapons four times more often than girls, and the incidents are more common among Hispanic boys.  The weapon of choice is a knife or razor (55.2%) with the second choice being a club (24%).<p>
The National Education Goals Report found that in 1992 nine percent of 8th graders, 10 percent of 10th graders, and six percent of 12th graders reported they had brought a weapon to school at least once during the previous month.  A significant percentage frequently carried weapons to school.<p>
A Gallup poll found that weapon-toting students tend to use their weapons to settle disputes.  Twenty-one percent of students said they had been attacked with a knife or gun and, overall, assaults were reported by 63 percent of students. The poll found that nine percent of the students labeled weapons at school as a "very big problem."<p>
Guns at school are a special problem given their lethality.  A 1993 Louis Harris poll found that 11 percent of schoolchildren had been shot at by a gun in the past year, and 39 percent know someone personally who has either been killed or injured from gunfire.  Children enrolled in private and parochial schools "say they know how to get a gun than do those who go to public schools." <p>
A Justice Department report found that one in five suburban high school boys owns a gun, and that 45 percent of these boys have been threatened with a gun or shot at on the way to or from school during the previous few years.  Half of these boys said that they have friends who routinely carry a gun. <p>
<h4><a name="victims">WHO ARE THE VICTIMS AND OFFENDERS?</a></h4>
A 1993 Metropolitan Life survey, "Violence in America's Public Schools," found that 23 percent of students and 11 percent of teachers have been victims of violence in and around school.  MetLife reports that boys are twice as likely (30%) as girls (16%) to be victims of violence.<p>
The Justice Department found that public school students (9%) are more likely to be crime victims than private school students (7%).  Black and Hispanic students are more likely than white students to be victims of violent acts at school involving weapons.  Age, family income, and frequency of family moves were predictors of victimization: younger kids were more likely to be victims; students from homes with annual incomes of $50,000 or more were likely to be victims; and students from families that had moved three or more times in the last five years were crime victims twice as often as students who had not moved.<p>
Without factoring in age, family income and frequency of moves, teenagers from single-parent families are more likely to be violent crime victims than teens from two-parent intact families.  The statistics are the same whether the single parent is a mother or father.<p>
Fear of victimization varies by school location, type of school, and mode of transport to school.  For example, public school students (22%) are more likely than private school students (13%) to be fearful of attack at school.  Public school students are twice as likely as private school students to avoid certain areas at school.  And students who travel to school by car are the least likely to fear attack.<p>

Wesley Mitchell, commander of the Los Angeles Unified School District police, said, "Schools are feeling the outgrowth and the experiences of the larger community." This is especially true with regards to the violent student offenders.  Children bring to school the problems they have at home and in the community.<p>
A Washington State survey found that the more a student uses alcohol and other drugs or reports a history of physical or sexual abuse, the more likely he is to carry a weapon to school or to have been in a fight in the past year that resulted in injuries which required medical attention.  Boys (32%) are far more likely than girls (15%) to carry a weapon to school.  Hispanic (41.1%) and black (39.4%) male students are more likely to carry a weapon than white (28.6%) male students.<p>
Gangs promote violence in schools and, according to the Justice Department, 15 percent of schools have violence-prone gangs and 12 percent said gang members fought once or twice a week or even every day.  Students in central cities are more likely to report gangs at their schools (25%) than suburban students (8%), and black and Hispanic students (20% and 32%) say their schools have gangs more often than white (20%) students.Most (78%) students from schools with gangs report that a student can obtain drugs at school compared to 66 percent of students in schools without gangs.<p>
<h4><a name="where">WHERE DOES SCHOOL VIOLENCE TAKE PLACE?</a></h4>

The Justice Department explains in "Teenage Victims" that the likelihood of becoming a crime victim in a particular location is influenced by the amount of time spent in one location relative to another.  That's why schools, according to the Justice Department, are prime locations for teen crime.<p>
Teachers say that most acts of student violence take place in or around school.  Students are, however, less certain.  Police officials say that student violence is equally evident inside, outside, and in the school neighborhood.<p>
Teachers told Louis Harris that 64 percent of in-school violence takes place in the hallways or stairways, 16 percent in lunchrooms, 12 percent in the classrooms, and 15 percent in bathrooms.  Students believe more violence takes place in the classroom and athletic areas than teachers report.<p>
The Justice Department reports that six percent of students avoid some place in or around their school because of the potential that someone might attack them.  School restrooms were listed most often as a place to avoid and hallways were second. More than two-thirds of students don't feel completely safe going to and from school.
<h3><center><a name="what">WHAT IS BEING DONE TO CURB THE VIOLENCE?</a></h3></center>
School authorities are trying virtually anything that might curb the violence.  There are programs to help parents to reduce family violence.  There are groups who seek to reduce violence in television and music lyrics.<p>
<ul>
<li> NSBA surveyed school districts to determine the most common anti-violence strategies.  It found that suspension is used 78 percent of the time.  Other strategies include: expulsion (72%), locker searches (50%), security personnel in schools (36%), gun-free school zones (31%), metal detectors (15%), dress code (41%), and volunteer parent patrols (13%).<p>
<li> Orange County, Florida started a program that includes conflict resolution, peer mediation, and support groups. The S.A.F.E. program (Student Assistance and Family Empowerment) includes five students from each grade who are trained to offer mediation for students in conflict.<p>
<li> New York City public schools have S.T.A.R. (Straight Talk About Risks) which is designed to help students avoid crime.  The program teaches protective skills needed to avoid threatening situations with guns.<p>
<li> A Dayton, Ohio, program promotes character education, inculcating values like honesty, responsibility, courage, and loyalty.<p>
<li> Duval County, Florida uses local policemen to patrol schools and Denver, Colorado, has a special school security force.  A school in Tucson, Arizona built an eight-foot fence around the parking lot in response to a drive-by shooting.  In San Diego, California, schools recently removed all lockers to reduce hiding places for contraband.<p>
While some schools are on the offensive, trying to stem classroom violence, a recent Department of Justice study found that some of these anti-crime efforts don't make a significant difference.  For example, schools using hall monitors or patrols suffered the same incidence of violence as schools which didn't have these programs.  And students in schools with these programs were more likely to fear an attack than those attending schools without monitors and patrols.<p>
Even more troubling, an American Association of School Administrators report finds that some schools consciously and actively play down the incidence of violence.  This is done to avoid bad publicity, to avoid litigation, out of fear they will be regarded as ineffective, and to avoid being labeled as poor leaders.  Teachers under-reported crime and violence because they wanted to avoid litigation, had difficulty identifying the offender, and did not wish to stigmatize young offenders.<p>
The National School Safety Center recommends an action plan to achieve safe schools.  The plan includes:  assigning responsibility for developing a plan; consulting an attorney who knows education law, analyzing the nature and scope of the problem, identifying and implementing measures to fight the problem, establishing procedures for school employees, conducting regular in-service training for staff on school crime and violence, establishing procedures for students and parents to make suggestions, developing an effective relationship with local law enforcement and court officials, sharing information with other schools, and regularly evaluating programs.<p>
In spite of considerable expenditure of money and effort to curb the epidemic of school violence, no school district has yet declared victory.<p>
Parents are looking for safe schools and are expressing their displeasure with their feet and pocketbooks.  They walking out of public schools with their children and placing them in "safer" private institutions.  The number of private school students has grown from 2.4 million in 1981 to more than 3.3 million last year.  In addition, more than 700,000 children are now schooled at home.  This move comes at great cost to parents because the average private school tuition is $6,400 annually.  <p>
A decade ago parents considered discipline a very important factor in choosing their children's school.  Mr. Bauer's study found that 85.6 percent of public school parents and 87.1 percent of private school parents considered discipline when choosing a school.<p>

Today, a vast majority of parents (84%) believe that "problems affecting children have grown worse."  A larger majority (92%) of parents feel that there is "more violence in the schools [today] than when they were growing up."  Because they are concerned for the physical safety of their children due to the widespread availability of guns and the resulting violence, they are taking action to protect them.<p>

A May 1994 nationwide poll commissioned by the Family Research Council found that 83 percent of Americans favor giving parents the right to select the safest available school for their children.  This overwhelming support for school choice demonstrates that school safety is an important issue for parents.<p>
<h3><center><a name="root">THE ROOT OF SCHOOL VIOLENCE</a></h3></center>
The American Federation of Teachers captured the essence of the problem when it stated, "Discipline problems both cause and are caused by a growing gap between school and home.  They are exacerbated by faulty public school policies framed by students' rights advocates who have been so preoccupied with protecting the difficult child that they have failed to consider the rights of the average child to learn in a disciplined, structured place."<p>
Unfortunately, a minority of disruptive and too often violent students are spoiling the system for children, who, if given a fighting chance, would succeed.<p>

Deborah Prothrow-Stith, a public health official and author of <u><i>Deadly Consequence</i>s</u>, stated, "[i]f all the children born in America learned at home how to manage anger and aggression non-violently, our homicide and assault rates would decline by 50 percent -- maybe even 75 percent."<p>
<h3><center><a name="conclusion">CONCLUSION</a></center></h3>
Violence is a problem that begins at home and spreads to the community.  Much of the increase in violence in this country and in the schools is due to "changing family situations."  These changes include a lack of parental caring and supervision, lack of discipline on the part of parents, lack of parental concern regarding student behavior and student whereabouts, poor family discipline, and a lack of connectedness with an extended family.<p>

Many children experience difficulty in school because they are emotionally incapacitated by the explosive drama at home.  This is especially true for a growing segment of students from single-parent families.  These children are two to three times as likely as children in two-parent families to have emotional and behavioral problems: they drop out of high school more often, get pregnant as teenagers, abuse drugs, and more often get into trouble with the law.  And most single-parent families are headed by mothers who cannot provide the paternal direction young boys desperately need.<p>
According to Charles Murray, a Bradley Fellow at the American Enterprise Institute, the growing number of fatherless boys creates a "Lord of the Flies" culture evidenced by widespread physical violence, immediate gratification, and predatory sex.  These problems are all-too-evident in America's schools today.<p>
Parents must take responsibility for the rearing of their children and support teachers who need a disciplined classroom to teach.  If parents do their job, then the teacher finds creating a good learning environment easier.<p>
Mary Bruce, a spokeswoman for the Federation of Women's Teachers Associations of Ontario, says teachers must begin early.  She states, "The guns and knives at secondary school get all the attention, but those violent acts were born years earlier in elementary school."<p>
Her observation rings true for many teachers.  Children cultivate a proclivity for violence during the elementary school years and too often those schools tolerate misbehavior which grows more violent with time.  Children need to understand what is acceptable behavior and school authorities need the authority to create a positive learning environment which gives each child the opportunity to learn without fear of verbal and physical intimidation and assault.<p>

Ten years ago, the U.S. Education Department warned the nation that the classroom was seriously handicapped by violence.  The problem is worse today.  School administrators, teachers, law enforcement officials, parents, and teachers must work together to reclaim the classroom for education.  Building well-disciplined schools begins with parents taking responsibility for rearing their children to respect one another and other adults, and it takes school policies which facilitate a climate of discipline.  This combination will promote learning and protect children during their formative years.<p>

The institutionalization of "family life" or sex education classes in public and private schools around the country has created a demand for curricula on the subject.  Unfortunately, the broad reach of organizations such as Planned Parenthood and SIECUS have left many school boards and parents thinking that there is no alternative except to teach "safe sex."  But there is an alternative that has shown to be even more effective than "safe sex" in reducing teen pregnancy and sexually-transmitted diseases -- Abstinence.  This paper is designed to help concerned school board members and parents choose a solid abstinence curriculum.<p>
<CENTER>
<h3><a name="abstinence">WHY ABSTINENCE EDUCATION?</a></h3><br></center>

Abstinence is the only strategy for preventing teenage pregnancy and sexually-transmitted diseases that is 100 percent effective.  According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, it is "the most effective solution" to unwanted pregnancy and sexual disease.<p>

Given the effectiveness of abstinence, a number of states--including Texas, California, Washington, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Indiana-- have passed laws in recent years stipulating that public school sex education programs be abstinence-based. Many of these programs have produced promising results:
<p>
 <ul><li> 	San Marcos Junior High in San Marcos, California, adopted an abstinence-only curriculum developed by Teen-Aid, Inc., titled Sexuality, Commitment, and Family.  The year before the curriculum was implemented, 147 girls were reported pregnant.  But two years after the program's adoption, only 20 girls became pregnant.<br><br>
<li>Historically, the eighth-grade class at Nathan Hale Middle School in the Chicago suburb of Crestwood included a number of already pregnant girls.  When the school decided to adopt an abstinence program for the kids, many adults were skeptical.  But after three years of quality sessions with the abstinence program <i>Project Taking Charge</i>, the school graduated three pregnancy-free classes in a row.<br><br>
<li>In the Washington, D.C. chapter of "Best Friends," only one out of 400 girls has become pregnant since the program began.  Elayne Bennett, director of "Best Friends," says that between 20 and 70 pregnancies are common for the same sized group of fifth- to ninth-grade girls in the District of Columbia.  One "Best Friends" member explains, "I want to 												
	save my virginity for the man I marry....And I want my child to have a daddy."<br><br>
<li>An evaluation of the abstinence-based program Sex Respect:  <i>The Option of True Sexual Freedom</i> found that students participating in the program had considerably lower pregnancy rates than those in a comparison group.  Five percent of the female program participants and nine percent of the non-program students became pregnant in the two years following the program.<br><br>
<li>Emory University's abstinence-only curriculum, <i>Postponing Sexual Involvement</i>, teaches kids about abstinence through skill-building exercises on "how to say no."  An evaluation of the program showed that its participants were less likely to become sexually active than those not involved in the program.<br><br>
<li><i>AANCHOR</i>, an alternative national curriculum on responsibility, stresses the importance of family involvement and individual responsibility to prevent adolescent pregnancy.  An evaluation of the curriculum found three statistically significant differences between students receiving the AANCHOR curriculum and students receiving the standard school curriculum.  The students participating in AANCHOR were significantly more likely to report (1) higher family strengths, i.e., loyalty, emotional support, cohesion, (2) greater discussions with parents about sexual values and beliefs, and (3) more abstinent attitudes regarding premarital sexual involvement.<br><br>
<li>Students who participated in the abstinence-based <i>FACTS</i> curriculum showed significant pre-post effects occurring on the measures of (1) affirmation of abstinence, (2) rejection of permissiveness, and (3) future orientation and peer support for abstinence.  These attitudinal data are important indicators of delaying sexual activity.<br><br>
</ul>
<h3><center><a name="choose">HOW TO CHOOSE A GOOD ABSTINENCE CURRICULUM</a></h3></center>
In order to choose an appropriate abstinence curriculum, parents and school board members should study curricula for their focus, methodologies, and content.<p>

<h4><a name="focus">Focus of Curricula:</a></h4>  The growing interest in abstinence curriculum has caused many contraception programs to frame themselves as "abstinence-based," "abstinence-plus" or "comprehensive" because they mention abstinence as one of several options.  Such programs, however, communicate a mixed message to students which thereby tremendously weakens the abstinence message.  Some common characteristics of these "comprehensive" or "abstinence-plus" programs are that they (1) assume that teenagers are inevitably sexually active, (2) emphasize contraception and abortion, and (3) include affective decision-making (presenting abstinence one of many options from which to choose).  Thus, parents and school boards should choose a curriculum that avoids these danger points, and instead, upholds abstinence as the way to handle teen sex issues.<p>


<h4><a name="methodology">Methodology of Curricula:</a></h4>  The method used to deliver sex education material heavily influences the way students will respond to the abstinence message.  Effective abstinence programs are directive in their approach.  Dr. Onalee McGraw provides a comparative analysis of competing delivery models of sex education in her book <u>Foundations for Family Life Education</u>:<p>

abstinent values.
<p></pre>
Directive abstinence education emphasizes the importance of values and attitudes, which is consistent with a U.S. Department of Education study, "The Role of Responsibility and Knowledge in Reducing Teenage Out-of-Wedlock Childbearing," which found that "adolescents with strong feelings of control over their lives, with higher educational expectations, and with parents who show concern and have higher educational expectations for their daughters have lower chances of experiencing teenage childbirth." <p>

Furthermore, students want help in saying "no" to sexual activity.  When Emory University surveyed 1,000 sexually active girls and asked them what they would most like to learn to reduce teen pregnancy, 84 percent responded, "How to say no without hurting the other person's feelings."   Moreover, a recent study done by Roper Starch in association with the Sexuality Information and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS) found that, of the teens who have had sex, 54 percent wish they would have waited until they were older to have sex. 

<p>
<h4><a name="content">Content of Curricula:</a></h4>  Sex education curricula vary greatlt by content , and parents should be particuarly concerned if the curriculum contains information or pictures too explicit for the intended audience. Caution is recommended even in cases in which  a particular sex education curriculum is widely used or endorsed by prominent organizations. For Example:
<br>
<ul>
<li>The two-million member National Education Association (NEA) endorses sex education programs that promote birth control and homosexuality.<br><br><p>
<li>The influential Sex Information and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS) has published a widely used set of goals for sex education curricula entitled, "<i>Guidelines for Comprehensive Sexuality Education:  Kindergarten - 12th Grade</i>.  The report promotes abortion, unmarried couples living together, and homosexual relationships as equal to heterosexual relationships.<br><br><p>

<h2><center>	EDUCATION, TECHNOLOGY <br>
	AND THE FAMILY</h2>
	<h4><i>by<br>

<hr size="3" width="30%"><br>

For someone who comes to you from a conservative organization, I have a somewhat radical speech to make.  I think that society is making more radical demands on education than most education professionals, and even education reformers, have yet admitted; and also that, paradoxically, these radical demands will actually add up to a good deal for the traditional family.<p>

One way to find out what demands society is making on education would be to listen to what leaders in the fields of business, education, and government are saying and then try to draw some general themes from their remarks.  You would hear, I think, a great deal about competitiveness, but also a great deal about something called diversity.  I suspect you would find that the back-to-basics movement of the early 1980s has faded, and that the world of the experts is presently divided between those who want schools to be vocational training centers for high-tech shop floors, and those who want them to be desensitization centers for initiating kids into what New York State Senator John Marchi calls "Manhattan attitudes."<p>

Actually, both those camps are missing the point, because both are working from assumptions based on educational centralism.  They think of education as a centralized function, in which a uniform product, determined by the education elite, is doled out to receptive and malleable pupils, as if on an assembly line.  I think society may be moving in a different direction than that.<p>

Commendably, there are some education reform proposals out there that are more radical.  Much of the rhetoric of these movements involves the need to, as they say, "break the mold."  One type of break-the-mold reform is exemplified by businessman Chris Whittle, and his project to create a network of low-cost, for-profit private schools.  This idea is mold-breaking, in the sense that it asks us to get past the long-held assumption that schools must be non-profit, and instead, to consider the possible role that the profit motive could play in securing good schools, just as it secures good consumer electronics.  On the other hand, while Mr. Whittle's idea breaks some molds, it <i>does </i>not break all.  It still conceives of education as a process that an elite does to a passive student body.  <p>

Another type of reform proposal is parental choice.  This movement originated with liberal sociologists in the '60s, and it was carried forward by conservatives 
in the 1980s.  The liberals who promoted it, such as Christopher Jencks, did so because it would promote equality.  Conservatives, on the other hand, liked it 
because it would empower families and disempower the state.  Opposition came, of course, from the organized interests who are dependent in one way or another on the existing public school quasi-monopoly.  Today, despite occasional setbacks, the choice movement appears to be gaining steam, with a coalition of supporters that is very diverse, both racially and ideologically.<p>

The parental choice movement is mold-breaking, because it questions the existing power structure in elementary and secondary education, and it deconstructs the authority-claims advanced by the education elites.  It also breaks molds by seeking to bring real accountability into public education for perhaps the first time since before Horace Mann.  Of all the organized education reform movements, the school choice movement is the most radical.  Yet even this movement declines to question the most deeply-held assumption of all -- that school is something you "go to" in order to "get ready," rather than something you do all your life.<p>

And yet, so radical are the changes taking place in our society, and most particularly in our technology, that some very basic assumptions may be coming into question: the assumption that school is something you "go to," entirely apart from both home life and professional life, and the assumption that the acquisition of education requires the services of an elite specially trained for that purpose.  <p>

A theory along these lines has recently been advanced by a physicist and former school teacher names Lewis J. Perelman.  Like the social critic George Gilder, Dr. Perelman belongs to the school of thought that sees computer technology as a force that will transform our lives and, on the way, weaken the behemoth state and empower individuals and families.  In terms of the conventional groupings within the wild, wonderful world of conservatism -- you've heard, perhaps, of neo-conservatives, or "neo-cons," and paleo-conservatives, or "paleo-cons"?  Well, perhaps we may call these people cyber-cons.<p>

Anyway, Dr. Perelman has written a book called <i>School's Out</i>.  The subtitle is:  <i>Hyperlearning</i>, <i>The New Technology</i>, and <i>The End of Education</i>.  His thesis is that technology is developing so fast that a number of concepts that we think we are familiar with will have to be re-thought.  The traditional paradigm of education, in which those who <i>know </i>impart knowledge to those who do <i>not yet know</i>, is becoming obsolete, because information is increasing so fast that, in effect, everyone is becoming a life-long learner.  But while information is becoming more voluminous, it is also becoming easier to store and retrieve.  More and more environments are becoming learning situations.  We are becoming a society of ongoing learners.<p>

The Perelman thesis goes on to suggest that schools, as institutions set apart from daily life in which young people spend a portion of their lives getting prepared for the adult world, are destined for the ash-heap of history.  Learning is no longer something that takes place apart from daily life; nor is it any longer something that can be said to be finished when the student reaches attains a high school diploma, or a college degree, or even a graduate/professional degree.<p>

Thus, Perelman ridicules all the present-day education reform movements as missing the point.   To illustrate, he draws an analogy between the new, computerized learning and the automobile:<p>

<blockquote>Imagine, for instance, that it's near the end of the nineteenth rather than the twentieth century.  A national task force on "excellence in horses" has issued a report exclaiming that America is "at risk" because its horse breeding and training are afflicted by a "rising tide of mediocrity."  Russian, Japanese, and German horses, the report warns, eat more oats, pull heavier loads, and can run faster and farther than American horses.  Since everyone knows that the horse is essential to agriculture, transportation, industry, and the military, it's obvious that an all-out effort is needed to raise the quality of U.S. horseflesh if America hopes to be competitive in the twentieth-century world.<br></blockquote>

<blockquote>Oh, by the way, the task force suggests, since the "horseless carriage" seems to be becoming pretty popular, all horses and their trainers should take a course in "automobile literacy" so they won't be scared by the noise of these curious contraptions.</blockquote>

I was particularly intrigued by Perelman's critique of the school choice movement.  He actually agrees with the school choice movement that parental choice is the indispensable threshold for education reform: without it, the continuing slide of our schools into mediocrity and ideology will be irreversible.<p>

But (Perelman's argument goes) if school choice is confined to choices <i>among schools</i>, as traditionally defined and maintained, then it is not choice enough.  This is for two reasons: one, school itself is becoming outmoded by new technology; two, good schools will not be able to start, expand, or multiply fast enough to accommodate demand.  Therefore, many families will not be able to take advantage of it, and this fact will fuel the anti-reform lobbying of those with a vested interest in the present quasi-monopoly.  Therefore, Perelman concludes:  "As long as `school' refers to the traditional structure of buildings and grounds with services delivered in boxes called classrooms to which customers must be transported by car or bus, `school choice' will be unable to meaningfully alter the quality or efficiency of education."<p>

What Perelman's analysis adds up to is that the principle of school choice must be followed to its logical conclusion, and that is, that the education of children, regardless of whether or not it is partly delegated to outsiders, must be seen first and foremost as a task for the home, and for the family.<p>


There is an extremely interesting fact that Perelman cites, and that was also cited in a recent ground-breaking Brookings Institution study favoring school choice, called <i>Politics, Markets, and America's Schools</i>, by John Chubb and Terry Moe.  Indeed, Perelman castigates Chubb and Moe for failing to realize the significance of this fact.  And that fact is this.  Chubb and Moe looked at various factors in the home lives of students, and correlated these with what they called "high performance schools" and "low performance schools," so as to see what features of home life have the biggest impact in making schools more effective.  By far and away, the home life factor that was most strongly correlated with effectiveness of the school was the <i>number of learning tools in the home</i>.  Students with more learning tools in the home -- such as computers, calculators, encyclopedias, and an abundance of books -- do better in school, leading to more apparent "effectiveness" on the part of that school.<p>

Lost in all the talk about "effective schools" was the truly significant finding here:  students learn more when the <i>homes </i>furnish intellectually stimulating environments.<p>

This leads to two conclusions: one would be that synergies between home and school can be very dynamic for students.  The other is that there may be a great future for one education reform movement that truly takes choice to its logical conclusion -- home-schooling.<p>

The home-schooling movement has grown phenomenally in the past thirty years.  It seems to have started in the 1960s with a few hippie parents who didn't want their children to be educated by "the Establishment."  Then it spread in the '70s to Christian families who didn't want their children educated by public schools that were perceived to be dominated by secular humanism.  In the '80s it spread to thousands of parents with graduate and professional degrees who just couldn't see the point of entrusting the education of their children to persons whom they saw as less qualified to teach than themselves.  Today, the movement is flourishing -- with hippies, Christians, intellectuals, and others, and some interesting overlaps between those groups.<p>

As for Perelman, he recommends many solutions in addition to home-schooling, but he also urges that parents look at home-schooling as an option.  And he urges that all families, whether they home-school or not, look on their family life as a part of their children's education.  In fact, after a great deal of prophecy about our high-tech future, Perelman ends his book with an exhortation to family togetherness.<p>

There is a portentous cultural convergence here: between high-tech cyber-radicals and traditional-values conservatives.  The link is this:  from the rise of nation-states during the Middle Ages, until recently, economic and industrial forces have been favorable to the growth of bureaucracy, which is a powerful rival to small-scale communities such as the family.  But the new technology, as Perelman argues at length, bypasses and cuts out bureaucracy.  Perhaps this is why defenders of bureaucratic interests are increasingly taking on an anti-technological tone, sometimes almost sounding like High Tories.  <p>


We've talked now at some length about elementary and secondary education.  What impact will the changes we are talking about have on higher education?  Very positive ones, quite possibly.  If education is going to change from a getting-ready process to a life-long endeavor, it would seem to follow that we will all find ourselves encouraged to maintain, throughout our lives, a certain student-like spirit.  Remember that the word "student" comes from the Latin verb "studere," which means to be fanatically interested in something.<p>

According to Perelman, one of the effects of the technology on education will be that academic degrees will decline in importance relative to actual knowledge.  Also, quite obviously, distances will matter less, as persons far apart will be able to communicate and share information in increasingly efficient and inexpensive ways.<p>

Therefore, I see a very interesting possibility: instead of our present-day universities, you will see new computer-linked communities of scholars spring up, linked by commonality of interest, and devoid of academic bureaucracy and infighting.  That may be the twenty-first century, but interestingly enough, if you take away the computer part, then it's also the thirteenth.  The great universities of Europe, in their infant days during the High Middle Ages, were basically just associations of scholars, who gathered together so as to learn from one another.  Young men who wanted to learn from those scholars would join them, and they were called "studentes," because they were extremely interested.  Perhaps the university of the twenty-first century will be like that, with future "studentes" tapping the scholars of their choice by computer.<p>

I've referred so heavily to Dr. Perelman that you must think I agree with him on everything.  Actually, there may be one point of divergence.  As I read him, I don't think he has a very high regard for the liberal arts as part of education.  My own view is that one can come to understand one's own society and culture only through close study of the best that has been thought and written in past societies and cultures -- that is, by participating in a trans-historical conversation on the great questions.  That is why I, personally, value the liberal arts (not, of course, that they are "liberal" in the modern sense -- in fact, many people consider them downright reactionary).<p>

In spite of this disagreement with Perelman, if it is one, I don't think I will be unhappy in the future that he describes, because I will have the option of sharing my interests in the liberal arts freely with others who truly share those interests.  The modern university is rapidly ceasing to be a place where such sharing is possible.  <p>

American higher education has followed a long, tortuous path.  During the nineteenth century, liberal arts education ceased to be considered intrinsically valuable and began to function instead as a means of maintaining a class structure.  People destined to be lawyers and bankers studied Greek philosophy and Roman poetry, not because they thought it would help them in banking or law, nor because they loved those things (were "studentes" of them) for their own sake, but because such studies served to distinguish them from those destined to be plumbers or auto mechanics.  If you doubt this, ask yourself what the young lady of yesteryear meant to communicate when she assured her parents that her beau was "a college man."  <p>

But that role for higher education has been upset by two major changes, one good, one bad:  the good change is that we are more egalitarian with regard to the professions.  The bad change is that a massive revolt against the liberal arts is being carried out, from within academia itself.<p>

To this problem, the cyber-future offers a possible solution: in the future, it simply won't matter if shrill and shallow ideologues take over what we now call the universities;  those who want the skills that the market demands will get them elsewhere.  And those who love the liberal arts for their own sake will be able to pursue them with others who share that love.<p>

So, to sum up, society today is demanding that education, at all levels, become less centralized, less bureaucratized, and less separated from home and family life.  These changes will be demanded by a knowledge-based economy; they will be facilitated by emerging technology; and they have the potential to restore hearth and home to their rightful place in the hierarchy of human values.<p><br>

<h2><center>WHEN ALL ELSE FAILS,<br> RESTRUCTURE:</h2>
<h3>INTERPRETING THE NEW SAT SCORES</h3>	</center>

<h4><center><i>by</i><br>
<i>Gary L. Bauer</i></center>
</h4>
<hr size="3" width="30%"><br>
The results are in, the scores are up, and the education establishment is patting itself on the back.  Last week the College Board announced the results from its annual college entrance exam, the SAT.  But this year there's a twist:  this is SAT I, a new but comparable (according to test makers) version of the SAT.  Except SAT I has fewer questions.  And allows students 30 more minutes to take the test.  And permits calculators, and throws out antonyms, one of the most difficult verbal sections on the test.  As the folks at Oldsmobile might say, this is not your father's SAT. <p>  

Why the change in format?  The College Board claims changes were necessary to keep the test in sync "with what and how students are learning today."  Given that explanation, SAT I provides an interesting and accurate commentary on schools today.  Students are spending more time in school and learning less.  One has only to compare a sixth grade reader from the early 20th century to a modern middle school language arts text to verify that 12-year-olds in today's schools are not held to the same standard  their predecessors were.  Rote learning and memorization, such as learning basic math tables and vocabulary, are disparaged.  Crutches like calculators provide ways around such basic tasks.  Many students do not know what an antonym is, let alone understand the nuances of words well enough to determine their opposites.<p>

If the knowledge level of American students is down, as a 30-point drop in SAT verbal scores over two decades indicates, then common sense would prescribe a no-nonsense, back-to-basics, rigorous academic regimen.  If students can't do basic math without a calculator, then teach them their multiplication tables.  Write them, say them, or sing them, but have the students learn them.  If students have puny, bland 
vocabularies, introduce them to works of literature that will keep them striving toward mastery of our English language.  Learning is training, and any athlete knows training involves a lot of sweat and some discomfort, but the results can be exhilarating. <p> 

The pursuit of knowledge is arduous, for both teacher and student.  It requires determination, commitment, and high expectations from parents, teachers, and students.  It cannot be induced with spending or any other form of bureaucratic bribery.  It does not provide a quick fix.  Because long-term solutions to our country's educational woes involve a great deal of lag time before reaping results, most political regimes have found them unappealing.  After all, most administrations pursue an agenda that brings them credit and reelection, which makes quick turnaround time essential.  <p>

The agenda of the day is education restructuring, a term that has quietly been interchanged with education reform.  If education restructuring implied innovative thinking unconstrained by the model of the current public school system, I would have little argument.  We need to restructure the public school system to decrease the federal role and restore local schools, and we need competitive alternatives to public schools.  <p>

In reality, restructuring has only changed the system to <i>make student performance look better</i>.  Goals 2000 marks the height of the restructuring agenda. It created a framework for a new federal-state-local partnership, giving more weight than ever to the federal government.  Goals 2000-style restructuring manipulates the system so that all students can achieve to the same "high" standards.  To make standards universally attainable, they must be lowered to the least common denominator among students.  This is the epitome of Outcome-Based Education, where students are held at the same level until the group is ready to move on as a whole.  <p>

If academic standards were lowered independently of all other factors, falling performance on standardized tests would be noticeable--as it has been on the SAT in recent years--and Americans would blow the whistle on the restructuring agenda.  However, if new tests keyed to the new standards were implemented, performance on these tests would be pleasingly high relative to previous test scores, and the public would be pacified.  That's exactly why Goals 2000 calls for the creation of standards and "aligned assessments." <p> 

That's also what we've witnessed in the SAT overhaul.  Rather than remaining an objective, independent measure, the restructured SAT has been keyed to the restructured classroom.  Results, therefore, will be higher and Americans will be artificially confident that we have finally gotten back on track from our educational waywardness.<p>

That is exactly what President Bill Clinton and Secretary Richard Riley were hoping we'd believe.  They now have the statistics to give the appearance that their education agenda has been a success.  Unfortunately, what has been accomplished is the gerrymandering of objective measures and accepted standards, making it difficult to determine the true status of student achievement.  Instead of rallying Americans to the task of real education reform, our leaders are prodding us into that blissful Lake Wobegon naivete that sees all our children as decidedly above average. <p>

<title>CHEATING SCANDAL POINTS TO
	MORAL DECLINE</title>
<center><h2>CHEATING SCANDAL POINTS TO<br>
	MORAL DECLINE</h2></center>
	<h4><center><i>by</i><br>
	<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></h4></center>
<hr size="3" width="30%"><br>
Cheating scandals at the nation's military academies make news because military officers are supposed to epitomize loyalty, integrity and selfless service.  This is evidenced by the schools' strict honor codes, which are unsurpassed in academe.<p>  

The announcement of the U.S. Naval Academy's widest cheating scandal in its 149 year history suggests an erosion of the military profession's reliability, and testifies to the decline in America's culture.  The Navy convened a special review board to investigate charges that up to 134 midshipmen illegally had advance knowledge about the contents of an electrical engineering final examination given in December 1992.  The board recommended expulsion of 29 midshipmen and lesser punishment for 42 others.<p>    

Advance knowledge of the contents of an exam is a violation of the academy's honor code, which states that midshipmen must not lie, cheat or steal or tolerate those who do.  The code serves to impress upon future naval leaders that a high standard is expected of those who must make life-and-death decisions.  A similar code applies to the other academies, and they too have suffered scandals in recent years.<p>

If future military leaders can't deal honestly with school exams, how will they perform in situations that could cost lives?  In America's combat history, the character of our leaders has often been more powerful than the firepower of our weapons.<p>     

For years, the nation's military academies took America's best and integrated them into a military regimen.  The process was simplified because applicants shared similar, well-defined ideas of right and wrong.  Today, however, there is a tremendous chasm between the values required of a professional military and those possessed by the pool of eligible college-age students.  The process of integrating and indoctrinating-- bridging the chasm-- is more difficult than ever before.<p>
  
This phenomenon goes beyond the military and affects the civilian sector as well.  Industry, business, academe, government and family all rely, like the military, on people with integrity, commitment, candor, discipline, selfless service and competence.  <p>  
                                                                                              

The erosion of values is traceable largely to changes in institutions which have traditionally been responsible for imparting them to our youth.  These key institutions include family, school, church, media and government. <p> 

<ul><li>The typical American family of the 1950s consisted of a working father, a stay-at-home mother and one or two children.  Nearly 70 percent of all households used to fit that description.  Today, nearly two-thirds of the nation's young children still are raised at home by full-time mothers or mothers who are employed part-time outside of the home.  Women are increasingly pressured, however, to work full-time in the paid labor force.  And work force competition for material benefits has reduced the time that fathers have with their children. </ul><p> 

Armand Nicholi, a Harvard psychiatrist, believes that "the character development and emotional stability of a person...is [the product] of the relationship he experiences as a child with both of his parents."  The importance of parent-child time for childrearing was confirmed in a survey commissioned by the Massachusetts Mutual Insurance Company which found that Americans believe "parents having less time to spend with their families" is the single most important reason for the family's decline in our society. <p>

Although the length of the work week has changed little in recent years, the rise of more mothers joining working fathers reduces parent-child time.  Additionally, the dual wage earning couple often leave their children with day-care providers despite a 1993 Family Research Council survey finding that 87 percent of Americans agree that young children benefit more from mother care than substitute care.  Choosing inferior child care alternatives during the child's most impressionable and value forming years is risky. <p>

Today, one in six families is headed by a single mother.  Increasing numbers of children are being born out of wedlock.  The illegitimacy rate is 22 percent for white babies and 68 percent for black babies.  Growing up in single-parent households too often means financial hardship and a serious lack of parental attention, from absent fathers.<p>

The U.S. has the highest divorce rate in the world -- 5.3 divorces per 1,000 people.  The consequences of divorce for children are significant.  Not only does the child's standard of living usually change for the worse, there is also a loss of parental attention; many children in divorced homes require psychological help.  Girls from divorced families are at much greater risk for early sexual initiation, promiscuity, non-marital pregnancies, venereal diseases, and divorce than are girls in two-parent intact families.  Boys in similar situations are at greater risk of dropping out of school than girls, and are also more likely to exhibit aggressive behavior.<p>

The traumas of abuse and neglect are frequently associated with divorce.  A National Institute of Justice study found that people who had been "abused or neglected as children are more likely to be arrested as juveniles, as adults, and for violent crimes."  Another study found that chronic exposure to violence, in the home or in the neighborhood, often can lead to violent behavior.<p>

The family as a value-influencing institution has been weakened, and children bear the brunt of parental mistakes with an inevitable impact on their value system.<p>
 
<ul><li>The school is the second most important contributor to the child's value system.  Modern educators, however, are spending more and more time on remedial social work.  Instead of equipping America's youth academically for the next century, educators are counseling their pupils about drug abuse, discipline problems, sex, suicide and anorectic and bulimic disorders.  Surveys indicate that the biggest problems in public schools today are drugs and crime.  Thirty years ago, chewing gum and talking in class were the major problems.</ul>

A national survey of college freshmen found a significant shift in motivation away from altruism and toward concern with making money and getting power and status.  Not surprisingly, students are finding it easier to rationalize lying or cheating in pursuit of their goals.<p>

Theodore Roosevelt stated, "To educate a person in mind and not in morals is to educate a menace to society."  Ethics training was replaced in the last 20 years by values clarification programs which treat children like adults who need only to clarify values rather than to acquire them.  At best, values clarification encourages the student to close the gap between the values he professes and his personal action.  At worst, it promotes moral relativism.<p>

The school's role as a value instiller has changed.  There is, however, a growing national momentum to require schools to introduce "character" instruction.  Whether or not this trend is positive, however, depends upon whose values prevail.<p>

<ul><li>Until the early 1960s, organized religion was very influential in most children's value-formation process.  Today, however, although most Americans claim to be religious, fewer are regularly attending religious services.  This trend has been especially evident during times of great change, particularly over the last decade.</ul><p>

For many, the church is no longer the center of family and community life.  Theology has become more relativistic in many churches, and its focus has correspondingly been altered for many people.  Members now more often expect to be served, as opposed to being challenged to serve others.  Churches are increasingly functioning as a "country club" or "social club" that scratches the religious itch and provides a drive-through "feel-good" service rather than as a center of salvation and substantive, community-building activity.<p>

The influence of organized religions has waned, and nontraditional movements have emerged, such as the New Age Movement, a post-Christian belief system that recycles elements of eastern mysticism with modern, self-centered philosophy.<p>

This fast-growing spiritual, social and political movement seeks to transform individuals and society.  It has left its mark on sociology, theology, medicine, anthropology, history, sports and literature.  The New Age movement promotes a view of reality that admits to no absolutes.  Many adherents believe that good and evil are essentially one, thus breeding moral relativism. <p>

<ul><li>The all-pervasive media also influence society's values.  Television, with its 6,600 cable systems, leaves a daily impression on most children.  The average child spends more time in front of the television than in school.  Television includes Saturday morning cartoons such as the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles and Ghost Busters -- programs that promote aggressive and disrespectful behavior.  Afternoon television provides false views of life via soap operas and sex-saturated talk shows.  Evening programming often promotes anti-family agendas, and glorifies promiscuity, violence, homosexuality, and more. </ul><p>

The average teenager in the U.S. sees 50 R-rated movies a year.  Some of these are rated "R" because of violence.  "True Romance," for example, depicts a man killing his wife's former pimp by shooting him point-blank, first in the groin and then in the face.  The wife applauds the act.<p>

Rap music is another virtual obsession with today's teens.  "2 Live Crew" has an album, "Nasty As They Wanna be," which features strings of obscenities set to music.  Women are described only as sex objects for the singer's gratification.  The album includes many explicit references to male and female genitalia and even sexual torture of women.<p>   

<ul><li>Finally, government exists to reflect the will of the people in the laws and to enforce those laws.  Unfortunately, government's track record has been poor,  particularly with regard to public safety.  Elected officials pass many laws, hire more policemen and build more prisons, but the crime problem is not abating.  </ul><p>

The government also lacks the discipline, like too many individual Americans, to balance its budget.  This communicates a message of fiscal irresponsibility.  Opinion polls place politicians and government bureaucrats at the bottom of lists of occupations ranked for trust and confidence.  This reflects a growing cynicism about those in civil authority.<p>

The breakdown of value-influencing institutions was recently linked to the Navy's scandal by Sean M. Fahey, the 21-year-old senior who, as brigade commander, holds the highest rank among the 4,200 midshipmen at Annapolis.  He states, "The idea of integrity wasn't that hard to grasp.  Now, institutionally, we've hardly changed.  But the whole world has turned upside down.  Our class -- we grew up at a time when nobody in our entire lives, in any institution, was ever there to tell us what's right or wrong."<p>

Mr. Fahey explains the significance of the value chasm for the Navy.  "The sea is the same sea now as it was 2,000 years ago," he says, "A storm will tear apart a ship just as it did 2,000 years ago.  If you go out to sea and people die because you were not good at your word, it means everything."<p>

This future officer understands the tough job that faces every American leader, military or civilian.  Our current crop of young Americans are products of institutions that have failed to instill important values.  This has grave consequences for America.<p><br>

<title>REINVENTING FAMILY VALUES IN BEIJING</title>

<p>
<h2>REINVENTING FAMILY VALUES<br>
IN BEIJING</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Gracie S. Hsu</i></center>
<p>
While there has been much speculation as to whether Hillary Clinton
will or will not attend the United Nations Fourth World Conference
on Women, much less attention has been given to the U.N. document
itself and what its impact will be on the family.  The U.N. conference
-- to be held in Beijing, China, from September 4-15, 1995 --
is supposed to advance women's rights around the world.  However,
the document reveals a much different reality -- one which attempts
to reinvent traditional families and family values.
<p>
Consider only a few of the Beijing document's most egregious violations:
<UL>
<LI><B>Denigrating the values of motherhood and traditional family
life.</B>  The word &quot;mother&quot; has been bracketed throughout
the entire platform so that it might be changed to the term &quot;caretaker.&quot;
 Similarly, the word &quot;family&quot; has been bracketed so
that it might be changed to &quot;household.&quot;  [Bracketed
sections indicate that delegates could not agree on the text.
 These sections are to be discussed further, with each alternative
weighed equally.]  Moreover, the word &quot;family&quot; almost
always appears in a negative context, i.e., in relation to domestic
violence or as a vehicle for female oppression.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Devaluing the husband-wife relationship to a mere power
play. </B>  Consider paragraph 198 of the platform: &quot;Inequality
in the public arena can often start within the family when <I>power
relations</I> between men and women are unbalanced with discriminatory
attitudes and practices within the family.  The unequal division
of labour and responsibilities within households based on<I> unequal
power relations</I> also limits women's potential...for participation
in decision-making in wider public forums&quot; (emphasis added).
 Thus, rather than acknowledging marriage as a cooperative partnership,
the platform pits one mate against the other.  Notably, the words
&quot;wife&quot; and &quot;husband&quot; are nowhere to be found
in the document even though the populace of every country participating
in the conference honors the marital relationship.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Gender is open for interpretation.</B>  While &quot;gender&quot;
appears more than 200 times in the platform document, the U.N.
fails to define the term.  During a preparatory 
committee meeting for the conference, one of the delegates asked
that the term &quot;gender&quot; be defined as the traditional
biological classifications of &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female.&quot;
 Others, however, sought to define &quot;gender&quot; as &quot;the
socially-constructed roles which society assigns to men and women.&quot;
 This latter definition has been used in feminist literature to
mean that gender is subject to change and that there exists a
spectrum of genders, perhaps even five (e.g., male heterosexual,
female heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, and transsexual). 
The U.N. rejected both definitions and decided that &quot;gender&quot;
was to be understood &quot;in its commonly accepted meaning.&quot;
  One can only hope the commonly accepted meaning of gender in
the United States remains that which acknowledges the biological
classifications of male and female.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Parents are irrelevant in adolescent health decisions.</B>
 In various areas relating to sexuality, reproduction, and AIDS,
the document repeatedly states that governments should &quot;emphasize
the role and responsibility of adolescents in sexual and reproductive
behavior through the provision of appropriate services and counseling,
recognizing their rights to privacy, confidentiality, and informed
consent.&quot;  The document refuses to recognize that parents
should play a vital role in their children's reproductive health
decisions.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Abortion and contraception as reproductive &quot;rights.&quot;</B>
 The efforts of the previous U.N. conferences in Cairo and Copenhagen
to promote abortion and unrestricted contraceptive availability
are well known.  The Beijing document follows in this tradition.
 The platform fails to recognize the role of men as husbands and
fathers, and argues that women should be completely autonomous
in their reproductive decision-making.  Indeed, the platform urges
governments to &quot;take action to ensure that women's sexual
and reproductive rights are fully recognized and respected&quot;
(paragraph 232).  Furthermore, the platform seems to elevate reproductive
&quot;rights&quot; above all other rights, stating that &quot;the
ability of women to control their own fertility forms an important
basis for their enjoyment of other rights&quot; (paragraph 98).
</UL>
<P>
Americans, in greater and greater numbers, are rejecting the radical
feminist agenda that has spawned many of the social problems now
confronting our nation.  The Clinton Administration should take
a lesson and remove the United States from promoting this to the
rest of the world in Beijing.

<title>THE FIRST LADY'S PARTICIPATION IN BEIJING CONFERENCE</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">
<h2>THE FIRST LADY'S PARTICIPATION IN<br>
BEIJING CONFERENCE<br>
SENDS THE WRONG MESSAGE</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Gracie S. Hsu</i></center>
<p>
Within hours of Harry Wu's safe return to the United States, the
Clinton Administration announced First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's
intention to go to Beijing for the United Nations Fourth World
Conference on Women.  After weeks of debate and uncertainty regarding
her participation, the Clintons felt Harry Wu's release paved
the way for the First Lady to attend without further barriers.
 But the Clintons are mistaken:  there remain several significant
reasons why Mrs. Clinton should not attend this conference.
<P>
First, Harry Wu was shamelessly used by the Chinese government
as a bargaining chip.  Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration
bought into China's tactic 100 percent.  By &quot;rewarding&quot;
China for its &quot;good&quot; behavior of expelling human rights
activist Harry Wu after convicting him of &quot;crimes,&quot;
the United States demonstrates that despotic regimes like China
should be free to take and use political prisoners as leverage
to strongarm the U.S. into accommodating their wishes.  The U.S.
position in this sends a clear message to China and to other nations
that the U.S. is willing to abide by the perverse rules of extortion.
<P>
Secondly, the Clinton Administration wrongly assumes that Harry
Wu's return to the United States clears the way for the First
Lady to attend the conference by exonerating China.  It does not.
 Indeed, during his first speech to the public after returning
from China, Mr. Wu strongly urged Mrs. Clinton to forgo her participation
in the Beijing conference because of China's blatant disregard
for human rights.  Mr. Wu said that the First Lady's attendance
would send China &quot;a signal, a kind of approval&quot; that
the United States is willing to tolerate, even condone, such crimes
against humanity.
<P>
And human rights abuses in China abound.  From forced sterilization
and coercive abortion policies, to female infanticide, to slave
labor (which Harry Wu placed himself at considerable risk to document),
to the killing of prisoners to harvest their organs for transplant
procedures, to cannibalizing aborted fetuses, to religious persecution,
to the quashing of human rights at all levels by the ruthless
communist Chinese government, the Chinese people inhumanely suffer
at the hands of their own government.  Indeed, the only difference
between the Tiananmen Square massacre and the ghastly human 
rights abuses that occur every day in China is that Tiananmen
was witnessed by the public.
<P>
Perhaps because the Tiananmen massacre has been permanently etched
into America's consciousness, the public outcry against Mrs. Clinton's
attendance in Beijing has been strong and swift.  As a result,
the Clinton Administration has been prompted to defend Mrs. Clinton's
attendance by contending that she will be able to:  (1) speak
out against China's human rights violations and (2) advance women's
rights.  However, it is doubtful that the First Lady will be able
to accomplish either of these objectives by participating in this
conference.
<P>
First, while we earnestly hope that Mrs. Clinton will highlight
China's human rights abuses, it is also noteworthy that Geraldine
Ferraro, a Clinton Administration-appointed delegate to the United
Nations conference, requested that the Beijing document's condemnation
of  &quot;trafficking in human organs and tissue&quot; -- a barbaric
practice largely associated with China -- remain bracketed for
removal.  In other words, Ms. Ferraro blocked this language from
being officially incorporated into the document.  That an official
U.S. delegate was unwilling to have the conference document even
<I>mention</I> one of China's most egregious human rights violations
during an unpublicized consultatory meeting makes it that much
more improbable that the First Lady would dare to condemn China's
abuses in the highly publicized setting of Beijing. 
<P>
Furthermore, a great chasm exists between doing something about
human rights abuses and merely talking about them.  A strong stand
by the Clinton Administration to withhold the First Lady's attendance
on the grounds that China abuses women would have shown words
backed by action.  But now the Administration has only words.
 And if the adage is true that actions speak louder than words,
then Mrs. Clinton's words will have little impact since she is
in Beijing delivering them.  Worst of all, her distinguished presence
at the conference confers on China the international spotlight
it desires and the legitimacy it seeks.
<P>
Finally, if the First Lady intends to uphold women's rights, then
she should not be attending the Beijing conference at all.  The
Beijing document's Platform for Action does not represent the
large majority of American women (or the women of any other country,
for that matter) on the central issues of motherhood and the family.
 Rather, it promotes a radical feminist agenda which undermines
the natural family unit and erodes the foundations of marriage
and family life, while upholding abortion and the dissemination
of contraceptives to minors as positive alternatives.
<P>
From the beginning of Harry Wu's imprisonment, the Clinton Administration
has been adamant in its resolve to send a  U.S. delegation to
the Beijing conference.  The U.S. refused to take a firm stand
then.  But with Wu's release, it would have been only a small
price to pay for the U.S. to finally take a stand -- albeit symbolic
-- by having Mrs. Clinton refuse to attend the conference.  That
the Clinton Administration failed to do even that is disturbing.

<P>
John Cardinal O'Connor of New York has defined two conditions
-- and two conditions only -- that justify opposing the anti-illegitimacy
measures recently adopted by the House.  His opposition hinges,
first, on the &quot;virtual inevitability&quot; that a freeze
on benefits &quot;amounts to a programmed `short-term' increase
in abortions&quot; and, second, on the lack of &quot;any hard
evidence&quot; to support the contention that reducing illegitimacy
will reduce abortions.
<P>
The Cardinal's principled objections deserve an answer, and all
people of faith should be relieved by the fact that we do have
hard evidence to allay both of his concerns.  Given the weight
of evidence suggesting that abortions will not increase in the
short term and will in fact decrease in the long term, those who
defend the status quo on moral or empirical grounds must now bear
the burden of proof.  And those who have been both puzzled and
troubled by the rift in the pro-life ranks over this issue must
understand that the division springs not from a different understanding
of our moral responsibilities, but from a different degree of
reliance on the actual empirical record.
<P>
While it is far too premature to draw any decisive conclusions
from the welfare experiment in New Jersey, there is absolutely
no statistical indication as of yet that an increase in abortions
has occurred since the state's family cap took effect August 1,
1993.  In fact, according to the New Jersey Department of Human
Services, the total number of Medicaid-funded abortions in New
Jersey declined from 13,629 in 1993 to 13,424 in 1994.
<P>
Anita Leone, executive director of an association that represents
all the publicly-funded abortion clinics in New Jersey, confirmed
in a recent interview: &quot;We know that abortions in New Jersey
are currently decreasing.  We just don't know why.&quot;  Because
the decline in the birth rate among welfare mothers in New Jersey
has been rather substantial since implementation of the family
cap (11.4 percent, according to the Department of Human Services),
the fact that an increase in abortions is not yet indicated is
particularly significant.      
<P>
The anecdotal evidence collected by those who are on the frontlines
of welfare reform in New Jersey confirms the general pattern that
is beginning to emerge from the data.  Richard Traynor of the
Legal Center for Defense of Life in New Jersey and David Sciarra
of New Jersey Legal Services, who together 
filed a class-action suit over the New Jersey family cap, both
commented in telephone interviews that the class was certified
to include welfare mothers who had aborted their babies -- but
that neither one could locate a woman who had actually aborted
in the wake of the cap.
<P>
Instead, the only plaintiffs who mention abortion in their affidavits
explain that they consciously decided on moral grounds not to
terminate their pregnancies, despite increased economic pressures.
 One woman testified that she made an appointment at an abortion
clinic but ultimately &quot;became very upset about having an
abortion and decided that [she] could not go through with it.&quot;
 Another woman who already had two children and was carrying triplets
-- three times the pressure -- never even considered abortion.
<P>
The decision to abort, the evidence suggests, is uniquely invulnerable
to rational economic incentives.  Only the most callous of mothers
places a price tag on her baby's head, and welfare mothers are
apparently more inclined to consider the intangibles than any
other population group.  Public opinion data collected by the
Family Research Council suggest that abortion is even more morally
repugnant to poor women; and the fact that abortion rates for
teen welfare mothers are <U>lower</U> than national averages for
all teenage girls is a powerful indication that non-economic factors
determine the decision to carry a child to term.
<P>
Many who now argue otherwise are precisely the ones who maintain
that the current benefits level is already far too low to cover
the costs associated with a new baby.  If so, it is illogical
to predict that a cap would have a sufficiently significant impact
on the &quot;affordability&quot; of another child to trigger such
a drastic measure as abortion.
<P>
State-by-state data from the 1980s demonstrates that small changes
in welfare payouts do not affect abortion rates in the short term;
and Michael Schwartz of Life Advocacy Alliance has found in analyzing
more recent data that states with the highest average monthly
benefit for a family of three also tend to have the highest ratio
of abortions to live births.
<P>
Not surprisingly, then, the only &quot;evidence&quot; the plaintiffs
could offer in the New Jersey suit was 55 letters from pro-life
activists expressing concern that freezing benefits might increase
abortions.  As of yet, there is nothing more concrete than their
concern itself to corroborate their claims; and pro-lifers who
are unconvinced by the hearsay -- including John Tomicki, past
president of New Jersey Right to Life -- have concluded that welfare
reform itself is a pro-life cause.
<P>
Contrary to Cardinal O'Connor's assertion, we do have compelling
statistical evidence to suggest that reducing illegitimacy will
reduce abortions.  Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation has
found an astronomically high correlation between abortion and
illegitimacy in a state-by-state analysis.  His study shows that
an increase of 100 in the number of illegitimate births per 10,000
women, in fact, results in an increase of 200 in the number of
abortions per 10,000 women.
<P>
The vast majority of abortions are performed on unmarried women
-- and the proportion is growing.  To reduce abortions, we must
reduce the premarital sex and out-of-wedlock pregnancy that create
a perceived &quot;need&quot; for abortion.  Marriage affords the
best protection -- indeed, the only real hope -- for the children
of the poor.
<P>
In deference to that fact, John Paul II wrote in his most recent
encyclical <U>Evangelium Vitae</U> that &quot;[a] general <I>and
no less serious </I>responsibility [for abortion] lies with those
who have encouraged the spread of an attitude of sexual permissiveness
and a lack of esteem for motherhood, and with those who should
have ensured -- but did not -- effective family and social policies
in support of families.&quot;
<P>
The Pope's teaching leaves ample room for inferring that a program
that undermines families and promotes sexual immorality as effectively
as our current welfare system does is equally responsible for
abortion as permissive abortion laws.  Those who countenance the
status quo in welfare countenance a system rife with abortion.
 And those who fight for welfare reform wage a war against abortion
that is no less morally valid than peaceful sit-ins, prayer vigils,
and reform of law.

<title>PARENTAL RIGHTS: WHOSE CHILDREN ARE THEY?</title>

<h2>PARENTAL RIGHTS:</br>
WHOSE CHILDREN ARE THEY?</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Cathleen Cleaver, Esq.</i></center>
<p>
Congress will soon take up legislation designed to acknowledge
(or restore) the right of parents to direct the upbringing and
education of their children.  Is federal legislation really necessary?
 Consider the following:  This summer, Mr. and Mrs. Waymon Earls
of Toccoa, Georgia were shocked to find a bag of condoms in their
13- and 15-year-old daughters' room.  The girls confessed that
their middle school counselor had helped them get the condoms.
After repeatedly being told that it was none of the parent's business,
a reluctant school superintendent revealed to the Earls that the
counselor had driven the girls during school hours to a health
clinic where they were tested for AIDS and cervical cancer, and
given condoms and prescriptions for birth control pills.  The
school has, to date,  refused to give the Earls the results of
the tests.  &quot;We're simply trying to do what's best for the
students,&quot; said the superintendent.  The Earls have filed
a lawsuit against the school and its officials. Georgia taxpayers
are funding the school's defense, and its attorneys have moved
the case to federal court.
<p>
Education bureaucrats are not the only culprits.  A steady drumbeat
of Child Protective Services tragedies reveals an increasing nonchalance
about the sanctity of the family unit on the part of government
social workers who take children from their homes on little more
than rumor.  This &quot;loot first and ask questions later&quot;
approach reflects the height of arrogance, and does untold damage
to the very souls CPS was designed to protect.  Tragically, however,
there are real cases of intra-family abuse and neglect.  But in
too many such cases, protective government agencies completely
fail to intervene.   That our child protection system needs improvement
is apparent, but no case of under-enforcement can support a blanket
sanction of over-enforcement so obtrusive as to be self-defeating.
<p>
To compound matters, President Clinton earlier this year agreed
to the United Nation's Convention on the Rights of the Child,
which espouses the &quot;new concept&quot; of government &quot;protecting
children from the power of parents.&quot;  There is little doubt that the 
United Nations is out of touch with American ideas.  The U.N.'s Convention on
the Rights of the Child was telling, but the platform document
for its Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing -- with its
confusion about gender and hostility toward motherhood and natural
families -- cinches the case.  The UN has been virtually co-opted
by social experimentalists who can test theories in an ostensibly
reputable body where physical and conceptual &quot;foreign-ness&quot;
makes for reduced scrutiny and no real accountability.  Paternal
deconstruction proponents responsible for the Convention on the
Rights of the Child have accomplished through the U.N. what they
could not through the legislative process.
<p>
Senator Charles Grassley and Congressman Steve Largent have introduced
the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act of 1995.  The Act
establishes the fundamental right of parents to direct and provide
for the education and religious teaching of their children, and
also addresses health care decisions and reasonable corporal discipline.
 Importantly, the Act allows the government to intervene when
it has a compelling interest to do so, and has specific allowances
for child abuse and neglect.  
<p>
The notion that government should protect children from the power
of parents is opposed by the vast majority of Americans.  In February
of this year, Luntz Research asked registered voters nationwide:
&quot;Who do you feel should be primarily responsible for the
upbringing and education of children -- parents or the government?&quot;
 Voters favored parents by a landslide 94%.
<p>
The Earls will continue to fight for the right to be parents,
and pro-family groups will rally around the much-needed Parental
Rights Act.  Stable, intact families rearing children with both
love and direction have never been in shorter supply or more desperately
needed.  The time has come to put a stop to efforts to replace
Mom and Dad with Big Brother.

<h2>The September Budget Battle: Truth and Consequence </h2><p>
<h3>Pete du Pont</h3>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
When the Congress returns from its recess after Labor Day, the battle 
of the budget will begin in earnest.   <p>
 
While the Congress has adopted a budget resolution providing for a 
balanced budget by 2002, now it must pass legislation implementing 
that budget.  Assuming the appropriations bills follow the resolution, 
and thus reduce spending, what will President Clinton do with them?  
The budget resolution Congress adopted was not subject to a 
Presidential veto, but the appropriations bills are another matter.  
President Clinton could shred the Republican budget by vetoing 
appropriations bills that include more spending cuts than he wants.   <p>
 
But the President is in a box.  The truth is his initial economic 
policy, enacted in 1993 by a single vote in each House, has failed 
badly.  One of the consequences was the election of a Republican 
Congress.  And the consequence of that is very little room for the 
President to maneuver.  <p>
 
In the 1992 campaign, President Clinton promised to balance the 
federal budget in 5 years.  His first budget proposed to reduce the 
deficit primarily through one of the largest tax increases in U.S. 
history.  Spending cuts in his budget were largely offset by spending 
increases elsewhere. <p>
 
So how has this liberal fiscal policy fared? <p>
 
In 1993, before the Clinton plan was enacted, the budget deficit was 
around $250 billion.  Under the latest budget projections, excluding 
proposed Republican changes, the deficit is projected to rise to $300 
billion per year by 2000. <p>
 
The economic rationale for the Clinton budget plan was that cutting 
the deficit would reduce borrowing pressures, and consequently reduce 
interest rates.  Lower rates would in turn stimulate investment and 
economic growth.  But by the end of April of this year, the prime rate 
charged by banks was 50% higher than in 1993 when the Clinton plan was 
adopted.  Other interest rates from new home mortgages to AAA 
corporate bonds and Treasury bills and bonds were all substantially 
higher as well. <p>
 
Meanwhile, the dollar has collapsed against foreign currencies.  From 
January, 1993 to June of this year, the dollar is down one-third 
against the Japanese yen, almost one-fourth against the Swiss franc, 
and one-eighth against the German mark.  As a result, all Americans 
are poorer because their dollar incomes now buy less of the world's 
goods and services.  This is in sharp contrast to the strong dollar 
policy of the Reagan administration, which led the dollar to soar to 
record levels, making all Americans richer. <p>
 
Real incomes and wages have continued to fall under Clinton's economic 
policies, a trend which started with the tax and regulation increases 
of the Bush Administration. <p>
 
Finally, economic growth has been sluggish.  With the Clinton tax 
increases, the recovery from the recession of 1990-1991 has been the 
weakest post-recession period on record.  Job growth has been half and 
real GDP growth  only about two-thirds the rate of prior recoveries.  
Indeed, in the last full quarter, the economy barely grew at all. <p>
 
Surely the President does not want to return to this sort of fiscal 
policy.  In any event, he cannot, for the Republican Congress will not 
raise taxes.  So the best the administration can do is veto a few 
appropriations bills and hope to keep government as large as he can 
for as long as he can. <p>
 
But remember that the Constitution dealt all the budget cards to the 
Congress.  If the Congress reduces funding for a department, the 
President cannot restore the spending simply by vetoing the 
legislation.  A veto ends all funding for all of the activities of  
the department, until the President signs a Congressionally approved 
bill. <p>
 
Remember, too, that at the end of the current fiscal year on September 
30, the government cannot operate if Congress has not authorized 
spending for the new fiscal year.  Congress can consequently turn off 
the government -- or parts of it -- if the President does not accept 
the Congressional budget.  In the fall, Congress will also have to 
approve an increase in the debt ceiling for deficit borrowing to 
continue, so it holds all the cards here as well. <p>
 
So the Congress leads from strength.  The only real risk is that the 
Republicans will compromise with themselves and hand the President a 
victory he otherwise could not have won. <p>
 
If the Republicans continue to reduce regulation and taxes, 
encouraging both job and real wage growth, and stay on the glide path 
to a balanced budget in seven years, the President will have little 
choice but to sign the appropriations bills and say it was all his 
idea in the first place.<p>

<h2>Address by Congressman Dick Armey</h2>
<b>Conservative Leadership Conference<br>
Washington, D.C.<br>
December 3, 1994<br></b>
</center>
<hr><p>
Thank you for that kind welcome.  What a pleasure it is to be here tonight, and in the company of such good friends.  And seeing you all here reminds me of that old Gene Autry song.  We're "back in the saddle again."<p>
Morton is too humble to tell you this, but my staff and I first began planning our strategy for a Republican majority last year down at Briar Patch, his mountain cabin.  I don't know whether it was the woods or the fresh air or Morton's well-stocked larder, or what -- but all I can say is: "Keep throwin' us in that Briar Patch."<p>
I hope you'll pardon me for looking tired.  As you might imagine, Newt and I are getting a lot less sleep these days.  It's not easy taking over the Congress, streamlining the House, and planning for the first hundred days -- when you can't have even a moment to fish.<p>
Of course, as exciting and gratifying as our victory is, we need to remember -- and this is important -- we didn't win power, we gained responsibility.  We have a lot of hard work ahead of us.  And so tonight, I want to spend a few moments with the people who have worked so hard to make this majority come true, reflecting on the meaning of what's happened -- and what we need to do.<p>
In this first midterm election of the post-Cold War era, Americans made it dramatically clear what they want.  They want a return to normalcy.  They want a restoration of the good, solid old values that made this country great: limited government, economic opportunity, and personal responsibility.  And so we have a clear mandate.  We go into this exciting new era with a very clear idea of which values are going to guide our actions.<p>
We also have a clear agenda.  The American people expect us to fulfill our end of the Contract with America.  And we will.  In the first hundred days, we will bring to the floor of the House ten very specific pieces of legislation, debate them, and vote on them in a fair and open process.  And let me say, I take this obligation very seriously.  I am fully aware that the future of my political Party depends on our performance between January 3rd and Good Friday of 1995.<p>
I've found that, in politics, you can either be a bitter disappointment or a pleasant surprise.  Well, we intend to be a pleasant surprise.  We intend to produce a persistent, steady stream of good news coming out of Washington for the average American.<p>
Instead of raising taxes, we're going to cut taxes.  Instead of writing new regulations, we're going to repeal old ones.  Instead of producing more dependency, we're going to encourage self-reliance.  Whether the issue is poverty, crime, education, the environment, or even equality of incomes, we believe freedom offers a better solution than does government.  My hope is that, as our solutions are enacted, and the good news gets out, it's going to start sinking in.  People are going to find themselves looking at one another in amazement and delight and say, "Wow, what's going on up there?"<p>
I know, Paul Weyrich, you've expressed concerns that the Contract doesn't go far enough.  And if the Contract were the extent of our agenda, I'd say the same thing.  But the Contract is just the beginning.  I call it the shakedown cruise for the counter-revolution.<p>
After all, the welfare-dependency state took more than a hundred days to build.  And replacing it with a conservative opportunity society will also take more than a hundred days.  Doubtless there will be setbacks.  Sometimes we'll lose a few yards.  Sometimes we'll score.  Sometimes we'll have to throw long.  But with discipline and hard work, day in and day out, I'm confident we'll reach our goal and move beyond big government.<p>
You know, the liberals are already giving away their game plan.  They obviously take us for rubes.  They think we're going to come in like Attila the Hun and try to sack the place in a massive frontal assault -- and, they hope, get ourselves thrown out in '96.<p>
Well, in a former life, I was a marathon runner, and I learned the painful way that sprinters don't finish marathons.  A good steady pace wins the prize.  So I hate to break the bad news to my liberal colleagues, but we do not view ourselves as a temporary strike force -- we are a permanent presence.<p>
We will wage a patient, well-planned, well-coordinated campaign to replace the welfare-dependency state with a conservative opportunity society, not in one futile assault, but brick by brick and stone by stone.<p>
Our source of strength is this.  We trust people.  We respect the sense and know-how of the American citizen.  We trust people to spend their own money and make their own decisions.  We trust the typical American family more than we trust a bureaucracy to know what is best for that family.  Just look around.  Ordinary men and women are capable of extraordinary things, if only we let them.  After all, America itself offers the most eloquent proof that free people can do great things.
But just as we respect people's freedom, we also understand that freedom requires personal responsibility.  It is character that makes freedom work.  And the essence of character is a love for the truth.  Truth, honesty, integrity -- these things matter.  Unfortunately, one of the reasons Americans are so disappointed with their elected officials is that, for too long, Washington has been a city in which powerful people could not be trusted with either words or numbers.<p>
Take, for example, the eighties.  In the 1980s, we were a successful and generous people.  As our incomes rose, so did our giving -- a record decade for personal philanthropy.  For the revisionists to call it a "decade of greed" is not only untrue, it robs us of our most precious possession -- our understanding of our own experience.  It's hard to make good public policy in the nineties unless we understand the truth about the eighties.<p>
Another example: "compassion."  When conservatives look at the facts and conclude that government-created dependency may be hurting people and tearing apart families and communities, many of whom are poor African Americans living in miserable circumstances, we're often told we lack compassion.  Well, compassion without understanding can be the cruellest thing of all.<p>
Back when I was still a professor at the university, we had a janitor named Charlie.  And although he was slightly mentally retarded, Charlie was a good man who did his job faithfully, and to my knowledge without complaint.  Well, one day they raised the minimum wage, and Charlie lost his job.  Doubtless they thought they were being compassionate.  But it seems to me part of having compassion for people is seeing their potential.<p>
Our first tool, then, will be our honesty.  Our second tool will be discipline.  For years, we conservatives have tried to reduce the size of government by taking on one program at a time, only to suffer huge casualties in a kind of budgetary trench warfare.  What we need is a new strategy that enables us to outflank the special interests entirely.<p>
And that's why, by February 6, I hope to dedicate to President Reagan two very special birthday presents: the balanced-budget amendment and the line-item veto.  These powerful new tools -- together with a ban on unfunded mandates and a constitutional requirement for a super-majority to raise taxes -- will transform the fundamental question Congress asks itself from "whether to cut" to "what to cut."  Having to set priorities will do more to shrink big government than a hundred individual floor fights.<p>
And because the biggest source of spending pressures is the desire of incumbents to ensure their reelection, we will move swiftly to hold a first-ever vote on term limits.  The American people overwhelmingly support term limits for a very sound reason.  Term limits are the surest way to prevent lawmakers from building personal empires with other people's money.<p>
Now, there's been some confusion about this in the press, so let me just clarify.  With Newt Gingrich as our Speaker, we will schedule a vote on term limits.  And I will do all in my power to persuade two-thirds of our colleagues to vote "yes."<p>
One of the least publicized, but most exciting, parts of our Contract is our prescription for reining in what I call the "invisible foot" of government.  Federal regulations cost the American economy six hundred billion dollars a year -- more than we spend on national defense and social welfare combined.  Yet you won't find these costs counted anywhere in the budget.<p>  
Well, our Job Creation and Wage Enhancement Act includes three major reforms which strike fear into the heart of every radical environmentalist.  I'm speaking of the so-called "unholy trinity" of mandatory cost-benefit analysis, a regulatory budget, and compensation for "takings."  I don't want to make your eyes glaze over with the details, but the upshot will be a lot fewer harmful federal rules.
To give the economy a much-needed infusion of risk-taking, our job-creation bill cuts the capital gains tax in half and then ends the tax on illusory gains due only to inflation.  This policy is being called a sop to the rich.  But the truth is, any family that sells its home at a profit realizes a capital gain.  Most of the families that see a capital gain each year are firmly middle class.  Personally, I think we should leave capital gains untaxed altogether, as our international competitors do.  But this cut is an affordable down payment that will create jobs right away.<p>
And that's just the first of our proposed tax cuts.  Today, the typical American family pays 40 percent of its income in taxes -- more than it spends on food, shelter, and clothing combined.  To ease this burden, we want to let families keep a little more of their own money, with five hundred dollars per child taken off their yearly tax bill.  Incidentally, that five hundred dollars is the functional equivalent of a school choice voucher, because parents could use it to send their children to a non-government school.<p>
We'll also let folks save tax-free for that first home, a child's college tuition, or medical expenses.  And to further strengthen families, we want to provide generous tax relief to families who adopt a child or care for an elderly relative at home.<p>
But perhaps the most important thing we can do next year for America's families and for the future of our society is to address the growing crisis of out-of-wedlock births.  Today, three out of every ten births in America occur outside of marriage.  By the year 2000, four out of every ten births will be illegitimate, and among African Americans the rate will be a heart-breaking 75 percent.<p>
Our Personal Responsibility Act would try to end the perverse incentives we've created through our welfare system by channeling welfare and housing benefits away from unwed teenage mothers into block grants which the states would use to give assistance -- but not cash -- to young, fatherless children.<p>
What would this mean?  It would mean young people will tend to exercise more personal responsibility.  And those who find themselves in a difficult situation will be more likely to turn to the traditional "safety net" institutions -- family, friends, churches and private charities -- which will grow stronger when no longer displaced by government charity.  But the biggest beneficiaries will be the children themselves, who will be more likely to have the blessing of two loving parents in the home.<p>
And as I said before, the first hundred days is only the beginning.  We envision -- and we will work for -- a day when every family can send their children to the school of their choice.  We will work for a day when consumers can buy food without having to pay a special surcharge to the government.  And we will work for a day when any young person, of any color or creed, can grow up to fulfill his or her God-given potential in an America with the freest, the most open, and the most productive economy on earth.<p>
Well, I could go on all night, but I know Morton would have my hide.  So I'll just conclude with this thought.<p>
Some of you here can trace your roots to the Goldwater campaign.  And others came in with Ronald Reagan.  And still others of you have joined our ranks only recently.  Well, no matter when we came to the cause, we are all in this room tonight because we've devoted ourselves to a vision.<p>
We see Ronald Reagan's shining city on a hill as more than a fanciful image or a bygone way of life.  It is always before our mind's eye as the America we cherish and dream of, the America we want for our children, the America we strive to be.<p>
This election has given us the best opportunity in our lifetimes to build and strengthen that shining city.  If we do our jobs right over the next two years, if we show determination and discipline and courage and sacrifice, we will not only succeed, we will have redeemed all those years of patient labor spent working for this day.  With your support, with your patience, and with your prayers, I know our ideals will be "back in the saddle" for a good long time.<p>
Thank you.

<title>TH Spotlight on The Leader: Congressman Dick Armey</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
August 21, 1995
<h2>TH Spotlight on The Leader</h2>
</center>
<hr size="5" width="70%">
<p>
Congressman Dick Armey is "one of his party's most prolific and effective idea machines," according of the Wall Street Journal.  His former colleague Vin Weber calls him a "one-man think tank in cowboy boots."
<p>
With his unanimous election as the first Republican Majority Leader since 1954, Armey continued the string of victories that, in just ten years, has transformed him from a little-known economics professor into a leading figure in national politics.
<p>
As principal architect of the Republican "Contract with America," Armey palyed a key role in helping his party win majority control of the House and Senate in 1994.  When he and then -Minority Whip Newt Gingrich decided to present America with a ten-point agenda to be considered in the first 100 days of a Republican Majority, Armey supervised the drafting of the Contract bills and then worked tirelessly to gather  wide public support for the effort.
<p>
Armey is well-known for the flat-tax proposal.  Under his plan, all income would be taxed at a flat 17-percent rate, with no credits or exemptions for low-income earners and children.  A family of four earning $38,600 would pay no federal income tax.  "You could pay your taxes on a form the size of a postcard," he says.
<p>
Armey first came to national prominence through his advocacy of  free-market, pro-growth policies, and his attacks on wasteful federal spending programs.  His 1988 base-closure legislation broke a decade-old log-jam in Congress, enabling the Pentagon to shut down hundreds of obselete military facilities.  Two years later, Armey led a bipartisan coaltion oposing outdated farm programs, an effort which saved taxpayers over $14 billion.  For his budget-cutting efforts, U.S. News and World Report named him an "unsung hero."
<p>
Armey has consistantly advanced and defended the philosophy of President Ronald Reagan.  In 1990, when taxes and regulations were once again on the rise, Armey led House Republicans in opposing the "Budget  Summit Tax Increase" and the re-regulation of the economy.  As the ranking Republican on the Joint Economic Committee in 1991-92, he argued vigorously that Americans of all income classes would benefit instead from lower taxes and economic freedom.
<p>
Following the GOP's 1992 defeats, Armey ran for Conference Chairman, the third-ranking position in the House GOP leadership, arguing the party needed more assertive conservative leadership.  Suprising most pundits, he beats the incumbant, 88 to 84, with strong support from the newly-elected freshman.
<p>
In 1994, Armey's north Dallas district reelected him with 77 percent of the vote.  A native of Cando, N.D., he has worked at a grain elevator and as a telephone lineman.  He holds a B.A. form Jamestown College (ND), a master's from the University of North Dakota, and a Ph.D. from the University of Oklahoma.  He is a former chairman of the University of Texas economics depatment.
<p>
In his new book, The Freedom Revolution, Representative Armey describes the Republican victory in November of 1994 as, "...in every sense, a Freedom Revolution -- a revolution in the bold sense of scrapping an entrenched, arrogant political order, of tossing out the moneychangers.  But, even more, a revolution in the humbler sense of revolving back to our points of origin.  A revolution not so much in power as in faith -- the faith of our fathers."  As Representative Armey states, "This is not a moment for the timid," and through his great writings and speeches one can clearly see that the Leader stands poised on the front lines of the Freedom Revolution.

<h2>"The Flat Tax in Our Future"</h2>
<b>Address by Congressman Dick Armey<br>
on Reintroducing the Freedom and Fairness Restoration Act<br>
National Press Club<br>
Washington, D.C.<br>
July 19, 1995<br></b></center>
<hr>
<p>
Ladies and gentlemen, I hope you'll forgive me for being in such a cheerful mood.  But to paraphrase that old Ethel Merman song, "Everything's coming up flat tax."  
<p>
One of my rules of thumb is when Dick Gephardt is singing out of Dick Armey's hymnal, you know something important is going on out there.  And it's not just Dick Gephardt.  These days it seems you can't swing a dead catfish in this town without hitting the author of a flat-tax plan, or at least a major tax overhaul.  Clearly, the lessons of the Contract with America are being heard loud and clear by the Washington establishment.  The American people are clamoring for a dramatically different kind of government -- one that's smaller, more open, and more accountable.
<p>
As I said in my new book, The Freedom Revolution, I believe the most enduring revolutions bring about the simplest reforms.  The moment the polls closed on November 8th, 1994, today's mindlessly complicated, growth-stifling tax code began tumbling toward the waste-paper basket of history.  And that's why my friend Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama and I are proud today to reintroduce the Freedom and Fairness Restoration Act.  
<p>
This legislation features a tax system so simple you could do your taxes on a postcard, and so fair, it might just restore people's ability to trust their government.  Wouldn't that be a nice change?  Rather than tinkering, Senator Shelby and I scrap the entire code, corporate and personal, and replace it with one flat rate that applies to all Americans.  We leave just one exception: a family allowance to ensure that every family has the first claim to its own income sufficient to support itself.  A typical family of four must earn $33,300 before it owes a penny of federal income tax.  Beyond that, everyone pays a flat 17 percent on all income.  No deductions.  No loopholes.  No tax breaks.  No tables.  No schedules.  No nothing.  
<p>
Each year, you calculate your income, fill out a postcard-size form like the one blown up on this chart, make out a check, and drop it in the mail.  End of process.  You're done with the IRS until next year.  It's as simple as an income tax gets.
<p>
If you have business income, the process is almost identical.  Whether you're IBM or a mom-and-pop grocer, you still fill out a postcard-sized form.  Just subtract expenses from revenues and pay 17 percent on the remainder.  That's it.  Instead of taking eleven hours to do your taxes, as the average family does today, you could do it in eleven minutes.  Maybe less.
<p>
Imagine the new world that will dawn.  Gone will be today's 480 different tax forms, and the 280 forms that explain how to fill out the 480 forms.  Whole armies of tax attorneys and lobbyists will be out looking for more productive work.  And as for all those IRS agents and auditors?  Well, instead of harassing you, they'll be sitting silently at their desks, like Maytag Repairmen, feeling bored and, I suspect, just a little lonely.
<p>
There is an important change from last year's bill.  We've added a new provision that requires a three-fifths supermajority to raise the rate, add additional rates, create loopholes, or shrink the family allowance.  We are absolutely determined that the flat tax stay flat.
<p>
And I can tell you, this idea is catching fire.  You can feel it.  The flat tax is in America's future.  Why am I so confident?  Well, for one thing, over the past year, I've received more than 5,000 intensely enthusiastic letters praising the bill.  And in just the past month, I've received nearly that many messages over the Internet.  Yes, the flat tax has gone "third wave" with its very own home page on the worldwide web.  The address is armey.flattax.
<p>
From this mail, I can tell you there are four basic reasons why people like the flat tax.  They know it's simple, it's honest, it's pro-growth, and it's fair -- four virtues notably lacking in our current system.
<p>
First of all, as I've said, it's incredibly simple.  No longer will the American people spend anything like 5.4 billion man-hours figuring their taxes each year, which incidentally is more man-hours than it takes to produce every car, van, and truck built in the United States.  By one estimate, this needless time and paperwork costs our economy a staggering $232 billion a year, more than the entire federal deficit.  That's a potential savings of $900 for every man, woman, and child in America.
<p>
Second, unlike today's code, the flat tax is honest.  By sweeping away all the special-interest loopholes, it shows us right up front how much government is really costing us.  And by eliminating the code's social engineering and economic tinkering, it shifts power from politicians to private citizens.  It has the decency to respect our ability to make our own financial judgments.
<p>
Third, the flat tax is incredibly pro-growth, planting the seeds for rapid rises in output and wages.  Any professional economist worth his Ph.D. will tell you the chief cause of stagnant wages is our nation's anemic saving rate.  And the chief cause of our low saving rate is today's destructive policy of taxing savings twice -- once when a dollar is earned, and then again when it produces a return.  The flat tax wipes out this perverse bias against saving in a single bold stroke.  As a result, savings will rise.  The pool of capital will grow.  Workers will be better equipped and trained.  And their output will expand, leading to bigger paychecks.
<p>
But a higher saving rate is not enough.  We also need greater rewards for work and risk-taking, the true engines of wealth-creation.  Instead of punishing entrepreneurship with steeply progressive tax rates, as we do today, the flat tax slashes the top rate from 40 percent to 17, enabling America to unfetter her would-be Thomas Edisons and Bill Gates to create the inventions and industries and high-paying jobs of tomorrow.  Today, people rightly ask themselves why they should invent the proverbial "better mousetrap" when the government is going to take away half their earnings anyway?  The flat tax would make such risks worthwhile, while making America a magnet for foreign investment capital.  As a result, as you can see from this chart, the income of the average American family of four would be approximately $4,300 higher in 2002 than it would if we retained the current system.  Higher savings, more risk-taking, higher wages.
<p>
The fourth and final reason people like the flat tax is also, in my view, the most politically powerful.  It's fair.  Let me tell a quick story.  I was walking out of a hotel in Dallas one day, and the fellow that parks the cars approached me, and he said, "Congressman, I love your flat tax.  And the reason I love your flat tax is it treats everybody the same."  I think that gentleman revealed something very profound, something very American, in his view of fairness.  In America, we define fairness as treating everybody the same.  Rich or poor, black or white, we're all equal.
<p>
That's why liberals ought to love the flat tax.  When you tax everyone at the same rate, the rich pay a lot more in taxes than the middle class or the poor.  With three times the income, you pay three times the taxes.  Ten times the income, ten times the taxes.  And so on.  Now if you ask me, that seems pretty fair.  But even beyond that, by the traditional liberal definition, our flat tax plan is "progressive" -- as progressive as the code we had under President Kennedy.  As the chart shows, thanks to the generous family allowance, even with a flat rate, a family making $33,300 a year would pay no federal income tax, while a family making $50,000 would pay six percent of its income, and a family making 200,000 a year would pay 14 percent of its income.  This means about 20 million lower-income Americans would be dropped from the tax rolls altogether.  What's not for a liberal to love?
<p>
So there you have it.  Simplicity, honesty, growth, fairness -- four reasons people love the flat tax.  But now allow me to take a few minutes to address the four most commonly heard concerns about our plan.
<p>
The first concern comes from the class-warfare crowd -- and, I'm sad to say, a few careless reporters -- who are asserting that the Armey flat tax does not tax investment income.  They say we're letting wealthy stockholders off the tax hook.  This is completely untrue.  Our plan taxes investment income at exactly the same rate as wages.  What we don't do is tax it twice.  
<p>
Take a dollar of corporate-generated earnings.  Today, it's taxed at the business level, and then taxed again when it's paid out as a dividend.  That's double taxation, which, as I've said, depresses the saving rate.  Our bill, by contrast, taxes every dollar of business-generated income at the business level, once and only once.  And it does so far more efficiently than today's system, because it eliminates the need for taxpayers and businesses to keep billions of pieces of paper for reporting purposes.  So let me repeat.  Under our plan, all income is taxed at the same 17 percent rate with no exceptions.  To suggest or imply that we do not tax investment income is a misrepresentation of the plan.
<p>
A second question of concern comes from people who ask, "Will eliminating the home mortgage interest deduction hurt the real-estate industry?"  The answer is "Not as much as lower interest rates will help it."  While our plan does end the interest deduction, it also ends the tax on interest earnings.  As a result, nothing changes.  Both borrowers and lenders are held harmless.  What the homeowner loses in deductions, he gains in lower interest rates.  And in fact he comes out ahead on the deal, because the flat tax ends the bias against saving, causing the capital pool to swell and driving interest rates down even further.  That's good news for the housing industry.
<p>
And frankly, homeowners are not as wedded to this supposedly "sacred" deduction as you might think.  By a three-to-one margin in a recent poll, homeowners said they're willing to forego the mortgage deduction if that loss is offset by a reduction in their tax bill by a similar amount, which our plan does.  So I'm confident homeowners, homebuilders, Realtors, and lenders will all support our approach, knowing they're not losing a tax break -- they're gaining a new and better tax code, and a bigger economy.
<p>
And that leads me to an observation.  Ladies and gentlemen, the American dream is not just owning your own home, it's getting your kids out of it.  We want a high-growth, low-inflation economy with opportunities where our children can get out of school, get a good job, raise their own family, and be able to afford their own home.  And the flat tax goes a long way to helping them realize that dream.
<p>
The third major concern about our plan comes from some of our conservative friends who are worried charity would suffer without the charitable deduction.  My guess is they won't even miss it.  For one thing, almost half of charitable contributions today are not even claimed as deductions, so ending the break would have no effect on that giving.  But more tellingly, during the 1980s, the so-called "decade of greed," charitable giving actually went up even as its value as a tax break declined dramatically.  Because President Reagan cut the top marginal rate from 70 percent to 28 percent, the deduction became far less valuable for tax purposes.  And yet total charitable giving doubled.  Religious contributions nearly tripled.  Why?  Because people had more money in their pockets.  Their taxes were lower, and their incomes higher.  The American people responded to greater freedom and prosperity as they've always done, by opening their hearts and their wallets to their neighbors.
<p>
And finally, the fourth major concern with the flat tax is that it will explode the deficit.  Those who want to preserve the current, complicated tax structure have been repeating an estimate of "$200 billion dollars a year" like a mantra.  Well, as Ronald Reagan used to say, "The trouble with our opponents is not that they are ignorant, but that they know so much that isn't so."  I've said from the beginning that I want our proposal to be debated on its merits, and not on the issue of revenue loss.  I've designed it to provide a $40 billion tax cut, paid for by spending cuts.  I've asked the Joint Committee on Taxation to score our bill.  And I'm confident Joint Tax will find it to be deficit neutral.  When it does, the red herring of revenue loss will be laid to rest for good.
<p>
What, then, is the Freedom and Fairness Restoration Act?  It's a tax plan so simple you could do your taxes on a postcard.  But it's more than that.  It's also a vision of what America can be again -- a formula for rejuvenating our economy, freeing our entrepreneurial talent, and reviving stagnant family wages.  It's a common-sense plan for returning to a government that is simple, honest, and fair to all our citizens.  And who knows?  It might just restore people's ability to trust their government.  And this is why I believe the flat tax is in America's future.
<p>
Thank you.

<h2>Toast by Congressman Dick Armey</h2>
<b>American Spectator Tribute to Ronals Reagan<br>
Washington, D.C.<br>
May 17, 1995</b><br>
</center>
<hr>
<p>
Thank you, Ed Crane, for that kind introduction.  I was just thinking to myself ... if only this were a fund-raiser for the Reagan '96 campaign.<p>
But thank you all.  I'm honored to be here tonight to help you celebrate my hero, Ronald Reagan.  Thinking about Reagan's life, I'm reminded of what Yogi Berra said when informed that the City of Dublin had elected a Jewish mayor: "Only in America!"  Think of it.  Here was a former movie actor who brought down the most wicked regime the world has ever known, largely through the power of his words.  Only in America.<p>
They called him a far-right extremist -- said he was too conservative to be president.  And yet he won two landslides.  And when he left the Oval Office, he was one of the most truly beloved men ever to have held that high office.  Only in America.<p>
You know, that great lady, Clare Booth Luce, once offered the theory that American presidents are remembered by a single sentence.  Thus we say "Washington was the father of his country," "Lincoln saved the Union and freed the slaves," "FDR led the nation through depression and war."  And so naturally the question arises: How will Ronald Reagan be remembered?  Back while he was still president, Clare Booth Luce suggested: "He restored our pride and revived the economy."  Later, Margaret Thatcher would offer a pithier assessment: "He won the cold war without firing a shot."  Well, I hope it's not too presumptuous of me to add my own suggestion to the list.  I would simply say, "He liberated the world."  Yes, the world.  And not just from Soviet communism.  No, it goes deeper.  He liberated us from the peculiarly 20th-century notion that human progress depends on planners and experts.<p>
He had an abiding faith in ordinary people, because, unlike so many of this century's so-called wise men, he could see the inherent dignity of the human spirit.  Endlessly and eloquently, he reminded us that "democracy is the most deeply honorable form of government ever devised by man" and that the free market is the greatest engine of prosperity ever conceived.  He was the sort of person who really believed, as he said in his first Inaugural, that "you can see heroes every day going in and out of factory gates," and "you meet heroes across a counter -- and they're on both sides of that counter."
Because this humble, optimistic man of conviction was our president -- because this former actor dared to love freedom more than peace -- we stand tonight on the verge of an era of unimagined peace, prosperity, and personal liberty.  Only in America.<p>
Ladies and gentlemen, a toast.  To Ronald Reagan, the man who liberated the world.<p>

<title>Dick Armey Speech at Cato</title>

<h2>Address by Congressman Dick Armey</h2>
<b>At the Dedication of the Hayek Auditorium<br>
Cato Institute<br>
Washington, D.C.<br>
May 9, 1995<br></b>
</center>
<hr>
<p>
Thank you, Ed Crane, for that kind introduction.  It's not just a pleasure, but also a tremendous honor, for me to be here this evening to honor the memory and ideas of Friedrich Hayek.<p>
Fifty years after The Road to Serfdom, the closing thought of Hayek's great treatise still rings true: "The guiding principle of any attempt to create a world of free men is this.  A policy of freedom for the individual is the only truly progressive policy."<p>
Sometimes we forget how radical this statement was in 1944.   Hayek's little book evoked contempt from his fellow intellectuals.  To suggest, in the midst of the Second World War, that central planning does not work and is generally self-defeating and dangerous -- this was a dramatic statement which the political class could not accept.  To argue that government should be so limited as to be able to do little beyond protecting life, liberty, and property -- this was antiquated, eccentric, even bizarre.  And yet, today, looking back over the decades, who would say that the socialists and central planners were right, and Hayek wrong? <p> 
Events, of course, have proved him prophetic.  Indeed, he had the good fortune to live long enough not only to see National Socialism smashed, but also to see Soviet Socialism relegated to the ash heap of history.  And I'd like to think he is up there somewhere tonight, smiling down on us, as big government liberalism follows those two great, tragic "isms" into oblivion.<p>
What was it that so enraged left-wingers about Hayek?  It was the assertion that liberal paternalism is just as dangerous to humanity in the long run as fascism or communism.  Liberalism, he argued, differs from those evil systems only in degree, not in kind.  Hayek was a humble man, genuinely humble before Reality.  And this humility gave his words the boldness of honesty and the audacity of truth.  And the liberals could not forgive him.<p>
Reading back over The Road to Serfdom, I could not help thinking that a conservative is someone who says, "I'll believe it when I see it," and a liberal is someone who says, "I'll see it when I believe it."  While Hayek always called himself a liberal in the classical sense of "one who is for liberty," he was truly conservative in the sense I'm talking about.  He never thought human nature or the constitution of reality could be changed or reshaped by force of will.  He was that rarity, the intellectually honest man in an intellectually dishonest age.  What an ideal namesake for an auditorium dedicated to the promotion of human freedom.<p>  
And what an ideal think tank to have helping our new majority transform Washington.  Your devotion to truth, like that of Hayek, has cast you as mavericks.  It has put you at odds with the received opinions of the conventional left and right.  But it is this principled consistency that has made the Cato Institute so "hot" these days.  I mean, who would have imagined, a year ago, that the leaders of Congress would be looking to those"extremist libertarians" over at Cato for advice?  Who could have imagined we would be discussing abolishing whole programs, turning others back to the states, repealing ill-conceived laws, and dismantling cabinet agencies, just as you've always recommended?<p>

You have been successful because you believe what Hayek never ceased to point out -- and indeed what the entire twentieth century makes plain -- that freedom, and only freedom, works.<p>

What a hopeful time this is.  Socialism is finished.  The liberal welfare state is passe.  And I'm more optimistic than I've ever dared to be that we are entering a new era of limited government.  Congress is run by Americans who believe ordinary people can be trusted to spend their own money and make their own decisions.  We will send power back from the hallowed halls of Congress to the more hallowed kitchen tables of America, where night after night families bow their heads in thanks and make decisions about education, charity, jobs, spending, debt, and personal behavior with a wisdom and a compassion that no agency, no cabinet, no Congress could ever match.<p>

Just today, we shook the foundations of Washington by doing something that hasn't been done for a quarter-century.  We proposed a balanced budget.<p>

True to our word, and despite the skeptics, we've produced a specific, detailed plan to balance the budget in seven years.  And we get there with real spending restraint.  No accounting gimmicks.  No tax increases.  In Hayekian fashion, we ask basic questions: Does the typical American family really need a Department of Commerce?  Could our children learn without an Education Department?  Could the Republic survive without a National Endowment for the Arts?  Would the economy grind to a halt without an Interstate Commerce Commission?<p>
While this budget faces a tough road, we believe the American people demand no less, for the sake of freedom.  Americans want, not just a smaller government, but the government of the Framers of our Constitution.  And that's what we intend to restore.<p>

Can I give you a peak at where we're headed?  Just look at Estonia.  Three years ago, that tiny republic was a typical, ex-Soviet basket case, with negative growth, staggering unemployment, and skyrocketing inflation.  But in late 1992, Prime Minister Mart Laar's reform government decided to throw the dice.  They abolished all tariffs.  They privatized 90 percent of state-owned enterprises.  They scrapped every last subsidy, right down to farm subsidies.  To create a sound money supply, they threw out the worthless ruble and created a new local currency, pegged to the Mark.  Here's my favorite part: They established a flat tax.  And yes, they balanced their national budget.<p>
What's the result?  Today, the Estonian economy is growing at a vigorous 6 percent a year, twice America's growth rate.  Unemployment is just two percent.  Inflation has collapsed from 1,000 percent to forty.  Sixty thousand new private businesses have sprung up, in a population of only two million.<p>

Mart Laar came to my office the other day to recount his country's remarkable transformation.  He described a nation of people who are harder-working, more virtuous -- yes, more virtuous, because the market punishes immorality -- and more hopeful about the future than they've ever been in their history.  I asked Mr. Laar where his government got the idea for these reforms.  Do you know what he replied?  He said, "We read Milton Friedman and F. A. Hayek."<p>

Ladies and gentlemen, if Estonia is not a vindication of everything we believe in -- from free trade to privatization to sound money to balanced budgets -- I am at a loss as to how else one could validate our ideas.  To quote my friend and hero, Thomas Sowell, we don't have faith that freedom works.  We have evidence.<p>

And by the way, if I can advertise for a moment, it turns out Estonians love their flat tax.  They like the postcard-size return.  Compliance has actually gone up.  People are willing to pay their taxes voluntarily now, because they feel the system is fair.  Their only complaint: They think the rate is too high.  But of course, there's an easy way to cure that.<p>  

And speaking of taxes, isn't it amazing that the debate over how we restructure America's tax system for the next century is coming down to a contest between a flat tax and a consumption tax?  How far we've come.<p>
As I say, I'm hopeful for the future of freedom.  But I do have concerns.  Let me just mention one.  More and more these days, immigrants are being viewed as if they were the source of America's problems.  It seems the old Malthusian notion that people are a drain is making one of its regular revivals.  Well, it's good to know Cato has always held fast against this misguided teaching.  At a time when some are turning against immigrants, you continue to view human beings, in Julian Simon's beautiful phrase, as the ultimate resource.<p>

Anti-immigrationism has always been ironic, because throughout our history, newcomers have been a source of strength, not weakness.  America still attracts the world's best talent.  And surely that is no liability.  Think of it.  We can avail ourselves of much of the world's intellectual wealth simply by opening our doors.  America need not grow old and tired.  We can always take in new talent and new ideas and new blood.  No ruling elite can dominate us for very long, because we always have younger, smarter, more entrepreneurial spirits willing and eager to move up.<p>
The impulse to limit immigration is really a manifestation of the protectionist impulse.  And it's misguided for the same reasons.  It's a desire to use government's monopoly of coercive power to benefit oneself at the expense of somebody else.  And that, as Hayek taught us, is self-defeating.  But the biggest problem with the closed-border idea is that it embraces the liberals' world view.  And thus it leads logically down the path to bigger government.  Should we have an orderly immigration policy?  Of course.  Should we give the Border Patrol appropriate tools?  Yes.  But in so doing, should we infringe on the personal liberties of law-abiding Americans?  Absolutely not.  We need immigration reform.  But our goal should be to make immigration more orderly, not more restrictive.
<p>
We have too many immigrants coming here to get on welfare.  But the reasonable response is not to build a police state.  It's to shrink the welfare state.<p>
We have an educational system that no longer promotes assimilation.  But the sensible response is not to exclude foreign children.  It's to scrap multiculturalism in the schools and give parents real school choice.<p>
Should we reduce legal immigration?  Well, I'm hard pressed to think of a single problem that would be solved by shutting off the supply of willing and eager new Americans.  If anything, in the spirit of Hayek, we should be thinking about increasing legal immigration.<p>
Should we turn private employers into auxiliary border guards?  I think unfunded mandates are bad enough without that.<p>
And as for a national ID card, which I understand the Administration is considering, let me just say this.  I oppose it.  And I will fight it.  Let me be clear here.  What some are calling a "national computer registry" is just a euphemism for a national ID card.  And any system in which Americans would be forced to possess such a card, for any reason, is an abomination and wholly at odds with the American tradition of individual freedom.<p>
Lest I close on such a defiant note, let me just leave you by saying how much comfort it gives me to know that when it comes to this issue, as with so many others, we'll be able to count on our good friends at Cato.<p>
The coming months promise major battles with the liberals over spending, taxes, crime, education, the environment, welfare, property rights, and a hundred others.  And as always, Cato will be there for us, arming our legions of righteousness with facts, statistics, policy briefs, and four-color charts.<p>
For like the great man we are celebrating tonight, you have the boldness of honesty and the audacity of truth.  You believe, as he always reminded us, that true human progress lies not in power or planning, but in markets and the Rule of Law.  It is in these safeguards, and these alone, that we may dare hope to avoid the road to serfdom and "create a world of free men."<p>
Thank you.

<h2>Address by Congressman Dick Armey</h2>
<b>Conservative Political Action Conference<br>
Washington, D.C.<br>
February 10, 1995</b><br>
</center>
<hr>
<p>
Thank you, Wayne La Pierre, for that kind introduction.  What a pleasure it is to be here with all of my old friends at CPAC, the real heroes of the Second Reagan Revolution. And what a special pleasure to be a conservative at this exciting time in history.<p>  
Something dramatic is happening in this town.  I've never seen anything like it.  Democrats are falling all over each other to vote for smaller government, middle class tax cuts, the line-item veto, even a balanced budget amendment.  Dick Gephardt is talking about the flat tax.  And President Clinton is reportedly going to name an aircraft carrier the "USS Ronald Reagan."<p>
It all reminds me of that old liberal protest song, "The times, they are a-changin'."  Well, the times are changing, all right.  But not in the direction the liberals were hoping.<p>
America is moving forward, forward to the freedoms envisioned by our Founding Fathers.  Far from being some antiquated, outdated idea from the past, smaller government is really the newest and most radical idea in the long history of human politics.  And thanks to your grass-roots efforts, it's undergoing a long-overdue revival.<p>
I believe we are witnessing one of those great historical transitions when one era sets, and a new, more exciting era dawns, heralding undreamed-of possibilities.  It's a time when the American people are willing to rethink all the old assumptions and dare to entertain the most sweeping change, the kind of change contained in our Contract with America.<p>
Our Contract is based on a simple realization.  Big Government as an idea is finished.  Big Government does not work.  Only freedom works.  Whether the issue is poverty, crime, health care, education, or the environment, freedom offers a better outcome than does government.  How do I know freedom works?  Because you can't help noticing a difference between the Post Office and Federal Express.<p>  
How do I know freedom works?  Because in the 1980s this nation spent one-third more, in real terms, on government monopoly schools.  And test scores went down.  Meanwhile, private schools and even home-schooling parents are turning out Harvard material on shoestring budgets.<p>
How do I know freedom works?  Because 30 years and five trillion dollars in welfare spending have produced a permanent underclass, fatherless families, skyrocketing crime rates, and one out of every three babies being born out-of-wedlock.  Meanwhile, churches and charities are out there actually solving these problems and changing lives, at a fraction of the cost.  To paraphrase my friend and hero, Thomas Sowell, we don't have faith in freedom,
we have evidence.<p>
If you think about it, the Founding Fathers are still the world's only true progressives.  The socialists, the environmentalists, the multiculturalists, the labor-union monopolists, the so-called consumer advocates, the central planners of all stripes, these are the real reactionaries of our day.  Their idea of progress is more government control.  But George Washington's idea of progress was more freedom.  And that's the philosophy behind our Contract with America.  We firmly believe what Ronald Reagan said so many years ago:  "There is no such thing as a left or right.  There is only an up or down: up to man's age-old dream, the ultimate in individual freedom consistent with law and order -- or down to the ant-heap of totalitarianism."<p>
Well, tonight, I'm happy to report that in these first, busy 38 days, America has begun slowly moving upward.  We've racked up win after win on our Contract.  We've picked up 50 to 70 Democrats on almost every bill.  Meanwhile, the left-wing liberals are, to quote that old Frank Sinatra song, "bewitched, bothered, and bewildered."<p>
On Day One, the longest opening day in the history of the House, we overhauled our rules from top to bottom.  To ensure accountability, we made Congress obey the same laws it imposes on the private sector.  We banned closed-door committee meetings and put an end to ghost voting.  To promote efficiency, we abolished dozens of committees and subcommittees,
cut out hundreds of staff positions, and swept away all those frivolous commemorative bills like "National Asparagus Day" and "Pizza and Pasta Week."  To keep ourselves honest, we reformed our budget terminology, so that from now on, the term "spending cut" will actually mean a cut, and not just a smaller increase.  And best of all, to safeguard the American taxpayer, we passed a rule requiring a three-fifths supermajority to raise income taxes.  And that was just Day One.<p>
Being federalists, naturally we've moved quickly to restore the proper balance of power between Washington and the states, with a bill that effectively bans unfunded federal mandates.  From now on, if Congress wants the sovereign states or private citizens to do something, Congress is going to have to provide the funds or just not do it.<p>
And because we believe the federal government should limit itself strictly to those activities which are truly national in scope, it was a distinct pleasure for us this week to present to President Reagan a very special birthday gift, the line-item veto.<p>
Perhaps the most deeply held conviction we conservatives cherish is a belief in self-restraint, national as well as personal.  We disdain government borrowing.  We reject President Roosevelt's famous quip that "we merely owe it to ourselves."  The truth of the matter is we're spending our children's inheritance.  Today's deficit is tomorrow's tax increase.  Right now, every child in America is carrying $18,000 in federal national debt.  And that's why, in my view, the crowning achievement of these first 38 days has been our passage of a Balanced Budget Amendment to the Constitution.<p>
Without this amendment, the focused and well-organized special interests will always be able to combine to defeat the widely dispersed and unfocused public interest.  Only if members of Congress have no legal choice but to set priorities, accept tradeoffs, and cut spending, can we resist the temptation to raid our posterity's piggy banks.<p>
Now, as you know, in passing the amendment, we lost the tax-limitation clause.  I was very, very disappointed.  But let me assure you.  We will return to fight another day on this issue.  We have already scheduled April 15, 1996, as the day we will vote on a tax-limitation amendment to the United States Constitution.<p>
And we've got plenty of other votes scheduled, too.  We have 62 more days to go.  And there are plenty of exciting changes in store.  Allow me to mention just a few.<p>
The crime problem is caused by criminals , not impersonal social forces.  So we'll pass a crime bill that funds more police and prisons, not basketball and ballet classes.<p>
Families are the fundamental unit of society.  They should have the first claim on their own hard-earned dollars.  So we'll vote to let families lower their yearly tax bill by $500 per child.	The economy is being strangled by excessive regulation.  So we'll vote on a sweeping regulatory reform bill to, in effect, legalize capitalism in the United States.<p>
The nation is saddled with too many lawsuits pleasing too many trial lawyers.  So we'll vote on a strong legal-reform bill that I call "Dan Quayle's revenge."<p>
The welfare system has become a source of out-of-wedlock births and family breakdown, which in turn promotes social breakdown, gangs, drugs, violence, and despair. We've been so busy imposing our idea of compassion, we've never bothered to stop and think of what effect our actions are having on young children.<p>  
So we'll vote on a sweeping Personal Responsibility Act that will abolish upwards of 70 existing federal welfare programs and entitlements, including the big one, AFDC.  Then we'll take the money this saves, cut it by ten percent, cap it, and send it back to the states with virtually no strings attached.  The only restrictions we'll put on the money are as follows: "You must spend it to help the needy.  You cannot give cash to unwed teenage mothers.  And you cannot give it to able-bodied people who refuse to work."  And that's it.  This is a "tough love" solution that really will end welfare as we know it.<p>
Finally, because the Founding Fathers would be shocked and dismayed by a Congress of politicians-for-life, we will hold the first-ever vote on term limits.  Now, I have to tell you this is going to be a tough fight.  Making term limits a reality will take all of our resources, and all of our energies, and every last drop of commitment we can muster.  And, as in the past, we do count on your help.<p>
Obviously, the Contract with America is not a timid document.  In fact, the Contract will do more to dismantle the welfare-regulatory state in 100 days than anything I've seen in my ten years in Congress.  But as President Reagan used to say, "You ain't seen nothin' yet."  It's after the first hundred days that the fun really begins.
<p>  
Come May, you will see some of the most dramatic changes in government anyone can remember.  We'll pass a huge 1996 budget resolution and 13 appropriations bills that I think you'll find very pleasing.  I can't give you all the details tonight, but, for starters, how does defunding the National Endowment for the Arts sound?  Not just cut, defund.  And what would you say if we privatized the Corporation for Public Broadcasting?  And let me ask you this.  What if we dismantled the Department of Education?  How about if we turned off the lights at the Department of Energy?  How about Commerce?  How about HUD?  How about the Post Office?  
<p>
And ladies and gentlemen, I would be remiss if I didn't mention farm subsidies, helium subsidies, Amtrak, mass transit, Davis-Bacon, Legal Services, the REA, the TVA, the EDA, the ICC, and the MPP.<p>  
And I'm not through yet.  Allow me to ask your opinion on one last thing.  Ladies and gentlemen, are you interested in scrapping the Internal Revenue Code and replacing it with a flat tax?<p>
As I've said all along, the Contract with America is merely the shakedown cruise for the Counter-Revolution.  Of course, in order to make the voyage, the ship must first make it safely out of port.  If we're going to achieve these sweeping reforms I just mentioned, we must first win the lasting trust of a rightly suspicious public.  And to do that, we must fulfill our Contract with America.  All our dreams, all our hopes for our children's future, hang on these next 62 days.<p>  
These are amazing times, when a whole new era is cresting the horizon.  And sweeping change is in the air.  Tonight, the course of freedom runs more swiftly, and our future shines more brightly, than we dared imagine just yesterday.<p>
Many years ago, when we conservatives were on the fringes of political life, in a speech that still rings in my memory, Barry Goldwater urged our fledgling forces to fight on, "until our cause has won the day, inspired the world, and shown the way to a tomorrow worthy of all our yesteryears."<p>
Well, my friends, we have won the day. We have inspired the world.  And tonight we have it in our power to make real, the tomorrow Barry Goldwater could only dare to dream.  So let us renew our resolve.  Let us quicken our pace. And arm in arm, we will secure the rebirth of freedom.<p>
Thank you, and God bless you.

<b>Senator Dole</b>: Thank you very much.  It's a privilege for me to be here, and a privilege to see Ben Franklin again.  He was just telling me about his childhood with Senator Thurmond.  But Ben Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, and the rest of our founding fathers probably never imagined the
 technology that produced the computer age, and the Internet.  But one thing they did imagine -- a
 government closer to the people; a government that listened to the people, and a public that took active
 involvement in the issues today, and that is what Town Hall is all about.  Thanks to Town Hall, Americans are into the information age and the super-highway to take a detour around the traditional media road blocks.  And I am just one of countless Americans, who will be taking a right on the information highway, and heading straight for Town Hall.<p><hr>

<title> Town Hall Launch</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<h2>Town Hall Launch</h2>
June 29, 1995
</center>
<p>
<hr size="3" width="45%">
<p>
<b>Tim Butler</b>: About four years ago <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Ed Feulner</a> had an idea.  Now there is nothing new there, but he understood that a new emerging on-line technology was going to have a tremendous impact on the way America and the world communicates.  He also understood that the conservative movement must embrace
 these new communications opportunities.  The result of that is Town Hall.  Today Town Hall moves into a new dimension, the Internet.  And I'm very pleased to introduce the man behind the dream, Dr. Edwin J. Feulner, Jr., Town Hall's Chairman of the Board.
<p>
<b>Ed Feulner</b>: Thanks very much Tim, for that very nice introduction.  I appreciate it.  I'm very pleased to have with me my colleague from the Town Hall Board of Directors, Ed Capanno whose real job is publisher of <a href="/nationalreview/welcome.html"><i>National Review</i></a>.  Town Hall, from its very beginning, has been a joint project of <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a> and <i>National Review</i>.  And Ed, it's been a great learning curb for us, certainly, and we've been through a lot, but I think today bears witness to the fact that it has been worth working at.
<p>
 We are here today to officially launch Town Hall, the first conservative community on the Internet.  Like most communities, Town Hall has been created to serve people.  To provide an innovative site for political discourse and dialogue -- an international electronic center where new ideas and policies can be debated and studied by anyone who's interested.
<p>
 And Town Hall will use the technology of the Information Age -- the Internet -- to create this community of literally millions of people around the world.
<p>
Two hundred years ago, people concerned about the direction of their government and committed to the ideals of freedom and liberty, joined together to talk and argue, to dream and debate radical new ideas to make their lives and the lives of their families, their children, and their communities better.  In that respect, Town Hall will be no different.
<p>
I am very proud that the Heritage Foundation and National Review, together, created Town Hall as the conservative meeting place on the Internet, and I am equally proud that, through Town Hall, will continue to play a part in the Second Great American Revolution that has swept Washington and the halls of Congress like a great whirlwind.  Today, we have with us, the Revolution's two great generals in this extraordinary battle of ideas.
<p>
 From the Senate, we have Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, who continues to fight for America's families after a lifetime of commitment to his country.  In war and in peace, Bob Dole is and always will be a national leader -- a man of action and a man of accomplishment.
<p>
On the House front, everything <a href="http://www.house.gov/mbr_dir/GA06.html">Newt Gingrich</a> does shows how deeply he cares about his country and the hopes and dreams of its people.  He is a man of endless ideas whose extraordinary leadership has literally changed the course of history.
<p>
 We stand here in the shadow of the Capitol -- at one end of a long continuum -- a continuum that began
 with the goosefeather pen of Thomas Paine and reaches across time to the computers that sit here on this stage.  I can't think of anyone better to launch this historic connection than these two men -- leading the charge to preserve the Founding Fathers' great legacy of freedom.  Please join me in welcoming Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich.
<p>
Gentlemen, thank you both for joining us.  We're honored to have you here.  Before I ask you to take a seat at the controls, I want to bring out another special guest we are privileged to have with us today.  Just to make sure that the Founding Fathers would have approved, we've been able to produce someone who ought to know.  Please welcome in his 290th year, the father of invention and innovation, the Honorable Benjamin Franklin.
<p>
Senator Dole, Mr. Speaker will you each take a seat at the keyboards and Mr. Franklin, will you do the honors, please?
<p>
<b>Benjamin Franklin</b>: Let it be known that on this, the 29th day of June in the year of our Lord one thousand
  nine hundred and ninety-five, we open wide the doors of Town Hall in a spirit of experiment and good
  will; to preserve liberty and prevent tyranny, and to seek change in the principles, opinions, sentiments and affections of the people as we share in the progress of human knowledge.  Gentlemen, on the count of  three.... one ... two ... three ... start your engines.
<p>
<b>Ed Feulner</b>: Alright!  Town Hall is officially launched!
<p>
Thank you very much, Senator Dole, Mr. Speaker and, of course, you too Mr. Franklin.  Thomas Jefferson would be proud.  It is now my happy duty to introduce you to the charter members of Town Hall -- America's leading conservative organizations who vision and creativity have spurred them to join in this innovative effort.  I'm very please to welcome them to the Town Hall Community.
<p>
As I introduce their representatives, we will all get a look at each group's site as it will appear in Town Hall on big screen.
<p>
<ul>
<li>First, please welcome, <a href="/conservative/kbio.html">David Keene</a>, Chairman of the <a href="/conservative/welcome.html">American Conservative Union</a>.
<li>Next, Shades of the Boston Tea Party, is Grover Norquist, President of <a href="/atr/1.html">Americans for Tax Reform</a>.
<li>It is a great pleasure to welcome Charlie Kupperman Executive Director of <a href="/empower/welcome.html ">Empower America</a>.
<li><a href="/townhall/FRC/bauer.html">Gary Bauer</a>, President of the <a href="/townhall/FRC/welcome.html">Family Research Council</a>.  Welcome aboard, Gary.

<li>The president of the <a href="/sbsc/home.html">Small Business Survival Committee</a>, Karen Kerrigan.
<li>We're indeed pleased to announce that the <a href="/wash_times/">Washington Times National Weekly Edition</a> will be on Town Hall and represented is its Editor-in-Chief, Wes Pruden.
<li><a href="/yaf/home.html">The Young America's Foundation's</a>, <a href="/yaf/sharp.html">Michelle Sharp</a>, Director of Lectures, is here.
<li>And Finally, my colleague -- <a href="/heritage/staff/truluck.htm">Phil Truluck</a>, the Executive Vice President of <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>.
</ul>
<p>
As Tim said, it's a great starting line-up, but only the beginning of a conservative community.  We thank  you all for being here today.  I would now like to give you all an opportunity to hear from our two  wonderful leaders here today.  It is truly an honor for me to first introduce to you the great Speaker of the House of Representatives -- the Honorable Newt Gingrich.

<b>Speaker Gingrich</b></a>: I want to say first of all that I am delighted to be here.  I was explaining to Senator Dole that last night we pretended we were the Senate.  And we ran all night, and we're not use to this, we didn't get out till almost ten o'clock this morning.  He's used to these kind of marathons where you have to go all the time, but we're not quite that tough.  I'm a little blurry eyed, but delighted to be here.  I believe this is part of entering the information age, I think that this is a very important commitment to reach out and to allow literally people around the entire planet to be able to interact, have ideas, to have dialogues, to know
what's going on.  And to contribute good ideas.  And I'm just delighted that Ed Feulner brought all of us
together here today, to participate in creating Town Hall, and I can tell you from our stand point we look
forward to having lots of Americans, and frankly lots of people all across the world, to share with us their
ideas and their comments, and then to work with the various groups who will have their pages on this site.  We're very grateful, and I'm delighted to behalf of the House Republicans to be here to help inaugurate this.<p><br>

<CENTER><H3>Winning the Next Education Battle</H3><p>
<A HREF="mailto:spaldingm@heritage.org">Matthew Spalding</A><br>

</CENTER>
<hr>
<br>
  Education will surely be an important issue in the 1996 presidential election.  President Clinton
regularly uses the issue as a weapon against Republican budget austerity and fiscal conservatism,
as was the case when a smaller than anticipated increase in federal funding for school lunches
(but an increase none the less) became a "cut" in the program and thus an attack on the whole
education system.<P>
    The next battle is likely to be over the financial aid program for college students--specifically the
Clinton administration's plan to provide direct government funded student loans.  Congress in
1993 approved a phase-in of the program over at least five years.  The Administration hopes to
accelerate the program to reach 100% participation in 1997-8.  Rep. William Goodling (R-PA),
Chairman of the Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee, and Nancy Kassebaum
(R-Kan), Chairman of Labor and Human Resources Committee, have separately introduced
legislation (HR 530 and S 495) to cap the growth of the direct loan program at the 40% level.  In
light of recent cost estimates for the program, some are now calling for a complete repeal of the
program.<P>

    This time around conservatives are on solid ground.  The prudent and fiscally responsible
position is to eliminate the program before it costs American taxpayers -- not to mention
American college students -- more than they can afford.  Besides, getting rid of this program is
pro-education.  Here are four reason why.<P>
<ol>
<li> <STRONG>The Direct Loan Program does not save money</STRONG>.  By streamlining and centralizing the
whole student loan program, direct lending is supposed to save taxpayers billions of dollars. 
President Clinton's 1996 budget claims $5.2 billion in savings if the direct loan program is fully
implemented and replaces guaranteed loans.  A recent report by the Congressional Budget
Office, however, argues that the direct loan program, if fully implemented, would save only $115
million over the next seven years.  The difference is largely explained by changes in official
budget scoring to account for the complicated long-term administrative costs of direct loans.  (It
is also due to the removal from the cost estimate of savings that are not due to the direct loan
program.)  Indeed, according to the updated CBO report, eliminating the direct loan program and
maintaining the guaranteed program would save $1.5 billion over the next seven years.  <P>
<li> <STRONG>The Direct Loan Program adds considerably to the national debt</STRONG>.  As it currently stands
private lenders provide the capital for the loans, private and state guarantor agencies process the
loans and the federal government subsidizes the loan interest rate, guarantees the loans in cases
of default and exercises regulatory authority over the whole program. That is to say, the vast bulk
of capital is provided by private sources.  Under the Clinton plan the federal government would
borrow the money necessary to provide capitol for the loans and would service and collect the
loans itself.  This would require the federal government to borrow an additional $20-25 billion a
year to provide capital for the program.  According the Rep. Ernest Istook (R-OK) in testimony
last spring, a complete shift to direct loans could add $348 billion to the national debt by the year
2014.  And this does not consider any additional borrowing costs this expansion of debt will have
on the existing debt!<P>
<li><STRONG>The Direct Loan Program creates a new government bureaucracy</STRONG>.  Direct lending
centralizes control in the Department of Education and creates the potential for vast inefficiencies
and unconstrained costs.  The Department is hiring 600 new employees to administer the
program and anticipates 20,000 contract employees by the time the program is fully operational. 
The government is already funding the expansion with an unencumbered $2.5 billion
authorization.  This in a government department that is notoriously disorganized and
mismanaged.  In 1994, for instance, the Department of Education gave out $700 million in direct
loans but is unable to account for some $100 million.  The Advisory Committee on Student
Financial Assistance recently reported that the direct loan program is "potentially exposed to
multiple loans, overawards, loans to ineligible students, and excessive cash drawdowns" and, in
general, cannot "ensure program integrity."  This is the program that wants to take over
responsibility for making six million loans and dispersing over $20 billion a year?<P>
<li> <STRONG>The Direct Loan Program is bad for students and education</STRONG>.  Direct lending radically
changes the federal government's involvement in college lending programs by nationalizing what
for three decades has been a private-public partnership.  There are currently efforts to nationalize
(though not directly within the government) the college accreditation process, which allows a
college's students to be eligible for financial aid.  One can only imagine the temptations
presented to education reformers if the power of accreditation is combined with government
control over student loan money.  If recent history is any guide--witness Goals 2000 and the
drive for multicultural curriculum changes--further government intrusion in the academy will
only hinder and not help college and university education.  <P>
</ol>

    At a time when many existing programs are being reconsidered in light of the need to balance the
federal budget, Congress should think very carefully before completely federalizing the multi-billion dollar student loan program.  In the early 1970s Congress experimented with a direct loan
program called the Federally Insured Student Loan (FISL) program.  It was poorly managed and,
because the government was ineffective at collecting the loans, default rates increased above
previous levels.  Not surprisingly it was phased out in 1976.  It was largely because of this failure
that there emerged the current decentralized system that relies on private lenders and guarantors. 
Taxpayers should not be expected to tolerate more bureaucracy and an increased federal debt in
order to support another inefficient and costly program that does not help students or their
families.<P>  
    Let's eliminate the direct loan program and focus our energy on reforming the existing system
rather than replacing it with a new government-run program.  <P>

<blockquote><blockquote>
<img alt="The Classic Kirk " src="kirkclas.gif" align="right">For more than forty years, Russell Kirk was in the thick of the intellectual controversies of our time. Both 
<i>Time</i> and <i>Newsweek</i> have described him as one of America's leading thinkers. He is the author of some 
twenty-nine books and of hundreds of periodical essays; also of many short stories.
<p>
Dr. Kirk wrote and spoke on modern culture, political thought and practice, educational theory, literary 
criticism, ethical questions, and social themes. He addressed audiences on nearly five hundred American 
campuses and also appeared often on television and radio.
<p>
He was editor of the educational quarterly journal <i>The University Bookman</i> and was founder and first 
editor of the quarterly <i>Modern Age.</i> He contributed to numerous serious periodicals on either side of the 
Atlantic. For a quarter of a century he wrote a page on education for <i>National Review,</i> and for thirteen 
years published, through the Los Angeles Times Syndicate, a nationally-syndicated newspaper column. 
Over the years he contributed to more than a hundred serious periodicals in the United States, Britain, 
Canada, Australia, Austria, Germany, Italy, Spain, Bulgaria, and Poland, among them <i>Sewanee Review, 
Yale Review, Fortune, Humanitas, The Contemporary Review, The Journal of the History of Ideas, World 
Review, Crisis, History Today, Policy Review, Commonweal, Kenyon Review, The Review of Politics, </i>
and <i>The World and I.</i>
<p>
Dr. Kirk was president of the Wilbur Foundation; president of The Educational Reviewer, Inc.; 
editor of <i>The Library of Conservative Thought</i> for Transaction Books; and from time to time distinguished 
visiting professor at various universities and liberal-arts colleges in the disciplines of history, political 
thought, humane letters, and journalism.
<p>
He is the only American to hold the highest arts degree (earned) of the senior Scottish university - doctor of 
letters of St. Andrews. He received his bachelor's degree from Michigan State University and his master's 
degree from Duke University. Honorary doctorates were conferred upon him by twelve American 
universities and colleges.
<p>
<img alt="Gothic Kirk" src="kirkgoth.gif" align="left">He was a Guggenheim Fellow, a senior fellow of the American Council of Learned Societies, a 
Constitutional Fellow of the National Endowment for the Humanities, and a Fulbright Lecturer in Scotland. 
The Christopher Award was conferred upon him for his book <i>Eliot and His Age, </i>and he received the Ann 
Radcliffe Award of the Count Dracula Society for his Gothic Fiction; the Third World Fantasy Convention 
gave him its award for the best short fiction. In 1984 he received the Weaver Award of the Ingersoll Prizes 
for his scholarly writing. For several years he has been a Distinguished Scholar of the Heritage Foundation. 
In 1989, President Reagan conferred on him the Presidential Citizens Medal. In 1991, he was awarded the 
Salvatori Prize for historical writing.
<p>
More than a million copies of his books have been sold, and several have been translated into German, 
Spanish, Dutch, Korean, and other languages. His second book, <i>The Conservative Mind </i>(1953), was one of 
the most widely reviewed and discussed studies of political ideas in this century and has gone through 
seven editions. Seventeen of his books are in print at present, and he has written prefaces to many other 
books, contributed essays to them, or edited them.
<p>


Dr. Kirk debated with such well-known speakers as Norman Thomas, Frank Mankiewicz, Carey 
McWilliams, John Roche, Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr., Michael Harrington, Max Lerner, Michael Novak, 
Sidney Lens, William Kunstler, Hubert Humphrey, F. A. Hayek, Karl Hess, Clifford Case, Ayn Rand, 
Eugene McCarthy, Leonard Weinglass, Louis Lomax, Harold Taylor, Clark Kerr, Saul Alinsky, Staughton 
Lynd, Malcolm X, Dick Gregory, and Tom Hayden. Several of his public lectures have been broadcast 
nationally on C-Span.
<p>
<img alt="Kirk and Buckley" src="kirkbuck.gif" align="right">Among Kirk's literary and scholarly friends have been T. S. Eliot, Roy Campbell, Wyndham Lewis, 
Donald Davidson, George Scott Moncrieff, Richard Weaver, Max Picard, Ray Bradbury, Bernard Iddings 
Bell, Paul Roche, James McAuley, Thomas Howard, Wilhelm Roepke, Robert Speaight, Anthony 
Kerrigan, Robert Nisbet, Malcolm Muggeridge, Flannery O'Connor, William F. Buckley, Jr., Andrew 
Lytle, Henry Regnery, Robert Graves, and Cleanth Brooks.
<p>
<img alt="Young Kirk" src="kirkyng.gif" align="right">Born near the railroad yards at Plymouth, Michigan, in 1918, Kirk lived at his ancestral place, named Piety 
Hill, in Mecosta, Michigan - a little village in the stump-country. There he converted a toy factory into his 
library and office. His Italianate house is adorned with sculpture and architectural antiques snatched from 
the maws of the urban renewers of western Michigan. At home he was a famous narrator of ghostly tales, 
many of them picked up during his travels (often afoot) in Scotland and Ireland, Mediterranean and Alpine 
lands, and Africa.<p>

<img alt="Kirk and Annette" src="kirkfam.gif" align = "left">
For nearly thirty years he was married to Annette Yvonne Cecile Courtemanche; they have four daughters. 
Their tall house often was crowded with Asiatic, African, and European refugees and exiles; also with 
university students, travellers from antique lands, and a congeries of fugitives from Progress. In 
conjunction with the Intercollegiate Studies Institute and the Wilbur Foundation, Russell and Annette Kirk 
held frequent seminars at their residence and received several literary interns every year. Annette Kirk was 
an active member of the National Commission on Excellence in Education; she organizes the Piety Hill 
Seminars, and is managing editor of <i>The University Bookman.</i>

 
<p>
Additional information about him may be found in <i>Contemporary Authors, Who's Who in the World, 
Who's Who in America, Who's Who in the Midwest, International Scholars Directory, The Directory of 
American Scholars,</i> and other biographical directories. Chapters about his writings and his life may be 
found in Henry Regnery's <i>Memoirs of a Dissident Publisher,</i> John East's <i>The American Conservative 
Movement,</i> and M. E. Bradford's <i>A Better Guide Than Reason.</i>
<p>
The definitive work on Russell Kirk's life can be found in his own autobiography, <i>The Sword of 
Imagination,</i> available now through Eerdsmans Publishing.

<title>Heritage Exclusive -- Fall Agenda of 104th Congress</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center><h3><i>Heritage Exclusive</i> -- The Fall Agenda of the 104th Congress -- House of Representatives</h3>
By <a href="mailto:griffinc@heritage.org">Charles P. Griffin</a><br>
Congressional Relations<br> <a href="/heritage/welcome.html">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
September 5, 1995<br></center>
<p>
The House of Representatives returns to Washington on Wednesday, September 6 to face two grueling months of budget debate.  The public attention has been focused on Medicare, but there are also 13 appropriations bills, reconciliation, and the debt ceiling that all must be dealt with during this time period.  It is not at all certain how the debate will turn out, but it is safe to assume that everyone will be happy to put these months behind them.
<p>
<b>Medicare:</b>
<p>
The trustees of the Medicare Trust Fund -- including three members of President Clinton's Cabinet -- have predicted the imminent bankruptcy of this health care safety net for the elderly.  Despite this, many politicians and special interest groups have been fighting the efforts to keep Medicare solvent.  Among the <a href="/heritage/library/categories/govern/gip4.html">special interests</a> that have fought reform are several that feed at the public trough.  The House will have to cut through the scare tactics, roll up their sleeves, and find real solutions to the Medicare crisis.  The Heritage Foundation has contributed <a href="/heritage/library/index/i2.html">several useful studies</a> for Congress to consider in the debate.
<p>
<b>The Federal Budget:</b>
<p>
There is much speculation in Washington as to what will occur with the 13 spending bills that Congress must pass -- in theory -- before the start of the new fiscal year on October 1.  The President has issued several veto threats for some of the appropriations bills, and it is anticipated that there will be significant disagreements between the Congress and the President over what the nation's <a href="/heritage/library/index/a2.html">spending priorities</a> should be.  If a new law funding a particular agency is not in place by October 1, Congress must either pass a "continuing resolution" to permit it to remain open, or all but essential activities must be closed down.  It is likely that the Congress will send 13 bills to the President by the deadline, but delays in the bill becoming law may occur due to the give-and-take between the two branches of government.
<p>
<b>Reconciliation:</b>
<p>
"Reconciliation," although it is a fancy word, essentially describes the process by which Congress etches all aspects of the budget -- including taxes, appropriations, and entitlements -- in concrete.  It is through this process that the Congress hopes to reduce the tax burden on Americans, control entitlement spending, and enact a budget that will achieve balance by 2002.  The reconciliation process likely will not be completed until sometime in mid-October.
<p>
<b>Debt Ceiling:</b>
<p>
Since the federal government has repeatedly run up large deficits over the past 30 years, the Treasury Department must borrow money -- through bonds -- to finance the government's activities.  The government is limited by law as to how much money can be borrowed at any time.  A good way to think of this is like the credit limit on your credit cards.  This credit limit will be reached by the Treasury Department in October or November, so a new law must be enacted to permit further borrowing.  The key question in this debate will be how much to raise the limit by.  In the past, Congress has passed both long-term and short-term increases.  A number of freshman representatives have been quoted publicly as opposing any increase in the debt and this could be a significant factor in the debate.

<H2>The Summer MediScare Campaign: Subsidized By The American Taxpayers</H2><p>

<p>

As the Senate prepares to join the House in Congress's August recess, it has become clear that myriad interest groups have united to frighten senior citizens into believing that attempts to reform the Medicare system are really an attempt to "steal" their health care.  The fact that the Trustees of the Medicare Trust Funds -- among them three members of President Clinton's Cabinet -- have predicted the imminent bankruptcy of this health care safety net for the elderly has done nothing to dissuade the opponents of reform.
<p>
The catch is that many of the special interests now attempting to instill fear in the nation's senior citizens are subsidized by the American taxpayer.  In effect, elderly Americans are helping to fund  a campaign of lobbying and propaganda that runs directly counter to their own long-term best interests.
<p>
A June 27, 1995, "Medicare Message" distributed by the House Democratic Leadership refers to six taxpayer-subsidized organizations actively involved in the effort to "talk about the devastating effects of the Republican Medicare cuts."  These organizations received nearly $80 million in federal funding between July 1993 and June 1994:
<ul>
<p>
<li>AFL-CIO<br> 
$2,038,000
<p>
<li>Families USA 
<br>$250,000
<p>
<li>Service Employees International Union (SEIU)<br>
$137,000
<p>
<li>Save Our Security<br>
$100,000
<p>
<li>American Association of Retired Persons (AARP)<br>
$76,000,000
<p>
<li>American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME)<br>
$148,000
</ul>
<p>
One day later, on June 28, the National Committee to Preserve Social Security and Medicare ($75,000) wrote a letter to Members of Congress opposing the conference report on the budget resolution.  The organization's president, Martha McSteen, wrote that the Medicare reforms in that bill would "seriously harm" the program and that "reductions of this magnitude are only necessary to ... balance the budget by 2002."  She went on to say that "these reductions do not reflect the budget priorities of Americans."
<p>
In an attempt to influence the outcome of the debate in Congress over Medicare, some taxpayer-funded organizations have resorted to aggressive grassroots activity.  For example, four busloads of SEIU members joined Representative John Lewis (D-GA) in disrupting an August 7 Medicare meeting attended by members of the Georgia congressional delegation.  In addition, the SEIU, Urban League ($6,447,000), and Teamsters ($3,542,000) were among the organizations that led a large protest in front of House Budget Committee Chairman John Kasich's office in Ohio on July 21.  Speaking at the event, where 20 demonstrators were arrested, John Sweeney (candidate for the presidency of the federally subsidized AFL-CIO) stated, "We are here today to deliver a message to John Kasich, Newt Gingrich and every right-wing Republican and turncoat Democrat" in Congress that "we will not allow you to destroy job training and education and Medicare and Medicaid."<i>1</i>
<p>
Other organizations have targeted other Members of Congress.  In New York, taxpayer-subsidized AFSCME launched a "four day TV blitz" in mid-July targetted at Representative Jack Quinn (R-NY) to show that the results of proposed Medicare reforms will be "catastrophic."  According to press reports, "the 30-second spot, which will air 37 times ... features a couple distraught over 'Republican efforts' to cut health benefits for the elderly." A spokesman for the Civil Service Employees Association who joined AFSCME in the ad campaign said, "we hope to focus public attention on the impact these cuts will have so [Quinn] can influence his Republican leaders in Congress to do the right thing."<i>2</i>
<p>
When President Clinton came to Capitol Hill to celebrate the 30th anniversary of the passage of Medicare, the National Council of Senior Citizens ($71,516,000) played host and "provided goodie bags containing fans and hats with its logo."<i>3</i> <i> Newsday </i>said the event "amounted to a campaign rally" that was part of an effort to "argue that [Republicans] can't be trusted to preserve [Medicare]."<i>4</i>
<p>
The NCSC and other federal grantees have also resorted to exaggerated direct-mail pieces to spur grassroots activity. The Council recently mailed 500,000 business cards that declared, "The Threat: Gingrich Urges Replacing Medicare."  It went on to say, "Save Medicare! Call Congress." Says spokes-man Patrick Burns, "This is less of a moneymaker.  We're doing this to get people to take action."<i>5</i>
<p>
These organizations have every right to articulate their views, but the American taxpayer should not be compelled to subsidize the efforts of these special-interest groups.

<P>
	Title I.  CONTRACT WITH AMERICA: A BILL OF ACCOUNTABILITY<P>
<P>
[Note: Each section below in Title I would be under a separate introductory paragraph adopting House Rules from the 103rd Congress as the Rules of the 104th Congress with the additional amendment(s) in the section, thereby permitting a division of the question and separate debate and vote on each of the 8 Contract items.  The 23 items in Title II, on the other hand, would be subject to a single vote.]<P>

Statutory and investigative staff salary authorization levels would be consolidated in a single, 2-year committee expense resolution (except for the Committee on Appropriations).  The distinction between professional and clerical staff would be eliminated while retaining the overall core staff of 30 for each committee (20-majority, 10-minority, or a one-third guarantee to the minority if less than 30).  Committee chairmen would be required to ensure that sufficient staff is made available to each subcommittee to exercise its responsibilities under committee rules, including fair treatment to the minority in subcommittee staffing.

<P>
Our friend Russell Kirk, &quot;The Wizard of Mecosta,&quot; seemed
an ill-suited visitor to Washington back in 1978. He was accompanied
by his loving wife Annette, and he shared with a packed auditorium
some of the truths that made his published works so powerful and
so influential.
<P>
Then sixty years old, Russell Kirk was not a newcomer to Washington,
and yet he was certainly not a part of this unreal, political
place.
<P>
Despite his visits here in subsequent years, Russell Kirk was
always more comfortable surrounded by his family and his books
in Mecosta. He was at home among inquisitive students on one of
the college campuses where he held visiting appointments or where
he lectured.
<P>
Despite his discomfort, however, he made a real impact on Washington.
In a city of constant change, Kirk reminded opinion leaders, journalists,
legislators and staffers of prudence and of taking the long view.
<P>
It was at an I.S.I.-sponsored seminar, more than thirty years
ago over the Christmas holidays, that I first met Dr. Kirk. He
was already a fixed star in the conservative firmament. Although
he has described himself in those days as &quot;roly-poly and
benign,&quot; all of us students were in awe of him.
<P>
Had we known that he was an occasional eater of beaver and an
habitual smoker of &quot;dark, thick,&quot; Burmese cigars, &quot;looking
and tasting . . . Like torpedoes,&quot; we probably would have
addressed him with even greater trepidation. Yet, as he talked
with a small group of us on that frosty night in Detroit I could
not project that twenty years later Russell Kirk would be a Heritage
Distinguished Fellow and that three of his books would be based
on lectures that he first delivered here.
<P>
Over the years, Russell's Washington lecture themes would include
natural law, the prospects for conservatives, and individual rights.
They are masterpieces of clear thought and eternal truth.
<P>
These volumes and his other works mean that Russell Kirk's influence
in Washington will continue to be far greater than many
of the transient politicians who descend upon this city, cycle
after cycle.
<P>
As a back row observer at his soirees for the last sixteen years,
I never ceased to be amazed by the inevitable overflow crowd of
young people who couldn't get enough of him.
<P>
I asked one of them what his hold was on them. Her reply: &quot;I
had only admired him from afar and, of course, reading his books
at my university was not politically correct.&quot; Or, as a young
Reagan appointee said, &quot;He taught us all why our role was
important beyond ourselves and beyond politics.&quot;
<P>
Russell Kirk's operating guide was prudence and what Patrick Henry
called &quot;the lamp of experience,&quot; which abhorred all
forms of ideology claiming some instant substitute for genuine
tradition, custom, and experience.
<P>
He often described himself as a &quot;Bohemian Tory.&quot; A Bohemian
Tory who adapted to his environment, whether this meant a humble
cellar, a rustic cabin, a city mansion, or one of the great country
houses of Europe.
<P>
From time to time here in Washington, Russell was entertained,
feted, or downright idolized. While he seemed to enjoy this, his
heart belonged to Mecosta.
<P>
Russell Kirk has left an indelible mark on us, on Washington,
and on our nation. Perhaps his words have more meaning for us
today because, as one of his friends, T.S. Eliot puts it:
<P>
&quot;The communication of the dead is tongued with fire beyond
the language of the living.&quot;
<p><br><p><center><img alt="_______________________" align="middle"src="divide.gif"></center><p><br><p>

<P>
<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Gleaves Whitney<BR>
on behalf of <BR>
The Honorable John Engler, Governor of Michigan</CENTER></b>
<p>
 Russell
Kirk once wrote: &quot;Men are put into this world . . . to struggle,
to suffer, to contend against the evil that is in their neighbors
and in themselves, and to aspire toward the triumph of Love. They
are put into this world to live like men and to die like men.&quot;
<P>
By his own measure, Russell Kirk lived a robust and manly life,
and he died a noble and manly death.
<P>
Let it be said at the outset--without hesitation and without qualification--Russell
Kirk was a great man. His work will stand as one of the most significant
intellectual achievements of our time. That is because he understood
our time. Before his most famous book, <i>The Conservative Mind</i>,
was accepted for publication, Russell Kirk wrote a letter to Henry
Regnery, saying: This work is &quot;my contribution to our endeavor
to conserve the spiritual and intellectual and political tradition
of our civilization; and if we a e to rescue the modem mind we
must do it very soon . . .The struggle will be decided in the
minds of the rising generation.&quot;
<P>
There can be no doubt that Russell Kirk reached many minds-- and
touched many hearts--over the last four decades. His words coursed
over the continents and across the generations. He touched us
not just because of what he said, but how he said it. This &quot;Bohemian
Tory,&quot; this &quot;Canny Scot,&quot; possessed an excellent
ear for the language, and his readers felt all the force of his
personality in his prose.
<P>
And then there were the many personal qualities that endeared
Russell Kirk to us. He was a loyal friend and a faithful correspondent.
Who could forget his keen wit, those fantastic ghost stories,
and that mischievous twinkle in his eyes? He was devoted to his
family--a wonderful family so many of us have come to know: his
lovely wife Annette, their four beautiful daughters, his sons-in-law,
and the larger family. For years they have opened their arms to
us, as today we open our arms to them.
<P>
Russell Kirk had an uncommonly generous spirit--a spirit that
never flagged, but gave tirelessly. It is evident in his letters
and lectures, his books and conversation. Weakened though he was
toward the end of his life, Dr. Kirk's last public gesture was
to sign books from his bed, because he knew how much that would
mean to his readers
and friends. The last book he signed, just a week before his passing,
vas to Governor Engler.
<P>
Russell Kirk was very much a Michigan man--one of us. We can imagine
him as a young boy, reading historical adventures by the train
yards in Plymouth where his father worked. We can think of him
as a gifted teacher at his alma mater, Michigan State. We can
see him walking out of that drafty old library at Piety Hill and
turning down the road which leads to the woods.
<P>
Russell loved Michigan. Recently his heart made its final journey
back to the &quot;stump country&quot; that he called his ancestral
home, to return to the land that shaped him. But his spirit now
knows its true and eternal home. And the wisdom in his writings
will remain to help those of us still on this earthly pilgrimage.
Indeed, for generations to come, his words will find a resting
place wherever there is right reason, and wherever there is a
heart in search of the Permanent Things.
<P>
Today we mourn. We have lost a friend. Michigan has lost its preeminent
man of letter. America has lost one of the men who understood
her best. We mourn, but Russell would not want us to become too
melancholy this day. In the epilogue of his memoirs, which he
recently composed and which will be published next year, Russell
Kirk tells us that he lived a good life. At the age of seventy-five,
he says that what he sought in life had come down to three things.
<P>
First, he had sought to defend the Permanent Things -- truth, justice,
freedom, a tolerable moral order and in so doing he was more successful
than he thought would be possible at the outset of his career.
<P>
Second, he had sought to lead a life of decent independence, living
much as his ancestors had lived, on their land, in circumstances
that would enable him to utter the truth and make his voice heard:
a life uncluttered and unpolluted, not devoted to getting and
spending. This, he tells us, he had achieved as a man of letters
at Piety Hill.
<P>
Third, he had sought to marry for love and to rear children who
would come to know that the service of God is perfect freedom.
Words cannot express how filled with gratitude he was for Annette
and his children, who are endowed with the unbought grace of life.
In this, too, he had been wonderfully blessed.
<P>
To Russell Kirk, the three goals of his life had been reached,
and he was grateful. And we who are here today can be grateful
that we knew him, and that he walked a little distance with us
in our journey to our eternal home.

<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Pat Buchanan<BR>
Founder and Chairman <BR>
The American Cause</CENTER></b><p> We are here today to mourn the passing
of a wonderful friend, and to celebrate a great life, that of
Dr. Russell Kirk, Patriarch of Piety Hill, Sage of Mecosta, gentle
giant of American conservatism. And, I am proud and honored to
add, leader of the Buchanan Brigades in the Michigan primary of
'92.
<P>
In 1953, when Dr. Kirk's seminal work, The Conservative Mind,
appeared In a desert of liberal orthodoxy, it was celebrated,
not only here but across the West. For the wise men of the age
were aware something new had been born, a genuine conservative
movement, and Russell Kirk was its father. His was the spark that
set fire to the minds of so many of my generation.
<P>
For forty years, Dr. Kirk wrote his columns and commentaries,
essays, and stories, books and reviews- a treasure house of work
that now becomes part of the deposit of faith--of the cause in
which we believe. And his books will be read and reread and cherished,
when most of what his contemporaries published is long since forgotten.
Why?
<P>
Because Russell Kirk wrote not only for his time, but for all
time. He was the custodian, the caretaker of &quot;The Permanent
Things&quot;, the eternal truths that do not change. All his life
he wielded his pen to expose the false gods of modernity, and
in particular, the false god of ideology.
<P>
To Dr. Kirk, ideology, whether of Left or Right, was something
that took possession of a soul that was empty. &quot;Ideology,&quot;
he wrote, &quot;provides sham religion . . . comforting in its
way to those who have lost or never have known genuine religious
faith.&quot;
<P>
When Dr. Kirk discovered this heresy in the camp of the saints,
he used a needle to winkle it out. A few years back when the ideology
of democracy was being exalted to the status of high dogma, he
wrote, &quot;A trouble with this civil-religion notion is that
the large majority of Americans think they already have a religion
of their own, not one cobbled up by some department in Washington.&quot;
<P>
When some great minds arose in our midst to declare The End of
History, Dr. Kirk merrily laughed. Because he knew more history
than all of them put together; and because he knew that the seedbed
of conflicts and war lay in the human heart, which is unchanged
and unchanging, save through grace.
<P>
As the presence here today of Russell Kirk's wife and four daughters
so beautifully testifies, Russell Kirk did not simply preach the
values of family and faith, he lived them. He not only wrote of
the search for truth, he persevered all his life; and when he
came upon the truth in the Roman Catholic Church, Russell Kirk
embraced it. This was a man, whole and entire, whose hierarchy
of values were in perfect order and synchronization, as are the
planets in God's heaven that circle the sun. And because his values
were in harmony, Dr. Kirk was one off the most genuinely, visibly
happy men I have ever met.
<P>
I recall the last time we met, in Philadelphia near midnight for
a drink after a speech; Annette and Dr. Kirk invited me out to
Piety Hill, to see the library in which he took such joy.
<P>
And, upon occasion, Dr. Kirk would undertake my instruction.
<P>
After listening to me propound the latest economic nostrum for
America's ills, this gentle teacher sent me a slim book that contained
his own introduction: &quot;I have regarded with some suspicion
many practitioners of the Dismal Science,&quot; Dr. Kirk had written.
&quot;I have found economists a blindered breed, worshipping the
false god, Efficiency.&quot;
<P>
Dr. Kirk believed in a market economy, but all his life he fought
this Cult of Efficiency--because it dehumanized man; and because
he knew there is a higher order of things in God's universe, ruled
by a law higher even than the law of supply and demand.
<P>
If today a man should ask me what is conservatism, I would tell
him: Read Russell Kirk. He endures; he speaks to the ages of what
it means to be one of us.
<P>
If there is an image I will carry with me all my days of Dr. Kirk,
it is the image of the loving father of the Prodigal Son, the
father who; nightly, walks to the edge of his estate to look to
the horizon to see if his wandering boy is ever coming home again.
And when the son appears, disheveled, having squandered his patrimony
chasing after the fads and follies of the age, the gentle father,
never reproachful, rejoices to take his son back home.
<P>
He was that--to us.
<P>
&quot;Men are put into this world . . . to struggle, to suffer,
to contend against the evil that is in their neighbors, and in
themselves, and to aspire toward the triumph of Love,&quot; Russell
Kirk wrote forty years ago. &quot;They are put in this world to
live like men and to die like men.&quot;
<P>
A brave man all his life, Russell Kirk died like a man, passing
away in the arms of the wife and daughters he loved. <i>Ave atque vale</i>,
my friend.

<P>
<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Russell Hittinger<BR>
Professor, Department of Philosophy <BR>
The Catholic University of America</b></CENTER><p> In <i>The Roots of American
Order</i>, Russell wrote: &quot;Whatever America's incertitudes today,
it is difficult to find American citizens who can sketch any convincing
ideal new order as an alternative to the one long rooted here.&quot;
This sentence was aimed particularly at the malcontents of the
1960s. But it might just as well have been aimed at all of us;
especially those of us who work in universities, think tanks,
and newspapers. Who among us knows so much as to offer the prospect
of any &quot;convincing&quot; alternative to an order long rooted
in the experience of a people? Our answer to this question will
determine how we understand the word &quot;conservative.&quot;</B>
<P>
We know how Russell Kirk answered the question. To his eternal
credit, he did not impart to this movement the name &quot;Kirkianism.&quot;
When he wrote <i>The Conservative Mind</i>, he certainly did not suggest
that the &quot;mind&quot; was his own. The whole point of the
book was to have the reader draw quite the opposite conclusion.
The permanent things are not known by merely one mind or party;
thanks to the gift of culture, they are known by many minds. Whether
we speak of culture in its moral and religious sense, or culture
in terms of liberty and economic markets, the conservative believes
that the kind of social order worth living in most certainly is
not something vouchsafed exclusively to a privileged class of
theorists.
<P>
Russell Kirk kept a distance, both spiritual and geographical,
from the institutions of the elite. He did most of his thinking
and writing outside of the academy. While it seems at least paradoxical
to say this about a conservative, he needed no institutional credentials
to certify his ideas. It was enough for him to call upon the authority
Cicero, Burke, and John Randolph of Roanoke. He certainly kept
a distance from the imperial institutions of this city. Except
for two terms as Justice of the Peace in Morton Township, Mecosta
County, Michigan, Russell never held public office.
<P>
Nonetheless, he had the chief virtue of a public man: he regarded
cultural order as a gift, even if it had been neglected and despoiled
by the age. One might think that it was a great misfortune for
him to have lived in our time, with its rejection of authority
and its rejection of the vicarious communion of the living with
the dead. Russell was, of course, duly critical of the age.
<P>
But criticism was rarely his first word, and never his last. 1
recall the first time I met him, during one of his annual seminars
at Piety Hill. I never, by the way, met a man of his prominence
who spent such time with young people, especially college undergraduates.
That year he was considering the subject, &quot;Is Virtue Teachable?&quot;
After citing all of the classical authorities, and making every
argument (pro and con) of which we were capable, we retired to
the living room on the final evening, whereupon Russell told ghost
stories. I returned more than once to these annual affairs in
Mecosta, and I can assure you that the ghosts always had the final
word.
<P>
When we consider the life of Russell Kirk, we may ask ourselves:
Can a virtuous man be happy in a decadent time? Aristotle said
of Priam's misfortunes: &quot;A truly good and intelligent person
will bear strokes of fortune suitably, and from his resources
at any time will do the finest actions, just as a . . . good shoemaker
will produce the finest shoe from the leather given him . . .
If this is so, then the happy person could never become miserable.&quot;
<P>
And so it was with Russell Kirk. &quot;Happiness,&quot; he concluded
in <i>The Roots of American Order</i>, is first expressed in &quot;gratitude.&quot;
Gratitude is found neither in sadness nor in protest, but in &quot;restoring
and improving the order of the soul and the order of the republic.&quot;
<P>
For his piety, for his example, for his paternal solicitude for
his students, and above all for his sanity, we will miss him.
But we. are grateful for his extraordinary defense of the ordinary,
civilizing virtues.<p><br><p><center><img alt="_______________________" align="middle"src="divide.gif"></center><p><br><p>

<P>
<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Irving Louis Horowitz<BR>
Professor of Sociology and Political Science<BR>
Rutgers University</b></CENTER><p> It would be futile, not to say frustrating,
to try summarizing Russell Kirk's life and work in a few well
chosen words. Russell him self was wise enough to leave for paradise
ultimate summaries and judgments. He understood that our world
was comprised, if not shrouded, in mystery and paradox; and hence
in need of dispositions not dogmas. He lived his extraordinary
life accordingly.
<P>
He was a huge public presence with a private life that remained
ever intact. He was a man who wrote fiercely, but who yet managed
to speak softly. Russell gave substance to a movement floundering
in search of theory, and yet only episodically participated in
partisan politics. He was as dedicated to what Veblen called the
higher learning with an unmatched ferocity, and yet chose the
life of what Mannheim called the <i>freischwebende Inelligenz</i> -- 
or loosely translated, the free-wheeling intellect. He was a political
philosopher in the strictest, Burkean, sense of the word, and
yet could produce ghost I stories and aphoristic works with equal
aplomb and ease. And yes, he was Catholic in the exacting sense
of that word, and yet fully able to register a catholicity that
knew no boundaries of religion or culture.
<P>
In short, he was one of us: a human being with aspirations no
less than accomplishments. His conservatism was ample enough to
take the measure of man as a complex bundle of twine; touched
by original sin but in search of ultimate redemption, and filled
with such tumult as to make possible an appreciation of order.
But having said this, one must add a qualifier: Russell did not
use paradox as a mechanism for avoiding decisions or skirting
issues. Better than nearly any I person I have ever known, he
took forthright positions on basic ques tions. For Russell, what
ought to be is at least as important as what is in the conduct
of human affairs.
<P>
I take this passion for the political as his secret war against
empiricism and for moralism. He was at heart, an essayist. He
loved preparing introductions to his favorite contemporary authors:
Irving Babbitt, Christopher Dawson, William H. Mallock, John Randolph,
Forrest McDonald, Donald Davidson, Wilhelm Roepke, Victor Kravchenko, Louis deBonald, George Scott-Moncrieff -- to name some of
them. They spoke at levels that provided meaning without fueling
animus.
<P>
I suspect that this opportunity to dialogue with his friends and
mentors of ages past no less than times present was a large part
of Russell's reason for sponsoring the Library of Conservative
Thought a series wthich has brought such distinction to Transaction,
 no less than pleasure to its readers. He shared with Montaigne
the deep belief that the essay form was that most amenable to
give I expression to ethical considerations. If this made him
at times appear I avuncular, it was a small price to pay for giving
intellectual shape to the struggles of our century and our nation.
<P>
Russell's life spanned much of the century: he knew many victories,
and suffered defeats as well. He handled both ends of the public
spectrum with equal equanimity. I suspect that the warmth of his
private life above all, his unabashed love and beaming pride of
his wife and four daughters allowed him to put into perspective
any indignities, and put into practice his belief in the values
of family, tradition, and faith. There was a seamless movement
from the private to the public that gave an informed unity of
purpose to his life.
<P>
In the short few weeks since his death, I have received many encomiums
about the Library of Conservative Thought. Several of them have
spoken of the series as somehow complete, or near completion,
with his passing. While well-intentioned, this is simply not the
case. That rich body of analysis to which Russell both contributed
so mightily and recovered so consistently, is no more near completion
than the planet earth itself. It would be high irony that a person
dedicated to the search for eternal values in a changing polity
would advocate or announce the competition of such a stupendous
task.
<P>
I suspect that these letters are giving expression to a feeling
of deep sorrow at the loss of a spiritual leader in a spiritless
environment. But the need for the comfort of belief, the instinct
for tradition, the impulse to maintain, if not create order, must
ultimately overcome our sorrow at the loss of a human being, however
talented and whatever achievements he may have registered. The
fact is that Russell is now one with the great tradition he helped
to articulate and recover. He is one with Plato, Augustine, Burke,
Brownson, Calhoun, Eliot and countless other names who helped
Russell give definition to western civilization. May his soul
rest in peace. May our souls remain restless in the pursuit of
peace.

<A href="#index">Index</A> <CENTER><B>Honorable T. Kenneth Cribb,
Jr.<BR>
President<BR>
Intercollegiate Studies Institute</b></CENTER><p> The priceless regalia
of the Scottish kings--the crown, the scepter, the sword of state--are
known as the Honors of Scotland. They are more ancient by far
than the British Crown Jewels, and it is said that the gold circlet
of the richly reworked crown was worn by Robert the Bruce. Despite
their incalculable worth, the Honors of Scotland were put away
following the union of the English and Scottish nations, and then
were lost to memory for 150 years.</B>
<P>
It was none other than Sir Walter Scott who, understanding their
significance, used all the powers of his scholarship and imagination
to deduce their forgotten resting place. After infinite pains,
he himself lifted the Honors of Scotland from the dusty recess
where they had been consigned by an earlier generation careless
of its patrimony.
<P>
In our age, it was Russell Kirk who, with ground-breaking scholarship
and moral imagination, rediscovered what we may call the Honors
of the West. At a time when the American heirs to conservatism
had fallen into forgetfulness of the great tradition, and liberal
intellectuals had proclaimed its demise, Dr. Kirk, like the Walter
Scott he so admired, lifted with his own hands our forgotten patrimony
from dusty oblivion.
<P>
In his early work Dr. Kirk treated modern exemplars of the conservative
tradition from Burke to Eliot, but always with respect to their
insights into timeless truths. Later, he more explicitly traced
these eternal verities to their ancient historical roots, and
to their Source beyond history. All along the way he erected guideposts
for those who would follow--all of us here and so many others--that
we too could travel the path he had marked toward order in the
soul and order in the commonwealth; that we too could discover
the Honors of the West.
<P>
Friend or foe would occasionally address him as Professor Kirk--not
realizing that he had held professorships no longer than he had
to--such was his contempt for Behemoth University. But teacher
he was, all his life. More than a few volumes on his long shelf
of books were written explicitly to instruct the young, not to
F mention hundreds of college lectures from coast to coast, scores
of Wilbur Fellows who served as his research assistants, or the
Piety Hill seminars begun more than twenty years ago. As with
Chaucer's Clerk, gladly would he teach and gladly learn.
<P>
Russell Kirk also taught by the example of his towering integrity.
Here was the man of letters who, without the usual sinecures,
actually lived by his pen. Here was the scourge of the Welfare
State who quietly practiced the arts of private charity. He and
Annette made their house a home to the troubled, to the dispossessed,
to great eccentrics seeking refuge from the commonplace world.
Who has not visited Piety Hill only to find himself dining with
the deposed imperial family of Ethiopia, or a young person with
grave family problems, or an intellectual expatriated from the
totalitarian East. There was even the Burglar Butler who before
finding shelter with the Kirks, made his way by robbing church
poor boxes, taking--as he said--only what was absolutely necessary.
<P>
Yes, Dr. Kirk taught us by the very nature of the household that
he established, graced by Monica, Cecilia, Felicia, and Andrea,
and presided over by Annette with an encompassing love.
<P>
In January of 1993 Russell Kirk learned that he suffered from
congestive heart failure, and realist that he was, understood
that his remaining time was short. He took the news as no more
and no less than an artifact of the human condition, and in his
last year and-a-half neither despaired in his spirit nor flagged
in his Herculean literary feats. After all, this was a man who
measured his intellectual pursuits in millennia and who planted
trees throughout his life as a symbol of our duty to strive for
good that we may not live to see.
<P>
Well into his seventies, Dr. Kirk could canoe on the rivers of
Mecosta County or walk the hills of the Scottish Borders, only
to sit down later at his typewriter and engage in learned disputation.
This past December nineteenth, Dr. Kirk wrote me, &quot;I fear
that my days of canoeing and hill-walking are over,&quot; and
then proceeded to outline a series of literary projects that daunted
even in the reading. Since the onset of his illness in 1993, he
had produced two of his most important works: <i>America's British
Culture</i>, a consummate defense of our common patrimony against
the destructive sallies of the multiculturalists; and <i>The Politics
of Prudence</i>, a series of essays instructing the rising generation
in the essence of conservative thought and exhorting them to nurture
and transmit their precious cultural heritage.
<P>
But perhaps the most significant work of his last days was the
completion of his final literary gift to us, <i>The Sword
of Imagination: Memoirs of a Half-Century of Literary Conflict</i>.
This 874-page treasure of a manuscript is currently being prepared
for publication by Eerdmans Publishing Company and, according
to Dr. Kirk, is a memoir humbly penned in the tradition of Julius
Caesar and Henry T Adams.
<P>
During his final illness, Dr. Kirk would gather his daughters
around him to tell stories of his youth and of their family history--as
well as an occasional gothic tale. He mustered the energy to read
aloud to his family Walter Scott's <i>Tales of a Grandfather</i>,
and, on Easter Sunday, Chesterton's <i>Ballad of the White
Horse</i>;.
<P>
On his last morning, he heard on the radio that the Pope had slipped
and fallen. He asked his family to pin him in prayer for the Holy
Father's recovery. At the end, he sat up in his bed at his beloved
Piety Hill, and sank back with eyes closed. As Annette went for
the nurse, two of his young daughters took his hands and began
to sing the songs he had sung to awaken them from their a slumbers.
He opened his eyes once more to the angelic voices that sang him
to his rest. His life was gentle in the old sense; his death,
in all senses.
<P>
The final works and days of Russell Kirk were at one with his
long life. From across the ages the best minds of the West spoke
to Dr. Kirk of permanent things which eclipsed the paltry preoccupations
of our time, and he made those thinkers our contemporaries. It
is across the ages that Russell Kirk's own voice will be heard
by future voyagers embarked on the reflective journey toward order
in the soul and order in the commonwealth. May they redeem for
their time, as Russell Kirk has done for ours, the Honors of the
West.

Mass of Dr. Russell Kirk<BR>
Reverend Winthrop Brainerd<BR>
St. Matthew's Cathedral, Washington, D.C. </CENTER></B>
<P>
On Sunday we celebrated Pentecost, and on Monday, I was at Yale
graduation. The contrast between them was extreme. Certainly at
Yale I discovered much knowledge. Certainly at Yale, I discovered
much learning. Yet, with all of this knowledge and learning, was
the lack of moral imagination; and in the midst of &quot;political
correctness,&quot; the refusal of the truth; and therefore the
absence of all wisdom.
<P>
Certainly, there was much talk of &quot;freedom from,&quot; and
lamentably little understanding of &quot;freedom to:&quot; a multiplication
of rights; and a convenient amnesia of duty.
<P>
Yet as Pentecost reminds us, the vocation of a Catholic is to
witness to the truth. To this end, God reveals Himself in covenant;
in sacrifice; in flesh and blood; and through the Holy Spirit.
<P>
Poured out upon the Church at Pentecost, and upon us at our baptism,
that Spirit leads us into the truth, and as we discover the truth,
if we are to live our lives with integrity, we must proclaim it.
<P>
For it is in this fearless proclamation of truth, that we ourselves
learn: from each other; from tradition; from grace; and from that
radical transformation of the heart. Truth comes from the entirety
of the human condition and has been refined and forged in the
inner conflicts between truth and lies; between good and evil;
between the world and the kingdom. And from the proclamation of
the truth, we discover wisdom.
<P>
Given the corruption of human nature, it is, perhaps, too much
to expect gratitude from those challenged and exposed by the proclamation
of the truth, but in the midst of persecution, explicit or implicit,
we see &quot;<i>Cor ad Cor loquitur</i>,&quot; heart speaks to heart.
Like the rim of a bell, it does not matter where it is touched,
for it rings clear, out across the earth. Wisdom speaks heart
to heart, because it perceives not only truth, but the purpose
of truth, which is God.
<P>
Wisdom speaks to the human: body, soul, mind, for wisdom both
understands the truth of the human condition, and is the ground
of its healing. It mines the individual he art for the good for
which humanity was made; for the good of which it is capable;
and for that fragile good confronted by the dark destructive selfishness
of which each one of us is daily tempted to succumb.
<P>
Such wisdom comes from God who is wisdom Himself; Himself the
author, the purpose and the end and it is the birthright of every
Catholic.
<P>
Here in the presence of the author of truth and seat of wisdom
we are given a sign: we see the bread and wine; we perceive the
flesh and blood. We see in what we have made, in bread, in wine,
the seeds of our mortality: the bread must rot and the wine spoil.
Yet we see God take what we have made, and by them, give to us
immortality.
<P>
This sign shows us what God will do, not with what we have made,
but with what he has made: ourselves. &quot;Now we see a dim reflection
in a mirror; but then we shall be seeing face to face. The knowledge
that I now have is imperfect; but I shall understand as I am understood.&quot;
(1 Cor. 13:12)
<P>
&quot;To understand as I am understood&quot; is the ultimate wisdom.
It is still the vocation of our brother Russell Kirk; it is the
lesson of his life; and it is the legacy, like Elijah's mantle,
that falls upon us here.<p><br><p><center><img alt="_______________________" align="middle"src="divide.gif"></center>

"The flat tax has some serious hurdles to overcome<br> 
before it can go from tax concept to tax code."</i><br>
-- J.D. Foster<br>
</center>
<hr>
<p>
<br>
The flat tax is the vanguard of tax reform, and for good reason. It is  
sound economically and easy to explain. It corrects some long-standing  
problems with the current tax system: complexity, high costs of  
administration and compliance, a depressing effect on the economy, and  
the unfairness of double taxation of income from capital. Its strengths  
have gained the flat tax many ardent fans and have brought it from an  
obscure oddity debated by economists to the forefront of the tax-policy  
debate.   
<p> 	  
Flat-tax advocates are nearly evangelistic in their drive to replace the  
current tax system, often as an integral part of their broader agenda to  
reshape government. They are also often unwilling to acknowledge that,  
despite its strengths, the flat tax also has some weaknesses and some  
serious obstacles to overcome before it can go from tax concept to tax  
code.   
<p>
<center>
<b><a name="Flat Tax">WHAT IS A FLAT TAX?</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
Any tax with a single tax rate could be considered a flat tax. A flat tax on  
labor and business income has been popularized by professors Robert E.  
Hall and Alvin Rabushka of the Hoover Institution. A flat tax on labor  
and business income is also embodied in legislative proposals advanced  
by Congressman Dick Armey, the majority leader in the House of  
Representatives, and Senator Arlen Specter, a presidential contender.  
These flat-tax proposals do not tax income from saving; they are  
therefore a form of consumption tax.  
<p> 	  
One of the great advantages of a flat tax is its neutrality. It taxes all forms  
of income only once and does so at a single rate. It taxes individuals'  
labor income at a single rate after allowing for personal exemptions, and  
it taxes business's net cash flow at the same rate that applies to  
individuals. The flat tax thus gives no relative advantage to any means of  
earning income. It favors neither capital nor labor, neither physical nor  
intellectual capital, neither manufacturing nor real estate. By contrast,  
under current law, the federal government uses the tax code to  
micromanage the economy, distorting the allocation of resources such as   
capital and labor, and thereby diminishing both the level of economic  
activity and the standard of living.  
<p>	  
The flat tax is also vastly simpler than the current system and thus  
virtually transparent to taxpayers -- that is, taxpayers need not become  
lawyers or CPAs to understand the intent and application of the tax  
system. Such transparency is important for individuals and businesses   
making economic decisions, for taxpayers' confidence in the fairness of  
the system, and for assuring taxpayers that the tax code will not become a  
tool of deliberate or accidental oppression by government. Much of the  
distrust bred by the federal tax system derives from a suspicion that it  
conceals traps to snare the unwary taxpayer and torture him with tax  
penalties, interest charges, tax liens, and possibly jail. The flat tax aims to  
be so simple and transparent that taxpayers could shelve their fear of the  
tax man.  
<p>	  
<b>Individuals under a flat tax.</b> Taxable income under a flat tax includes all  
wages and salary, and excludes all capital income such as dividends,  
interest, rental income, and capital gains. In addition, all nonwage forms  
of labor compensation are also excluded, such as employer-provided  
health insurance and subsidized parking. The tax on individuals,  
therefore, is essentially a payroll tax collected at the employee level.  
Most flat-tax proposals also allow the taxpayer to take personal  
exemptions and an additional exemption for each child in the household,  
effectively creating a zero tax rate for low-income filers. Under the   
Armey version of the flat tax, for example, a single filer is allowed a  
$13,100 exemption ($26,200 for married, filing jointly), and the plan  
allows for a $5,300 exemption per dependent. Having calculated taxable  
income net of the personal and child exemptions, a flat tax imposes a  
single tax rate on any remaining taxable income.  
<p>	  
The most striking feature of a flat tax is that it eliminates the special  
deductions, phase-outs, and credits in the federal income tax, ensuring  
that most individuals could calculate their tax liability easily -- hence the  
claims by flat-tax advocates that a tax return could be filed on a postcard.   
(In his plan, Specter retains the two most popular individual deductions,  
the home-mortgage interest and charitable deductions.)  
<p>	  
Simplicity for the individual is indeed one of the flat tax's best selling  
points. It is a point that is often oversold, however. Under the flat tax,  
there are two tax rates -- zero and approximately 20 percent. No doubt a  
reduction in the number of tax rates would make tax planning easier, but  
for most individuals the number of rates is irrelevant to their   
actual tax filing.  
<p>  
The simplification of the calculation of taxable income may also be  
oversold. For the approximately 80 million tax filers who take the  
standard deduction, the difference in tax computation between the flat tax  
and current law is that taxpayers today must add their interest, dividends,   
and capital gains to the tax base. They do not suffer the complexities of  
tax deductions because they opt for the standard deduction. For the  
approximately 32 million itemizers, the flat tax offers a clearly simpler  
system. But taxpayers who itemize do so voluntarily. They itemize   
because it lowers their tax liability. Thus, for itemizing taxpayers, the flat  
tax represents a loss of a preferred option in the way they file their taxes.  
Flat-tax advocates assume that most itemizing taxpayers would happily  
give up their credits and deductions in exchange for a simpler tax system.  
<p>	  
<b>Businesses under a flat tax.</b> The taxation of businesses under a flat tax  
makes even greater strides towards simplicity and neutrality. All  
businesses are treated the same; no distinction is made between  
partnerships, sole proprietorships, corporations, and any other business  
form. There is a single tax rate. And businesses are taxed on their net  
cash flow, not on their net income as under current law, thereby  
eliminating all the complications of attempting to match the timing of  
income and expenses.   
<p>	  
Under a flat tax, a business calculates its net cash flow for the year by  
totaling its receipts from all sources and subtracting all payments made  
to its employees and all payments made to other businesses for such  
things as plant and equipment and inventory. Businesses would deduct  
from income the full cost of their investments at the time of purchase,  
instead of stretching out these expenses according to complicated  
depreciation schedules. Employee fringe benefits would not be  
deductible. Nor would interest payments. The business then calculates its  
tax liability by applying a single tax rate to its net cash flow.  
<p>	  
<b>More than just a tax system.</b> In the current political environment, the flat  
tax is far more than an alternative tax system. The flat tax is also a strong  
political and philosophical statement about the role of tax policy in   
society, as seen most clearly in the strong preference of flat-tax advocates  
for a single tax rate for all taxpayers.   
<p>	  
For decades, the prevailing doctrine of "tax fairness" has dictated a highly  
progressive income-tax system. This means that, as a family's income  
rises, so do its average and marginal tax rates. Under current law,  
progressivity is achieved through a combination of deductions,  
exclusions, phase-outs, and rising tax rates imposed on a comprehensive  
measure of income. For example, in 1994 a married couple with $50,000  
in Adjusted Gross Income (AGI) and two children, taking the standard  
deduction, would pay 10.1 percent in federal income tax, whereas the  
same family with $100,000 in AGI would pay tax at an 18.5 percent rate.  
<p>	  
Under a flat 20 percent tax rate, a family would be subject to a 20 percent  
rate however high its labor income above a certain threshold. Having  
exempted lower-income taxpayers from the tax, many flat-tax advocates  
believe that proportionality, not progressivity, reflects the prevailing   
sense of fairness in America: Taxpayers should pay more tax as their  
incomes rise, but the amount of tax should not increase more than  
proportionally.  
<p>	  
Flat-tax proposals actually include two tax rates -- zero (by virtue of the  
personal exemptions) and about 20 percent. Some critics worry that the  
inclusion of a zero tax rate in the flat tax will maintain a large  
constituency for expanded government. The dangers are apparent in any   
general system of taxation that allows any but the poorest of the poor to  
escape paying at least some tax when they have taxable income. Taxes  
reflect a price we pay for government. Whenever someone escapes  
paying tax to finance government services, the direct cost of those  
services is zero and the amount of services demanded is high. Even a   
minimal tax of a few dollars a month would remind taxpayers                                                                   
that government services are not free.  
<p>	  
Many advocates of the flat tax are using the tax reform debate as a means  
of reshaping the political debate. By directly challenging the doctrine of  
tax progressivity in the federal tax system, they seek to change not only   
established ideas about desired tax burdens, but also the very notion of  
using the state as an instrument of incomes policy. Nor does the challenge  
stop there.   
<p>	  
Armey has included as part of his proposal the elimination of income-tax  
withholding. To many, withholding is simply a convenience whereby  
their employers subtract a certain amount from their paychecks each pay  
period based on an estimate of the total tax due for the year. To Armey  
and others, however, tax withholding disguises the true magnitude of the  
taxpayer's federal individual income-tax liability. By clouding the amount  
paid, they argue, taxpayers object less to the tax burden and to the  
amount of government spending that tax receipts make possible. By  
replacing the withholding mechanism with a monthly payment directly  
from the taxpayer to the Treasury, Armey believes he will bring powerful  
new forces to bear on the size of the tax burden and the size of  
government.  
<p>

<b><a name="Economic Benefits">ECONOMIC BENEFITS</a></b><br> 

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
Tax reform is a long and difficult process. Even the adoption of an ideal  
tax system creates transition costs for taxpayers, economic dislocation,  
and uncertainty. What benefits would justify these costs?  
<p>	  
<b>Saving, investment, and economic growth.</b> The net national savings rate  
in the U.S. has averaged 2.7 percent per year in the 1990s, less than one  
third the rate of the 1950s and 1960s. The savings rate is a prime  
determinant of the growth of incomes and wealth, so a low savings rate  
obviously does not bode well for future growth in standards of living.   
Certainly one contributing factor to the low savings rate is the high tax  
rate on saving and investment, due in part to the double taxation of  
income from capital. The flat tax would tax income from capital only  
once -- in the form of a tax on business income. Dividends, capital gains,  
interest payments, and other forms of capital income received by  
individuals would not be taxed, because they had already been taxed  
before. The flat tax would thereby reduce the tax burden on saving,  
which means, everything else held constant, that a flat tax would increase  
the rate of private saving.  
<p>	  
The flat tax may also reduce the tax burden on investment by eliminating  
the double taxation of corporate income and allowing businesses to  
deduct in full the cost of their plant and equipment purchases. However,  
the flat tax also appears to increase the overall tax burden of businesses   
(more on this later) so the net effect on investment incentives   
may be muted.   
<p>	  
The purpose of  encouraging saving and investment is, of course, to  
promote faster non-inflationary economic growth, boost real wages, and  
raise the nation's standard of living. At a recent conference sponsored by  
the Hoover Institution, Dale W. Jorgenson of Harvard presented a paper,   
"The Economic Impact of Fundamental Tax Reform," showing that the  
adoption of a consumption tax such as the flat tax would increase the  
discounted value of Americans' future income by about $1.3 trillion.  
<p>	  
Such increases certainly justify considering a change in tax systems.  
Projecting increases in economic activity is risky business, however,  
since the projections always depend on the underlying assumptions. At  
the same conference, Laurence J. Kotlikoff of Boston University  
presented results based on a different type of economic model indicating  
that a switch to a consumption tax would eventually increase real wages  
by 7 percent and GDP per capita by 8 percent. These two studies are  
impressive and, because they are based on different types of models,  
credibly imply that the economy would perform significantly better under  
a flat tax or another consumption tax than it would under the current  
income tax.	  
<p> 
It is important to recognize that accelerated economic growth also means  
accelerated tax collections for federal, state, and local governments.  
While congressional and Treasury Department analysts persist in  
ignoring these additional revenues, policymakers should understand that   
additional economic growth will mean additional tax revenue. Using  
Jorgenson's estimates of economic growth, in present-value terms a flat  
tax could eventually raise well over $200 billion in additional federal  
revenues and $150 billion in additional state and local revenues.  
<p>	  
<b>Compliance and administrative-cost savings.</b> According to an analysis by  
the Tax Foundation, the annual compliance costs associated with the  
federal personal and corporate income taxes are roughly $200 billion.  
These costs result from recordkeeping, tax filing, litigation and appeals,   
and so forth. In addition, the federal government spends almost $14  
billion administering the system, for a total annual cost of well over $800  
per person.   
<p>	  
Most compliance costs are borne by the business sector, and most of  
these costs can be attributed to those areas of the tax code dealing with  
the timing of income and expense, and with the taxation of foreign- 
source income. The flat tax is a tax on cash flow, and so at a stroke it  
eliminates the issue of timing. It also exempts from U.S. tax the foreign-  
source income of U.S. citizens, so it eliminates this compliance cost as  
well. And, at the individual level, most compliance costs arise in relation  
to capital income, which would no longer be taxed, so these costs, too,  
disappear. While every tax system imposes some administrative and   
compliance costs, there is good reason to believe the flat tax eventually  
would dramatically reduce this burden on the taxpayer and on the  
economy.  
<p>	  
<b>Thoughts of lower interest rates.</b> Proponents of the flat tax (and of many  
other tax reform proposals) often suggest that lower (nominal, after-tax)  
interest rates would ensue. If a flat tax raises saving levels as promised,  
the amount of capital available for domestic and foreign investment  
would increase and, if everything else were held constant, this could  
reduce interest rates under certain circumstances. Everything else is not  
held equal, however. 
<p>
The flat tax may also improve investment  
opportunities by reducing the marginal tax burden on capital income.  
Recall that the double taxation of corporate income would cease and   
that businesses could, for example, expense their capital purchases. Thus,  
the domestic demand for new investment in plant and equipment may  
also increase. At this point, we cannot say whether saving would increase  
more or less rapidly than investment. 
<p>
However, as the modern mantra  
runs, we live in a global economy, and no markets are more completely  
integrated than the capital markets. This means that, to the extent   
domestic saving exceeds the demands of the economy for capital, the  
excess saving finds its way overseas in search of more profitable  
investments. And, when domestic saving is insufficient to meet domestic  
investment demands, we import capital from abroad. Thus, whether  
domestic saving increases more rapidly than investment following a flat  
tax, or vice versa, no significant effect on after-tax interest rates should   
be anticipated on this score. 
<p>
Pre-tax interest rates are nevertheless sure to  
decline following a flat tax. Interest rates reflect many factors, including  
expected inflation, a real, after-tax required rate of  return, a degree of  
uncertainty and, possibly, a degree of credit-market tightness. Interest  
rates also reflect the taxes the interest income recipient must pay, which  
explains, for example, why there is a significant difference in the interest   
rates paid to taxable and tax-exempt bond holders. Under a flat tax,  
interest income is tax-exempt, so pre-tax interest rates would fall to about  
what are currently the rates paid on tax-exempt bonds. 
<p>
On the flip side,  
interest expense is not deductible under a flat tax, so there would be no  
net reduction in after-tax interest costs to borrowers and hence little or no  
stimulation of growth from lower interest rates.

<b><a name="Middle-Class">PROBLEM #1: A MIDDLE-CLASS TAX BURDEN</a></b><br>  

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	  
At the tax rates currently discussed, the flat tax appears to impose a  
higher share of the total federal tax burden on middle-class taxpayers and  
appears to raise their taxes in dollar terms as well. Each of these  
represents an enormous political problem for flat-tax advocates.  
<p>	  
A progressive rate structure means that upper-income taxpayers pay a  
higher proportion of their labor income in taxes than do all other  
taxpayers. A revenue-neutral flat tax would shift some of the tax burden  
on labor income from upper-income taxpayers onto the middle class. This  
shift of tax burden to the middle class is exacerbated by the exclusion   
of capital income from the tax base, which on a per-capita basis is a  
larger fraction of a typical upper-income individual's taxable income than  
that of a middle-income individual. Finally, large personal exemptions  
would remove millions of lower-income individuals from the tax rolls.   
Consequently, the middle class would be forced to bear a greater share  
yet of the total tax burden.  
<p>	  
Flat-tax advocates take the fairness issue head on by advocating only one  
(or two) tax rates. Where the flat tax really attempts to redefine tax  
fairness, however, is in the exclusion of capital income from the tax base.  
Justice and tax neutrality are both served by excluding capital income  
since the capital has already been subject to tax at least once, if not   
many times over. Nevertheless, a clear problem of perceptions must be  
admitted.  
<p>	  
Consider two families. The Joneses have a combined salary of $50,000 in  
wages and salary. Under the Armey plan with a 20 percent tax rate, this  
family of four would owe $3,700 in tax. Now consider the Smiths, who  
in retirement consume every dollar of their $1 million in dividend  
income. Under the flat tax, the Smiths owe no tax at all because capital  
income is excluded from the tax base. This is appropriate, because their  
dividend income was taxed at least once before the Smith family received  
it. But the perception would persist that a wealthy family is paying no tax.  
<p>	  
When capital income, which would not be subject to personal income tax,  
is considered along with wage

<Font Size="2"><b>Less progressive.</b>  One potential criticism of the flat tax is that high-income groups appear to pay a lower percentage of their personal income in taxes than middle-income groups.  This occurs because higher-income groups receive a greater share of their earnings from capital income, which is exempt under the flat tax.  <b>Source:</b>  The Tax Foundation.<br>

<p>
income, average tax rates for higher- 
income groups are lower than for middle-income groups under the  
individual side of the flat tax (see chart below). And so this may be the  
Achilles' heel of a flat tax: Are the majority of the American people  
willing to define tax fairness entirely in terms of labor income? Can tax  
fairness be defined in such a way that individuals who consume 
significant  
amounts of capital income would be allowed to pay little or no tax? If so,  
then the flat tax has overcome its biggest hurdle. If not, then a flat tax  
solely on labor income probably cannot succeed.   
<p>	  
Flat-tax advocates can overcome this hurdle through careful analysis. As  
we shall soon see, a flat tax will shift the incidence of taxation sharply  
from individuals to business. While individuals will pay no tax on their  
own capital income, the businesses from which they earn capital income   
will pay higher taxes. The crucial point is this: The burden of business  
taxes is ultimately borne not by the entities that pay them but, one way or  
another, by workers (in the form of lower compensation) or by business  
owners (in the form of lower profits), who tend to belong to the higher- 
income group.  
<p>	  
The chart on page 29 shows the average tax paid at different income  
levels under a flat tax when business taxes are imputed to individuals.  
Following procedures adopted by the Congressional Budget Office, the  
Tax Foundation assumes that half of the business tax is ultimately paid by   
business owners and half is paid through reduced labor compensation.  
The imputation of the business tax shows a disproportionate share of the  
business-tax burden falling on upper-income taxpayers.  
<p>	  
The chart shows the distribution of the tax burden when we account for  
both the individual and business taxes under current law, under the  
Armey proposal with a 20 percent rate (which Armey argues reduces  
revenues by $40 billion annually relative to current law), and under a  
revenue-neutral version of the Armey proposal which the Tax   
Foundation calculates would require a 21.1 percent rate. (The lower rate  
claimed by Armey probably arises because his plan, by design, loses  
revenue relative to current law.) As the chart shows, when income is  
measured comprehensively and both labor and business income are taxed,  
the flat tax imposes a remarkably proportional tax burden (once  
individuals earn enough to pay tax).   
<p>	  
Analysis of the likely distribution of the tax burden also reveals some  
disturbing news for flat-tax advocates, however: At the proposed rates,  
the flat tax would impose a tax increase on middle-income taxpayers.  
This obviously creates an enormous political problem for flat-tax  
proponents. Many middle-income voters may object to a significant tax   
increase in exchange for a simpler tax system and the   
promise of a stronger economy. One solution is, of course, to   
cut spending to reduce the tax rate below 17 percent. This is   
Armey's solution. As noted below, however, this is far easier   
said than done.   
<p>
<center> 
<b><a name="Business End">PROBLEM #2:  THE BUSINESS END</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
Successful tax reform must always originate in the barber shops and  
bingo parlors outside the Washington Beltway. Without sustained popular  
support, the enormous effort of fundamental reform will fall short. A new  
tax principle, having gained the necessary popular support, must then  
gain the support, or at least the acquiescence, of the bulk of the business  
community. Tax reform that fails employers will fail their employees as  
well.   
<p>	 
The simplicity of the flat tax would eventually benefit the business sector  
by reducing both compliance costs and the uncertainty that a complex tax  
code imposes on business decisions. On the other hand, the business  
sector, at least under the Armey flat tax, appears to bear a much higher  
share of the total federal tax burden. Currently, the business sector bears  
about 31 percent of the burden. Under the Armey flat tax, according to  
Tax Foundation analysis, the business sector would bear about 50 percent  
of the burden, an increase of about two thirds. In other words, under the  
Armey plan about 19 percent of the total tax collection is shifted from  
individuals to businesses. The higher burden on businesses is due to  such  
things as the loss of the deductions for state and local taxes and for  
employee fringe benefits. (Some of this burden would eventually be  
shifted back to individuals, as companies convert fringe benefits into  
labor income on which individuals would have to pay taxes.)  
<p> 	 
It is, of course, true that businesses only collect taxes; individuals  
ultimately bear the tax burden. Nevertheless, business leaders are very  
aware of their average tax rate and the after-tax earnings they report to  
their owners. The business community in the aggregate suffered a hefty  
tax increase as part of the 1986 Tax Reform Act, though much smaller  
than that apparent in the Armey flat tax. Many of today's CEOs and chief  
financial officers were tax directors and tax vice-presidents in 1986, and  
they remember how a laudatory tax principle eventually boomeranged to  
their firms' detriment. Business owners are likely to resist any tax  
proposal that would raise their effective tax rates, even if it promised to  
accelerate economic growth.   
<p>	 
At the very least, successful tax reform should probably avoid increasing  
the net tax burden on America's businesses. Even so, such reform would  
still create lists of winners, losers, and uncertains. Traditionally, the  
uncertains oppose tax reform while projected losers fight harder against   
their losses than winners will fight for their gains, so even a revenue- 
neutral tax reform between individuals and businesses is likely to create  
important opposition to a flat tax.  
<p>
<center>
<b><a name="Other Obstacles">OTHER OBSTACLES</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
Aside from the basic tax-burden questions, there is a long list of obstacles  
for the flat tax to overcome:  
<p>	 
<b>Charitable contributions.</b> Under the current income tax, itemizing  
taxpayers can deduct amounts contributed to charitable organizations  
(churches, certain civic groups, educational institutions, research  
organizations, etc.) in calculating their taxable income. The charitable  
deduction is defended by politically powerful organizations from Harvard   
University and the Boy Scouts to the Catholic Church and the American  
Association of Retired Persons. For itemizers, contributions to these  
groups under current law are made in pre-tax dollars. Under a flat tax, the  
tax incentive to make a contribution is eliminated, so all such  
contributions must be made in after-tax dollars. Some decline in  
charitable giving should be expected for virtually all charities, at least  
initially, following the enactment of the tax. Over the long run, of   
course, the higher incomes and capital accumulation produced by a flat  
tax will lead to increases in giving that will offset the initial decline. Even  
so, charitable groups, recognizing the immediate threat to their funding,  
will surely lobby to keep the charitable deduction in the tax base.   
<p>	 
<b>Tax receipts under the Armey plan.</b> Flat-tax advocates also often strongly  
favor a smaller federal government, and the arguments in favor of one  
occasionally intermingle with arguments in favor of the other. However,  
a flat tax implies little or nothing about the desired level of government   
spending or taxation. It is a revenue system capable of raising a wide  
range of tax revenue levels depending on the tax rate chosen. Without  
question, a flat tax would be easier to enact and implement if the federal  
government

<Font Size="2"><b>More proportional.</b>  When income is defined comprehensively to include business income, taxes on higher-income groups remain remarkably proportional.  That's because the flat tax appears to shift some of the overall tax burden to businesses, whose taxes are borne disproportionately by (higher-income) business owners.  <b>Source:</b>  The Tax Foundation.<br>

<p>
needed less revenue. General tax cuts would help avoid the  
contest of winners and losers that typically impede tax reforms. Also,   
all tax reforms impose adjustment costs on the economy as resources are  
re-allocated and re-priced. These costs would be easier to bear in the  
context of reduced overall tax burdens.   
<p>	 
The initial tax rate under the Armey flat tax is set at 20 percent, which  
Armey argues would reduce federal collections by about $40 billion  
annually; the tax rate drops two years later to 17 percent. The Armey plan  
argues forcefully for funding these cuts with spending cuts. Over the   
traditional five-year budget window, setting the flat rate at 20 percent  
means cutting spending by about $250 billion. To put it in perspective,  
the budget passed by the House Budget Committee in May to eliminate  
the deficit called for spending cuts of $459 billion over five years.   
<p>	 
The spending cuts needed to fund the Armey flat tax would be in addition  
to those in the Fiscal Year 1996 Budget Resolution. For advocates of a  
dramatically smaller government, a call for additional spending cuts to  
fund flat-tax reform is more of an opportunity than a problem. But,   
given the difficulties of achieving the cuts in the budget resolution, it is  
fair to question whether additional cuts of this size are possible. At this  
stage, the possible responses of the flat-tax advocates would seem to be  
either that the revenue scoring must include revenue gains from projected   
accelerated economic growth or that the extra spending cuts are possible  
and desirable.  
<p>	 
<b>The flat tax and the health care debate.</b> Under a flat tax, the employer  
would no longer be allowed to deduct the cost of employee health- 
insurance coverage. This arrangement eliminates a serious distortion in  
the current system -- the tax advantage of employer-provided health   
insurance. Denying employers the ability to deduct the cost of health  
insurance will discourage them from continuing to provide insurance as a  
benefit. Instead, they are likely to raise wage and salary income, and  
families would have to buy their own insurance. Eventually, such a  
family-based system should work as well for health insurance as it does  
for any other form of insurance.  
<p>	 
At the outset, the flat tax could expose individuals to much higher  
insurance premiums if they no longer receive the benefit of group rates.  
This is a serious transition issue for the flat tax for which no good  
solution seems available. One could, for example, require employers to  
continue to offer insurance for a specified period following tax reform.   
Another solution would be to require insurers to continue coverage  
indefinitely for previously covered employees, and set insurance  
premiums at the levels applicable to the employee's previous group.   
<p> 
<b>Double taxation and state and local taxes.</b> Alongside tax neutrality,  
avoiding double taxation between tax jurisdictions is a fundamental goal  
of good tax policy. Double taxation occurs when an individual pays tax to  
one entity and must pay tax to another jurisdiction on the tax paid to the  
first. For example, when a taxpayer pays $100 in state tax ad the federal  
government includes that $100 in the taxpayer's income for federal  
income-tax purposes, then the individual is effectively paying tax on  
taxes received by the state. This is unfair to the taxpayer.  
<p>	 
With the exception of sales taxes, state and local taxes are currently  
deductible for itemizers at the individual level and for all corporate  
taxpayers, thereby avoiding double taxation. This deduction is typically  
eliminated under a flat tax, thereby assuring double taxation and bringing  
new pressures on state and local government finances. A flat tax would  
disproportionately raise the costs of living and doing business in high-tax  
states and localities. Recognizing the threat, state and local government  
officials would strenuously oppose this change in policy. On the other  
hand, many advocates of smaller government would applaud the  
additional fiscal pressures on government under a flat tax, even at the  
price of a measure of unfairness.   
<p>	 
<b>Transition issues.</b> They say the Devil is in the details, and that is certainly  
true of tax reform. But the Devil is in his Heaven when dealing with  
transition issues. A complicated economy subject to a complex tax  
system produces extraordinary business and contractual arrangements. A   
simpler tax system may eliminate the need for some of these  
complications going forward, but the old arrangements would still be in  
force and must be addressed. The limited space available here precludes a  
discussion of these issues, but they would include the depreciation of  
previously purchased plant and equipment, the taxation of deferred  
foreign-source income, the use of accumulated Alternative Minimum Tax   
Credits, etc.   
<p>

<b><a name="Possibility Awaits">A GREATER POSSIBILITY AWAITS</a></b><br>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
Tax reform, and the flat tax in particular, is intended to replace a very  
poor tax system with a simpler tax promising better economic  
performance. Once such a system has been designed, the level of  
collections demanded of it is a matter of choosing the tax rate.  
<p>	 
The federal government, however, collects a wide variety of other taxes,  
including sales taxes on gasoline and other items, payroll taxes, and user  
fees which should also be considered for replacement. For example,  
federal sales taxes are highly distortionary, require separate and costly  
collection mechanisms, and are generally thought to be regressive.   
<p>	 
Once a new tax base has been established, strong arguments should be  
required in favor of keeping any of the other existing components of the  
federal tax system. Failing such arguments, we should give serious  
consideration to replacing these other, inferior tax systems, making up the   
revenue with a higher flat tax rate. A flat-tax rate of between 38 and 40  
percent would likely raise enough revenue to allow the elimination of the  
payroll tax and all other federal taxes.  
<p>	 
The nation faces many serious economic problems, including Social  
Security and Medicare systems racing towards bankruptcy, a costly  
private health-care system, and high regulatory burdens. So tax reform  
has some steep competition for national attention. It is all the more   
impressive, therefore, that the flat tax's advocates have succeeded in  
moving tax reform to the forefront so quickly. Replacing the current tax  
system with something significantly better, whether a flat tax or an  
alternative, will not solve all our economic ills. But the more rapid  
economic growth it promises may make finding the other solutions a   
little easier.

<h3><a name="Addendum">Taking on the Mortgage-Interest Deduction</a></h3>
<hr width="60%">

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
If the flat tax is to gain the support of the public, its advocates will have to confront defenders of existing 
deductions head on. The most important deduction for most itemizing individuals is the mortgage-interest deduction. Many observers defend this deduction as encouraging home ownership; some argue that it is necessary for tax neutrality. Under the Armey flat tax, the deduction disappears.
<p>
Many groups believe they would be injured by the elimination of the mortgage-interest deduction. They 
argue, for example, that the loss of the deduction would raise the cost of home ownership, reduce the value of existing homes, and generally cripple the home building industry. In combination, the realtors, the home-builders, the mortgage lenders, and the construction-workers unions make a very powerful lobby, particularly when millions of homeowners are added to the mix.
<p>
The concerns of the mortgage-interest deduction lobby are generally misplaced. As noted above in the 
discussion on interest rates, the tax a saver must pay on interest income is recovered by demanding a higher interest rate. Since a flat tax does not tax individual interest income, pretax market interest rates will fall significantly, just as tax-exempt bonds now pay interest more than 2 percentage points below the rate paid to taxable bonds. Mortgage lenders, seeing their cost of funds fall, will be driven by competition to pass these savings along to mortgage borrowers in the form of lower mortgage rates.
<p>
In after-tax terms, the elimination of the home-mortgage deduction will neither raise nor lower the interest
cost of home-mortgage borrowing. Therefore, that reform should have no affect on the demand for homes or on property values.
<p>
The benefit of lower mortgage rates does not extend to current mortgage holders unless they refinance their mortgages. Thus a legitimate problem is the treatment of mortgages underwritten prior to the enactment of a flat tax. Most of these borrowers assumed they would be able to deduct mortgage interest paid, thereby producing a lower after-tax interest rate and a lower tax burden. Since an estimated 27.4 million taxpayers will claim this deduction in 1995 to the tune of about $238 billion, a potentially huge bloc of voters stand ready to join the ranks of flat-tax opponents. While many or most may be able-to refinance, refinancing may be impractical for many current mortgage holders if, for example, they expect to sell the property in the following year or two.
<p>
A fair (and politically sensible) solution to the old mortgages problem might be to allow homeowners to 
deduct the interest on mortgages taken before the flat tax is enacted. While fairness demands 
grandfathering pre-existing mortgages, the consequence would be a slightly more complicated tax system and a short and medium-term erosion of the tax base, which would have to be offset with initially higher tax rates.
<p>
A loss in the battle over the mortgage interest deduction would not derail the essential effort to develop a flatter, simpler, more saver-friendly tax system. It would, however, require a much higher tax rate initially, and it would make it harder to repeal other popular deductions, like that for charitable contributions.

<center><h3>HOW OUR LAWS ARE MADE</h3></center><p>

I. <a name="introduction"><b>INTRODUCTION</b></a><p>

This handbook is intended to provide a readable and 
nontechnical outline of the background and the numerous steps 
of our Federal lawmaking process from the origin of an idea 
for a legislative proposal through its publication as a 
statute. This is a matter about which every citizen should be 
well informed so as to be able to understand the everyday 
news reports and discussions concerning the work of Congress.<p>

 It is hoped that this handbook will enable every citizen to 
gain a greater understanding of the Federal legislative 
process and its role as one of the bulwarks of our 
representative system. One of the most practical safeguards 
of the American democratic way of life is this legislative 
process that, with its emphasis on the protection of the 
minority, gives ample opportunity to all sides to be heard 
and make their views known. The fact that a proposal cannot 
become a law without consideration and approval by both 
Houses of Congress is an outstanding virtue of our 
legislative system. Open and full discussion provided for 
under our Con stitution frequently results in the notable 
improvement of a bill by amendment before it becomes law, or 
the defeat of a bad  proposal.<p>

 Because the large majority of laws originate in the House of 
Representatives, this discussion will be directed principally 
to the procedure in that body.<p>

 
 II. <a name="congress"> <b>THE CONGRESS</b></a><p>

Article I, Section 1, of the United States Constitution, 
provides that--<p>

 All legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a 
Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a 
Senate and House of Representatives.

 The Senate is composed of 100 Members--2 from each State, 
irrespective of population or area--elected by the people in 
conformity with the provisions of the 17th Amendment to the 
Constitution. That amendment changed the former 
Constitutional method under which Senators were chosen by the 
respective State legislatures. A Senator must be at least 30 
years of age, have been a citizen of the United States for 9 
years, and, when elected, be a resident of the State for 
which the Senator is chosen. The term of office is 6 years 
and one-third of the total membership of the Senate is 
elected every second year. The terms of both Senators from a 
particular State are so arranged that they do not terminate 
at the same time. Of the 2 Senators from a State serving at 
the same time the one who was elected first--or if both were 
elected at the same time, the one elected for a full term--is 
referred to as the "senior" Senator from that State. The 
other is referred to as the "junior" Senator. If a Senator 
dies or resigns during the term, the governor of the State 
must call a special election unless the State legislature has 
authorized the governor to appoint a successor until the next 
election, at which time a successor is elected for the 
balance of the term. Most of the State legislatures have 
granted their governors the power of appointment.<p>

Each Senator has one vote.<p>

 As constituted in 1989--the 101st Congress--the House of 
Representatives is composed of 435 Members elected every 2 
years from among the 50 States, apportioned to their total 
populations. The permanent number of 435 was established 
following the Thirteenth Decennial Census in 1910, as 
directed in Article I, Section 2, of the Constitution, and 
was increased temporarily to 437 for the 87th Congress, to 
provide for one Representative each for Alaska and Hawaii. It 
seems undesirable to make a considerable increase in the 
number of Members, because a larger body, similar to the 
British House of Commons, consisting of 650 members, would be 
too unwieldy. The Constitution limits the number of 
Representatives to not more than one for every 30,000 of 
population, and, under a former apportionment in one State a 
particular Representative represented more than 900,000 
constituents, while another in the same State was elected 
from a district having a population of only 175,000. The 
Supreme Court * has since held unconstitutional a Missouri 
statute permitting a maximum population variance of 3.1 
percent from mathematical equality. The Court said that the 
variances among the districts were not unavoidable and, 
therefore, were invalid. This is an interpretation of the 
Court's earlier decision that "as nearly as is practicable 
one man's vote in a Congressional election is to be worth as 
much as another's".<p>

 * Kirkpatrick v. Preisler, 394 U.S. 526 (1969).<p>

 A law enacted in 1967 abolished all "at-large" elections 
(that is, Representatives elected by the voters of the entire 
State rather than in a Congressional district within the 
State) except, of course, in States entitled to only one 
Representative.<p>

 A Representative must be at least 25 years of age, have been 
a citizen of the United States for 7 years, and, when 
elected, be a resident of the State in which the 
Representative is chosen. If a Representative dies or resigns 
during the term, the governor of the State must call a 
special election for the choosing of a successor to serve for 
the unexpired portion of the term.<p>

Each Representative has one vote.<p>

In addition to the Representatives from each of the States, 
there is a Resident Commissioner from the Commonwealth of 
Puerto Rico and Delegates from the District of Columbia, 
American Samoa, Guam, and the Virgin Islands. The Resident 
Commissioner and the Delegates have most of the prerogatives 
of Representatives, with the important exception of the right 
to vote on matters before the House.<p>

Under the provisions of Section 2 of the 20th Amendment to 
the Constitution, Congress must assemble at least once every 
year, at noon on the 3d day of January, unless by law they 
appoint a different day.<p>

 A Congress lasts for 2 years, commencing in January of the 
year following the biennial election of Members, and is 
divided into 2 sessions.<p>

 Unlike some other parliamentary bodies, both the Senate and 
the House of Representatives have equal legislative functions 
and powers (except that only the House of Representatives may 
initiate revenue bills), and the designation of one as the 
"upper" House and the other as the "lower" House is not 
appropriate.<p>

 The Constitution authorizes each House to determine the 
rules of its proceedings. Pursuant to that authority the 
House of Representatives adopts its rules on the opening day 
of each Congress. The Senate, which considers itself a 
continuing body, operates under standing rules that it amends 
from time to time.<p>

 The chief function of Congress is the making of laws. In 
addition, the Senate has the function of advising and 
consenting to treaties and to certain nominations by the 
President. In the matter of impeachments, the House of 
Representatives presents the charges--a function similar to 
that of a grand jury--and the Senate sits as a court to try 
the impeachment. Both Houses meet in joint session on the 6th 
day of January, following a presidential election, to count 
the electoral votes. If no candidate receives a majority of 
the total electoral votes, the House of Representatives 
chooses the President from among the 3 candidates having the 
largest number of votes, and the Senate chooses the Vice 
President from the 2 candidates having the largest number of 
votes for that office.<p>

 
 III. <a name="legislation"><b>SOURCES OF LEGISLATION</b></a><p>

 Sources of ideas for legislation are unlimited, and 
proposed drafts of bills originate in many diverse quarters. 
First of these is, of course, the idea and draft conceived by 
a Member. This may emanate from the election campaign during 
which the Member had promised to introduce legislation on a 
particular subject, if elected. The entire campaign may have 
been based upon one or more such proposals. Or, through 
experience after taking office the Member may have become 
aware of the need for amendment or repeal of existing laws or 
the enactment of a statute in an entirely new field.<p>

 In addition, the Member's constituents--either as 
individuals or by corporate activity such as citizen groups 
or associations, bar associations, labor unions, 
manufacturers' associations, and chambers of commerce--may 
avail themselves of the right to petition, which is 
guaranteed by the First Amendment to the Constitution, and 
transmit their proposals to the Member. Many excellent laws 
have originated in this way inasmuch as some of those 
organizations, because of their vital concern with various 
areas of legislation, have considerable knowledge regarding 
the laws affecting their interests and have the services of 
expert legislative draftsmen at their disposal for this 
purpose. If favorably impressed by the idea, the Member may 
introduce the proposal in the form in which it has been 
submitted or may first redraft it. In all events, the Member 
may consult with the Legislative Counsel of the House or the 
Senate, as the case may be, to frame the ideas in suitable 
legislative language and form for introduction.<p>

 In modern times the "executive communication" has become a 
prolific source of legislative proposals. This is usually in 
the form of a letter from a member of the President's Cabinet 
or the head of an independent agency--or even from the 
President--transmitting a draft of a proposed bill to the 
Speaker of the House of Representatives and the President of 
the Senate. Despite the system of separation of powers, 
Article II, Section 3, of the Constitution imposes an 
obligation on the President to report to Congress from time 
to time on the "State of the Union" and to recommend for 
consideration such measures as the President considers 
necessary and expedient. Many of these executive 
communications follow on the President's message to Congress 
on the State of the Union. The communication is then referred 
to the standing committee having jurisdiction of the subject 
matter embraced in the proposal because a bill may be 
introduced only by a Member of Congress. The Chairman of that 
committee usually introduces the bill promptly either in the 
form in which it was received or with changes the Chairman 
considers necessary or desirable. This practice prevails even 
when the majority of the House and the President are not of 
the same political party, although there is no constitutional 
or statutory requirement that a bill be introduced to 
effectuate the recommendations. Otherwise, the message may be 
considered by the committee or one of its subcommittees to 
determine whether a bill should be introduced. The most 
important of the regular executive communications is the 
annual message from the President transmitting the proposed 
budget to Congress. This, together with testimony by 
officials of the various branches of the Government before 
the Appropriations Committees of the House and Senate, is the 
basis of the several appropriation bills that are drafted by 
the Committee on Appropriations of the House.<p>

 Several of the executive departments and independent 
agencies have staffs of trained legislative counsels whose 
functions include the drafting of bills to be forwarded to 
Congress with a request for their enactment.<p>

 The drafting of statutes is an art that requires great 
skill, knowledge, and experience. In some instances a draft 
is the result of a study covering a period of a year or more 
by a commission or committee designated by the President or 
one of the Cabinet officers. The Administrative Procedure Act 
and the Uniform Code of Military Justice are only 2 of many 
examples of enactments resulting from such studies. In 
addition, Congressional committees sometimes draft bills 
after studies and hearings covering periods of a year or 
more. Bills to codify the laws relating to crimes and 
criminal procedure, the judiciary and judicial procedure, the 
armed forces, and other subjects, have each required several 
years of preparation.<p>

 
 IV. <a name="Action"><b> FORMS OF CONGRESSIONAL ACTION</b></a><p>

The work of Congress is initiated by the introduction of a 
proposal in one of 4 principal forms. These are: the bill, 
the joint resolution, the concurrent resolution, and the 
simple resolution. By far the most customary form used in 
both Houses is the bill. During the 100th Congress (1987 
-1988), there were introduced in both Houses, 8,515 bills and 
1,073 joint resolutions. Of this number 5,585 bills and 678 
joint resolutions originated in the House of Representatives.<p>

 For the sake of simplicity this discussion will be confined 
generally to the procedure on a House of Representatives 
bill, but a brief comment will be made about each of the 
forms.<p>

<b> BILLS</b><p>

 A bill is the form used for most legislation, whether 
permanent or temporary, general or special, public or 
private.<p>

 The form of a House bill is as follows:<p>
<center>
                    A BILL<br
<br>
<br
 For the establishment, etc. 
            [as the title may be].<p>
</center>
 Be it enacted by the Senate and House of Representatives of 
the United States of America in Congress assembled, That, 
etc.<p>

 The enacting clause was prescribed by law in 1871 and is 
identical in all bills, whether they originate in the House 
of Representatives or in the Senate.<p>

 Bills may originate in either the House of Representatives 
or the Senate, with one notable exception provided for by the 
Constitution. Article I, Section 7, of the Constitution, 
provides that all bills for raising revenue shall originate 
in the House of Representatives but the Senate may propose or 
concur with amendments, as on other bills. General 
appropriation bills also originate in the House of 
Representatives.<p>

 There are 2 types of bills--public and private. A public 
bill is one that affects the public generally. A bill of a 
private character, that is, a bill that affects an individual 
rather than the population at large, is called a private 
bill. A private bill is used for relief in matters such as 
immigration and naturalization and claims by or against the 
United States.<p>

 Article I, Section 8, prescribes the matters concerning 
which Congress may legislate, while Section 9 of the same 
Article places certain limitations on Congressional action.<p>

 A bill originating in the House of Representatives is 
designated by the letters "H.R." followed by a number that it 
retains throughout all its parliamentary stages. The letters 
signify "House of Representatives" and not, as is sometimes 
supposed, "House resolution". A Senate bill is designated by 
the letter "S." followed by its number. The term "companion 
bill" is used to describe a bill introduced in one House of 
Congress that is similar or identical to a bill introduced in 
the other House of Congress. <p>

 A bill that has been agreed to in identical form by both 
bodies becomes the law of the land only after--<p>

 (1) Presidential approval; or<p>

 (2) failure by the President to return it with objections to 
the House in which it originated within 10 days while 
Congress is in session; or<p>

 (3) the overriding of a Presidential veto by a two-thirds 
vote in each House.<p>

 It does not become law without the President's signature if 
Congress by their adjournment prevent its return with 
objections. This is known as a "pocket veto".<p>

<b> JOINT RESOLUTIONS</b><p>

 Joint resolutions may originate either in the House of 
Representatives or in the Senate--not, as may be supposed, 
jointly in both Houses. There is little practical difference 
between a bill and a joint resolution and, although the 
latter are not as numerous as bills, the 2 forms are often 
used indiscriminately. Statutes that have been initiated as 
bills have later been amended by a joint resolution, and vice 
versa. Both are subject to the same procedure--with the 
exception of a joint resolution proposing an amendment to the 
Constitution. When a joint resolution amending the 
Constitution is approved by two-thirds of both Houses, it is 
sent directly to the Archivist of the United States for 
submission to the several States for ratification. It is not 
presented to the President for approval.<p>

 The form of a House joint resolution is as follows:<p>
<center>
                 JOINT RESOLUTION<br>
<br>
<br
Authorizing, etc. [as the title may be].<p>
</center>

   Resolved by the Senate and House of Representatives
   of the United States of America in Congress assembled,
   That all, etc.<p>

 The resolving clause is identical in both House and Senate 
joint resolutions, having been prescribed by statute in 1871. 
It is frequently preceded by one or more "whereas" clauses 
indicating the necessity for or the desirability of the joint 
resolution.<p>

 The term "joint" does not signify simultaneous introduction 
and consideration in both Houses.<p>

 A joint resolution originating in the House of 
Representatives is designated "H.J. Res." followed by its 
individual number which it retains throughout all its 
parliamentary stages. One originating in the Senate is 
designated "S.J. Res." followed by its number.<p>

 Joint resolutions become law in the same manner as bills.<p>

<b> CONCURRENT RESOLUTIONS</b><p>

 Matters affecting the operations of both Houses are usually 
initiated by means of concurrent resolutions. In modern 
practice, these normally are not legislative in character but 
are used merely for expressing facts, principles, opinions, 
and purposes of the 2 Houses. They are not equivalent to a 
bill and their use is narrowly limited within these bounds.<p>

 The term "concurrent" does not signify simultaneous 
introduction and consideration in both Houses.<p>

 A concurrent resolution originating in the House of 
Representatives is designated "H. Con. Res." followed by its 
individual number, while a Senate concurrent resolution is 
designated "S. Con. Res." together with its number. On 
approval by both Houses, they are signed by the Clerk of the 
House and the Secretary of the Senate and transmitted to the 
Archivist of the United States for publication in a special 
part of the Statutes at Large volume covering that session of 
Congress. They are not presented to the President for action 
as in the cases of bills and joint resolutions unless they 
contain a proposition of legislation, and that, of course, is 
not within their scope in their modern form.<p>

<b> SIMPLE RESOLUTIONS</b><p>

 A matter concerning the operation of either House alone is 
initiated by a simple resolution. A resolution affecting the 
House of Representatives is designated "H. Res." followed by 
its number, while a Senate resolution is designated "S. Res." 
together with its number. They are considered only by the 
body in which they were introduced and on adoption are 
attested to by the Clerk of the House of Representatives or 
the Secretary of the Senate, as the case may be, and are 
published in the Congressional Record.<p>

 
 V. <a name="reference"><b>INTRODUCTION AND REFERENCE TO COMMITTEE</b></a><p>

  Any Member, the Resident Commissioner, and the Delegates in 
the House of Representatives may introduce a bill at any time 
while the House is actually sitting by simply placing it in 
the "hopper" provided for the purpose at the side of the 
Clerk's desk in the House Chamber. Permission is not required 
to introduce the measure or to make a statement at the time 
of introduction. Printed blank forms for use in typing the 
original bill are supplied through the Clerk's office. The 
name of the sponsor is endorsed on the bill. A public bill 
may be sponsored by an unlimited number of Members. On 
request, a Member may be added as a sponsor no later than the 
day the bill is reported to the House. (For a discussion of 
"Reported bills", see Part VII.) In addition, a Member listed 
as a sponsor (other than the first sponsor) may have the 
Member's name deleted as a sponsor no later than the day the 
bill is reported to the House. To forestall the possibility 
that a bill might be introduced in the House on behalf of a 
Member without that Member's prior approval, the sponsoring 
Member's signature must appear on the bill before it is 
accepted for introduction. When there are multiple sponsors 
of a bill, the signature must be that of the Member first 
named thereon. In the Senate, unlimited multiple sponsorship 
of a bill also is permitted. Occasionally, a Member may 
insert the words "by request" after the Member's name to 
indicate that the introduction of the measure is in 
compliance with the suggestion of some other person.<p>

 In the Senate, a Senator usually introduces a bill or 
resolution by presenting it to one of the clerks at the 
Presiding Officer's desk, without commenting on it from the 
floor of the Senate. However, a Senator may use a more formal 
procedure by rising and introducing the bill or resolution 
from the floor. A Senator usually makes a statement about the 
measure when introducing it on the floor. Frequently, 
Senators obtain consent to have the bill or resolution 
printed in the body of the Congressional Record, following 
their formal statement.<p>

 If any Senator objects to the introduction of a bill or 
resolution, the introduction of the bill or resolution is 
postponed until the next day. If there is no objection, the 
bill is read by title and referred to the appropriate 
committee.<p>

 In the House of Representatives it is no longer the custom 
to read bills--even by title--at the time of introduction. 
The title is entered in the Journal and printed in the 
Congressional Record, thus preserving the purpose of the old 
rule. The bill is assigned its legislative number by the 
Clerk and referred to the appropriate committees by the 
Speaker (the Member elected to be the Presiding Officer of 
the House) with the assistance of the Parliamentarian. These 
details appear in the daily issue of the Congressional 
Record. It is then sent to the Government Printing Office 
where it is printed in its introduced form, and printed 
copies are available shortly thereafter in the document rooms 
of both Houses. <p>

 One copy is sent to the office of the Chairman of the 
committee to which it has been referred, for action by that 
committee. The clerk of the committee enters it on the 
committee's Legislative Calendar.<p>

 Perhaps the most important phase of the Congressional 
process is the action by committees. That is where the most 
intensive consideration is given to the proposed measures and 
where the people are given their opportunity to be heard. 
Nevertheless, this phase where such a tremendous volume of 
hard work is done by the Members is sometimes overlooked by 
the public, particularly when complaining about delays in 
enacting laws. There are, at present, 22 standing committees 
in the House and 16 in the Senate, as well as several select 
committees. In addition, there are several standing joint 
committees of the 2 Houses.<p>

 Each committee has jurisdiction over certain subject matters 
of legislation and all measures affecting a particular area 
of the law are referred to that committee that has 
jurisdiction over it. For example, the Committee on the 
Judiciary has jurisdiction over measures relating to judicial 
proceedings (civil and criminal) generally, and 18 other 
categories, of which Constitutional amendments, immigration 
and naturalization, bankruptcy, revision and codification of 
statutes, civil liberties, antitrust, patents, copyrights and 
trademarks, are but a few. In all, the rules of the House and 
of the Senate each provide for approximately 200 different 
classifications of measures that are to be referred to 
committees.<p>

 Membership on the various committees is divided between the 
2 major political parties. The proportion of the Members of 
the minority party to the Members of the majority party is 
determined by the majority party, except that one-half of the 
Members on the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct are 
from the majority party and one-half from the minority party. 
The respective party caucuses nominate Members of the caucus 
to be elected to each standing committee at the beginning of 
each Congress. Membership on a standing committee during the 
course of a Congress is contingent on continuing membership 
in the caucus that nominated the Member for election to the 
committee. If the Member ceases to be a Member of the caucus, 
the Member automatically ceases to be a Member of the 
standing committee.<p>

 A Member may serve on more than one committee. However, the 
rules of the caucus of the majority party in the House 
provide that the Chairmen of certain committees may not serve 
on another committee and that a Member may be Chairman of 
only one subcommittee of a committee or select committee with 
legislative jurisdiction, excepting certain committees 
performing housekeeping functions and joint committees.<p>

 A Member usually seeks election to the committee that has 
jurisdiction over a field in which the Member is most 
qualified and interested. For example, the Committee on the 
Judiciary traditionally is composed entirely of lawyers. Many 
Members are nationally recognized experts in the specialty of 
their particular committee or subcommittee.<p>

 Members rank in seniority in accordance with the order of 
their appointment to the committee, and usually the ranking 
majority Member is elected Chairman. The rules of the House 
require that committee Chairmen be elected from nominations 
submitted by the majority party caucus at the commencement of 
each Congress.<p>

 Most committees have 2 or more subcommittees that, in 
addition to having general jurisdiction, specialize in the 
consideration of particular classifications of bills. Each 
standing committee of the House, except the Committee on the 
Budget, that has more than 20 Members must establish at least 
4 subcommittees.<p>

 Each committee is provided with a professional and clerical 
staff to assist it in the innumerable administrative details 
and other problems involved in the consideration of bills. 
For the standing committees, the professional staff 
(consisting of not more than 18, 6 of whom may be selected by 
the minority) is appointed on a permanent basis solely on the 
basis of fitness to perform the duties of their respective 
positions. The clerical staff (consisting of not more than 
12, 4 of whom may be selected by the minority) is appointed 
to handle correspondence and stenographic work for the 
committee staff and the Chairman and ranking minority Member 
on matters related to committee work. All staff appointments 
are made by a majority vote of the committee without regard 
to race, creed, sex, or age. The minority staff provisions do 
not apply to the Committee on Standards of Official Conduct 
because of its bipartisan nature. The Committee on 
Appropriations and the Committee on the Budget have special 
authority under the rules of the House for appointment of 
staff and assistants for the minority.<p>

 Under certain conditions, a standing committee may appoint 
consultants on a temporary or intermittent basis and also may 
provide financial assistance to members of its professional 
staff for the purpose of acquiring specialized training, 
whenever the committee determines that such training will aid 
the committee in the discharge of its responsibilities.<p>

 
 VI. <a name="committee"><b> CONSIDERATION BY COMMITTEE</b></a><p>

The rules adopted by the caucus of the majority party in 
the House provide that the Chairman of the committee to which 
a bill has been referred must refer the bill to the 
appropriate subcommittee within 2 weeks, unless a majority of 
the Members of the majority party on the committee vote to 
have the bill considered by the full committee. One of the 
first actions taken is the transmittal of copies of the bill 
to the departments and agencies concerned with the subject 
matter and frequently to the General Accounting Office with a 
request for an official report of views on the necessity or 
desirability of enacting the bill into law. Ample time is 
given for the submission of the reports and when received 
they are accorded serious consideration but are not binding 
on the committee in determining whether or not to act 
favorably on the bill. Reports of the departments and 
agencies in the executive branch are submitted first to the 
Office of Management and Budget to determine whether they are 
consistent with the program of the President.<p>

 <b>COMMITTEE MEETINGS</b><p>

 Standing committees are required to have regular meeting 
days at least once a month, but the Chairman may call and 
convene additional meetings. Three or more Members of a 
standing committee may file with the committee a written 
request that the Chairman call a special meeting. The request 
must specify the measure or matter to be considered. If the 
Chairman fails, within 3 calendar days after the filing of 
the request, to call the requested special meeting, to be 
held within 7 calendar days after the filing of the request, 
a majority of the Members of the committee may call the 
special meeting by filing with the committee written notice 
specifying the time and date of the meeting and the measure 
or matter to be considered.<p>

 With the exception of the Committees on Appropriations, on 
the Budget, on Rules, on Standards of Official Conduct, on 
Ways and Means, and on House Administration, committees may 
not, without special permission, meet while the House is 
reading a measure for amendment under the "five-minute rule". 
(See first paragraph under heading "Second Reading" in Part 
XI.) Special permission to meet will be given unless 10 or 
more Members object. The rules of the House also provide that 
House committees may not meet during a joint session of the 
House and Senate or during a recess when a joint meeting of 
the House and Senate is in progress. Committees may meet at 
other times during a recess up to the expiration of the 
constitutional term.<p>

 <b>PUBLIC HEARINGS</b><p>

 If the bill is of sufficient importance, and particularly if 
it is controversial, the committee will usually set a date 
for public hearings. Each committee (except the Committee on 
Rules) is required to make public announcement of the date, 
place, and subject matter of any hearing to be conducted by 
the committee on any measure or matter at least one week 
before the commencement of that hearing, unless the committee 
determines that there is good cause to begin the hearing at 
an earlier date. If the committee makes that determination, 
it must make a public announcement to that effect at the 
earliest possible date. Public announcements are published in 
the Daily Digest portion of the Congressional Record as soon 
as possible after the announcement is made by the committee, 
and are often noted in news papers and periodicals. Personal 
notice, usually in the form of a letter, but possibly in the 
form of a subpena, is sent frequently to individuals, 
organizations, and Government departments and agencies that 
are known to be interested.<p>

 Each hearing by a committee and subcommittee is required to 
be open to the public except when the committee or 
subcommittee, in open session and with a majority present, 
determines by rollcall vote that all or part of the remainder 
of the hearing on that day shall be closed to the public 
because disclosure of testimony, evidence, or other matters 
to be considered would endanger the national security or 
would violate a law or a rule of the House. The committee or 
subcommittee by the same procedure may vote to close one 
subsequent day of hearing, except that the Committees on 
Appropriations and on Armed Services and the Permanent Select 
Committee on Intelligence, and subcommittees of those 
committees, by the same procedure may vote to close up to 5 
additional consecutive days of hearings. When a quorum for 
taking testimony is present, a majority of the Members 
present may close a hearing to discuss whether the evidence 
or testimony to be received would endanger national security 
or would tend to defame, degrade, or incriminate any person.<p>

 Hearings on the budget are required to be held by the 
Committee on Appropriations in open session within 30 days 
after its transmittal to Congress, except when the Committee, 
in open session and with a quorum present, determines by 
rollcall vote that the testimony to be taken at that hearing 
on that day may be related to a matter of national security. 
The Committee may by the same procedure close one subsequent 
day of hearing.<p>

 On the day set for the public hearing an official reporter 
is present to record the testimony in favor of and against 
the bill. The bill may be read in full at the opening of the 
hearings and a copy is inserted in the record. After a brief 
introductory statement by the Chairman and often by the 
ranking minority Member or other committee Member, the first 
witness is called. Members or Senators who wish to be heard 
are given preference out of courtesy and because of the 
limitations on their time. Cabinet officers and high-ranking 
civil and military officials of the Government, as well as 
interested private individuals, testify either voluntarily or 
at the request or summons of the committee.<p>

 Committees require, so far as practicable, that witnesses 
who appear before it file with the committee, in advance of 
their appearance, a written statement of their proposed 
testimony and limit their oral presentations to a brief 
summary of their arguments.<p>

 Minority party Members of the committee are entitled to call 
witnesses of their own to testify on a measure during at 
least one day of the hearing.<p>

 All committee rules in the House must provide that each 
Member shall have only 5 minutes in the interrogation of 
witnesses until each Member of the committee who desires to 
question a witness has had an opportunity to do so.<p>

 A typewritten transcript of the testimony taken at a public 
hearing is made available for inspection in the office of the 
clerk of the committee and frequently the complete transcript 
is printed and distributed widely by the committee.<p>

<b> BUSINESS MEETINGS</b><p>

 After hearings are completed, the subcommittee usually will 
consider the bill in a session that is popularly known as the 
"markup" session. The views of both sides are studied in 
detail and at the conclusion of deliberation a vote is taken 
to determine the action of the subcommittee. It may decide to 
report the bill favorably to the full committee, with or 
without amendment, or unfavorably, or suggest that the 
committee "table" it, that is, postpone action indefinitely. 
Each Member of the subcommittee, regardless of party 
affiliation, has one vote.<p>

 All meetings for the transaction of business, including the 
markup of legislation, of standing committees or 
subcommittees must be open to the public except when the 
committee or subcommittee, in open session with a majority 
present, determines by rollcall vote that all or part of the 
remainder of the meeting on that day shall be closed to the 
public. This requirement does not apply to any meeting that 
relates solely to internal budget or personnel matters. 
Members of the committee may authorize congressional staff 
and departmental representatives to be present at any 
business or markup session that has been closed to the 
public.<p>

<b> COMMITTEE ACTION</b><p>

 At committee meetings reports on bills may be made by 
subcommittees. Reports are fully discussed and amendments may 
be offered. Committee amendments are only proposals to change 
the bill as introduced and are subject to acceptance or 
rejection by the House itself. A vote of committee Members is 
taken to determine whether the full committee will report 
favorably or "table" the bill. If the committee votes to 
report the bill favorably to the House, it may report the 
bill with or without amendments or report a "clean bill". If 
the committee has approved extensive amendments, the 
committee may decide to report a new bill incorporating those 
amendments, commonly known as a "clean bill". The new bill is 
introduced (usually by the Chairman of the committee), and, 
after referral back to the committee, is reported favorably 
to the House by the committee. Because tabling a bill 
normally is effective in preventing action on it, adverse 
reports to the House by the full committee ordinarily are not 
made. On rare occasions, a committee may report a bill 
without recommendation or unfavorably.<p>

 Generally, a majority of the committee constitutes a quorum, 
the number of Members who must be present in order for the 
committee to act. This ensures adequate participation by both 
sides in the action taken. However, a committee may vary the 
number of Members necessary for a quorum for certain actions. 
For example, a committee may fix the number of its Members, 
but not less than 2, necessary for a quorum for taking 
testimony and receiving evidence. Except for the Committees 
on Appropriations, on the Budget, and on Ways and Means, a 
committee may fix the number of its Members, but not less 
than one-third, necessary for a quorum for taking certain 
other actions. The absence of a quorum is the subject of a 
point of order--that is, an objection that the proceedings 
are out of order--that is, that the required number of 
Members is not present.<p>

<b> PUBLIC INSPECTION OF RESULTS OF ROLLCALL VOTE IN COMMITTEE</b><p>

 The result of each rollcall vote in any meeting of a 
committee must be made available by that committee for 
inspection by the public at reasonable times in the offices 
of that committee. Information available for public 
inspection includes (1) a description of each amendment, 
motion, order, or other proposition, (2) the name of each 
Member voting for and each Member voting against the 
amendment, motion, order, or proposition, and whether by 
proxy or in person, and (3) the names of those Members 
present but not voting.<p>

 With respect to each rollcall vote by a committee on a 
motion to report a bill or resolution of a public character, 
the total number of votes cast for, and the total number of 
votes cast against, the reporting of the bill or resolution 
must be included in the committee report.<p>

<b> PROXY VOTING</b><p>
 A vote by a Member of a committee with respect to a measure 
or other matter may not be cast by proxy unless that 
committee adopts a written rule that permits voting by proxy 
and requires that the proxy authorization (1) be in writing, 
(2) assert that the Member is absent on official business or 
is otherwise unable to be present at the meeting of the 
committee, (3) designate the person who is to execute the 
proxy authorization, and (4) be limited to a specific measure 
or matter and any amendments or motions pertaining to the 
measure or matter. A Member may authorize a general proxy 
only for motions to recess, adjourn or other procedural 
matters. A proxy must be signed by the Member and must 
contain the date and time of day that it is signed. A proxy 
may not be counted for a quorum.<p>

 <b>POINTS OF ORDER WITH RESPECT TO COMMITTEE PROCEDURE</b><p>

 A point of order does not lie with respect to a measure 
reported by a committee on the ground that hearings on the 
measure were not conducted in accordance with required 
committee procedure. However, certain points of order may be 
made by a Member of the committee which reported the measure 
if, in the committee, that point of order was (1) timely made 
and (2) improperly overruled or not properly considered.<p>

<b> BROADCASTING COMMITTEE HEARINGS AND MEETINGS</b><p>

 It is permissible to cover open committee hearings and 
meetings in the House by television, radio, and still 
photography. This permission is granted under well defined 
conditions as provided in the rules of the House. Similarly, 
the rules of the Senate permit broadcasting of open hearings 
of a Senate committee under such rules as the committee may 
adopt.<p>

 
 VII. <a name="reported bills"><b>REPORTED BILLS</b></a><p>

  If the committee votes to report the bill favorably to the 
House, one of the Members is designated to write the 
committee report. The report describes the purpose and scope 
of the bill and the reasons for its recommended approval. 
Generally, a section-by-section analysis is set forth in 
detail explaining precisely what each section is intended to 
accomplish. All changes in existing law must be indicated in 
the report and the text of laws being repealed must be set 
out. This requirement is known as the "Ramseyer" rule; a 
similar rule in the Senate is known as the "Cordon" rule. 
Committee amendments also must be set out at the beginning of 
the report and explanations of them are included. Executive 
communications regarding the bill usually are quoted in full.<p>

 If at the time of approval of a bill by a committee (except 
the Committee on Rules) a Member of the committee gives 
notice of an intention to file supplemental, minority, or 
additional views, that Member is entitled to not less than 3 
calendar days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal 
holidays) in which to file those views with the clerk of the 
committee and they must be included in the report on the 
bill. Committee reports, with certain exceptions, must be 
filed while the House actually is sitting unless unanimous 
consent is obtained from the House to file at a later time.<p>

 The report is assigned a report number when it is filed, and 
it is delivered to the Government Printing Office for 
printing during that night. Beginning with the 91st Congress, 
in 1969, the report number contains a prefix-designator which 
indicates the number of the Congress. For example, the first 
House report in 1969 was numbered 91-1.<p>

 The bill is reprinted when reported and committee amendments 
are indicated by showing new matter in italics and deleted 
matter in line-through type. The report number is printed on 
the bill and the calendar number is shown on both the first 
and back pages of the bill. However, in the case of a bill 
that was referred to 2 or more committees for consideration 
in sequence, the calendar number is printed only on the bill 
as reported by the last committee to consider it. See Part 
IX, "Calendars".<p>

 Committee reports are perhaps the most valuable single 
element of the legislative history of a law. They are used by 
courts, executive departments and agencies, and the public 
generally, as a source of information regarding the purpose 
and meaning of the law.<p>

<b> CONTENTS OF REPORTS</b><p>

 The report of a committee on a measure that has been 
approved by the committee must include (1) the committee's 
oversight findings and recommendations, (2) the statement 
required by the Congressional Budget Act of 1974, if the 
measure provides new budget authority (other than continuing 
appropriations), certain new spending authority, new credit 
authority, or an increase or decrease in revenues or tax 
expenditures, (3) the cost estimate and comparison prepared 
by the Director of the Congressional Budget Office whenever 
the Director has submitted that estimate and comparison to 
the committee prior to the filing of the report, and (4) a 
summary of the oversight findings and recommendations made by 
the Committee on Government Operations whenever they have 
been submitted to the legislative committee in a timely 
fashion to allow an opportunity to consider the findings and 
recommendations during the committee's deliberations on the 
measure. Each of these items are set out separately and 
clearly identified in the report. For a discussion of the 
Congressional budget process, see Part XII.<p>

<b> INFLATIONARY IMPACT AND COST ESTIMATES IN REPORTS</b><p>

 In addition, each report of a committee on a bill or joint 
resolution of a public character reported by the committee 
must contain a detailed analytical statement as to whether 
the enactment of the bill or joint resolution into law may 
have an inflationary impact on prices and costs in the 
operation of the national  economy.<p>

 Each report also must contain an estimate, made by the 
committee, of the costs which would be incurred in carrying 
out that bill or joint resolution in the fiscal year reported 
and in each of the 5 fiscal years thereafter or for the 
duration of the program authorized if less than 5 years. In 
the case of a measure involving revenues, the report need 
contain only an estimate of the gain or loss in revenues for 
a one-year period. The report must include a comparison of 
the estimates of those costs with the estimate made by any 
Government agency and submitted to that committee. The 
Committees on Appropriations, on House Administration, on 
Rules, and on Standards of Official Conduct are not required 
to include cost estimates in their reports. In addition, the 
cost estimates are not required to be included in reports 
when a cost estimate and comparison prepared by the Director 
of the Congressional Budget Office has been submitted prior 
to the filing of the report and included in the report.<p>

 <b>FILING OF REPORTS</b><p>

 Measures approved by a committee must be reported promptly 
after approval. A majority of the Members of the committee 
may file a written request with the clerk of the committee 
for the reporting of the measure. When the request is filed, 
the clerk immediately must notify the Chairman of the 
committee of the filing of the request, and the report on the 
measure must be filed within 7 days (excluding days on which 
the House is not in session) after the day on which the 
request is filed. This does not apply to a report of the 
Committee on Rules with respect to the rules, joint rules, or 
order of business of the House or to the reporting of a 
resolution of inquiry addressed to the head of an executive 
department.<p>

<b> AVAILABILITY OF REPORTS AND HEARINGS</b><p>

 With certain exceptions (relating to emergency situations, 
such as a measure declaring war or other national emergency 
and Government agency decisions, determinations, and actions 
that are effective unless disapproved or otherwise 
invalidated by one or both Houses of Congress), a measure or 
matter reported by a committee (except the Committee on Rules 
in the case of a resolution making in order the consideration 
of a bill, resolution, or other order of business) may not be 
considered in the House until the third calendar day 
(excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays) on which 
the report of that committee on that measure has been 
available to the Members of the House. In addition, the 
measure or matter may not be considered unless copies of the 
report and the reported measure or matter have been available 
to the Members for at least 3 calendar days (excluding 
Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays during which the House 
is not in session) before the beginning of consideration. 
However, it is always in order to consider a report from the 
Committee on Rules specifically providing for the 
consideration of a reported measure or matter notwithstanding 
this restriction. If hearings were held on a measure or 
matter so reported, the committee is required to make every 
reasonable effort to have those hearings printed and 
available for distribution to the Members of the House prior 
to the consideration of the measure in the House. General 
appropriation bills may not be considered until printed 
committee hearings and a committee report thereon have been 
available to the Members of the House for at least 3 calendar 
days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal holidays).<p>

 
 VIII. <a name="legislative"><b>LEGISLATIVE REVIEW BY STANDING COMMITTEES</b></a><p>

  Each standing committee (other than the Committees on 
Appropriations and on the Budget) is required to review and 
study, on a continuing basis, the application, 
administration, execution, and effectiveness of the laws 
dealing with the subject matter over which the committee has 
jurisdiction and the organization and operation of Federal 
agencies and entities having responsibility for the 
administration and evaluation of those laws.<p>

 The purpose of the review and study is to determine whether 
laws and the programs created by Congress are being 
implemented and carried out in accordance with the intent of 
Congress and whether those programs should be continued, 
curtailed, or eliminated. In addition, each committee having 
oversight responsibility is required to review and study any 
conditions or circumstances that may indicate the necessity 
or desirability of enacting new or additional legislation 
within the jurisdiction of that committee, and must 
undertake, on a continuing basis, futures research and 
forecasting on matters within the jurisdiction of that 
committee. Each standing committee also has the function of 
reviewing and studying, on a continuing basis, the impact or 
probable impact of tax policies on subjects within its 
jurisdiction.<p>

 In addition, several of the standing committees have special 
oversight responsibilities, the details of which are 
contained in the rules of the House.
<p>
 
 IX. <a name="calendar"><b>CALENDARS</b><p></a>

  The House of Representatives has 5 calendars of business: 
the Union Calendar, the House Calendar, the Private Calendar, 
the Consent Calendar, and the Calendar of Motions to 
Discharge Committees. The calendars, together with a listing 
of all bills introduced and a history of all bills reported 
out of committee in the current Congress, are printed each 
day the House is in session to provide information on the 
status of pending legislation.<p>

 As soon as a public bill is favorably reported, it is 
assigned a calendar number on either the Union Calendar or 
the House Calendar, the 2 principal calendars of business. 
The calendar number is printed on the first page of the bill 
and, in certain instances, is printed also on the back page. 
In the case of a bill that was referred to 2 or more 
committees for consideration in sequence, the calendar number 
is printed only on the bill as reported by the last committee 
to consider it.<p>

<b> UNION CALENDAR</b><p>

 The rules of the House provide that there shall be:<p>

 First. A Calendar of the Committee of the Whole House on the 
state of the Union, to which shall be referred bills raising 
revenue, general appropriation bills, and bills of a public 
character directly or indirectly appropriating money or 
property.<p>

 
 This is commonly known as the Union Calendar and the large 
majority of public bills and resolutions are placed on it on 
being reported to the House. For a discussion of the 
Committee of the Whole House, see Part XI.<p>

 <b>HOUSE CALENDAR</b><p>

 The rules further provide that there shall be:<p>

 Second. A House Calendar, to which shall be referred all 
bills of a public character not raising revenue nor directly 
or indirectly appropriating money or property.<p>

 
 The public bills and resolutions that are not placed on the 
Union Calendar are referred to the House Calendar.<p>

<b> PRIVATE CALENDAR</b><p>

 The rules also provide that there shall be:<p>

 Third. A Calendar of the Committee of the Whole House, to 
which shall be referred all bills of a private character.<p>

 
 This is commonly known as the Private Calendar and all 
private bills are placed on it on being reported to the 
House. The Private Calendar is called on the first and third 
Tuesdays of each month.  If objection is made by 2 or more 
Members to the consideration of any measure called, it is 
recommitted to the committee that reported it. As in the case 
of the Consent Calendar (see below) there are 6 official 
objectors, 3 on the majority side and 3 on the minority side, 
who make a careful study of each bill or resolution on the 
Private Calendar and who will object to a measure that does 
not conform to the requirements for that calendar, thereby 
preventing the passage without debate of nonmeritorious bills 
and resolutions.<p>

<b>CONSENT CALENDAR</b><p>

 If a measure pending on either the House or Union Calendar 
is of a noncontroversial nature, it may be placed on the 
Consent Calendar. After a bill has been favorably reported 
and is on either the House or Union Calendar, any Member may 
file with the Clerk a notice that the Member desires the bill 
placed on the Consent Calendar. On the first and third 
Mondays of each month immediately after the reading of the 
Journal, the Speaker directs the Clerk to call the bills in 
numerical order (that is, in the order of their appearance on 
that calendar) that have been on the Consent Calendar for 3 
legislative days. If objection is made to the consideration 
of any bill so called, it is carried over on the calendar 
without prejudice to the next day when the Consent Calendar 
is again called, and if then objected to by 3 or more Members 
it is immediately stricken from the calendar and may not be 
placed on the Consent Calendar again during that session of 
Congress. If objection is not made and if the bill is not 
"passed over" by request, it is passed by unanimous consent 
without debate. Ordinarily, the only amendments considered 
are those sponsored by the committee that reported the bill.<p>

 To avoid the passage without debate of measures that may be 
controversial or are sufficiently important or complex to 
require full discussion, there are 6 official objectors--3 on 
the majority side and 3 on the minority side--who make a 
careful study of bills on the Consent Calendar. If a bill 
involves the expenditure of more than a fixed maximum amount 
of money or if it changes national policy or has other 
aspects that any of the objectors believes demand explanation 
and extended debate, it will be objected to and will not be 
passed by unanimous consent. That action does not necessarily 
mean the final defeat of the bill because it may then be 
brought up for consideration in the same way as any other 
bill on the House or Union Calendars.<p>

<b> CALENDAR OF MOTIONS TO DISCHARGE COMMITTEES</b><p>
 When a majority of the Members of the House sign a motion to 
discharge a committee from consideration of a public bill or 
resolution, that motion is referred to the Calendar of 
Motions to Discharge Committees. For a further discussion of 
Motions to Discharge, see "Motion to Discharge Committee" in 
Part X.<p>

 X. <a name="measures"><b> OBTAINING CONSIDERATION OF MEASURES</b></a><p>

  Obviously certain measures pending on the House and Union 
Calendars are more important and urgent than others and it is 
necessary to have a system permitting their consideration 
ahead of those that do not require immediate action. Because 
all measures are placed on those calendars in the order in 
which they are reported to the House, the latest bill 
reported would be the last to be taken up if the calendar 
number alone were the determining factor.<p>

 <b>SPECIAL RESOLUTIONS</b><p>

 To avoid delays and to provide some degree of selectivity in 
the consideration of measures, it is possible to have them 
taken up out of order by obtaining from the Committee on 
Rules a special resolution or "rule" for their consideration. 
That Committee, which is composed of majority and minority 
Members but with a larger proportion of majority Members than 
other committees, is specifically granted jurisdiction over 
resolutions relating to the order of business of the House. 
Usually the Chairman of the committee that has favorably 
reported the bill appears before the Committee on Rules 
accompanied by the sponsor of the measure and one or more 
Members of the Chariman's committee in support of the request 
for a resolution providing for its immediate consideration. 
If the Committee on Rules is satisfied that the measure 
should be taken up it will report a resolution reading 
substantially as follows with respect to a bill on the Union 
Calendar:<p>

 Resolved, That upon the adoption of this resolution it shall 
be in order to move that the House resolve itself into the 
Committee of the Whole House on the State of the Union for 
the consideration of the bill (H.R. ___) entitled, etc., and 
the first reading of the bill shall be dispensed with. After 
general debate, which shall be confined to the bill and shall 
continue not to exceed __ hours, to be equally divided and 
controlled by the chairman and ranking minority member of the 
Committee on ___, the bill shall be read for amendment under 
the five-minute rule. At the conclusion of the consideration 
of the bill for amendment, the Committee shall rise and 
report the bill to the House with such amendments as may have 
been adopted, and the previous question shall be considered 
as ordered on the bill and amendments thereto to final 
passage without intervening motion except one motion to 
recommit.<p>

 
 If the measure is on the House Calendar the resolution reads 
substantially as follows:<p>

 Resolved, That upon the adoption of this resolution it shall 
be in order to consider the bill (H.R. ___) entitled, etc., 
in the House.<p>

 
 The resolution may waive points of order against the bill. 
When it limits or prevents floor amendments, it is popularly 
known as a "closed rule".<p>

<b> CONSIDERATION OF MEASURES MADE IN ORDER BY PREVIOUS 
RESOLUTION</b><p>

 When a "rule" has been reported to the House, and is not 
considered immediately, it is referred to the calendar and, 
if not called up for consideration by the Member making the 
report within 7 legislative days thereafter, any Member of 
the Committee on Rules may call it up as a question of 
privilege (after having given one calendar day notice of the 
Member's intention to do so) and the Speaker will recognize 
any Member of the Committee seeking recognition for that 
purpose. For a discussion of privileged questions, see the 
matter under the heading "Privileged Matters" at the end of 
this part.<p>

 If, within 7 calendar days after a measure has, by 
resolution, been made in order for consideration by the 
House, a motion has not been offered for its consideration, 
the Speaker may recognize a Member of the committee that 
reported the measure to offer a motion that the House 
consider it, if the Member has been duly authorized by that 
committee to offer the motion.<p>

 There are several other methods of obtaining consideration 
of bills that either have not been reported by a committee 
or, if reported, for which a special resolution or "rule" has 
not been obtained. Two of those methods, a motion to 
discharge a committee and a motion to suspend the rules, are 
discussed below.<p>

<b> MOTION TO DISCHARGE COMMITTEE</b><p>

 A Member may present to the Clerk a motion in writing to 
discharge a committee from the consideration of a public bill 
or resolution that has been referred to it 30 days prior 
thereto. A Member also may file a motion to discharge the 
Committee on Rules from further consideration of a resolution 
providing either a special order of business, or a special 
rule for the consideration of a public bill or resolution 
favorably reported by a standing committee, or a special rule 
for the consideration of a public bill or resolution that has 
remained in a standing committee 30 days or more without 
action. This motion may be made only when the resolution, 
from which it is moved to discharge the Committee on Rules, 
has been referred to that committee at least 7 days prior to 
the filing of the motion to discharge. The motion is placed 
in the custody of the Clerk, who arranges some convenient 
place for the signature of Members. When a majority of the 
total membership of the House have signed the motion, it is 
entered on the Journal, printed with the signatures thereto 
in the Congressional Record, and referred to the Calendar of 
Motions to Discharge Committees.<p>

 On the second and fourth Mondays of each month, except 
during the last 6 days of a session, a Member who has signed 
a motion to discharge, that has been on the calendar at least 
7 days, may seek recognition and be recognized for the 
purpose of calling up the motion. The bill or resolution is 
then read by title only. After 20 minutes' debate, one-half 
in favor of the proposition and one-half in opposition, the 
House proceeds to vote on the motion to discharge.<p>

 If the motion to discharge the Committee on Rules from a 
resolution pending before the Committee prevails, the House 
immediately votes on the adoption of that resolution.<p>

 If the motion to discharge one of the standing committees of 
the House from a public bill or resolution pending before the 
committee prevails, a Member who signed the motion may move 
that the House proceed to the immediate consideration of the 
bill or resolution. If the motion is agreed to, the bill or 
resolution is considered immediately under the general rules 
of the House. If the House votes against the motion for 
immediate consideration, the bill or resolution is referred 
to its proper calendar with the same rights and privileges it 
would have had if reported favorably by the standing 
committee.<p>

<b> MOTION TO SUSPEND THE RULES</b><p>

 On Monday and Tuesday of each week and during the last 6 
days of a session, the Speaker may entertain a motion to 
suspend the rules of the House and pass a bill or resolution. 
Arrangement must be made in advance with the Speaker to 
recognize the Member who wishes to offer the motion. Before 
being considered by the House, the motion must be seconded by 
a majority of the Members present, by teller vote, if 
demanded. However, a second is not required on a motion to 
suspend the rules when printed copies of the proposed bill or 
resolution have been available for one legislative day before 
the motion is considered. The motion to suspend the rules and 
pass the bill is then debated for 40 minutes, one-half by 
those in favor of the proposition and one-half by those 
opposed. The motion may not be amended and if amendments to 
the bill are proposed they must be included in the motion 
when it is made. The rules may be suspended and the bill 
passed only by affirmative vote of two-thirds of the Members 
voting, a quorum being present.<p>

 The Speaker may postpone all recorded and yea-nay votes on 
motions to suspend the rules and pass bills and resolutions 
until the end of that legislative day or the next 2 
legislative days. At that time the House disposes of the 
deferred votes consecutively without further debate. After 
the first deferred vote is taken, the Speaker may reduce to 
not less than 5 minutes the time period for subsequent 
deferred votes. If the House adjourns before completing 
action on one or more deferred votes, these must be the first 
order of business on the next legislative day. By eliminating 
intermittent recorded votes on suspensions, this procedure 
reduces interruptions of committee meetings and also reduces 
the time Members spend on suspension days going back and 
forth between the floor and their committee rooms or offices.<p>

<b> CALENDAR WEDNESDAY</b><p>

 On Wednesday of each week, unless dispensed with by 
unanimous consent or by affirmative vote of two-thirds of the 
Members voting, a quorum being present, the standing 
committees are called in alphabetical order. A committee when 
named may call up for consideration any bill reported by it 
on a previous day and pending on either the House or Union 
Calendar. Not more than 2 hours of general debate is 
permitted on any measure called up on Calendar Wednesday and 
all debate must be confined to the subject matter of the 
measure, the time being equally divided between those for and 
those against it. The affirmative vote of a simple majority 
of the Members present is sufficient to pass the measure.<p>

 <b>DISTRICT OF COLUMBIA BUSINESS</b><p>

 The second and fourth Mondays in each month, after the 
disposition of motions to discharge committees and after the 
disposal of business on the Speaker's table requiring only 
referral to committee, are set aside, when claimed by the 
Committee on the District of Columbia, for the consideration 
of any business that is presented by that Committee.<p>

<b> PRIVILEGED MATTERS</b><p>

 Under the rules of the House certain matters are regarded as 
privileged matters and may interrupt the order of business, 
for example, reports from the Committee on Rules and reports 
from the Committee on Appropriations on the general 
appropriation bills.<p>

 At any time after the reading of the Journal, a Member, by 
direction of the appropriate committee, may move that the 
House resolve itself into the Committee of the Whole House on 
the State of the Union for the purpose of considering bills 
raising revenues, or general appropriation bills. General 
appropriation bills may not be considered in the House until 
3 calendar days (excluding Saturdays, Sundays, and legal 
holidays) after printed committee reports and hearings on 
them have been available to the Members. The limit on general 
debate is generally fixed by unanimous consent.<p>

 Other examples of privileged matters are conference reports, 
certain amendments to measures by the Senate, veto messages 
from the President of the United States, and resolutions 
privileged pursuant to statute. The Member in charge of such 
a matter may call it up at practically any time for immediate 
consideration. Usually, this is done after consultation with 
both the majority and minority floor leaders so that the 
Members of both parties will have advance notice and will not 
be taken by surprise.<p>

 
 XI. <a name="consideration"><b>CONSIDERATION</b></a><p>

  Our democratic tradition demands that bills be given 
consideration by the entire membership with adequate 
opportunity for debate and the proposing of amendments.<p>

<b> COMMITTEE OF THE WHOLE HOUSE</b><p>

 In order to expedite the consideration of bills and 
resolutions, the rules of the House provide for a 
parliamentary usage that enables the House to act with a 
quorum of less than the requisite majority of 218. The House 
resolves itself into the Committee of the Whole House on the 
State of the Union (a quorum of which consists of 100 
Members) to consider a measure. All measures on the Union 
Calendar--involving a tax, making appropriations, or 
authorizing payments out of appropriations already made--must 
be first considered in the Committee of the Whole.<p>

 The Committee on Rules reports a special resolution or 
"rule" allowing for immediate consideration of a measure by 
the Committee of the Whole. After adoption of the resolution 
by the House, the House votes on a motion to resolve itself 
into the Committee of the Whole or, in certain situations, 
the Speaker declares the House resolved into the Committee of 
the Whole without intervening motion. When the House resolves 
into the Committee of the Whole, the Speaker leaves the chair 
after appointing a Chairman to preside.<p>

 The special resolution or "rule" referred to in the 
preceding paragraph also fixes the length of the debate in 
the Committee of the Whole. This may vary according to the 
importance and controversial nature of the measure. As 
provided in the resolution, the control of the time is 
divided equally--usually between the Chairman and the ranking 
minority Member of the committee that reported the measure. 
Members seeking to speak for or against the measure usually 
arrange in advance with the Member in control of the time on 
their respective side to be allowed a certain amount of time 
in the debate. Others may ask the Member speaking at the time 
to yield to them for a question or a brief statement. A 
transcript of the proceedings and debate in the House and the 
Senate is printed daily in the Congressional Record. 
Frequently permission is granted a Member by unanimous 
consent to extend the Member's remarks in the Congressional 
Record if sufficient time to make a lengthy oral statement is 
not available during actual debate.<p>

 The conduct of the debate is governed principally by the 
rules of the House that are adopted at the opening of each 
Congress. Another recognized authority is Jefferson's Manual 
that was prepared by Thomas Jefferson for his own guidance as 
President of the Senate from 1797 to 1801. The House, in 
1837, adopted a rule that still stands, providing that the 
provisions of Jefferson's Manual should govern the House in 
all cases to which they are applicable and in which they are 
not inconsistent with the rules and orders of the House. In 
addition, there is a most valuable compilation of precedents 
up to the year 1935 set out in Hinds' Precedents and Cannon's 
Precedents of the House of Representatives, consisting of 11 
volumes, to guide the action of the House. A later 
compilation, Deschler's Precedents of the House of 
Representatives, covers years 1936 to date. Summaries of the 
House precedents prior to 1959 can be found in a single 
volume entitled Cannon's Procedure in the House of 
Representatives. A later volume, Procedure in the U.S. House 
of Representatives, fourth edition, as supplemented, is a 
compilation of the parliamentary precedents of the House, in 
summary form, together with other useful related material, 
from 1959 to date. Also, various rulings of the Speaker since 
1931 are set out as notes to the current House Rules and 
Manual. Most parliamentary questions arising during the 
course of debate are susceptible of ruling backed up by a 
precedent of action in a similar situation. The 
Parliamentarian of the House is present in the House Chamber 
in order to assist the Chairman or the Speaker in making a 
correct ruling on parliamentary questions.<p>

<b> SECOND READING</b><p>

 During the general debate an accurate account is kept of the 
time used on both sides and when all the time allowed under 
the rule has been consumed the Chairman terminates the 
debate. Then begins the "second reading of the bill", section 
by section, at which time amendments may be offered to a 
section when it is read. A Member is permitted 5 minutes to 
explain the proposed amendment, after which the Member who is 
first recognized by the Chair is allowed to speak for 5 
minutes in opposition to it; there is no further debate on 
that amendment, thereby effectively preventing any attempt at 
filibuster tactics. This is known as the "five-minute rule". 
There is, how ever, a device whereby a Member may offer a pro 
forma amendment--"to strike out the last word"--without 
intending any change in the language, and be allowed 5 
minutes for debate, thus permitting a somewhat more 
comprehensive debate. Each amendment is put to the Committee 
of the Whole for adoption. Generally, a pro forma amendment 
is withdrawn. However, in the absence of being withdrawn, it 
must be voted on.<p>

 At any time after a debate is begun under the five-minute 
rule, on proposed amendments to a section or paragraph of a 
bill, the Committee of the Whole may by majority vote of the 
Members present, close debate on the section or paragraph. 
However, if debate is closed on a section or paragraph before 
there has been debate on any amendment that a Member has 
caused to be printed in the Congressional Record after the 
reporting of the bill by the committee but at least one day 
prior to floor consideration of the amendment, the Member who 
caused the amendment to be printed in the Record is given 5 
minutes in which to explain the amendment, after which the 
first person to obtain the floor has 5 minutes to speak in 
opposition to it, and there is no further debate on that 
proposed amendment. However, time for debate is not allowed 
when the offering of the amendment is dilatory. Material 
placed in the Congressional Record must indicate the full 
text of the proposed amendment, the name of the proponent 
Member, the number of the bill to which it will be offered 
and the point in the bill or amendment thereto where the 
amendment is intended to be offered, and must appear in a 
portion of the Record designated for that purpose.<p>

 When an amendment is offered, while the House is meeting in 
the Committee of the Whole, the Clerk is required to transmit 
5 copies of the amendment to the majority committee table, 5 
copies to the minority committee table, and at least one copy 
each to the majority and minority cloak rooms.<p>

<b>THE COMMITTEE "RISES"</b><p>

 At the conclusion of the consideration of a bill for 
amendment, the Committee of the Whole "rises" and reports the 
bill to the House with the amendments that have been adopted. 
In rising the Committee of the Whole reverts back to the 
House and the Chairman of the Committee is replaced in the 
chair by the Speaker of the House. The House then acts on the 
bill and any amendments adopted by the Committee of the 
Whole.<p>

<b> HOUSE ACTION</b><p>

 Debate is cut off by moving "the previous question". If this 
motion is carried by a majority of the Members voting, a 
quorum being present, all debate is cut off on the bill on 
which the previous question has been ordered. The Speaker 
then puts the question: "Shall the bill be engrossed and read 
a third time?" If this question is decided in the 
affirmative, the bill is read a third time by title only and 
voted on for passage.<p>

 If the previous question has been ordered by the terms of 
the special resolution or "rule" on a bill reported by the 
Committee of the Whole, the House immediately votes on 
whatever amendments have been reported by the Committee in 
the sequence in which they were reported. After completion of 
voting on the amendments, the House immediately votes on the 
passage of the bill with the amendments it has adopted.<p>

 In those cases where the previous question has not been 
ordered, the House may engage in debate lasting one hour, at 
the conclusion of which the previous question is ordered and 
the House votes on the passage of the bill. During the debate 
it is in order to offer amendments to the bill or to the 
Committee amendments.<p>

 The Speaker may postpone a vote on final passage of a bill 
or resolution or agreement to a conference report. A vote may 
be postponed for up to 2 legislative days.<p>

 Measures that do not have to be considered in the Committee 
of the Whole are considered in the House in the first 
instance under the hour rule or in accordance with the terms 
of the special resolution limiting debate on the measure.<p>

 After passage of the bill by the House, a pro forma motion 
to reconsider it is automatically made and laid on the table-
-that is, action is postponed indefinitely--to forestall this 
motion at a later date, because the vote of the House on a 
proposition is not final and conclusive on the House until 
there has been an opportunity to reconsider it.<p>

<b> MOTIONS TO RECOMMIT</b><p>

 After the previous question has been ordered on the passage 
of a bill or joint resolution, it is in order to make one 
motion to recommit the bill or joint resolution to a 
committee and the Speaker is required to give preference in 
recognition for that purpose to a Member who is opposed to 
the bill or joint resolution. This motion is normally not 
subject to debate. However, with respect to a motion to 
recommit with instructions after the previous question has 
been ordered, it is in order to debate the motion for 10 
minutes before the vote is taken, except that the majority 
floor manager may demand that the debate be extended to one 
hour. Whatever time is allotted for debate is divided equally 
between the proponents and opponents of the motion.<p>

<b> QUORUM CALLS AND ROLLCALLS</b><p>

 In order to speed up and expedite quorum calls and 
rollcalls, the rules of the House provide alternative methods 
for pursuing these procedures.<p>

 In the absence of a quorum, 15 Members, including the 
Speaker, if there is one, are authorized to compel the 
attendance of absent Members. Such a call of the House is 
ordered by a majority vote, and a minority of 15 or more 
favoring a call is not sufficient. A call of the House is 
then ordered, and the Speaker is required to have the call 
taken by electronic device. However, the Speaker instead may 
name one or more clerks "to tell" the Members who are 
present. In that case the names of those present are recorded 
by the clerks, and entered in the Journal of the House and 
absent Members have not less than 15 minutes from the 
ordering of the call of the House to have their presence 
recorded. If sufficient excuse is not offered for their 
absence, by order of a majority of those present, they may be 
sent for by officers appointed by the Sergeant-at-Arms for 
that purpose, and their attendance secured and retained. The 
House then determines the conditions on which they may be 
discharged. Members who voluntarily appear are, unless the 
House otherwise directs, immediately admitted to the Hall of 
the House and they must report their names to the Clerk to be 
entered on the Journal as present. However, the former 
practice of presenting Members at the Bar of the House, 
during a call, is now obsolete, and Members now report to the 
Clerk and are recorded without being formally excused unless 
brought in under compulsion.<p>

 Whenever a quorum fails to vote on any question, and a 
quorum is not present and objection is made for that reason, 
there is a call of the House unless the House adjourns. The 
call is taken by electronic device unless the Speaker orders 
the call in the manner described in the preceding paragraph, 
and the Sergeant-at-Arms proceeds to bring in absent Members. 
The yeas and nays on the pending question are at the same 
time considered as ordered and an automatic rollcall vote is 
taken. The Clerk calls the roll and each Member who is 
present may vote on the pending question as the Member 
answers the roll. After the rollcall is completed, each 
Member, whose attendance was secured, is brought before the 
House by the Sergeant-at-Arms, where the Member's presence is 
noted. The Member then is given an opportunity to vote. If 
those voting on the question and those who are present and 
decline to vote together make a majority of the House, the 
Speaker declares that a quorum is constituted, and the 
pending question is decided according to the will of the 
majority of those voting. Further proceedings under the call 
are considered as dispensed with. At any time after the 
rollcall has been completed, the Speaker may entertain a 
motion to adjourn, if seconded by a majority of those present 
as ascertained by actual count by the Speaker; and if the 
House adjourns, all quorum call proceedings are vacated.<p>

 The rules prohibit points of no quorum (1) before or during 
the daily prayer, (2) during administration of the oath of 
office to the Speaker or any Member, (3) during the reception 
of messages from the President or the Senate, (4) in 
connection with motions incidental to a call of the House, 
and (5) against a vote in which the Committee of the Whole 
agrees to rise (but an appropriate point of no quorum would 
be permitted against a vote defeating a motion to rise). If 
the presence of a quorum has been established at least once 
on any day, further points of no quorum are prohibited (1) 
during the reading of the Journal, (2) between the time a 
Committee of the Whole rises and its Chairman reports, and 
(3) during the period on any legislative day when Members are 
addressing the House under special orders. The language 
prohibiting quorum calls "during any period" when Members are 
speaking under special orders includes the time between 
addresses delivered during this period as well as the 
addresses themselves. Furthermore, a quorum call is not in 
order when no business has intervened since the previous 
call. For the purposes of this provision, all the situations 
described above are not to be considered as "business".<p>

 The rules prohibit points of no quorum when a motion or 
proposition is pending in the House unless the Speaker has 
put the motion or proposition to a vote. However, the Speaker 
has the discretion to recognize a Member of the Speaker's 
choice to move a call of the House.<p>

 The first time the Committee of the Whole finds itself 
without a quorum during any day the Chairman is required to 
order the roll to be called by electronic device, unless the 
Chairman orders a call by naming clerks "to tell" the Members 
as described above. However, the Chairman may refuse to 
entertain a point of order that a quorum is not present 
during general debate. If on a call a quorum appears, the 
Committee continues its business. If a quorum does not 
appear, the Committee rises and the Chairman reports the 
names of the absentees to the House. The rules provide for 
the expeditious conduct of quorum calls in the Committee of 
the Whole. The Chairman may suspend a quorum call after 
determining that a bare or minimum quorum has been reached, 
that is, 100 or more Members. Under such a short quorum call 
the Committee will not rise, and therefore Members' names 
will not be published. Once the presence of a quorum of the 
Committee of the Whole has been established for the day, 
quorum calls in the Committee are only in order when the 
Committee is operating under the five-minute rule and the 
Chairman has put the pending motion or proposition to a vote.<p>

<b> VOTING</b><p>

 There are 4 methods of voting in the Committee of the Whole, 
that are also employed, together with an additional method, 
in the House. These are the voice vote (viva voce), the 
division, the teller vote, the recorded vote, and the yea-
and-nay vote that is used only in the House. If a Member 
objects to the vote on the ground that a quorum is not 
present in the House, there may be an automatic rollcall 
vote.<p>

 To obtain a voice vote the Chair states "As many as are in 
favor (as the question may be) say `Aye'." "As many as are 
opposed, say `No'.". The Chair determines the result on the 
basis of the volume of ayes and noes. This is the form in 
which the vote is ordinarily taken in the first instance.<p>

 If it is difficult to determine the result of a voice vote, 
a division may be demanded. The Chair then states that a 
division has been demanded and says "As many as are in favor 
will rise and stand until counted." After counting those in 
favor he calls on those opposed to stand and be counted, 
thereby determining the number in favor of and those opposed 
to the question.<p>

 If a demand for a teller vote is supported by one-fifth of a 
quorum (20 in the Committee of the Whole, and 44 in the 
House), the Chair appoints one or more tellers from each side 
and directs the Members in favor of the proposition to pass 
between the tellers and be counted. After counting, a teller 
announces the number in the affirmative, and the Chair then 
directs the Members opposed to pass between the tellers and 
be counted. When the count is stated by a teller, the Chair 
announces the result.<p>

 If any Member requests a recorded vote and that request is 
supported by at least one-fifth of a quorum of the House, or 
25 Members in the Committee of the Whole, the vote is taken 
by electronic device, unless the Speaker orders clerks "to 
tell", that is, record the names of those voting on each side 
of the question. After the recorded vote is concluded, the 
names of those voting together with those not voting are 
entered in the Journal. Members usually have 15 minutes to be 
counted from the time the recorded vote is ordered or the 
ordering of the clerks "to tell" the vote. The Speaker may 
reduce the period for voting to 5 minutes in certain 
situations.<p>

 In addition to the foregoing methods of voting, in the 
House, if the yeas and nays are demanded, the Speaker directs 
those in favor of taking the vote by that method to stand and 
be counted. The assent of one-fifth of the Members present 
(as distinguished from one-fifth of a quorum in the case of a 
demand for tellers) is necessary for ordering the yeas and 
nays. When the yeas and nays are ordered (or a point of order 
is made that a quorum is not present) the Speaker directs 
that as many as are in favor of the proposition will, as 
their names are called, answer "Aye"; as many as are opposed 
will answer "No". The Clerk calls the roll and reports the 
result to the Speaker who announces it to the House. The 
Speaker is not required to vote unless the Speaker's vote 
would be decisive.<p>

 The rules prohibit a Member from (1) casting another 
Member's vote or recording another Member's presence in the 
House or the Committee of the Whole or (2) authorizing 
another individual to cast a vote or record the Member's 
presence in the House or the Committee of the Whole.<p>

<b> ELECTRONIC VOTING</b><p>

 Recorded and rollcall votes are usually taken by electronic 
device, except when the Speaker orders the vote to be 
recorded by other methods prescribed by the rules of the 
House, and in emergency situations, such as, the failure of 
the electronic device to function. In addition, quorum calls 
are generally taken by electronic device. Essentially the 
system works as follows: A number of vote stations are 
attached to selected chairs in the Chamber. Each station is 
equipped with a vote card slot and 4 indicators, marked 
"yea", "nay", "present", and "open". The "open" indicator is 
used only when a vote period is in progress and the system is 
ready to accept votes. Each Member is provided with a 
personalized Vote 09ID Card. A Member votes by inserting the 
voting card into any one of the vote stations and depressing 
the appropriate push button to indicate the Member's choice. 
The machine records the votes and reports the result when the 
vote is completed. In the event the Member is without a Vote 
09ID Card, the Member may still vote by handing a paper 
ballot to the Tally Clerk, who may then record the vote 
electronically according to the indicated preference of the 
Member. The paper ballots are green for "yea", red for "nay", 
and amber for "present".<p>

<b> PAIRING OF MEMBERS</b><p>

 When a Member anticipates being unavoidably absent at the 
time a vote is to be taken, the Member may arrange in advance 
to be recorded as being either in favor of, or opposed to, 
the question by being "paired" with a Member who will also be 
absent and who holds contrary views on the question. A 
specific pair of this kind shows how the Member would have 
voted if present. Occasionally, a Member who has arranged in 
advance to be paired, actually is present at the time of 
voting. The Member then votes as if not paired, and 
subsequently withdraws that vote and asks to be marked 
"present" to protect the other Member. This is known as a 
"live pair". If the absence is to continue for several days 
during which a number of different questions are to be voted 
upon the Member may arrange a "general pair". A general pair 
does not indicate how the Member would have voted on the 
question, but merely that the paired Members would not have 
been on the same side of the question.<p>

 Pairs are not counted in determining the vote on the 
question, but, rather, provide an opportunity for absent 
Members to express formally how they would have voted had 
they been present. Pairs are announced by the Clerk of the 
House and are listed in the Congressional Record immediately 
after the names of those Members not voting on the question.<p>

 <b>SYSTEM OF LIGHTS AND BELLS</b><p>

 Because of the large number and the diversity of daily tasks 
that they have to perform it is not practicable for Members 
to be present in the House (or Senate) Chamber at every 
minute that the body is actually sitting. Furthermore, many 
of the routine matters do not require the personal attendance 
of all the Members. A legislative call system (consisting of 
electric lights and bells or buzzers located in various parts 
of the Capitol Building and of the House and Senate Office 
Buildings) alerts Members to certain occurrences in the House 
and Senate Chambers.<p>

 In the House, the Speaker has ordered that the bells and 
lights comprising the system be utilized as follows:<p>

 1 ring and 1 light on the left--Teller vote.<p>

 1 long ring followed by a pause and then 3 rings and 3 
lights on the left--Start or continuation of a notice or 
short quorum call in the Committee of the Whole that will be 
vacated if and when 100 Members appear on the floor. Bells 
are repeated every 5 minutes unless the call is vacated or 
the call is converted into a regular quorum call.<p>

 1 long ring and extinguishing of 3 lights on the left--Short

<b> BROADCASTING LIVE COVERAGE OF FLOOR PROCEEDINGS</b><p>

 The rules of the House provide for unedited radio and 
television broadcasting and recording of proceedings on the 
floor of the House. However, the rules prohibit the use of 
these broadcasts and recordings for any political purpose or 
in any commercial advertisement. Likewise, the rules of the 
Senate provide for broadcasting and recording of proceedings 
in the Senate Chamber with similar restrictions.<p>

 
 XII. <a name="budget"><b>CONGRESSIONAL BUDGET PROCESS</b></a><p>

  The Congressional Budget and Impoundment Control Act of 
l974 provides Congress with a procedure for establishing 
appropriate budget and revenue levels for each year. 
Essentially, the Congressional budget process involves 
"concurrent resolutions on the budget" that are passed each 
year.  These resolutions are designed to coordinate the 
revenue and spending decisions that the various legislative 
committees of Congress make in acting on measures within 
their respective jusrisdictions in order to provide fiscal 
discipline for Congress.<p>

 Congress must complete action on a concurrent resolution on 
the budget for the next fiscal year by April 15. This 
resolution sets levels of new budget authority and spending, 
revenue, and debt levels. However, Congress may adopt a later 
budget resolution that revises or reaffirms the most recently 
adopted budget resolution.<p>

 One of the mechanisms Congress uses to enforce projected 
budget authority and spending, revenue, and debt levels is 
called the reconciliation process. Under reconciliation, 
Congress in a budget resolution directs one or more of the 
legislative committees to determine and recommend changes in 
laws or bills that will achieve the levels set by the budget 
resolution. The directions to the committees specify the 
total amounts that must be changed but leaves to the 
discretion of the committees the changes that must be made to 
achieve the required levels.<p>

 If only one committee has been directed to recommend 
changes, that committee reports its reconciliation 
legislation directly to the floor for consideration by the 
whole House. How ever, if more than one committee has been 
directed to make changes, the committees report the 
recommended changes to the Committee on the Budget. The 
Committee then reports an omnibus reconciliation bill to the 
floor for consideration by the whole House. The Committee may 
not change the reconciliation legislation substantively.<p>

 When changes are to be made in legislation that already has 
been enacted or enrolled (for an explanation of enrollment, 
see Part XVII), the vehicle used is a reconciliation bill 
that is enacted in the same manner as any other bill. 
However, if changes are to be made in bills or resolutions 
that have not been enrolled yet, Congress enacts the changes 
in a concurrent resolution not requiring approval of the 
President. The concurrent resolution directs the Clerk of the 
House or the Secretary of the Senate to make the necessary 
changes in the bill or resolution as directed by the 
reconciliation resolution. Congress must complete action on a 
reconciliation bill or resolution by June 15 of each year.<p>

 Generally, after Congress has completed action on a 
concurrent resolution on the budget for a fiscal year, it is 
not in order to consider legislation that does not conform to 
the budget authority and spending, revenue, and debt levels 
set for that fiscal year.<p>

 In 1985, Congress enacted legislation establishing a 
procedure to gradually reduce the Federal deficit to zero. 
The current target date for a zero deficit is 1993. Under the 
new procedure, if the estimated deficit for a fiscal year 
exceeds the statutory level for that year, across-the-board 
cuts in the Federal budget (with certain exceptions) would go 
into effect automatically pursuant to order of the President.<p>

 
 XIII.<a name="message"><b> ENGROSSMENT AND MESSAGE TO SENATE</b></a><p>

  The preparation of a copy of the bill in the form in which 
it has passed the House is sometimes a detailed and 
complicated process because of the large number and 
complexity of amendments to some bills adopted by the House. 
Frequently these amendments are offered during a spirited 
debate with little or no prior formal preparation. The 
amendment may be for the purpose of inserting new language, 
substituting different words for those set out in the bill, 
or deleting portions of the bill. It is not unusual to have 
more than 100 amendments, including those proposed by the 
committee at the time the bill is reported and those offered 
from the floor during the consideration of the bill in the 
Chamber. Some of the amendments offered from the floor are 
written in longhand and others are typewritten. Each 
amendment must be inserted in precisely the proper place in 
the bill, with the spelling and punctuation exactly the same 
as it was adopted by the House. Obviously, it is extremely 
important that the Senate receive a copy of the bill in the 
precise form in which it has passed the House. The 
preparation of such a copy is the function of the enrolling 
clerk.<p>

 There is an enrolling clerk in each House. In the House, the 
enrolling clerk is under the Clerk of the House. In the 
Senate, the enrolling clerk is under the Secretary of the 
Senate. The enrolling clerk receives all the papers relating 
to the bill, including the official Clerk's copy of the bill 
as reported by the standing committee and each amendment 
adopted by the House. From this material the enrolling clerk 
prepares the engrossed copy of the bill as passed, containing 
all the amendments agreed to by the House. At this point, the 
measureceases technically to be called a bill and is termed 
"an act signifying that it is the act of one body of the 
Congress, although it is still popularly referred to as a 
bill. The engrossed bill is printed on blue paper and a 
certificate that it passed the House of Representatives is 
signed by the Clerk of the House. The engrossed bill is 
delivered by a reading clerk to the Senate, while that body 
is actually sitting, in a rather formal ceremonious manner 
befitting the dignity of both Houses. The reading clerk is 
escorted into the Chamber by the Secretary or another officer 
of the Senate and on being recognized by the Presiding 
Officer of the Senate states that the House has passed the 
bill, giving its number and title, and requests the 
concurrence of the Senate.<p>

 
 XIV. <a name="senate"><b>SENATE ACTION</b></a><p>

  The Presiding Officer of the Senate refers the engrossed 
bill to the appropriate standing committee of the Senate in 
conformity with the rules of the Senate. The bill is 
reprinted immediately and copies are made available in the 
document rooms of both Houses. This printing is known as the 
"Act print" or the "Senate referred print".<p>

 <b>COMMITTEE CONSIDERATION</b><p>

 Senate committees give the bill the same kind of detailed 
consideration as it received in the House, and may report it 
with or without amendment or "table" it. A committee Member 
who wishes to express an individual view, or a group of 
Members who wish to file a minority report, may do so, by 
giving notice, at the time of the approval of the measure, of 
an intention to file supplemental, minority or additional 
views, in which event those views may be filed within 3 days 
with the clerk of the committee and they become a part of the 
report.<p>

 When a committee reports a bill, it is reprinted with the 
committee amendments indicated by showing new matter in 
italics and deleted matter in line-through type. The calendar 
number and report number are indicated on the first and back 
pages, together with the name of the Senator making the 
report. The committee report and any minority or individual 
views accompanying the bill also are printed at the same 
time. Any Senator may enter a motion to discharge a committee 
from further consideration of a bill that it has failed to 
report after what is deemed to be a reasonable time. If the 
motion is agreed to by a majority vote, the committee is 
discharged and the bill is placed on the Calendar of Business 
under the rules of the Senate.<p>

 All committee meetings, including those to conduct hearings, 
must be open to the public. However, a majority of the 
Members of a committee or subcommittee may, after discussion 
in closed session, vote in open session to close a meeting or 
series of meetings on the same subject for no longer than 14 
days if it is determined that the matters to be discussed or 
testimony to be taken will disclose matters necessary to be 
kept secret in the interests of national defense or the 
confidential conduct of the foreign relations of the United 
States; will relate solely to internal committee staff 
management or procedure; will tend to charge an individual 
with a crime or misconduct, to disgrace or injure the 
professional standing of an individual, or otherwise to 
expose an individual to public contempt, or will represent a 
clearly unwarranted invasion of the privacy of an individual; 
will disclose law enforcement information that is required to 
be kept secret; will disclose certain information regarding 
certain trade secrets; or may disclose matters required to be 
kept confidential under other provisions of law or Government 
regulation.<p>

 <b>CHAMBER PROCEDURE</b><p>

 The rules of procedure in the Senate differ to a large 
extent from those in the House. The Senate relies heavily on 
the practice of obtaining unanimous consent for actions to be 
taken. For example, at the time that a bill is reported, the 
Senator who is making the report may ask unanimous consent 
for the immediate consideration of the bill. If the bill is 
of a noncontroversial nature and there is no objection, the 
Senate may pass the bill with little or no debate and with 
only a brief explanation of its purpose and effect. Even in 
this instance the bill is subject to amendment by any 
Senator. A simple majority vote is necessary to carry an 
amendment as well as to pass the bill. If there is any 
objection, the report must lie over one day and the bill is 
placed on the calendar.<p>

 Measures reported by standing committees of the Senate may 
not be considered unless the report of that committee has 
been available to Senate Members for at least 2 days 
(excluding Sundays and legal holidays) prior to consideration 
of the measure in the Senate. This requirement, however, may 
be waived by agreement of the majority and minority leaders 
and does not apply in certain emergency situations.<p>

 In the Senate, measures are brought up for consideration by 
a simple unanimous consent request, by a complex unanimous 
consent agreement, by a motion to proceed to the 
consideration of a measure, or by a motion to consider a 
measure on the calendar. A unanimous consent agreement, 
sometimes referred to as a "time agreement", makes the 
consideration of a measure in order and often limits the 
amount of debate that will take place on the measure and 
lists the amendments that will be considered. The offering of 
a unanimous consent request to consider a measure or the 
offering of a motion to proceed to the consideration of a 
measure is reserved, by tradition, to the majority leader.<p>

 Usually a motion to consider a measure on the calendar is 
made only when unanimous consent to consider the measure 
cannot be obtained. There is only one Calendar of Business in 
the Senate, there being no differentiation, as there is in 
the House, between (1) bills raising revenue, general 
appropriation bills, and bills of a public character 
appropriating money or property, and (2) other bills of a 
public character not appropriating money or property.<p>

 The rules of the Senate provide that at the conclusion of 
the morning business for each "legislative day" the Senate 
proceeds to the consideration of the calendar. In the Senate, 
the term "legislative day" means the period of time from when 
the Senate adjourns until the next time the Senate adjourns. 
Because the Senate often "recesses" rather than "adjourns" at 
the end of a daily session, the "legislative day" usually 
does not correspond to the 24-hour period comprising a 
calendar day. Thus, a "legislative day" may cover a long 
period of time--from days to weeks, or even months. Because 
of this and the modern practice of waiving the call of the 
calendar by unanimous consent at the start of a new 
"legislative day", it is rare to have a call of the calendar. 
When the calendar is called, bills that are not objected to 
are taken up in their order, and each Senator is entitled to 
speak once and for 5 minutes only on any question. Objection 
may be interposed at any stage of the proceedings, but on 
motion the Senate may continue consideration after the call 
of the calendar is completed, and the limitations on debate 
then do not apply.<p>

 On any day (other than a Monday that begins a new 
"legislative day"), following the announcement of the close 
of morning business, any Senator obtaining recognition may 
move to take up any bill out of its regular order on the 
calendar. Usually, this is the majority leader. The five-
minute limitation on debate does not apply to the 
consideration of a bill taken up in this manner, and debate 
may continue until the hour when the Presiding Officer of the 
Senate "lays down" the un finished business of the day. At 
that point consideration of the bill is discontinued and the 
measure reverts back to the Calendar of Business and may 
again be called up at another time under the same conditions.<p>

 When a bill has been objected to and passed over on the call 
of the calendar it is not necessarily lost. The majority 
leader, after consulting the majority policy committee of the 
Senate and the minority leadership, determines the time at 
which the bill will be called up for debate. At that time, a 
motion is made to consider the bill. The motion is debatable 
if made after the morning hour.<p>

 Once a Senator is recognized by the Presiding Officer, the 
Senator may speak for as long as the Senator wishes and loses 
the floor only when the Senator yields it or takes certain 
parliamentary actions that forfeit the Senator's right to the 
floor. How ever, a Senator may not speak more than twice on 
any one question in debate on the same legislative day 
without leave of the Senate. Debate ends when a Senator 
yields the floor and no other Senator seeks recognition, or 
when a unanimous consent agreement limiting the time of 
debate is operating.<p>

 On occasion, Senators opposed to a measure may extend debate 
by making lengthy speeches intended to prevent or defeat 
action on the measure. This is the tactic known as 
"filibustering". Debate, however, may be closed if 16 
Senators sign a motion to that effect and the motion is 
carried by three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen and 
sworn. Such a motion is voted on without debate on the second 
day after the day it is filed. This procedure is called 
"invoking cloture". In 1986, the Senate amended its rules to 
limit "post-cloture" debate to 30 hours. A Senator may speak 
for not more than one hour and may yield all or a part of 
that time to the majority or minority floor managers of the 
bill under consideration or to the majority or minority 
leader. The Senate may increase the time for "post-cloture" 
debate by a vote of three-fifths of the Senators duly chosen 
and sworn. After the time for debate has expired, the Senate 
may consider certain amendments before voting on the bill.<p>

 While a measure is being considered it is subject to 
amendment and each amendment, including those proposed by the 
committee that reported the bill, is considered separately. 
Generally, there is no requirement that proposed amendments 
be germane to the subject matter of the bill except in the 
case of general appropriation bills. Under the rules, a 
"rider" (an amendment proposing substantive legislation to an 
appropriation bill) is prohibited, but this prohibition may 
be suspended by two-thirds vote on a motion to permit 
consideration of such an amendment on one day's notice in 
writing. Debate on the measure must be germane during the 
first 3 hours after the morning hour unless determined to the 
contrary by unanimous consent or on motion without debate. 
After final action on the amendments the bill is ready for 
engrossment and the third reading, which is usually by title 
only, although if demanded, it must be read in full. The 
Presiding Officer then puts the question on the passage and a 
voice vote (viva voce) is usually taken although a yea-and-
nay vote is in order if demanded by one-fifth of the Senators 
present. A simple majority is necessary for passage. Before 
an amended measure is cleared for its return to the House of 
Representatives (or an unamended measure is cleared for 
enrollment), a Senator who voted with the prevailing side, or 
who abstained from voting, may make a motion within the next 
2 days to reconsider the action. If the measure was passed 
without a recorded vote, any Senator may make the motion to 
reconsider. That motion is usually tabled and its tabling 
constitutes a final determination. If, however, the motion is 
granted, the Senate, by majority vote, may either affirm its 
action, which then becomes final, or reverse it.<p>

 The original engrossed House bill, together with the 
engrossed Senate amendments, if any, is then returned to the 
House with a message stating the action taken by the Senate. 
Where amendments have been made by the Senate the message 
requests that the House concur in them.<p>

Senate Document No. 97-20 of the 97th Congress, second 
session, Enactment of a Law, by Robert B. Dove, then 
Parliamentarian of the Senate.<p>

 
 XV. <a name="final"><b> FINAL ACTION ON AMENDED BILLS</b></a><p>

  On their return to the House the official papers relating 
to the amended measure are placed on the Speaker's table to 
await House action on the Senate amendments. If the 
amendments are of a minor or noncontroversial nature the 
Chairman of the committee that originally reported the bill--
or any Member--may, at the direction of the committee, ask 
unanimous consent to take the bill with the amendments from 
the Speaker's table and agree to the Senate amendments. At 
this point the Clerk reads the title of the bill and the 
Senate amendments. If there is no objection, the amendments 
are then declared to be agreed to, and the bill is ready to 
be enrolled for presentation to the President. Lacking 
unanimous consent, bills that do not require consideration in 
the Committee of the Whole are privileged and may be called 
up from the Speaker's table by motion for immediate 
consideration of the amendments. A simple majority is 
necessary to carry the motion and thereby complete floor 
action on the measure. A Senate amendment to a House bill is 
subject to a point of order that it must first be considered 
in the Committee of the Whole, if, originating in the House, 
it would be subject to that point.<p>

<b> REQUEST FOR A CONFERENCE</b><p>

 If, however, the amendments are substantial or controversial 
the Member may request unanimous consent to take the bill 
with the Senate amendments from the Speaker's table, disagree 
to the amendments and request a conference with the Senate to 
resolve the disagreeing votes of the 2 Houses. If there is 
objection it becomes necessary to obtain a special resolution 
from the Committee on Rules. However, the Speaker may 
recognize a Member for a motion, authorized by the committee 
having jurisdiction over the subject matter of the bill, to 
disagree to the amendments and ask for a conference. If there 
is no objection to the request, or if the motion is carried, 
the Speaker then appoints the managers (as the conferees are 
called) on the part of the House and a message is sent to the 
Senate advising it of the House action. A majority of the 
Members appointed to be managers must have been supporters of 
the House position, as determined by the Speaker. The Speaker 
must name Members primarily responsible for the legislation 
and must include, to the fullest extent feasible, the 
principal proponents of the major provisions of the bill as 
it passed the House. The Speaker usually follows the 
suggestions of the Chairman of the committee in charge of the 
bill in designating the managers on the part of the House 
from among the Members of the committee. The number is fixed 
by the Speaker and majority party representation generally 
reflects the ratio for the full House committee, but may be 
greater on important bills. Representation of both major 
parties is an important attribute of all our parliamentary 
procedures but, in the case of conference committees, it is 
important that the views of the House on the House measure be 
fully repre sented.<p>

 If the Senate agrees to the request for a conference, a 
similar committee is appointed by unanimous consent by the 
Presiding Officer of the Senate. Both political parties may 
be represented on the Senate conference committee also. The 
Senate and House committees need not be the same size.<p>

 The conference committee is sometimes popularly referred to 
as the "Third House of Congress".<p>

 The request for a conference can be made only by the body in 
possession of the official papers. Occasionally the Senate, 
anticipating that the House will not concur in its 
amendments, votes to insist on its amendments and requests a 
conference on passage of the bill prior to returning the bill 
to the House. This practice serves to expedite the matter 
because several days' time may be saved by the designation of 
the Senate conferees before returning the bill to the House. 
The matter of which body requests the conference is not 
without significance because the one asking for the 
conference acts last on the report to be submitted by the  
conferees.<p>

<b> AUTHORITY OF CONFEREES</b><p>

 Although the managers on the part of each House meet 
together as one committee they are in effect 2 separate 
committees, each of which votes separately and acts by a 
majority vote. For this reason the number of managers from 
each House is largely immaterial.<p>

 The conferees are strictly limited in their consideration to 
matters in disagreement between the 2 Houses. Consequently, 
they may not strike out or amend any portion of the bill that 
was not amended by the Senate. Furthermore, they may not 
insert new matter that is not germane to the differences 
between the 2 Houses. Where the Senate amendment revises a 
figure or an amount contained in the bill, the conferees are 
limited to the difference between the 2 numbers and may not 
increase the greater nor decrease the smaller figure. Neither 
House may alone, by instructions, empower its managers to 
make a change in the text to which both Houses have agreed, 
but the managers for both bodies may be given that authority 
by a concurrent resolution adopted by a majority of each 
House.<p>

 When a disagreement to an amendment in the nature of a 
substitute is committed to a conference committee it is in 
order for the managers on the part of the House to propose a 
substitute which is a germane modification of the matter in 
disagreement, but the introduction of language in that 
substitute presenting a specific additional topic, question, 
issue, or proposition not committed to the conference 
committee by either House does not constitute a germane 
modification of the matter in disagreement. Moreover, their 
report may not include matter not committed to the conference 
committee by either House, nor may their report include a 
modification of any specific topic, question, issue, or 
proposition committed to the conference committee by either 
or both Houses if that modification is beyond the scope of 
that specific topic, question, issue, or proposition as 
committed to the conference committee.<p>

 An amendment by the Senate to a general appropriation bill 
which would be in violation of the rules of the House, if the 
amendment had originated in the House, or an amendment by the 
Senate providing for an appropriation on a bill other than a 
general appropriation bill, may not be agreed to by the 
managers on the part of the House, unless a specific 
authority to agree to such an amendment is given first by the 
House by a separate vote on each specific amendment.<p>

<b> MEETINGS AND ACTION OF CONFEREES</b><p>

 The rules of the House require that conference meetings be 
open, unless the House, in open session, determines by a 
rollcall vote of a majority of those Members voting that all 
or part of the meeting will be closed to the public. When the 
report of the conference committee is read in the House, a 
point of order may be made that the conferees failed to 
comply with the House rule referred to in the preceding 
sentence. If the point of order is sustained, the conference 
report is considered rejected by the House and a new 
conference is  requested.<p>

 There are generally 4 forms of recommendations available to 
the conferees when reporting back to their bodies:<p>

 (1) The Senate recede from all (or certain of) its 
amendments.<p>

 (2) The House recede from its disagreement to all (or 
certain of) the Senate amendments and agree thereto.<p>

 (3) The House recede from its disagreement to all (or 
certain of) the Senate amendments and agree thereto with 
amendments.<p>

 (4) The House recede from all (or certain of) its amendments 
to the Senate amendments.<p>

 In many instances the result of the conference is a 
compromise growing out of the third type of recommendation 
available to the conferees. The complete report may, of 
course, be comprised of any one or more of these 
recommendations with respect to the various amendments. 
Occasionally, the conferees find themselves unable to reach 
an agreement with respect to one or more amendments and 
report back a statement of their inability to agree on those 
particular amendments. These may then be acted upon 
separately. This partial disagreement is, of course, not 
practicable where the Senate strikes out all after the 
enacting clause and substitutes its own bill which must be 
considered as a single amendment.<p>

 If they are unable to reach any agreement whatsoever, the 
conferees report that fact to their respective bodies and the 
amendments are in the position they were before the 
conference was requested. New conferees may be appointed in 
either or both Houses. In addition, the Houses may instruct 
the conferees as to the position they are to take.<p>

 After House conferees on any bill or resolution in 
conference between the 2 bodies have been appointed for 20 
calendar days and have failed to make a report, the rules of 
the House provide for a motion of the highest privilege to 
instruct the House conferees or discharge them and appoint 
new conferees. Further, during the last 6 days of a session 
it is a privileged motion to move to discharge, appoint, or 
instruct House conferees after House conferees have been 
appointed 36 hours without having made a report.<p>

<b>CONFERENCE REPORTS</b><p>

 When the conferees, by majority vote of each group, have 
reached complete agreement (or find that they are able to 
agree with respect to some but not all amendments) they make 
their recommendations in a report made in duplicate that must 
be signed by a majority of the conferees appointed by each 
body. The minority portion of the managers have no authority 
to file a statement of minority views in connection with the 
report. The report is required to be printed in both Houses 
and must be accompanied by an explanatory statement prepared 
jointly by the conferees on the part of the House and the 
conferees on the part of the Senate. The statement must be 
sufficiently detailed and explicit to inform Congress as to 
the effect that the amendments or propositions contained in 
the report will have on the measure to which those amendments 
or propositions relate. The engrossed bill and amendments and 
one copy of the report are delivered to the body that is to 
act first on the report; namely, the body that had agreed to 
the conference requested by the other.<p>

 In the Senate, the presentation of the report always is in 
order except when the Journal is being read or a point of 
order or motion to adjourn is pending, or while the Senate is 
voting or ascertaining the presence of a quorum. When the 
report is received, the question of proceeding to the 
consideration of the report, if raised, is immediately voted 
on without debate. The report is not subject to amendment in 
either body and must be accepted or rejected as an entirety. 
If the time for debate on the adoption of the report is 
limited, the time allotted must be equally divided between 
the majority and minority party. If the Senate, acting first, 
does not agree to the report it may by majority vote order it 
recommitted to the conferees. When the Senate agrees to the 
report, its managers are thereby discharged and it then 
delivers the original papers to the House with a message 
advising that body of its action.<p>

 A report that contains any recommendations which go beyond 
the differences between the 2 Houses is subject to a point of 
order in its entirety. Any change in the text as agreed to by 
both Houses renders the report subject to the point of order 
and the matter is before the House de novo.<p>

 The presentation of the report in the House always is in 
order, except when the Journal is being read, while the roll 
is being called, or the House is dividing on any proposition. 
The report is considered in the House and may not be sent to 
the Committee of the Whole on the suggestion that it contains 
matters ordinarily requiring consideration in that Committee. 
The report may not be received by the House if the required 
statement does not accompany it.<p>

 It is, however, not in order to consider either (1) a 
conference report or (2) an amendment (including an amendment 
in the nature of a substitute) proposed by the Senate to a 
measure reported in disagreement between the 2 Houses, by a 
conference report, that the conferees have been unable to 
agree, until the third calendar day (excluding Saturdays, 
Sundays, and legal holidays) after the report and 
accompanying statement have been filed in the House, and 
consideration then is in order only if the report and 
accompanying statement have been printed in the edition of 
the Congressional Record for the day on which the report and 
statement have been filed. However, these provisions do not 
apply during the last 6 days of the session. Nor is it in 
order to consider a conference report or such an amendment 
unless copies of the report and accompanying statement, 
together with the text of the amendment, have been available 
to Members for at least 2 hours before the beginning of 
consideration. However, it is always in order to call up for 
consideration a report from the Committee on Rules only 
making in order the consideration of a conference report or 
such an amendment notwithstanding the requirement that the 
report and text of the amendment be available for at least 2 
hours before the beginning of consideration. The time 
allotted for debate on a conference report or such an 
amendment is divided equally between the majority party and 
the minority party. However, if the majority and minority 
floor managers both are supporters of the conference report, 
one-third of the debate time must be allotted to a Member who 
is opposed to the conference report. If the House does not 
agree to a conference report that the Senate has already 
agreed to, the report may not be recommitted to conference 
because the Senate conferees are discharged when the Senate 
agrees to the report.<p>

 When a conference report is called up before the House 
containing matter which would be in violation of the rules of 
the House with respect to germaneness if the matter had been 
offered as an amendment in the House, and which is contained 
either (1) in a Senate amendment to that measure (including a 
Senate amendment in the nature of a substitute for the text 
of that measure as passed by the House) and accepted by the 
House conferees or agreed to by the conference committee with 
modification or (2) in a substitute agreed to by the 
conference committee, it is in order, at any time after the 
reading of the report is completed or dispensed with and 
before the reading of the statement, to make a point of order 
that nongermane matter, which must be specified in the point 
of order, is contained in the report. It is also in order to 
make a point of order to nongermane Senate matter in the 
conference report that originally appeared in the Senate bill 
but was not included in the House-passed version. If the 
point of order is sustained, it is then in order for the 
Chair to entertain a motion, that is of high privilege, that 
the House reject the nongermane matter covered by the point 
of order. It is in order to debate the motion for 40 minutes, 
one-half of the time to be given to debate in favor of, and 
one-half in opposition to, the motion. Notwithstanding the 
final disposition of a point of order made with respect to 
the report, or of a motion to reject nongermane matter, 
further points of order may be made with respect to the 
report, and further motions may be made to reject other 
nongermane matter in the conference report not covered by any 
previous point of order which has been sustained. If a motion 
to reject has been adopted, after final disposition of all 
points of order and motions to reject, the conference report 
is considered as rejected and the question then pending 
before the House is whether (1) to recede and concur with an 
amendment that consists of that portion of the conference 
report not rejected or (2) to insist on the House amendment 
with respect to nongermane Senate matter that originally 
appeared in the Senate bill but was not included in the 
House-passed version. If all motions to reject are defeated, 
then, after the allocation of time for debate on the 
conference report, it is in order to move the previous 
question on the adoption of the conference report.<p>

 Similar procedures are available in the House when the 
Senate proposes an amendment to a measure that would be in 
violation of the rule against nongermane amendments, and 
thereafter it is (1) reported in disagreement by a committee 
of conference or (2) before the House and the stage of 
disagreement is reached.<p>

 The amendments of the Senate in disagreement may be voted on 
separately and may be adopted by a majority vote after the 
adoption of the conference report itself as though no 
conference had been had with respect to those amendments. The 
Senate may recede from all amendments, or from certain of its 
amendments, insisting on the others with or without a request 
for a conference with respect to them. If the House does not 
accept the amendments insisted on by the Senate the entire 
conference process begins again with respect to them.<p>

<b> CUSTODY OF PAPERS</b><p>

 The custody of the original official papers is important in 
conference procedure because either body may act only when in 
possession of the papers. As indicated above the request for 
a conference may be made only by the body in possession. The 
papers are then transmitted to the body agreeing to the 
conference and by it to the managers of the House that asked 
for the conference. The latter in turn carry the papers with 
them to the conference and at its conclusion turn them over 
to the managers of the House that agreed to the conference. 
The latter deliver them to their own House, that acts first 
on the report and then delivers the papers to the other House 
for final action on the report.<p>

 Each group of conferees, at the conclusion of the 
conference, retains one copy of the report that has been made 
in duplicate, and signed by a majority of the managers of 
each body--the House copy signed first by the House managers 
and the Senate copy signed first by its managers.<p>

 Obviously a bill cannot become a law of the land until it 
has been approved in identical terms by both Houses of the 
Congress. When the bill has finally been approved by both 
Houses all the original papers are transmitted to the 
enrolling clerk of the body in which the bill originated.<p>

 
 XVI. <a name="bill"><b> BILL ORIGINATING IN SENATE</b></a><p>

  The preceding discussion has described the legislative 
process for bills originating in the House. When a bill 
originates in the Senate, this process is reversed. When the 
Senate passes a bill that originated in the Senate, it is 
sent to the House for consideration. The bill is referred to 
the appropriate House committee for consideration. If the 
committee reports the bill to the full House and if the bill 
is passed by the House without amendment, it is ready for 
enrollment. (See Part XVII.) If the House passes an amended 
version of the Senate bill, the bill is returned to the 
Senate for action on the House amendments. The Senate may 
agree to the amendments or request a conference to resolve 
the disagreement over the House amendments.<p>

 
 XVII. <a name="enrollment"><b>ENROLLMENT</b></a><p>

  When the bill has been agreed to in identical form by both 
bodies--either without amendment by the Senate, or by House 
concurrence in the Senate amendments, or by agreement in both 
bodies to the conference report--a copy of the bill is 
enrolled for presentation to the President.<p>

 The preparation of the enrolled bill is a painstaking and 
important task because it must reflect precisely the effect 
of all amendments, either by way of deletion, substitution, 
or addition, agreed to by both bodies. The enrolling clerk of 
the House (with respect to bills originating in the House) 
receives the original engrossed bill, the engrossed Senate 
amendments, the signed conference report, the several 
messages from the Senate, and a notation of the final action 
by the House, for the purpose of preparing the enrolled copy. 
From these the enrolling clerk must prepare meticulously the 
final form of the bill, as it was agreed to by both Houses, 
for presentation to the President. On occasion there have 
been upward of 500 amendments, particularly after a 
conference, each of which must be set out in the enrollment 
exactly as agreed to, and all punctuation must be in accord 
with the action taken.<p>

 The enrolled bill is printed on parchment paper, with a 
certificate on the reverse side of the last page, to be 
signed by the Clerk of the House stating that the bill 
originated in the House of Representatives (or by the 
Secretary of the Senate when the bill has originated in that 
body). It is examined for accuracy by the Committee on House 
Administration (or by the Secretary of the Senate when the 
bill originated in that body). When the Committee is 
satisfied with the accuracy of the bill the Chairman of the 
Committee attaches a slip stating that it finds the bill 
truly enrolled and sends it to the Speaker of the House for 
signature. All bills, regardless of the body in which they 
originated, are signed first by the Speaker and then by the 
Vice President of the United States, who, under the 
Constitution, serves as the President of the Senate. The 
Speaker of the House may sign enrolled bills whether or not 
the House is in session. The President of the Senate may sign 
bills only while the Senate is actually sitting unless 
advance permission is granted to sign during a recess or 
after adjournment. If the Speaker or the President of the 
Senate is unable to sign the bill, it may be signed by the 
authorized presiding officer of the respective House. After 
both signatures are affixed the bill is returned to the 
Committee for the purpose of being presented to the President 
for action under the Constitution.<p>

 
 XVIII. <a name="presidential"><b> PRESIDENTIAL ACTION</b></a><p>

  Article I, Section 7, of the Constitution provides in part 
that--<p>

 Every Bill which shall have passed the House of 
Representatives and the Senate, shall, before it becomes a 
Law, be presented to the President of the United States.<p>

 
 In actual practice a clerk of the Committee on House 
Administration (or the Secretary of the Senate when the bill 
originated in that body) delivers the original enrolled bill 
to an employee at the White House and obtains a receipt, and 
the fact of the delivery is then reported to the House by the 
Chairman of the Committee. Delivery to a White House employee 
has customarily been regarded as presentation to the 
President and as commencing the 10-day Constitutional period 
for Presidential action.<p>

 Copies of the enrolled bill usually are transmitted by the 
White House to the various departments interested in the 
subject matter so that they may advise the President who, of 
course, cannot be personally familiar with every item in 
every bill.<p>

 If the President approves the bill, he signs it and usually 
writes the word "approved" and the date, although the 
Constitution requires only that the President sign it.<p>

 The Supreme Court has stated that undoubtedly the President 
when approving bills may be said to participate in the 
enactment of laws, which the Constitution requires the 
President to execute.<p>

 The bill may become law without the President's signature by 
virtue of the Constitutional provision that if the President 
does not return a bill with objections within 10 days 
(excluding Sundays) after it has been presented to the 
President, it shall be a law in like manner as if the 
President had signed it. However, if Congress by their 
adjournment prevent its return, it does not become law. The 
latter event is what is known as a "pocket veto", that is, 
the bill does not become law even though the President has 
not sent his objections to the Congress.<p>

 Notice of the signing of a bill by the President is sent 
usually by message to the House in which it originated and 
that House informs the other, although this action is not 
necessary to the validity of the act. The action is also 
noted in the Congressional Record.<p>

 A bill becomes law on the date of approval (or passage over 
the President's veto), unless it expressly provides a 
different effective date.<p>

<b> VETO MESSAGE</b><p>

 By the terms of the Constitution, if the President does not 
approve the bill "he shall return it, with his Objections to 
that House in which it shall have originated, who shall enter 
the Objections at large on their Journal, and proceed to 
reconsider it". It is the usual but not invariable rule that 
a bill returned with the President's objections, must be 
voted on at once and when laid before the House the question 
on the passage is considered as pending. A vetoed bill is 
always privileged, and a motion to take it from the table is 
in order at any time.<p>

 The Member in charge moves the previous question which is 
put by the Speaker, as follows: "The question is, Will the 
House on reconsideration agree to pass the bill, the 
objections of the President to the contrary 
notwithstanding?". The Clerk calls the roll and those in 
favor of passing the bill answer "Aye", and those opposed 
"No". If fewer than two-thirds of the Members present 
(constituting a quorum) vote in the affirmative the bill is 
killed, and a message is usually sent to the Senate advising 
that body of the decision that the bill shall not pass. If, 
however, two-thirds vote in the affirmative, the bill is sent 
with the President's objections to the Senate together with a 
message advising it of the action in the House.<p>

 There is a similar procedure in the Senate where again a 
two-thirds affirmative vote is necessary to pass the bill 
over the President's objections. If then passed by the Senate 
the measure becomes the law of the land notwithstanding the 
objections of the President, and it is ready for publication 
as a binding statute.<p>

 
 XIX. <a name="publication"><b> PUBLICATION</b></a><p>

  One of the important steps in the enactment of a valid law 
is the requirement that it shall be made known to the people 
who are to be bound by it. Obviously, there would be no 
justice if the state were to hold its people responsible for 
their conduct before it made known to them the unlawfulness 
of such behavior. That idea is implicit in the Constitutional 
prohibition against enacting ex post facto laws. In practice, 
our laws are published immediately upon their enactment so 
that they may be known to the people.<p>

 If the President approves a bill, or allows it to become law 
without signing it, the original enrolled bill is sent from 
the White House to the Archivist of the United States for 
publication. If a bill is passed by both Houses over the 
objections of the President the body that last overrides the 
veto likewise transmits it. There it is assigned a public law 
number, and paginated for the Statutes at Large volume 
covering that session of Congress. The public and private law 
numbers run in sequence starting anew at the beginning of 
each Congress, and since 1957 are prefixed for ready 
identification by the number of the Congress--that is, the 
first public law of the 101st Congress is designated Public 
Law 101-1 and the first private law of the 101st Congress is 
designated Private Law 101-1. Subsequent laws of this 
Congress also will contain the same prefix designator.<p>

 <b>SLIP LAWS</b><p>

 The first official publication of the statute is in the form 
generally known as the "slip law". In this form, each law is 
published separately as an unbound pamphlet. The heading 
indicates the public or private law number, the date of 
approval, and the bill number. The heading of a slip law for 
a public law also indicates the United States Statutes at 
Large citation. If the statute has been passed over the veto 
of the President, or has become law without the President's 
signature because he did not return it with objections, an 
appropriate statement is inserted in lieu of the usual 
notation of approval.<p>

 The Office of the Federal Register, National Archives and 
Records Administration, which prepares the slip laws, 
provides marginal editorial notes giving the citations to 
laws mentioned in the text and other explanatory details. The 
marginal notes also give the United States Code 
classifications, thus enabling the reader immediately to 
determine where the statute will appear in the Code. Each 
slip law also includes an informative guide to the 
legislative history of the law consisting of the committee 
report number, the name of the committee in each House, as 
well as the date of consideration and passage in each House, 
with a reference to the Congressional Record by volume, year, 
and date. A reference to Presidential statements--relating to 
the approval of a bill (or the veto of a bill when the veto 
was overridden and the bill becomes law)--is included in the 
legislative history in the form of a citation to the Weekly 
Compilation of Presidential Documents.<p>

 Copies of the slip laws are delivered to the document rooms 
of both Houses where they become available to officials and 
the public. They may also be obtained by annual subscription 
or individual purchase from the Superintendent of Documents, 
U.S. Government Printing Office.<p>

 Section 113 of title 1 of the United States Code provides 
that slip laws are competent evidence in all the courts, 
tribunals and public offices of the United States, and of the 
several States.<p>

 <b>STATUTES AT LARGE</b><p>

 For the purpose of providing a permanent collection of the 
laws of each session of Congress, the bound volumes (which 
are called the United States Statutes at Large) are prepared 
by the Office of the Federal Register, National Archives and 
Records Administration. When the latest volume containing the 
laws of the first session of the 101st Congress becomes 
available it will be No. 103 in the series. Each volume 
contains a complete index and a table of contents. From 1956 
through 1976, each volume contained a table of earlier laws 
affected. These tables were cumulated for 1956-1970 and 
supplemented for 1971-1975 in pamphlet form, and discontinued 
in 1976. From 1963 through 1974, each volume also contained a 
most useful table showing the legislative history of each law 
in the volume. This latter table was not included in 
subsequent volumes because, beginning in 1975, the 
legislative histories have appeared at the end of each law. 
There are also extensive marginal notes referring to laws in 
earlier volumes and to earlier and later matters in the same 
volume.<p>

 Under the provisions of a statute originally enacted in 
1895, these volumes are legal evidence of the laws contained 
in them and will be accepted as proof of those laws in any 
court in the United States.<p>

 The Statutes at Large are a chronological arrangement of the 
laws exactly as they have been enacted. There is no attempt 
to arrange the laws according to their subject matter or to 
show the present status of an earlier law that has been 
amended on one or more occasions. That is the function of a 
code of laws.<p>

<b> UNITED STATES CODE</b><p>

 The United States Code contains a consolidation and 
codification of the general and permanent laws of the United 
States arranged according to subject matter under 50 title 
headings, in alphabetical order to a large degree. It sets 
out the current status of the laws, as amended, without 
repeating all the language of the amendatory acts except 
where necessary for that purpose and is declared to be prima 
facie evidence of those laws. Its purpose is to present the 
laws in a concise and usable form without requiring recourse 
to the many volumes of the Statutes at Large containing the 
individual amendments.<p>

 The Code is prepared by the Law Revision Counsel of the 
House of Representatives. New editions are published every 6 
years and cumulative supplements are published after the 
conclusion of each regular session of the Congress.<p>

 Twenty-two of the 50 titles have been revised and enacted 
into positive law, and 2 have been eliminated by 
consolidation with other titles. Titles that have been 
revised and enacted into positive law are legal evidence of 
the law and the courts will receive them as proof of those 
laws. Eventually all the titles will be revised and enacted 
into positive law, and thereafter they will be kept up to 
date by direct amendment.<p>

Excerpts from the RNC Monday Briefing<p>
<b>FYI</b>
<p>
Keeping a Bold Agenda<P>
<i>The changes in Medicaid, Medicare and welfare must still clear several legislative hurdles, and President Clinton has threatened vetos if the measures reach him in forms he does not approve. But for those who doubted that the Republican sweep of 1994 would be mirrored in this year's legislative dramas, and there were many in Washington, this week has been a revelation.... The Democrats' anxiety is clearly linked to a belief repeately expressed during recent months by ranking senators and others: that the Republicans would quickly lose their boldness when 'it came to the crunch' of health care. But the Republican have not done so"<br></i>
-R.W. Apple, JR., <i>The New York Times</i>, 9/23/95<p>

In a Rut<p>
<i>"My party is making a big mistake. [W]ith Medicare facing a financial crisis, Democrats are playing politics instead of coming up with constructive solutions."<br></i>
-Former Rep. Tim Penny (D-MINN),<i>The Waskington Post</i>, 9/28/95<p>

<i>"[Republicans] have taken a huge political risk just in calling for the [Medicare] cut they have. What the Democrats have done in turn is confirm the risk, The Republicans are going to take away your Medicare.  That's their only message. They have no plan. Mr. Gephardt says he can't pffer one because the Republicans would simply pocket the money to finance their tax cut. ...But that has nothing to do with Medicare. The Democrats have fabricated the Medicare-tax cut connection because it is useful politically. It allows them to attack and to duck responsibility, both at the same time. We think it's wrong."<br>
--The Washington Post, 9/25/95</i><p>

<i>"[The Republican medicare Preservation Act is] not nearly as Draconian as it was assumed by us Democrats. ...I'm not sure how many of us would be will to admit that."</i><br>
--Rep. Jim Moran (D-Va),<i> The Hill</i>, 9/27/95<p>

That Presidency Thing<br>
<i>"President Clinton tells White House reporters he has decided to impart the big picture to Americans. That's nice. Certainly every president should do that. ...Here all along we thought that as a result of studying at Georgetown, Yale and Oxford, and the years of governorship, presidential campaigning and occupying the White House, he understood long ago that telling Americans the big picture was an wssential part of his job."</i><br>
--A.M. Rosenthal,<i>The New York Times</i>, 9/26/95<p>

<i>"We gave up a long time ago on President Clinton as father figure. He is president as gifted teen-ager, elevating his undisciplined, incomplete, searching personality to a management style."</i><br>
--Columnist Maureen Dowd,<i>The New York Times</i>, 9/28/95<p>

<TITLE>U.S. House of Representatives - Tying it All Together</TITLE>
</HEAD> 
<BODY>
<H1>The U.S. House of Representatives<BR>
The Legislative Process - Tying it All Together</H1>
<br>
<I>Prepared by U.S. House of Representatives Information Systems.</I>
<HR>
<DL> 
<DD>  "All Legislative Powers herein granted shall be vested in a Congress of the United States, which shall consist of a
  Senate and House of Representatives."<BR>
  (Article I, Section 1, of the <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/Constitution/Constitution.html">United States Constitution</A>)
</DL>
<P>
The chief function of Congress is the making of laws.  The legislative process comprises a number of steps, and much
information is available from this page concerning the legislation introduced and considered in the 104th Congress.  To
help you understand the information and how it interrelates, a very brief overview of the legislative process within the
House of Representatives is presented below.  There are many aspects and variations of the process which are not
addressed here.  A much more in-depth discussion and presentation of the overall process is available in <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/HOLAM.TXT">How Our Laws Are Made</A>.  Most of the information presented below was excerpted from that Congressional document.
<P>
<BR>
<H3>Forms of Congressional Action</H3>
<P>
The work of Congress is initiated by the introduction of a proposal in one of four principal forms: the bill, the joint
resolution, the concurrent resolution, and the simple resolution.
<P>
<DL>
<DL>
<DT><B>Bills</B>
<DD>  A bill is the form used for most legislation, whether permanent or temporary, general or special, public or
     private.  A bill originating in the House of Representatives is designated by the letters "H.R.",  signifying
     "House of Representatives", followed by a number that it retains throughout all its parliamentary stages.  Bills
     are presented to the President for action when approved in identical form by both the House of Representatives
     and the  Senate.
<DT><B>Joint Resolutions</B>
<DD>   Joint resolutions may originate either in the House of Representatives or in the Senate.  There is little practical
     difference between a bill and a joint resolution.  Both are subject to the same procedure, except for  a joint
     resolution proposing an amendment to the Constitution.  On approval of such a resolution by two-thirds of both
     the House and Senate, it is sent directly to the Administrator of General Services for submission to the
     individual states for ratification.  It is not presented to the President for approval.  A joint resolution originating
     in the House of Representatives is designated "H.J.Res." followed by  its individual number.  Joint resolutions
     become law in the same manner as bills.
<DT><B>Concurrent Resolutions</B>
<DD> Matters affecting the operations of both the House of Representatives and Senate are usually initiated by means
     of concurrent resolutions.  A concurrent resolution originating in the House of Representatives is designated
     "H.Con.Res." followed by its individual number.  On approval by both the House of Representatives and
     Senate, they are signed by the Clerk of the House and the Secretary of the Senate.  They are not presented to the
     President for action.
<DT><B>Simple Resolutions</B>
<DD> A matter concerning the operation of either the House of Representatives or Senate alone is initiated by a
     simple resolution.  A resolution affecting the House of Representatives is designated "H.Res." followed by its
     number. They are not presented to the President for action.
<P>
</DL>
  For more  information on bills and resolutions see <A HREF = "gopher://gopher.house.gov:70/1D-1%3A224%3AD.%20Forms%20of%20Cong%20Action"> Forms of Congressional Action </A> in <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/HOLAM.TXT">How Our Laws Are Made</A>.

</DL>
<P>
<BR>
<H3>Introduction and Referral to Committee</H3>
<P>
Any Member in the House of Representatives may  introduce a bill at any time while the House is in session  by simply
placing it in the "hopper" provided for the purpose at the side of the Clerk's desk in the House Chamber.  The  sponsor's
signature must appear on the bill.  A public bill may have an unlimited number of co-sponsoring Members.  The bill is
assigned its legislative number by the Clerk and referred to the appropriate committee by the Speaker, with the
assistance of the Parliamentarian.  The bill is then printed in its introduced form, which you can  read in <A HREF="gopher://wgate.house.gov:70/7waissrc%3A/USHOUSE_house_bill_text_103rd">Bill Text</A> (
See <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/help/bill_text_help_104.html">Help</A> for searching examples).  If a
bill was introduced today, summary  information about it can be found in <A HREF="gopher://wgate.house.gov:70/7waissrc%3A/USHOUSE_bill_status_today">Bill Status Today</A> (
See <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/help/bills_status_today_help.html">Help</A> for searching examples).
<P>
An important phase of the legislative process is the action taken by committees.  It is during committee action that the
most intense consideration is given to the proposed measures; this is also the time when the people are given their
opportunity to be heard.   Each piece of legislation is referred to the committee that has <A HREF = "http://www.house.gov/under_construction.html">jurisdiction</A> over the area
affected by the measure.
<P>
For more information on this step of the legislative process see <A HREF = "gopher://gopher.house.gov:70/0F-1%3A218%3AE.%20Intro%20and%20Reference%20to%20Cmte">Introduction and Reference to Committee</A> of <A HREF="HOLAM.TXT">How Our Laws Are Made</A>.
<P>
<BR>
<H3>Consideration by Committee</H3>
<P>
<DL>
<DL>
  <DT><B>Public Hearings and Markup Sessions</B>
  <DD>Usually the first step in this process is a public hearing, where the committee members hear witnesses representing various viewpoints on the measure.
    Each committee makes public the date, place and subject of
     any hearing it conducts.  The <A HREF="gopher://gopher.house.gov:70/0F-1%3A942%3ACommittee%20Schedules">Committee Meetings</A> scheduled for today are available along with other <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/Schedule.html">House Schedules </A>.
       Public announcements are also published in the Daily Digest portion of the 
       <A HREF = "gopher://wgate.house.gov:70/7waissrc%3A/USHOUSE_cong_record_103-2">Congressional Record</A>.
<P>
     A <A HREF = "http://www.house.gov/under_construction.html">transcript</A> of the testimony taken at a hearing is made available for inspection in the committee office, and
     frequently the complete transcript is printed and distributed by the committee.
<P>
     After hearings are completed, the bill is considered in a session that is popularly known as the "mark-up"
     session.  Members of the committee study the viewpoints presented in detail.  Amendments may be offered to
     the bill, and the committee members vote to accept or reject these changes.
<P>
     This process can take place at either the subcommittee level or the full committee level, or at both.  Hearings
     and markup sessions are status steps noted in the Legislative Action portion of <A HREF="gopher://wgate.house.gov:70/7waissrc%3A/USHOUSE_bill_status_104th">Bill Status</A>. (
     See <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/help/bill_status_help.html">Help</A> for searching examples).
<P>
  <DT><B>Committee Action</B>
  <DD>At the conclusion of deliberation, a vote of committee or subcommittee Members is taken to determine what
     action to take on the measure.  It can be reported, with or without amendment, or tabled, which means no
     further action on it will occur.  If the committee has approved extensive amendments, they may decide to report
     a new bill incorporating all the amendments.  This is known as a "clean bill," which will have a new number. 
     Votes in committee can be found in <A HREF = "http://www.house.gov/under_construction.html">Committee Votes</A>.
<P>
     If the committee votes to report a bill, the <A HREF = "http://www.house.gov/under_construction.html">Committee Report</A> is written.  This report describes the purpose and
     scope of the measure and the reasons for recommended approval.  House Report numbers are prefixed with
     "H.Rpt." and then a number indicating the Congress (currently 104). 
<P>
</DL></DL>
For more  information on bills and resolutions see <A HREF = "gopher://gopher.house.gov:70/1D-1%3A231%3AF.%20Consideration%20by%20Committee">Consideration by Committee</A> in <A HREF="http://www.house.gov/HOLAM.TXT">How Our Laws Are Made</A>.
<P>
<BR>

<H3>House Floor Consideration</H3>
<P>
<DL>
<DL>
   <DD>Consideration of a measure by the full House can be a simple or very complex operation.   In general a measure
     is ready for consideration by the full House after it has been reported by a committee.  Under certain
     circumstances, it may be brought to the Floor directly.
<P>
   <DD>The consideration of a measure may be governed by a "rule."  A rule is itself a simple resolution, which must
     be passed by the House, that sets out the particulars of debate for a specific bill -- how much time will allowed
     for debate, whether amendments can be offered, and other matters. 
<P>
   <DD>Debate time for a measure is normally divided between proponents and opponents.  Each side yields time to
     those Members who wish to speak on the bill.  When amendments are offered, these are also debated and voted upon.  If the House is in session today, you can see a summary of <A HREF="gopher://gopher.house.gov:70/0F-1%3A947%3ACurrent%20Floor%20Proceedings">Current House Floor Proceedings </A>.
<P>
   <DD>After all debate is concluded and amendments decided upon, the House is ready to vote on final passage.  In
     some cases, a vote to "recommit" the bill to committee is requested.  This is usually an effort by opponents to
     change some portion or table the measure.  If the attempt to recommit fails, a vote on final passage is ordered.
<P>
</DL>
</DL>
<H3>Resolving Differences</H3>
<DL>
<DL>
   <DD>After a measure passes in the House, it goes to the Senate for consideration.  A bill must pass both bodies in
     the same form before it can be presented to the President for signature into law.
<P>
   <DD>If the Senate changes the language of the measure, it must return to the House for concurrence or additional
     changes.  This back-and-forth negotiation may occur on the House floor, with the House accepting or rejecting
     Senate amendments or complete Senate text.  Often a conference committee will be appointed with both House
     and Senate members.  This group will resolve the differences in committee and report the identical measure
     back to both  bodies for a vote.  Conference committees also issue reports outlining the final version of the bill.
<P>
<BR>
</DL>
</DL>

<H3>Final Step</H3>
<DL>
<DL>
   <DD>Votes on final passage, as well as all other votes in the House, may be taken by the electronic voting system
     which registers each individual Member's response.  These votes are referred to as Yea/Nay votes or recorded
     votes, and are available in <A HREF = "http://www.house.gov/under_construction.html">House Votes</A> by Bill number, roll call vote number or words describing the reason
     for the vote.
<P>
   <DD>Votes in the House may also be by voice vote, and no record of individual responses is available.
<P>
   <DD>After a measure has been passed in identical form by both the House and Senate, it is considered "enrolled."  It
     is sent to the President who may sign the measure into law, veto it and return it to Congress, let it become law
     without signature, or at the end of a session, pocket-veto it.

<h2>
REFORMA ELECTORAL
</h2>

Edward H. Crane*
<p>

WASHINGTON <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Uno de los temas ms importantes -y peor entendidos- que
enfrenta Estados Unidos es la reforma electoral. La reforma de las leyes que
rigen el financiamiento de las campaas choca de frente con la ms popular
de las reformas propuestas, la que busca asignar un lmite a las veces que
un congresista puede ser reelegido.
<dd>	El intento de reformar el financiamiento de las campaas, de la manera como
ha sido recientemente presentado en el Congreso, es ms bien una solucin en
bsqueda de un problema. Las crticas de que estamos gastando cantidades
"obscenas" en las elecciones no tienen base en la realidad. En Estados
Unidos gastamos menos de $10 por elector en cada ciclo de dos aos para cada
cargo en el pas, desde atrapador de perros callejeros a presidente de la
nacin.
<dd>	Dado el inmenso impacto que los funcionarios electos tienen en nuestras
vidas y en nuestros bolsillos, se puede ms bien argumentar que no estamos
gastando lo suficiente. Eso es particularmente cierto si reconocemos que el
dinero es lo que nos permite ser informados durante las campaas. Herbert
Alexander, director de Citizens Research Foundation lo explica de la
siguiente manera: "Los gastos en las campaas deben ser considerados como lo
que pagamos para ser educados sobre los temas polticos. Las campaas ms
costosas resultan ser aquellas donde los electores hacen una mala seleccin
por falta de informacin".
<dd>	Es obvio que los lmites que se tratan de imponer a los gastos en las
campaas electorales de los congresistas beneficia a los miembros actuales y
perjudica a desconocidos que aspiran reemplazarlos.
Por el contrario, aquellos que intentan limitar las reelecciones de los
congresistas buscan abrir el proceso poltico. Ellos quieren que sus
conciudadanos que viven y trabajan en el mundo real, lejos de Washington,
vayan a la capital como sus representantes, por tiempo limitado, en lugar de
los polticos profesionales que favorecen las propuestas de limitar el
financiamiento de las campaas.
<dd>La limitacin de las reelecciones combinado a la total transparencia e
informacin sobre las contribuciones recibidas por los candidatos
conformaran una verdadera reforma. Ello permitira que gente competente,
con las ms diferentes posiciones, pudiesen recolectar suficientes fondos
para participar como candidatos en el proceso poltico, an cuando hayan
pasado la mayor parte de sus vidas en el sector privado, como el resto de
nosotros.
<dd>                Como resultado tendramos una democracia ms vigorosa, con
la participacin de candidatos con los ms variados antecedentes y
experiencias, tomando parte en elecciones ms competitivas.
En 1968, Eugene McCarthy pudo lanzar su candidatura a la presidencia porque
unos pocos opositores a la guerra en Vietnam, con mucho dinero,
contribuyeron cientos de miles de dlares a su campaa. Si los actuales
lmites a las contribuciones hubieran estado entonces vigentes, los millones
de ciudadanos opuestos a la guerra no hubieran tenido un vocero y Lyndon
Johnson hubiera ido a la reeleccin. No es el papel de las leyes electorales
cambiar la historia.
<dd>                Como el Sr. McCarthy sostuvo: "Nuestros prceres de la
independencia arriesgaron 'sus vidas, sus fortunas y su sagrado honor en la
batalla por la libertad'. No dijeron 'sus vidas y sus fortunas hasta $1000'".&copy

<title>LOS PREMIOS NOBEL 1996 DE ECONOMIA -- 11/14/96</title>

<i>November 14, 1996</i><br>
<h2>LOS PREMIOS NOBEL 1996 DE ECONOMIA
</h2>
Carlos A. Ball*<br>
<p>
MIAMI (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Un taciturno economista escocs de 60 aos -James Mirrless-,
profesor de la Universidad de Cambridge y otro de 82 aos -William Vickrey-,
profesor emrito de la Universidad de Columbia, quienes nunca se conocieron,
fueron conjuntamente los ganadores este ao del Premio Nobel de economa.
Vickrey, el primer canadiense que lo gana, muri el viernes 11 de octubre de
un infarto, apenas tres das despus de haber sido anunciado su galardn.
<p>
El premio, que conlleva una bolsa de $1,120.000, fue concedido por la Real
Academia Sueca de las Ciencias por el trabajo pionero de ambos en el
desarrollo "de la teora econmica de incentivos bajo informacin
asimtrica". Esto, que suena muy complicado, tiene que ver con las
decisiones econmicas que se toman cuando las partes no tienen la misma
informacin. Por ejemplo, cuando alguien pide prestado al banco, esa persona
conoce mucho mejor su habilidad de pagar el crdito que el banquero que
decidir prestar o no. Tambin, quien compra una pliza de vida sabe ms de
su propia salud que la empresa de seguro.
<p>
Esta asimetra de informacin tiene como consecuencia que el que ms sabe
aprovecha para explotar estratgicamente su mayor conocimiento. La
investigacin sobre la economa de la informacin se ha concentrado en
generar una mayor comprensin de los mercados de seguros, de crditos, las
subastas, los sistemas de impuestos, las instituciones polticas, etc. 
<p>
Ambos economistas han hecho importantes contribuciones al estudio de los
impuestos, buscando que las recaudaciones distorsionen lo menos posible los
incentivos al trabajo y al ahorro. El profesor Mirrlees, quien fue asesor
del Partido Laborista ingls, favoreca la redistribucin de la riqueza, a
travs del sistema impositivo. En 1971, cuando la tasa tope del impuesto
ingls era 83%, con la ayuda de un complejo modelo matemtico se propuso
identificar una tasa impositiva ptima que maximizara la productividad y el
esfuerzo de la gente. Mirrless no slo encontr que la tasa impositiva
debera ser 20% sino que esa debera ser aplicada por igual a todo el mundo.
El primer sorprendido fue l mismo, declarando: "Debo confesar que esperaba
que un riguroso anlisis del impuesto sobre la renta en forma utilitaria me
dara argumentos en apoyo de altas tasas impositivas. Pero no ha sido as".
<p>
Vickrey, por su parte, mantena que los impuestos no deberan desincentivar
a la gente en  producir un dlar adicional de ganancia porque si dejan de
hacerlo el gobierno no recaudar ningn impuesto sobre ese dlar de riqueza
que nunca se lleg a producir.
<p>
En 1964, Vickrey escribi: "Sigue siendo un hecho que las ganancias
producidas por el trabajo estn sujetas al impuesto sobre la renta, mientras
que el beneficio personal obtenido por el disfrute del tiempo libre no es
pechado Por ello, el impuesto sobre la renta tiende a hacer que los
individuos prefieran descansar" Vickrey deca que sus ideas respecto al
impuesto no fueron aplicadas porque hubieran dejado desempleada a la
burocracia de la oficina del impuesto.
<p>
Vickrey, en los aos 1962 y 63, trabaj en la planificacin urbana y
sistemas de transporte de la India, Argentina y Venezuela, haciendo
importantes contribuciones al mejor uso de recursos escasos, para lo cual es
necesario fijar un precio, ya que lo que nada cuesta se malgasta. Muchos
servicios como las carreteras, el transporte colectivo y la electricidad
requieren inmensas inversiones iniciales y cobrar lo mismo en las horas pico
crea congestin. Respecto a carreteras y puentes sugiri que el peaje fuese
ms caro durante las horas pico, de manera de desestimular el uso de esas
vas por personas que no tienen la necesidad de utilizarlas a esas horas. A
medida que aumenta la competencia en el servicio elctrico, los usuarios se
benefician gastando electricidad en horas en que es ms barata y las
empresas elctricas se benefician con un consumo ms estable, lo cual
aumenta la eficiencia de sus plantas.
<p>
Los amigos de Mirrlees cuentan que su nica pasin fuera de la economa y
la matemtica son las novelas de detectives. Y Vickrey, quien ni siquiera
saba exactamente cunto ganaba como profesor en Columbia, donde ense
durante medio siglo, dijo que no necesitaba el dinero pero s la tribuna que
el Premio Nobel le dara. Lamentablemente, sufri un ataque al corazn
mientras manejaba de Nueva York a Boston.

<h2>
UNIVERSIDADES QUE ENGAAN A LOS ESTUDIANTES
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
spanbio
.html">
William E. Simon
</a>

<P>
NUEVA YORK (AIPE).- Actualmente hay casi 15 millones de estudiantes en las
universidades de Estados Unidos. Como nacin gastamos anualmente casi
$170.000 millones en estudios superiores. El costo de una educacin
universitaria de cuatro aos flucta, segn la universidad seleccionada,
entre $50.000 y $100.000 y los costos siguen en aumento.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A pesar del financiamiento de fuentes privadas y pblicas, una buena
educacin universitaria es una inversin considerable para la clase media y
conseguir el dinero requerido es una fuente de angustia para muchos padres.
Pero, qu estn recibiendo los estudiantes, los padres y el pblico a
cambio de esa inversin? La triste verdad es que mientras ms jvenes creen
que es esencial tener un ttulo universitario, aunque signifique una pesada
deuda, ms y ms instituciones superiores ofrecen cursos de estudios que la
mayora de los estadounidenses que viven en el mundo real encuentran sin
sentido y sin contenido prctico.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Recientemente la National Association of Scholars (NAS), un grupo de
profesores que laboran en reforzar las normas acadmicas, presentaron un
informe desbastador, mostrando hasta donde las principales universidades han
desmantelado rigurosos requisitos que los estudiantes tenan antes que
cumplir para graduarse.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	En su investigacin sobre los programas de estudios de 50 universidades,
NAS reporta una disminucin constante desde los aos 60 en requisitos
especficos que antes introducan a los estudiantes a conocimientos bsicos
en reas claves.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	En lugar de los requisitos bsicos en los primeros dos aos exigidos hace
una generacin, que se fundamentaban en estudios de literatura inglesa,
historia de la civilizacin occidental, idiomas extranjeros, ciencias,
matemticas y religin, a los estudiantes de hoy en las ms famosas
universidades se les da entera libertad para que ocupen su tiempo asistiendo
a una variedad de cursos que estn de moda y cuyo contenido consternara a
estudiantes y profesores de una generacin atrs. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;El requisito de un idioma extranjero ha sido abolido por muchas de nuestras
mejores universidades. En 1964, por ejemplo, 90% de las universidades
exigan cursos en ciencias naturales, pero para 1994 el nmero se haba
reducido a 34% y en matemticas la obligatoriedad se redujo durante el mismo
perodo de 36% a 12%.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;La duracin del ao escolar se ha reducido de 191 das de clases en 1964 a
156 en 1993. La proporcin de universidades con clases los sbados cay de
79% a 6% y hasta las clases los viernes son hoy poco frecuentes en algunas
universidades. La duracin de las clases tambin se ha reducido.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Los profesores se han dado cuenta que a medida que se reducen los
requisitos, ellos tienen que dedicarle menos tiempo a los estudiantes,
dedicndolo ms bien a investigacin especializada. Al reducir normas
difciles, los administradores mejoran la retencin de estudiantes, lo cual
es importante a medida que aumenta la competencia entre universidades.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No hay duda de que todo este proceso comenz durante las rebeliones
estudiantiles de los aos 60, cuando los activistas se burlaban de los
programas tradicionales de estudios, tachndolos de irrelevantes en sus
grandiosos proyectos de cambio revolucionario.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Es irnico que cuando necesitamos de una educacin rigurosa para competir
en un exigente mercado mundial, nuestras universidades estn eliminando
requisitos y aadiendo cursos sin valor alguno. Tambin es irnico que ha
medida que el resto del mundo adopta los ideales polticos y econmicos de
la cultura occidental, nuestras instituciones acadmicas se ocupan de
repudiarlos.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Afortunadamente contamos con la ayuda de grupos como NAS, a la vez que
padres, estudiantes y funcionarios pblicos comienzan a exigir un adecuado
retorno sobre la inversin en estudios superiores, rechazando cursos tontos
que no sirven para nada. Como siempre sucede en el libre mercado, el mal
servicio ser rechazado y la gente votar con su dinero a favor de una
educacin que prepara a la juventud para una vida productiva de ciudadanos
educados.

<title>PARAGUAY: DEFORESTACION Y  POPULISMO -- 11/14/96</title>

<i>November 14, 1996</i><br>
<h2>PARAGUAY: DEFORESTACION Y  POPULISMO
</h2>
Porfirio Cristaldo A.*<br>
<p>
ASUNCION (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- La depredacin del bosque nativo en el Paraguay avanza a
ritmo pavoroso. Su total desaparicin se estima entre 5 y 7 aos. Miles de
hectreas boscosas son segadas diariamente e hileras de camiones cargados de
troncos cruzan las fronteras sin pausa, pese a las leyes ambientales que
proscriben la tala de rboles y prohiben su exportacin. 
<p>
Los legisladores reprochan al gobierno por la masiva destruccin de
los bosques, el trfico ilegal de madera y la creciente contaminacin de
ros y arroyos. Exigen el acatamiento de las leyes ambientales, proponen
crear un Ministerio del Medio Ambiente y sancionar leyes ms estrictas, con
elevadas multas y penas carcelarias para los infractores. Pero la
experiencia mundial muestra su equivocacin. No son ms leyes, ni penas ms
duras, ni ms burcratas lo que se precisa para conservar los bosques, sino
proteger la propiedad privada. Paradjicamente, fue el populismo de la
Legislatura en los ltimos aos lo que aceler la deforestacin. Toda
nuestra legislacin atenta contra el bosque.
<p>
        Las leyes de la Reforma Agraria califican al bosque como "latifundio
improductivo", sujeto a expropiacin confiscatoria para su posterior reparto
a campesinos "sin tierra". Supuestamente, los bosques no satisfacen la
"funcin social" de la propiedad. Y por ello los propietarios buscan
deshacerse de sus bosques transformndolos en pastos para el ganado. Por el
apuro, ante la amenaza de expropiacin, las maderas se queman en el
desmonte, sin importar la prdida de materiales de construccin, postes para
cercados y lea. 
<p>
        Pero el peligro no es slo de expropiacin; tambin est la invasin
de los "sin tierra", entre los que hay verdaderos "industriales" de la
deforestacin y el abigeo. Estos invaden nicamente los bosques, y no
precisamente por su fertilidad, sino porque constituyen una fuente inmediata
de ingresos. La primera actividad de los "sin tierra" es la tala del bosque
y venta de troncos. Buena parte del contrabando maderero financia las
invasiones de tierras y en muchos casos constituyen el nico inters de los
"sin tierra". No es fcil sobrevivir en regiones remotas esperando la venta
de las primeras cosechas. Los invasores talan y se van.
<p>
        Para el propietario, la mejor defensa contra la invasin de sus
tierras es la deforestacin, eliminando su principal atractivo. El
formidable costo de derribar y quemar la selva se justifica an ms por el
hecho que el bosque no sirve de mucho, pues las leyes ambientales intentan
"protegerlo" de su dueo. 
<p>
        Al propietario le est prohibido cortar sus rboles y venderlos sin
previa autorizacin del Ministerio de Agricultura, ajustndose a un Plan de
Explotacin forestal. Para el dueo, esta restriccin le resta valor al
bosque. A nadie le interesa cuidar o preservar un recurso cuyo uso el
gobierno puede disponer arbitrariamente. Mejor no tener bosques. Las leyes
de proteccin ambiental se suman as a los peligros de la invasin y
fomentan una rpida deforestacin. El gobierno activamente destruye lo que
pretende proteger. 
<p>
        Las restricciones a la exportacin, rezago de la fracasada "teora
de la dependencia" que consideraba imprescindible exportar bienes con "valor
agregado", limita, a su vez, el valor de los troncos al pequeo mercado
interno. Liberalizar la exportacin eliminara el contrabando y elevara el
precio de la madera al nivel internacional. Acaso esto aumentara la
deforestacin? No. Los bajos precios actuales destruyen el inters de
preservar el bosque y eliminan toda inversin en reforestar. El aumento del
precio de la madera incentivara su conservacin y eficiente explotacin.  
<p>
        En una economa libre es el propietario el ms interesado en
preservar sus bosques. Incluso hoy, las depredaciones ms severas las sufren
los Parques Nacionales, que al ser de todos no son de nadie. Intensificar
las regulaciones y controles como proponen legisladores y burcratas
paraguayos no slo agravar la deforestacin sino tambin el desempleo y la
miseria. 
<p>
        Los bosques nativos, alrededor del 10% del territorio paraguayo,
deberan declararse por ley "no aptos" para la reforma agraria. Frenar la
deforestacin requiere derogar las leyes ambientales y las restricciones al
comercio de troncos, restableciendo la propiedad privada. Nadie mejor que su
dueo cuida lo suyo.

<TITLE>Navarro: La Etica y el Mercado -- 8/7/96</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">

<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>August 7, 1996</i><br>
<H2>LA ETICA Y EL MERCADO</H2>
Agustn Navarro*<p>
CIUDAD DE MEXICO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- A menudo escuchamos crticas al mercado libre con
argumentos de que "la mano invisible" es impulsada por las ms bajas
pasiones de hombres perversos, sin freno tico ni humanitario en la
consecucin de sus aviesos fines de lucro. Tal crtica demuestra una
ignorancia monumental sobre la naturaleza del mercado, pero crea un ambiente
propicio para todo gnero de alternativas fantasiosas y dainas en
regularlo, restringirlo o impedir de plano su funcionamiento.
<dd>
El mercado es simplemente un proceso de intercambio de informacin basado en
los precios como sistema de sealizacin, los cuales concertan y armonizan
ofertas de productores con las demandas de consumidores de bienes y
servicios. En la medida que las seales de los precios sean libres, sin
controles o artificios, la informacin ser fiel y el mercado eficiente.
<dd>
Por tanto, al ser slo un proceso, el mercado es ticamente
neutro. No requiere ni de egosmo o maldad, como tampoco de altruismo y
caridad para funcionar. Lo que requiere la economa para funcionar no son
agentes ticamente calificados sino racionales. 
<dd>
El argumento central de la presunta inmoralidad del mercado
es la famosa "maximizacin de las ganancias" por parte de los participantes,
argumentando que no existira en un mundo ticamente perfecto, donde lo
importante es ayudar al prjimo,  concluyendo que el mercado est
fundamentado en una expoliacin utilitaria e inmoral. Sin embargo, la
realidad es que la maximizacin de las utilidades funciona tan bien en una
sociedad de santos como de diablos. La nica diferencia es que los santos
aplicarn las utilidades a elevados fines filantrpicos y los avaros las
usarn para fines de diversin materialista y egosta. La moralidad,
entonces, no radica en la obtencin de ganancias sino en su uso. Las
ganancias claramente no son el ltimo objetivo.
<dd>
No hay impedimento alguno para la plena convivencia del
mercado y la tica, bajo el funcionamiento del sistema de precios libres,
basado necesariamente en la maximizacin de las ganancias. Lo importante es
aclarar que el mercado es ticamente neutro, ya que promueve eficientemente
el logro de metas de todo tipo y, por tanto, es independiente de los
principios ticos o no de los actores que en l participan.
<dd>                
Al reconocer que en el libre mercado (capitalismo) pueden
coexistir individualidades y conductas inmorales con otras que no lo son
surge el requisito para su buen funcionamiento de un marco de derechos de
propiedad que elimine el dao social derivado de conductas repugnantes.
Cuando se respetan las reglas del sistema, los derechos de propiedad de la
mayora no podrn ser violados como resultado del comportamiento inmoral de
algunos. Por el contrario, el sistema de mercado libre asla y protege a los
participantes del perjuicio directo derivado de la conducta inmoral de algunos. 
<dd>                
No existe otro sistema socio-econmico que ofrezca esta
proteccin y garanta. Adems, el productivo y espontneo "contrato" social
que ofrece el mercado, basado en la divisin del trabajo, especializacin,
descubrimiento de oportunidades de servir a los consumidores y todo ese
proceso coordinado por el sistema de precios, permite que el nivel de vida
de la poblacin se vea beneficiado involuntariamente, an por aquellos que
actan inmoralmente.
<dd> 	
Baste decir que an los vicios privados pueden generar bienes pblicos.
Esto, claro est, no nos exonera de denunciar y repudiar los comportamientos
inmorales, como la corrupcin, el engao y la avaricia. Al final de cuentas
todos somos humanos imperfectos, pero tampoco podemos argumentar que el
mercado y la tica se oponen, o que la inmoralidad es un requisito para que
el mercado funcione. Ms bien, es en el mercado donde la tica tiene mayor
campo de accin y la inmoralidad es ms inofensiva, en razn directa a la
multitud de opciones que el mercado libre le ofrece a la sociedad.

<H2>VENEZUELA: SUBDESARROLLO LABORAL</H2>
Vladimir Chelminski*<br>
<p>



CARACAS (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)-- Los sueldos que recibe la mayora de los venezolanos no
alcanzan para vivir. Con el salario mnimo diario no se compran ni siquiera
dos Big Mac. Los polticos, quienes insisten en ignorar las races del
problema, creen que elevando el salario mnimo resolvern el problema.
Cada ao se aumenta el salario mnimo con la ilusin de proteger al
trabajador de los funestos efectos de la inflacin creada por las
autoridades monetarias. Pero atacar los sntomas, mientras se le da la
espalda a las verdaderas causas, conduce a mayor desempleo y  desconfianza.
Los obstculos que impiden mejorar el nivel de vida del venezolano son
principalmente nuestra psima a legislacin laboral, el  inmenso peso del
aparato gubernamental y la constante emisin de dinero inorgnico para tapar
huecos presupuestarios. Tan espectacular es la catstrofe econmica que
sufrimos que se comienza a generar presin popular por adelgazar al Estado,
por exigir eficacia a los polticos y burcratas, por cambiar leyes que
impiden la inversin, por reformar los corrompidos sistemas pblicos de
seguridad social y de administracin de justicia. Lamentablemente, la
probabilidad que se instrumenten reformas adecuadas en el exageradamente
politizado mbito laboral es nfima.<p>
Una de las aberraciones de la ley laboral venezolana concierne el pago de la
antigedad. Por cada ao de empleo, el trabajador se hace acreedor al
equivalente de un mes de salario, monto que se hace efectivo cuando se
retira de la empresa, pero que constantemente se recalcula en base al ltimo
sueldo. As, todo aumento de salario tiene un efecto retroactivo. En tiempos
de inflacin esta deuda de las empresas se dispara de tal manera que obliga
a los patronos a deshacerse de sus empleados ms veteranos, con la inmensa
prdida de productividad que ello acarrea para la economa.
Al gobierno, por el contrario, no le importa acumular pasivos que
administraciones futuras tendrn que pagar y por ello, aunque emplea al 20%
de los venezolanos, el sector pblico acumula 66% del pasivo por
prestaciones sociales.<p>
La situacin se agrava si el retiro ocurre por decisin del patrono y no del
trabajador, no importan las razones; entonces la antigedad se paga doble.
Por ello, un trabajador que tenga 15 aos en la empresa y gane $5.000 al
ao, despedirlo cuesta $14.000.<p>
La inflexibilidad que estas leyes populistas le han impuesto a la economa
venezolana es motivo importante del empobrecimiento de la nacin y del
atraso de nuestra industria, imposibilitada por las autoridades a competir
con el resto del mundo. Pero, los ms afectados son los miembros de la misma
clase trabajadora ante la desaparicin de ofertas de empleo y por la
imposibilidad de conseguir aumentos de sueldos a medida que sube el costo de
la vida. Eso tambin explica porque ms de la mitad de los venezolanos
laboran en la economa informal, sin ningn tipo de proteccin social.
A pesar de esta tragedia nacional, los sindicatos, fuerza dominante en
varios de los principales partidos polticos aunque representan slo a una
muy pequea parte de los trabajadores, se niegan a aceptar reformas que
impliquen la prdida de sus "conquistas", insistiendo que los "derechos
adquiridos" de los trabajadores no son negociables. <p>
 	El presidente Caldera y su actual ministro del Trabajo parecen ahora
comprender el problema, pero ellos fueron los autores de la ley promulgada
en 1990, cuando en la oposicin utilizaban todas las tradicionales armas de
la demagogia.<p>
Ahora se habla de que la ley se debera aplicar slo a quienes devengan
hasta 10 salarios mnimos. La verdad es que la situacin difcilmente podra
ser peor y da a da se hace ms evidente el atraso institucional de
Venezuela vis-a-vis el resto del continente. <p>

<h2>
EXITOSA REFORMA DEL SEGURO SOCIAL
</h2>

Jos Piera*
<p>

SANTIAGO DE CHILE <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Est ocurriendo en el mundo una verdadera
revolucin social ante el fracaso de los sistemas estatales de pensiones. La
crisis de la seguridad social sobreviene an en naciones tan prsperas como
Estados Unidos, Alemania y Japn.
<dd>	La buena noticia es que Amrica Latina ha sido pionera en lograr la
solucin. Hace 15  aos en Chile se instaur un sistema privado de cuentas
de ahorro individuales que conduce a una verdadera seguridad social. En
Per, Argentina y Colombia se han creado sistemas similares y es posible que
tambin lo hagan Mxico, Bolivia y El Salvador. Apostara que casi todos los
pases de Amrica Latina ingresarn al siglo XXI con la ventaja competitiva
de un sistema de pensiones privado de capitalizacin individual.
<dd>	Es conveniente mantener lo esencial del modelo chileno, adaptndolo a la
realidad nacional, especialmente en la definicin de la transicin desde el
sistema de reparto al de capitalizacin. Siempre surge la siguiente
pregunta: cules son las claves del xito del modelo chileno de pensiones,
aquellos factores esenciales que deben preservarse en toda reforma?
<dd>	Al celebrar 15 aos de funcionamiento del sistema de Administradores de
Fondos de Pensiones (AFP) es oportuno enumerar 20 factores esenciales:
<dd>                1. El sistema tradicional de reparto tiene una falla
estructural al basarse en una visin errada de la conducta humana. Al romper
la relacin que debe existir entre esfuerzo y recompensa, el sistema de
reparto origina conductas que producen, tarde o temprano, graves
consecuencias econmicas y sociales. El problema slo se corrige cuando se
crea un sistema donde la pensin de cada persona resulta de su esfuerzo de
ahorro durante la vida de trabajo. Esto adems permite ampliar la cobertura
del sistema a trabajadores independientes que quieran participar.
<dd>                2. El sistema de capitalizacin individual reemplaza
completamente al sistema de reparto. Siempre existe la tentacin de
soluciones mixtas, pues algunos suponen que al introducir elementos de dos
concepciones diferentes obtienen lo mejor de ambas. Eso es un error.
Generalmente la solucin mixta es un engendro que al carecer de coherencia
interna alimenta contradicciones que ocasionan daos graves. Si la
capitalizacin es mejor que el reparto, por qu mantener un beneficio
universal entregado por el Estado y financiado con un impuesto a la
contratacin de mano de obra?  La coexistencia entre el reparto y la
capitalizacin tiende a no ser posible, pues le permite a sucesivos
gobiernos mostrar preferencia por un sistema u otro.
<dd>                3. El sistema es administrado por el sector privado. En
Singapur hay un sistema de capitalizacin individual nico administrado por
el "Central Provident Fund" del Estado. Ello tiende al mal uso de los
recursos y es contradictorio con una sociedad libre. 
<dd>                4. Las empresas privadas que operan el sistema de pensiones
-las AFP- son de giro nico. No conviene confundir el producto del sistema,
que es una pensin al final de la vida, con los otros productos que ofrece
el sistema financiero. No debe mezclarse la administracin de un ahorro
obligatorio y de largo plazo con la inversin de recursos que toleran
niveles de riesgos superiores. En muchos pases los sistemas bancarios son
oligoplicos y no es conveniente reproducir esa estructura en el manejo del
sistema de pensiones. Entre las AFP y otras instituciones financieras pueden
haber relaciones contractuales, como convenios de servicios que reduzcan los
costos del sistema, pero se debe mantener la naturaleza nica de su giro.
<dd>	5. Los ahorros de los trabajadores reciben la rentabilidad de las
inversiones. Esto es necesario tanto por razones de seguridad como de
estabilidad poltica del sistema. En efecto, si las AFP pactaran de antemano
una tasa de retorno, podran quebrar al realizar malas inversiones, poniendo
en peligro los ahorros. Al distinguir entre Administradora (la cual se
financia con una comisin) y Fondo se logra el objetivo. El Fondo de
Pensiones puede tener oscilaciones de rentabilidad, pero en la medida que
est bien diversificado, esa variacin tiene los lmites propios de lo que
son las rentabilidades nacionales o mundiales. As un Fondo de Pensiones no
puede quebrar, aunque s la Administradora, involucrando en este caso slo
el capital del empresario. Y al comprender los trabajadores que el valor de
su cuenta de ahorro previsional depende de la buena marcha de las empresas y
de la economa, se logra su adhesin al sistema de pensiones y se estimula
un comportamiento responsable.
<dd>                6. Hay libre entrada de empresas del sector. Las condiciones
competitivas permiten optimizar la eficiencia en la oferta de cualquier bien
o servicio. Adems, el sistema de capitalizacin individual es intensivo en
el procesamiento de informacin, rea en la cual estn ocurriendo
vertiginosos avances tecnolgicos. La competencia de inversionistas tanto
nacionales como extranjeros asegura que estos avances sean incorporados y
que la reduccin de costos sea traspasada a los trabajadores a travs de
menores comisiones y mejor servicio.
<dd>	7. El tamao de cada AFP lo determina el mercado y no lmites arbitrarios
impuestos por el gobierno sobre el xito de cada AFP. Si hay una AFP que
logre una fraccin importante del mercado es porque es favorecida por los
propios trabajadores y no porque la autoridad as lo dispuso. Las
deseconomas de escala han impedido la monopolizacin del mercado.
<dd>	8. No hay AFP estatal, para lo cual no hay justificacin. De existir se
produce una competencia desleal con las AFP privadas.
<dd>	9. El trabajador tiene libertad para elegir su AFP. El sistema est basado
en la capacidad de los trabajadores para tomar decisiones sobre la AFP que
le manejar su cuenta de ahorro individual. Australia tiene un sistema
privado, pero  las personas deben afiliarse segn el gremio al que
pertenecen, crendose clientes cautivos que no reciben ni el mejor servicio
ni la mejor rentabilidad.
<dd>	10. Las comisiones que cobran las AFP son libres. Los precios son seales
fundamentales en una economa libre. Por lo tanto, las comisiones -el precio
de los servicios que dan las AFP- deben ser determinadas por el mercado
competitivo. En Chile se fortaleci la ley antimonopolio para impedir la
colusin entre empresas en fijar comisiones. Las autoridades deben asegurar
condiciones competitivas, pero no caer en la tentacin de fijar los precios,
con todas las distorsiones y presiones que ello genera.
<dd>	11. La transicin contempl la libertad para quedarse en el sistema de
reparto o trasladarse al sistema de capitalizacin. Ello hace ms difcil
cuantificar los aspectos fiscales de la transicin, pero tiene un gran valor
para las personas y crea confianza.
<dd>	12. Se les reconocen aportes hechos al sistema de reparto a los que optan
por el nuevo sistema. En Chile se aplic una frmula transparente y eficaz,
el Bono Reconocimiento que reflej los beneficios ya ganados por el
trabajador en el sistema de reparto. Esta compensacin debe existir para no
penalizar a las personas que ya han hecho aportes sustanciales en el sistema
estatal y prefieren que sus contribuciones futuras vayan a su cuenta de
ahorro individual.
<dd>	13. Los nuevos trabajadores entran al sistema de capitalizacin porque no
es responsable mantener abierta la puerta de un sistema de reparto que no es
viable en el largo plazo.
<dd>	14. Creacin de un organismo fiscalizador tecnificado con los recursos
necesarios, tanto humanos como financieros, para cumplir su funcin. En
Chile tenemos un organismo altamente profesional y despolitizado, la
Superintendencia de AFP.
<dd>	15. La regulacin del sistema ha sido crecientemente liberal. Nuestro
enfoque fue radical pero con una ejecucin conservadora. Una vez establecida
la capitalizacin es prudente enfatizar  la seguridad del nuevo sistema,
mientras se adquiere experiencia. Se impusieron estrictas reglas de
elegibilidad y diversificacin de las inversiones que se van liberalizando a
medida que el sistema madura.
<dd>	16. La transparencia es total. La confianza se gana con informacin plena.
Los trabajadores tienen derecho a saber quines son los dueos de las AFP,
en qu invierten los recursos, los niveles de comisiones, etc. Es importante
esta transparencia y posibilita a los dirigentes sindicales asesorar a sus
afiliados y a los analistas, consultores, clasificadores de riesgos e
instituciones financieras emitir opiniones sobre la calidad de los
portafolios de inversin. En Chile, la Superintendencia de AFP publica un
informe mensual que contiene toda la informacin relevante del sistema.
Adems, las AFP estn obligadas a proporcionar informacin peridica a sus
afiliados acerca del estado de sus cuentas.
<dd>	17. La reforma de las pensiones fue parte de un esfuerzo integral de
liberalizacin de la economa y la sociedad. La capitalizacin individual
funciona muchsimo mejor si opera en una economa abierta y con mercados
libres. La apertura del mercado de capitales permite a las AFP aprovechar
oportunidades de inversin en el exterior. 
<dd>	18. La reforma fue precedida por un gran esfuerzo comunicacional. Una
reforma de esta naturaleza afecta la vida de los trabajadores. La inquietud
e incertidumbre son inevitables por lo que las autoridades tienen que
explicar el sistema en trminos simples pero veraces. Una vez operando, la
funcin informativa es asumida por las AFP, sus asociaciones y los medios de
comunicacin.
<dd>	19. La meta fue lograr el sistema ptimo. Para ello se requiere liderazgo.
No se puede disear una reforma de este tipo basndose en encuestas y en un
consenso artificial que diluyen la reforma ptima. El verdadero lder es
aquel que acta segn lo que conviene al pas, aun cuando sea impopular en
el corto plazo.
<dd>	20. Estado de "eterna vigilancia": siempre habrn personas, partidos,
corrientes de opinin, grupos de inters que aspiran torcer el sistema en su
beneficio y en desmedro del resto. Hay que defender los principios centrales
del sistema, rechazando cualquier propuesta que vaya en direccin contraria,
manteniendo el esfuerzo educativo y comunicacional.
<dd>	El sistema chileno de pensiones es mucho ms que una manera de generar
buenos ingresos para los jubilados, crear ahorro para la economa y
estimular el crecimiento econmico. En ltimo trmino, es un acto de fe en
la libertad de los individuos y en las maravillas que los individuos pueden
hacer cuando son libres.&copy

BENEFICENCIA CORPORATIVA
</h2>     
     
     
Carlos Ball*
<p>

MIAMI <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- En Amrica Latina no nos sorprende encontrar a empresarios
que defienden fervientemente la economa de mercado, siempre y cuando no se
aplique a sus negocios; pero s  exigen todas las ventajas y todos los
privilegios que tradicionalmente han recibido de sus contactos polticos.
Pues resulta que en la gran democracia del norte la forma es algo ms
circunspecta, pero el fondo es muy parecido.
<dd>	El gobierno de Estados Unidos gasta $75.000 millones en subsidiar a
empresas privadas a travs de 125 programas federales diferentes. El gran
debate poltico sobre la necesidad de equilibrar el presupuesto se ha
concentrado en examinar programas sociales que han crecido a una velocidad
de varias veces el aumento poblacional y de la inflacin, pero poco se habla
de la beneficencia corporativa, cuando su eliminacin reducira a la mitad
el dficit fiscal.
<dd>	La beneficencia corporativa se puede definir como la concesin de favores y
beneficios, por parte del gobierno, a empresas especficas y, al igual de lo
que sucede en Amrica Latina, los beneficiarios no suelen ser firmas
diminutas que tratan de sobrevivir sino muchas de las ms grandes y
poderosas. La beneficencia corporativa tiene mltiples formas:
transferencias directas de fondos, prstamos blandos (a tasas subsidiadas de
inters y a largo plazo), seguro de inversiones y de exportaciones a pases
riesgosos, subsidios, barreras a importaciones para proteger ciertas
industrias que de otra forma no podran competir (aumentndole el costo de
esos productos y servicios a los estadounidenses), ventajas impositivas (con
reduccin de impuestos o aceleracin de la depreciacin permitida), etc.
<dd>	El ambiente de corrupcin generado por la beneficencia corporativa es parte
integral del mal. Ha sido comprobado que muchas de las empresas beneficiadas
por programas tales como el de Tecnologa Avanzada y el Programa de
Reinversin Tecnolgica fueron tambin las que aportaron las ms grandes
contribuciones a la campaa electoral del presidente Clinton. Otras
empresas, como Archer Daniels Midland (ADM) aporta millones de dlares en
contribuciones a candidatos de ambos partidos polticos y tales
contribuciones han coincidido con subsidios a ADM por valor de cientos de
millones de dlares en los ltimos 25 aos. Hay algo indudablemente podrido
cuando los impuestos pagados por ciudadanos comunes se canalizan para
aumentar las ganancias empresariales.
<dd>	De esta manera el gobierno premia no a las empresas que mejor sirven al
consumidor sino a las que son ms hbiles en el campo poltico. Una relacin
descriptiva de la beneficencia corporativa estadounidense no cabra en la
edicin de hoy de este peridico. Entre las joyas: El programa azucarero
concede ms de un milln de dlares al ao a cada una de las 33 plantaciones
ms grandes de azcar, a la vez que duplica el costo interno del azcar. El
Programa de Promocin de Mercado del Departamento de Agricultura  ha pagado
ms de $50 millones en publicidad en el extranjero de los vinos de
California. El Programa de Tecnologa Avanzada le da casi $500 millones
anuales a empresas como Xerox, Caterpillar y General Electric como subsidio
a sus investigaciones y desarrollo de nuevos productos. La agencia de
Inversiones Privadas en Ultramar gasta $58 millones al ao asegurando las
exportaciones e inversiones en el exterior de empresas como Coca Cola y
General Electric.
<dd>	El centro neurlgico de la beneficencia corporativa en este pas es el
Departamento de Comercio, un ministerio que muchos jvenes congresistas
quieren eliminar. Tambin importante es el Departamento de Agricultura,
ministerio cuyo personal ha crecido geomtricamente a medida de que se
reduce el nmero de agricultores en el pas. El problema es que cuando esos
mismos jvenes congresistas aspiren a ser reelegidos, los ms dispuestos a
aportar fondos a sus campaas sern las mismas empresas y grupos de presin
que reciben el grueso de los beneficios magnnimamente concedidos por el
gobierno. Nada nuevo bajo el Sol. &copy

<h2>
GUERRILLA COLOMBIANA JUEGA AL ANTISAMPERISMO
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Enrique Santos Caldern
</a>

<P>
BOGOTA (AIPE).- La guerrilla colombiana haba estado sospechosamente
quieta. A lo mejor pensaba que atacar a Samper era hacerle el juego a los
gringos. O que si cayera este Gobierno se subiran los militares.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Pero ya no parece tener esas dudas. La masacre de los 11 policas en el
pueblo de Chaln mediante la utilizacin de un "burro-bomba" (lo nico que
faltaba), marc el inicio de una ofensiva que continu el "paro armado", con
su trgico saldo de 25 muertos, buses y camiones incendiados, oleoductos
volados, puentes destruidos... 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Segn un panfleto del ELN, el objetivo es presionar la salida del
presidente Samper, lo que indica que la guerrilla ya reconoce el acelerado
desprestigio del Gobierno y procura sacar dividendos polticos enarbolando
tambin la bandera del antisamperismo.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Pero, no gracias. El pas deliberante, que entiende la necesidad del
retiro del presidente, no acepta estos mtodos, ni requiere a estos aliados.
Entre otras cosas porque el antisamperismo de la subversin es producto del
oportunismo de pescar en ro revuelto, y no de una conviccin sobre las
razones de ndole tica y poltica que precipitaron esta crisis.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La guerrilla se encontr con una coyuntura que ahora piensa puede
resultarle favorable. No la busc, ni la propici, y casi ni la entiende. Le
peg tan de frente, a pesar de ella. Otra muestra de como no logra
conectarse con el pas real. Para la subversin todos los gobiernos son
iguales. No diferencia, ni matiza. No le interesa la reforma, sino la
destruccin del sistema. Por eso no puede contribuir a la solucin de la
crisis ni aprovechar siquiera una coyuntura que debera serles muy propicia
a quienes invocan la lucha contra la corrupcin, la opresin y la injusticia
para justificar actos violentos.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;En efecto, con un gobierno desprestigiado y acorralado, sin credibilidad
interna ni externa, y sin recursos ya para el populismo social; sin una
oposicin que est en condiciones de movilizar a la gente o convertirse en
alternativa creble, era de suponer que quienes llevan 30 aos luchando con
las armas dizque por un pas mejor fueran por lo menos capaces de formular
una propuesta realista.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Pero, qu va. La crisis no ha sido sino nueva oportunidad para reafirmar su
vocacin violenta y su naturaleza destructiva; para comprobar su grado de
despolitizacin y bandolerizacin; para seguir haciendo, en fin, lo que
mejor hacen: matar, secuestrar, dinamitar. Ya no parece interesarles nada
ms: ni el poder, ni el bienestar popular, ni los intereses nacionales.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La guerrilla sigue manejando, claro, un discurso poltico. Ejerce control
sobre amplias zonas del territorio nacional donde el Estado brilla por su
ausencia. Y tiene la base social que le ofrecen la marginalidad y pobreza de
una poblacin que nada tiene que perder. Y es que para un jornalero del
campo o un marginado urbano ingresar a la subversin puede significar
incluso una mejora en sus condiciones de vida.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Mientras no cambien estas circunstancias objetivas, la guerrilla tendr
siempre carne de can para alimentar sus filas. Y podr camuflar la
impresionante perversin de sus ideales invocando motivos sociales y causas
patriticas. Lo grave es que la situacin del pas, la parlisis del
Gobierno el agotamiento del presupuesto social, el deterioro de la economa
y dems signos de la crisis, indican que, lejos de mejorar, estas
condiciones pueden empeorar.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La guerrilla ya lo sabe y por eso promovi un "paro armado". Que fue una
forma de medir su fuerza y la del gobierno. Y si bien su poder de
convocatoria result escaso, porque carece de credibilidad poltica, si
demostr su poder de intimidacin en muchas regiones del pas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Lo del paro representa un audaz paso en su estrategia de confrontacin
total. Consciente de la debilidad del Gobierno, la subversin quiere ampliar
el escenario de la guerra. Y todo indica que es lo que puede suceder. Basta
ver cmo los grupos de autodefensa tambin se multiplican y anuncian que van
a incrementar sus acciones contra la guerrilla.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Sin capacidad de liderazgo en la cpula del Estado; sin estrategia de
guerra ni poltica de paz, y con unas Fuerzas Armadas afectadas tambin por
el recorte presupuestal, no es nada halagador el panorama que se vislumbra
en materia de orden pblico en Colombia.

<h2>
SUICIDIO ELECTORAL REPUBLICANO
</h2>
Grover G. Norquist*
<p>
WASHINGTON <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Imagnese por un momento ser el candidato a la cabeza en
la carrera por la nominacin de su partido a la presidencia de Estados
Unidos. Entonces, un colega suyo, miembro de su propio partido, quien ha
anunciado su retiro del Congreso, introduce un proyecto legislativo que, sin
duda alguna, enemistar profundamente a 2,5 millones de votantes. Adems,
esa misma legislacin contiene aspectos extremadamente ofensivos para grupos
de fieles partidarios. Y, como si fuera poco, 1996 es el primer ao de
elecciones desde tiempos de Eisenhower en que su partido tiene la
oportunidad de alcanzar la Casa Blanca y mantener la mayora en el Congreso.
Pero, a la vez, necesita todo el apoyo posible para ganar la nominacin y
luego las elecciones nacionales. Por qu entonces permitirle a este colega
que ponga todo esto en peligro?
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ese es el dilema que enfrenta Bob Dole con su colega, el senador Alan
Simpson, quien ha introducido un proyecto legislativo sobre inmigracin que
es un desastre en potencia para el Partido Republicano. Permitir que se
discuta en el Congreso es una psima idea por multitud de razones.
Cualquiera que sea el resultado, se ofender a un grupo importante de
partidarios.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
El proyecto de Simpson le dice a 2,5 millones de ciudadanos estadounidenses
que se olviden de las peticiones para traer a sus familiares a este pas.
Toda esa gente que ha cumplido con las leyes y ha estado esperando hasta 10
aos veran que, gracias a los republicanos, el gobierno cambi las reglas.
Gran parte de estos 2,5 millones de votantes, quienes adems viven en los
estados con ms votos electorales (Nueva York, California, Illinois,
Florida, Massachusetts y Michigan), van a votar nicamente en razn de este
asunto en particular.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Visas para familiares no es un asunto que concierne a la gran mayora de
los votantes. Se trata de un escenario nico: si se aprueba la ley, los
republicanos perdern 2,5 millones de votos. Si no se aprueba, no perdern
ningn voto. Estn oyendo esto los candidatos republicanos?
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Este proyecto de ley contiene cosas aborrecidas por diferentes grupos de
republicanos. El Partido Republicano es el partido de quienes quieren bajar
impuestos, sin embargo esta ley le aumenta los impuestos a la clase media,
impone nuevos impuestos al cruzar la frontera y a las empresas que emplean
extranjeros. Tales aumentos se reflejarn en los precios que pagan los
consumidores.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Adems, se planea darle a cada ciudadano estadounidense una tarjeta
nacional de identidad, con algn tipo de "identificador biomtrico", tales
como huellas digitales o registro de la retina que tendra que ser revisado
por los empleadores. Por primera vez, en la historia de este pas, nadie
podra conseguir empleo sin el visto bueno del gobierno federal. Todo
norteamericano que aprecie su libertad debe sentirse ofendido por tal
legislacin, especialmente aquellos grupos que sufren de persecucin oficial
y que tienden por ello a ser republicanos, como los dueos de armas y
quienes dan clases particulares a sus hijos por no gustarles las escuelas
pblicas. Segn el Servicio de Inmigracin (INS), la instrumentacin de una
tarjeta de identidad o registro nacional de trabajadores costara no menos
de $6.000 millones.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Y, sencillamente, no funcionar.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Quienes quieran contratar a indocumentados lo seguirn haciendo. Slo
servir para estorbar a los ciudadanos que legalmente buscan trabajo. El INS
calcula que alrededor de 27% de su documentacin est errada. Si
milagrosamente lograran que slo 2% de sus datos estuvieran equivocados, a
1,3 millones de estadounidenses se les negara arbitrariamente el empleo y
tendran que introducir peticiones al gobierno. Cualquiera que haya tenido
tratos con el gobierno federal sabe cunto tarda cualquier trmite y el
problema que ello representara para quien tiene que pagar la hipoteca y
alimentar a la familia.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Lanzarse a una eleccin habiendo apoyado el proyecto de ley Simpson
equivaldra a que Bob Dole le pidiera a James McDougal (el socio de Clinton
en Whitewater) que le financiara la campaa presidencial.

CIUDAD DE MEXICO  (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--  En un reciente viaje a Europa cruc por carretera
las fronteras de varios pases y lo nico que vi fueron instalaciones
abandonadas, donde antes detenan a los vehculos para pedir pasaportes y
revisar las maletas de los pasajeros. Ahora, esas garitas estn polvorientas
y desoladas. Los autos y la gente circulan libremente.
El extranjero que llega a Europa solamente tiene que presentar su pasaporte
y visa cuando entra a alguna nacin de la Comunidad Europea, pero una vez
dentro, se mueve libremente por todos los pases integrantes de la unin.
En una de las obsoletas instalaciones fronterizas me detuve, tom fotos y
pens sobre todos los aos que innecesariamente y sin ningn beneficio al
bien comn los gobiernos de los diversos pases que ahora integran la
Comunidad Europea obstaculizaron el libre paso de personas y mercancas en
nombre de la soberana, el nacionalismo, la seguridad interna, la proteccin
al empleo, a las empresas nacionales, etc.<p>
	El camino para abolir las innecesarias y antieconmicas fronteras fue
largo, azaroso y controvertido, pero es un triunfo de la razn, el sentido
comn y los principios econmicos sobre el egosmo, los intereses de ciertos
grupos y los mal entendidos conceptos de nacionalismo y de soberana.<p>
	La ausencia de fronteras entre Espaa y Francia no ha desdibujado la
nacionalidad francesa ni daado la soberana espaola. Los espaoles siguen
siendo espaoles, los franceses, franceses y los portugueses, portugueses.<p>
	Desgraciadamente, en Mxico y el resto de Centro y Sudamrica todava se
escuchan voces arcaicas que identifican los valores patrios y nacionales con
una burocracia que, con aires de perdonavidas, deciden quin entra o no
entra en un pas y qu mercancas pasan.<p>
Las aduanas y las fronteras no nacen como consecuencia de una necesidad
social ni mucho menos para mejorar la convivencia entre los pueblos, sino
como un medio de recaudar dinero para hacer frente a los gastos de los
gobernantes, proteger a empresarios amigos en perjuicio de los niveles de
vida de los habitantes.<p>
	Actualmente se mencionan los ms diversos argumentos para mantener las
fronteras entre los pases de Latinoamrica o con Estados Unidos:
diferencias de ingresos, migraciones masivas, asimetras de los mercados,
etc. Todas esas razones y argumentos tambin obstaculizaron durante muchos
aos la integracin Europea, pero al final se impuso la sensatez y el
sentido comn ante el miedo, los intereses mezquinos y los burcratas que
buscan reglamentaciones, obstculos y aduanas como una fuente de poder y
enriquecimiento.<p>
Despus de dos guerras y de millones de muertos, los europeos se dieron
cuenta que la nica forma de evitar una nueva confrontacin es la
integracin econmica.<p>
Aparecern lderes y estadistas en Iberoamrica que recojan la experiencia
europea y luchen porque en un futuro, lo ms cercano posible, las fronteras
entre nuestros pases se conviertan en similares vestigios de la
irracionalidad econmica?  Fronteras que durante tres cuartos de siglo nos
han mantenido divididos y que han sido un factor determinante de nuestro
atraso y pobreza.  <p>

<h2>
LA CRISIS DEL SEGURO SOCIAL
</h2>     
     
     
Paul Craig Roberts*
<p>

WASHINTON <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Si los ciudadanos y sus representantes en el gobierno no
encaran la situacin del Seguro Social, no habr futuro para los
pensionados. El Seguro Social siempre ha sido una pirmide fraudulenta y se
est desmoronando.
<dd>	El Seguro Social "funcion" durante medio siglo por dos razones bsicas: el
programa se origin cuando la poblacin trabajadora era muy grande en
proporcin al nmero de retirados cobrando beneficios y los impuestos a la
nmina necesarios para financiar esos beneficios eran bajos.
<dd>	Al pasar el tiempo, la longevidad ha aumentado y la tasa de nacimiento se
ha reducido. La poblacin en general se torn ms vieja y la proporcin de
trabajadores a pensionados se ha reducido. Para compensar todo esto, el
impuesto a la nmina ha ido aumentando hasta alcanzar 15,3%. Y para mantener
la pirmide ese impuesto tendra que ser doblado para el ao 2040. Varios
factores hacen eso imposible.
<dd>	Sera un peso impositivo imposible de aguantar y aadido al impuesto sobre
la renta y a otros impuestos no le dejaran gran cosa a las familias para
vivir. Otro factor es el impacto sobre el nivel de empleo. Los impuestos a
la nmina son impuestos al empleo. En el pasado, la combinacin de alta
productividad, falta de competencia extranjera e impuestos a la nmina
relativamente bajos impidi que muchos estadounidenses perdieran sus
trabajos, pero la situacin de hoy es diferente. Los impuestos ahora son
altos, la productividad ya no es tan superior a la de otros pases y la
competencia extranjera ha crecido con la desaparicin del socialismo.
<dd>	A partir del ao 2012, el Seguro Social no podr pagar los beneficios
prometidos a menos que el gobierno cubra el dficit pidiendo prestado. Pero
igual como hay un lmite a los impuestos a la nmina, existe tambin un
lmite a la habilidad del gobierno para endeudarse y pagar as los
beneficios del Seguro Social. El dficit se disparara y prestarle
crecientes cantidades al gobierno sera visto como una mala y arriesgada
inversin.
<dd>	Pero la mayor barrera contra la continuacin del actual sistema piramidal
del Seguro Social es la necesidad que tiene la economa de Estados Unidos de
nuevas inversiones para mantener su posicin competitiva en el mundo. Un
verdadero sistema de pensiones aporta los fondos que le permiten a la
economa crecer, pero nuestro Seguro Social es un sistema de transferencias
diseado para cubrir los gastos de vida y hospitalizacin de los mayores.
<dd>	Hay una sola manera de prevenir el colapso del Seguro Social y esa es
convertirlo en un verdadero sistema de jubilacin. El monto proveniente del
impuesto a la nmina sera invertido en un fondo de pensiones a nombre de
cada trabajador. Esto le dara seguridad al trabajador y aportara a la
economa los fondos requeridos para inversin.
<dd>	La transicin sera difcil, pero se puede hacer si comenzamos ahora. La
transicin tendra que ser financiada con un supervit fiscal para pagar los
beneficios de aquellos que se acercan a la edad de jubilacin y cuyo dinero
fue utilizado para pagar a otros que se retiraron antes.
<dd>	El gobierno nos ha venido engaando. Nos promete una jubilacin a cambio de
un impuesto de 15,3% a la nmina, pero no puede cumplir. A menos que se
privatice el sistema, la poblacin va a quedarse con altos impuestos y sin
ningn beneficio. &copy;

<h2>
LOS FUNDAMENTOS DE LA SOCIEDAD LIBRE
</h2>
Nathaniel Branden*
<p>
WASHINGTON <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Poco antes del derrumbe de la Unin Sovitica fui
invitado a participar en una conferencia en Acapulco, Mxico. Otro de los
expositores era Gennady Gerasimov, entonces portavoz de Gorbachev. Comenz
su discurso con un cuento en el que la Unin Sovitica haba invadido con
xito y conquistado al resto del mundo, con una excepcin, Nueva Zelanda. Se
haba tomado la decisin poltica de no invadir ese pas. Por qu? Para que
las autoridades soviticas pudieran conocer el precio de mercado de las
cosas. Toda la audiencia solt la carcajada y yo me qued petrificado.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mi mente retrocedi 40 aos atrs, cuando Ayn Rand me guiaba en la lectura
de Ludwig von Mises, el economista que por vez primera apunt la
imposibilidad del clculo econmico bajo el socialismo, explicando que esa
era la razn por la cual el sistema socialista terminara con un colapso
econmico. Tantos aos ms tarde, un representante de la Unin Sovitica
admita pblicamente, a manera de chiste, el argumento de Mises, tratndolo
como una evidente realidad.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ya muy pocos creen seriamente en el socialismo como un modelo viable de
organizacin social, pero est todava lejos la victoria del capitalismo.
Instituciones como Cato, adems de acadmicos e intelectuales alrededor del
mundo, aportan crecientes evidencias que ningn otro sistema puede competir
en cuanto a productividad y nivel de vida con el libre mercado, a la vez que
se demuestra que los gobiernos no slo fracasan en resolver los problemas
sociales sino que empeoran las mismas condiciones que tratan de mejorar.
Pero como decidido combatiente por la libertad me pregunto por qu la pelea
ha sido tan larga y por qu aparecen cien cabezas cuando le cortamos alguna
al monstruo estatista?
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Vivimos en una cultura que ensea que la moralidad es el autosacrificio, la
compasin y el servicio a los dems. No asociamos la moralidad con ambicin,
realizacin, innovacin ni con las ganancias. Ahora llaman egosta a quien
hace lo que quiere en vez de hacer lo que nosotros queremos que l haga.
Pero si comparamos el bien que logran los que sienten compasin por los
dems con el logrado por aquellos que inventan y alcanzan xito creando
industrias y nuevos servicios, no hay duda de que los ltimos han hecho
mucho ms por la humanidad.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Uno de los grandes problemas que enfrenta la sociedad libre es la
disonancia entre los valores que realmente mejoran el bienestar de la gente
y las cosas que se ensean como nobles y morales. Mientras exista tal
incongruencia, la batalla por la libertad no podr ser permanentemente
ganada. En nuestro siglo hemos sufrido rebeliones virulentas contra los
valores de la razn, objetividad, la ciencia, la verdad y la lgica de parte
de filosofas como el postmodernismo, postestructuralismo,
deconstruccionismo y el determinismo histrico. No es accidente que nuestros
contrincantes son todos estatistas, pero si no se ejerce la razn lo que
queda es la coercin.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Otro valor en decadencia es la autorresponsabilidad. Asumamos que el
crecimiento normal era la progresin de la dependencia de la niez a la
responsabilidad del adulto. Uno de los fundamentos principales del
liberalismo es la premisa de que tenemos que asumir la responsabilidad por
nuestras propias vidas. No hay otra forma en que funcione la sociedad
civilizada. Y durante demasiado tiempo ha existido una animadversin contra
el empresario. Sin embargo, si entendemos que el hombre de negocios es clave
para convertir los nuevos conocimientos en formas de mejorar el bienestar de
la gente, nos damos cuenta que ser antiempresarial es un error. Pero sin la
dimensin moral y espiritual lograremos apenas ganar el debate en el corto
plazo, mientras los estatistas asumen su manto de moralidad, por ms dao
que causen sus programas. 
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Pienso que no hay batalla ms noble que la batalla por la libertad. Y no se
trata de una batalla a favor de la empresa privada ni del mercado. Se trata
de una batalla por la propiedad sobre nuestra vida misma.&copy; <p>

<h2>
SEGURO SOCIAL CONTRA LA FAMILIA
</h2>     
     
     
Robert A. Sirico*
<p>

GRAND RAPIDS, MICHIGAN <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Los votos que he tomado como sacerdote,
incluyendo el de pobreza y castidad, no son para todo el mundo. Otros tienen
la vocacin de ser padres y madres, de proveer para su familia y sus
comunidades. Cuando el gobierno los despoja de su dinero, los est
desanimando de tener hijos y se les coarta artificialmente tal vocacin.
<dd>	Sabemos que los gobiernos reducen la riqueza de la gente a travs de
impuestos y de inflacin. Gracias a programas como el del Seguro Social, los
hijos y las familias extensas han perdido su valor econmico. Antes haba un
contrato implcito de que los padres se ocuparan de sus hijos, quienes a su
vez se ocuparan de los padres cuando estos no pudieran seguirse ganando la
vida. Cada uno sera as protegido durante los aos vulnerables. Hoy en da
a muchos padres les horroriza tener que depender de sus hijos y los hijos
-aun en tiempos malos- resienten tener que ocuparse de sus padres. Que lo
haga el gobierno.
<dd>	Mientras muchos jvenes se lavan las manos en cuanto a la responsabilidad
que tienen con respecto a sus padres, tambin ponen en duda que van a
recibir un centavo en pensiones del Seguro Social. Y tienen razn. Para la
primera dcada del nuevo siglo, los impuestos a la nmina no sern
suficientes para cubrir los beneficios de los pensionados.
<dd>	Ha llegado el momento de dejar de hablar slo de economa e introducir el
elemento moral al debate. Por falta de fuertes argumentos morales del lado
reformista, el intento de reformar la beneficencia pblica fracas el ao
pasado. Una reforma econmica radical necesita de respaldo moral. De otra
forma, la victoria siempre ser de los demagogos.
<dd>	Hay argumentos morales contra el actual sistema de Seguridad Social? Claro
que s. El Seguro Social fue originalmente establecido como una forma de
ahorro. El trabajador aportaba una parte de sus ingresos a cambio de
seguridad econmica en la vejez. Esa es la promesa que el gobierno
cnicamente rompe. Y all mismo est el poderoso argumento moral a favor de
la privatizacin del Seguro Social.
<dd>	Cuando el mercado aporta los servicios, la gente est en libertad de
participar o de retirarse del programa. Los administradores  de los fondos
tienen el incentivo de cumplir con sus obligaciones y con la palabra
empeada. Los que no lo hacen, desaparecen. Pero no es as con el gobierno,
el cual se basa en un intercambio coercitivo, no voluntario. Desaparecen,
entonces, los incentivos para cumplir con lo ofrecido. Por eso es que el
gobierno utiliza los fondos del Seguro Social en gastos corrientes,
reemplazndolos con promesas de pago. Por eso es que se acusa al Seguro
Social de ser una pirmide fraudulenta.
<dd>	Los trabajadores no tienen manera de salirse aunque saben que se trata de
un fraude. La "promesa" ha dejado de parecerse a un contrato, convirtindose
en un sistema basado en el saqueo intergeneracional, con el botn
disminuyendo progresivamente a travs del tiempo. Las nuevas generaciones no
slo dejarn de percibir los intereses sino que ni siquiera recuperarn el
capital. Tampoco contarn con la ayuda de sus hijos cuando estn viejos. A
menos que hagamos algo se incrementarn las peleas y las recriminaciones
entre las generaciones
<dd>	Sin el Seguro Social, los jvenes estaran nuevamente conscientes de su
obligacin de pagar la deuda que tienen con sus padres. Cada uno planeara
su futuro, en lugar de depender de programas coercitivos del gobierno. Las
distintas generaciones comenzaran a redescubrir el valor de cada una de ellas.
<dd>	La moralidad del mercado es que los contratos son honestos y las promesas
se cumplen. Los gobiernos no estn atados a tales valores morales.
Necesitamos de una seguridad social que le sea fiel a su nombre. &copy;

<i>"Any sales tax will inevitably become a<br>

<hr>
<p>
<br>
One of the most refreshing feelings in the new Washington is the growing  
sense that our current tax system is not long for this world.  
<p>	 
Only days after the November election, Congressman Bill Archer, the  
chairman of the House tax-writing committee, boldly declared his desire  
to "tear out the income tax by its roots." House Speaker Newt Gingrich  
and Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole have since formed a commission   
to consider entirely new alternatives. Presidential candidates Phil Gramm,  
Richard Lugar, and Arlen Specter want to scrap the system. A half dozen  
congressional panels are holding hearings on the subject. Even  
Congressman Richard Gephardt, the House Democratic leader, has  
floated a major rewrite (albeit without details).   
<p> 
The question is no longer whether America will get rid of its burdensome  
tax system; the question is, what new system should we replace it with? It  
is a question that will likely dominate our politics through the next  
election.  
<p>
<center>
<b><a name="The Contenders">THE CONTENDERS</a></b><br>

<p>
There are three main contenders: One is a plan advanced by Senators  
Sam Nunn and Pete Domenici. They were among the earliest to call  
attention to the most economically lunatic feature of the current tax code  
-- the highly destructive double taxation of savings -- and develop a   
way to fix it. Called the "USA Tax," their proposal, while fairly  
complicated, defers taxation on income that is saved, while taxing income  
that is used for consumption. It is a sincere and innovative effort to  
encourage the savings necessary for continued economic growth.  
<p>	 
The second contender, which I strongly favor, is the flat tax. Designed to  
make the tax system as neutral and simple as possible, the flat tax would  
sweep away all loopholes, deductions, and exemptions, and replace them   
with a single generous personal allowance. All other income would be  
taxed at one low rate of 17 percent. As the plan's authors, economists  
Robert E. Hall and Alvin Rabushka, have pointed out, a flat tax would  
allow Americans to figure their taxes on a form the size of a postcard.  
The use of the tax code by would-be social engineers would end. Like the  
USA Tax, the flat tax would also end the double taxation of saving.  
<p>	 
While support for the flat tax is soaring -- almost 60 percent of  
Americans appear to favor a version of it, if polls are to be believed -- the  
Nunn-Domenici plan may have been overtaken by events. Conceived at a  
time when it appeared to many that the redistributionist Democratic Party  
would control Congress indefinitely, the plan contains sharply  
progressive tax rates that would kick in at surprisingly low income levels.  
It addresses the disincentive to save quite well, but it may make the other  
problems in the code, high rates and complexity, even worse than the  
current system. With the new politics in Washington and across the  
country, superior alternatives are now clearly within political reach.  
<p>	 
Then there's choice number three: the national sales tax. This is a  
sweeping plan to wipe away the current system and replace it with an  
unprecedented federal tax on retail purchases. Although it's not as widely  
discussed as the flat tax, it has substantial support among many far- 
thinking conservatives, including Archer and Lugar. Indeed, there are   
few conservative hearts that could not be at least a little warmed by its  
central promise to end the income tax altogether.   
<p>	 
This last choice demands serious examination at the moment. Although  
well-intentioned, the sales-tax option has several serious flaws. Before  
getting into that, though, we must remember that supporters of all these  
plans are allies in a fight to end America's single greatest impediment to  
achieving its possibilities: the IRS code, circa 1995.  
<p>	 
Any American tax system should meet three basic criteria. It should be  
fair, simple, and pro-growth. The current system fails miserably on all  
three counts.   
<p>	 
Is it simple? Not by a long shot. In 1990, American workers and  
businesses spent 5.4 billion hours preparing their taxes for the  
government. That's more time than it takes to build every car, truck, and  
van manufactured in the United States each year. After seven decades of  
amendments, revisions, exemptions, loopholes, and extensions, the code  
has become an incoherent mess. The IRS now sends out eight billion  
pages of forms and instructions each year. Laid end to end, they would  
stretch 28 times around the circumference of the earth.  
<p>	 
Is it fair? Hardly. The tax system is as much an exercise in social  
engineering as it is a way of raising government revenue efficiently.  
Through its exemptions and loopholes, the government tries to guide the  
economic decisions of free Americans in the misguided belief that the   
government knows best. Among other things, the code tells us that it is  
better to invest in a municipal sewer system than the next Microsoft, that  
buying rather than renting a home is a better choice for everyone  
everywhere, that purchasing air compressors is better than buying  
computer software. Government has neither the competence nor the right  
to make those decisions for us. The pretense that "government knows   
best" is an insult to our citizens.  
<p>	 
Is it pro-growth? As written, the tax code actually punishes savings and  
investment, by placing double or even triple tax burdens on capital. This  
lowers wages, destroys jobs, and depresses the living standards of all  
Americans. At the same time, it burdens American workers with  
punishingly high tax rates and overall tax burdens. With state and local   
taxes and other federal taxes, Americans now pay more in taxes than they  
spend on food, clothing, and shelter combined.  
<p>	 
All who have worked to end this system, no matter what plan they  
currently favor, should be welcomed as members of the tax-reform  
movement.   
<p>	 
Now for a closer look at option number three. What follows is my  
assessment of the major arguments advanced in favor of the national sales  
tax:  
<p>	 
<b>A sales tax is not an income tax.</b> The case for a sales tax begins with one  
highly appealing applause line. It will allow us, supporters argue, to  
eliminate the income tax altogether, possibly even repealing the 16th  
Amendment, which authorized it and made Big Government possible in   
the first place.   
<p>	 
Even if that goal were politically feasible -- and I don't think it is -- the  
exchange would come at a high price. We would give up the income tax  
for a more intrusive and pervasive tax system.  
<p>	 
The reason is simple. If the government sets out to collect a new tax at  
the cash register, it will soon have no choice but to extend that tax  
beyond the retailer to every level of production, as it desperately tries to  
stop inevitable and massive tax evasion. Any sales tax will become a  
complex, pervasive, multi-rate, value-added tax. We will soon be living   
under a VAT -- possibly the most insidious tax scheme ever devised.  
<p>	 
Sales-tax backers often oppose a VAT. But that's what they'll get. To  
generate sufficient revenue by taxing goods only at the retail level, the  
government would need to impose a sales tax of at least 20 percent,  
which means that consumers would suddenly find that everything they  
buy appears to be 20 percent more expensive. But people will not pay  
such a high tax. They will either find ways to label their consumer goods  
tax-exempt wholesale items, they will purchase goods in a cash black  
market, or they will evade it some other way. A sales tax, in other words,  
will be immediately undermined by a silent tax revolt, and the  
government -- following the pattern of European countries -- will respond  
by imposing a VAT.  
<p>	 
A VAT is assessed at each stage of production and is much easier to  
collect and enforce for a host of reasons. You can hear the bureaucratic  
lament in a 1993 report by the Organization for Economic Cooperation  
and Development, which noted: "Governments have gone on record as  
saying that an RST [retail sales tax] of more than 10 percent to 12 percent  
is too fragile to tax evasion possibilities, and it is probably not entirely  
accidental that in OECD counties, VAT rates are nearly always above 12  
percent and that, except in Canada and Iceland, RST rates have always  
been well below 12 percent."   
<p>	 
These unhappy governments were speaking from sad experience. In  
1967, 21 developed countries had retail, wholesale, manufacturer, or  
multi-stage sales taxes. Today, 20 out of 21 of these sales taxes have  
become value-added taxes. Every developed country except Australia  
that has had a sales tax now has a VAT. (Even Canada and Iceland,   
mentioned as exceptions when the OECD report was written, have since  
replaced their retail-tax-only systems with VATs.)  
<p>	 
Whether or not the sales tax evolves into a VAT, the government would  
become intimately involved in almost every economic transaction  
between consenting adults. The simplest exchange, from a vegetable  
farmer selling his produce to the corner grocer selling a loaf of bread,  
would be under the shadow of a government tax collector taking his cut.  
In fact, every businessperson in America would become a tax collector  
for the government.  
<p>	 
"But businesses already collect taxes for the government," sales-tax  
supporters counter. There's a big difference. Today, businesses collect a  
relatively small share of the income tax, since three quarters of the  
income in the economy is labor income, paid by individuals. But under a  
sales tax, there is no direct tax on individuals, so businesses will be  
responsible for collecting several times what they collect today. That  
means IRS scrutiny of American businesses could be expected to rise  
proportionately. Since the 10-12 million businesses in America have  
fewer rights under law than individuals, we can expect IRS abuses to rise   
exponentially as well.  
<p>	 
It would be an administrative mess. A national sales tax may well exempt  
many basic necessities from tax --beginning with food and clothing.  
This would lead to bitter disputes over the difference between food and  
candy, between real clothes and costume accessories. Congress and   
the courts would likely find themselves debating the nutritional value of  
Twinkies, the body coverage of sportswear, and much else, just as state  
governments do today, but on a larger scale.  
<p>	 
Worse, the federal sales tax and the dozens of different state sales taxes --  
aside from having different tax rates -- would likely exempt different  
items. That means a small businessperson would need to look up the  
correct state sales-tax rate, apply the federal rate, subtract the state tax  
rate from items exempted only by the state, or subtract only the federal  
rate from items federal-only exempted. Then he would need to do  
separate calculations for each of the states in which he does business.  
(And he would need to catch any mistakes before the tax enforcer  
appears.)  
<p>	 
The likely consequence would be a slowdown in business activity -- and  
a loss of jobs and drop in wages for millions of American workers.   
<p>	 
<b>We could eliminate the IRS.</b> Ignoring or dismissing this inevitable  
tendency for a sales tax to become an all-pervasive VAT -- with a huge  
accompanying bureaucracy -- some sales-tax advocates nevertheless  
argue that the sales tax would allow us to eliminate the IRS altogether.  
<p>	 
The argument is presented with an interesting federalist twist. The states,  
they say, could collect the new federal sales tax through their existing  
sales-tax systems. The federal government, then, could do without its  
own revenue collection agency. We could bring about the ultimate   
devolution of federal authority.  
<p>	 
One immediate problem, however, is that five states do not have a sales  
tax and would not take kindly to enforcing one for Washington. Even  
those that do would consider the costs of collecting a huge federal sales  
tax (the main source of federal revenue) an unbearable federal   
mandate.  
<p>
The enforcement costs for current sales taxes, currently about 5 percent,  
are manageable. However, if you add a 20 percent federal sales tax on top  
of that, the compliance problems grow exponentially. It makes little   
sense for a state government to pay the enforcement costs for a 25  
percent tax when it only gets one fifth of the revenue. Many states would  
simply eliminate their sales taxes.  
<p>	 
But the point is purely academic. For reasons dating back to the unhappy  
years of the Articles of Confederation, the federal government will never  
rely on state governments for its prime source of revenue. It will not  
happen.  
<p>	 
In truth, a sales tax would not eliminate any federal agency. It will  
actually allow a huge increase in the size of the federal government by  
allowing politicians to raise taxes with relative impunity. Why? Because  
sales taxes are hidden from the taxpayers, concealed in the price of the  
goods they buy.  
<p>	 
Try this experiment. Stand outside a grocery store and ask shoppers as  
they leave how much they just paid in sales tax. You'll find that virtually  
no one knows. Can you guess how much you paid in sales tax last month,  
or last year? The problem is, if people don't appreciate how much they  
pay in taxes, it is a lot easier for politicians to raise them.  
<p>	 
<b>Individuals would no longer need to file tax forms with the government.</b>
Since people would pay their taxes whenever they purchase an item,  
some sales-tax advocates argue, the government will never need to know  
a taxpayer's name. There would be no filing of any tax papers at all by an   
individual.  
<p>	 
That's not quite right. Under almost any sales-tax plan, individuals would  
still file with the government -- but for entirely different reasons than  
they do today.  
<p>	 
It's almost certain that one way or another, any federal sales tax would  
need to exempt certain basic necessities in order to make it progressive.  
One way to do this, as I've mentioned above, would be to order retailers  
not to charge tax on food and clothing and whatever else the government   
selects.   
<p>	 
But exempting a handful of items isn't enough. Absent a generous rebate,  
most Americans would face a stiff tax increase under a sales tax. That's  
why most sales-tax proposals provide for a rebate. The truth is, the   
overwhelming majority of Americans would still need to file with the IRS  
to claim their rebate (or else face a substantial tax increase).   
<p>	 
Some have suggested the IRS could simply send out checks to every  
American by Social Security number, obviating the need for taxpayers to  
file with the IRS. This is a fantasy. It wouldn't be long before there were  
more Social Security numbers than citizens. Whether or not Americans   
file directly with the IRS, the potential for fraud is staggering. Even under  
the current Earned Income Tax Credit program, fraud levels are as high  
as 30 to 40 percent. How much fraud would there be if the federal  
government were cutting thousand-dollar checks to every American?  
<p>	  
Of even greater concern is the political dynamic that would develop once  
we couple a hidden sales tax with a highly visible tax rebate. Americans  
would be quietly nickel-and-dimed to death by a sales tax they may  
hardly notice, but every year a very noticeable and generous check would  
arrive from Washington like manna from heaven. Government, and even  
the tax bureaucracy, might become highly popular after all. And in my  
judgment, if there could be anything worse then people hating the IRS, it  
would be for people to love the IRS.	  
<p>	 
<b>A sales tax will tax the underground economy.</b> The notion here is that a  
sales tax will more effectively tax illicit trade in both legal and illegal  
goods and services than any income tax. If true, this would bring in tens  
of billions of dollars in revenue to the government as we collect revenue   
from people who are currently outside the system.  
<p>	 
The neighborhood drug dealer almost always serves as the illustration.  
Since the drug dealer declines to file a 1040 form, the argument runs,  
maybe we could at least recoup some of his income through a sales tax.  
The government may have no record that he exists, but when he uses his  
blood money to buy a sports car, the government will collect tax from  
him.  
<p>	 
That sounds compelling at first, but if we think it through, it doesn't hold  
together. Look at it this way: Both systems will equally fail to tax the  
drug trade for the simple reason that the drug dealer will not play along in  
either one. If there's an income tax in place, he won't report his income. If  
there's a sales tax in place, he won't collect tax from his customers. Either  
way, the government loses exactly the same amount of money.  
<p>	 
Consider the following example. Suppose there is a drug dealer who  
makes $50,000 in sales to his customers every year and then turns around  
and spends it. Under an income tax system, we wish to tax the income of  
the dealer and his customers, while under a sales tax we wish to tax all of  
their purchases.  
<p>	 
Under the income tax, we tax the income of the drug consumers  
(assuming they are law-abiding citizens besides their drug use), but we  
can't tax the income of the drug dealer. Thus we lose $50,000 from the  
tax base. Under the sales tax, we tax the purchases of the drug dealer, but  
we don't tax the purchases of the drug consumers. Loss to the tax   
base: $50,000.  
<p>	 
It has to be the case that neither system taxes the value of the drug trade  
because the amount people spend on drugs must equal the income of the  
drug dealer. And since the drug dealer will not report sales or income tax,  
neither system will capture the value of the drug trade.   
<p>	 
The same would hold true for the underground economy in legal goods  
and services as well -- which, of course, is much larger. The proverbial  
plumber who doesn't report his house-call income today would not report  
it for sales-tax purposes either. At best, it will be a wash.  
<p> 	 
Actually, economic reasoning aside, the whole "underground economy"  
argument for a sales tax is flawed. It's obvious that if we try to impose a  
national sales tax of 20 percent or more on the public, the underground  
economy will explode. The "contraband" involved, though, will not be  
just crack cocaine, but virtually any sort of consumer good. That's   
exactly what happened in Canada when the government imposed its  
goods-and-services tax. The tax raised much less than projected.  
Coincidentally, the Canadian Treasury soon noticed a dramatic increase  
in the amount of real currency flowing through the economy. Why were  
Canadians suddenly using so much cash? Guess.  
<p>	 
<b>A sales tax will reduce the trade deficit.</b> Supporters say that a sales tax  
will increase U.S. competitiveness by taxing imports and not taxing  
exports. As tax-policy people put it, a sales tax is "border adjustable."  
Since exports aren't sold in the U.S., they would escape a domestic sales  
tax; since foreign imports are sold here, they will get hit. This way,  
American firms receive a significant tax advantage over foreign firms,  
and that will favorably alter our trade balance.  
<p> 
There are very few economists who hold this view, however. An  
immutable law of economics holds that trade surpluses and deficits are  
linked to the amount a nation lends or borrows. When savings are low,  
the trade deficit must be high, but if we substituted a tax on imports for  
some other tax, it will not affect the amount Americans save. That means   
the trade deficit not only will stay the same, it must stay the same, as a  
basic principle of economics.  
<p>	 
Economists might explain it this way (simplifying, of course): If there is  
more investment occurring in our economy than can be financed by our  
savings, then foreign investors must be accounting for the difference. In  
effect, they are taking the money we pay them for their cars and VCRs  
and using it to buy our stocks and bonds, thus supplying the investment  
capital that we don't supply ourselves. This difference is the "trade  
deficit."   
<p>	 
The only way to change the trade deficit, then, is to change our savings  
rate. If we increase our savings relative to our domestic investment, we  
will have less need for foreign cash. The trade deficit will then drop, as  
we spend relatively less money buying foreign goods and relatively more   
investing at home.  
<p>	 
But anything we do to tax incoming foreign goods -- including slapping  
them with a sales tax -- will have no effect on the amount of money  
Americans are putting into domestic stocks and bonds or even their own  
bank accounts. There is simply no relationship between them.  
<p>	 
What will happen instead is this: Our exports will increase at first because  
of the new tax advantage. But since our savings will remain the same, the  
dollar will be artificially strengthened. This will make our exports more   
expensive, and the original balance of trade will be gradually restored --  
along with the original trade deficit. The policy will be self-defeating.  
<p>	 
Even if a border adjustment were to work as its proponents claim, it  
would still be a bad idea. It would make the goods Americans buy --  
whether produced here in America or abroad -- more expensive, while  
foreigners could purchase American-made goods more cheaply. It's hard  
to see how Americans benefit from paying higher prices than foreigners  
do to purchase American products.  
<p>	 
Adam Smith makes a relevant point in The Wealth of Nations. Smith  
reminds us, "Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production;  
and the interest of the producer bought to be attended to, only so far as it  
may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer."  
<p>	 
In a border-adjustable system, however, to borrow from Smith again, "the  
interest of the consumer is almost constantly sacrificed to that of the  
producer; and it seems to consider production, and not consumption, as  
the ultimate end and object of all industry and commerce."   
<p>

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>
All of the above assumes, of course, that we really could replace the  
income-tax system with a national sales tax. But could we? The roots of  
the income tax go back to the 16th Amendment, passed in 1916 to  
authorize the government to levy a tax on individual incomes. In my  
view, repealing the amendment and ending the income tax for good   
is, politically, not in the cards. Conservatives in Congress have tried for  
years to pass a balanced-budget amendment without success. I believe we  
will eventually succeed, but in the midst of that grueling fight, I believe  
the notion of getting 290 members of the House, 67 members of the  
Senate, and three quarters of the states to repeal the 16th Amendment is a   
dream.  
<p>	 
And that is perhaps the best argument against the sales tax. If we try to  
exchange an income tax for a sales tax, we could easily end up with both.  
It would be a tragic irony if conservatives who favor a smaller  
government unwittingly provide the liberals with a comprehensive new  
taxing authority without eliminating the old one.  
<p>

<b><a name="Flat-Tax">THE FLAT-TAX OPTION</a></b><br>  

<a href="#Contents">Contents</a><br></center>
<p>	 
We must not lose sight of the commendable motives behind the sales tax.  
Its supporters want a tax code that does not interfere with economic  
decisionmaking, minimizes the paperwork burdens on the taxpayers,  
limits the size of the federal government, avoids excessive taxes on  
savings and investment, and is straightforward and fair.  
<p>	 
For all the above reasons, however, the sales tax is not likely to achieve  
those goals. The flat tax, however, will do so. By placing a single tax rate  
on all income, it will not distort economic decisions. Citizens will be free  
to spend and invest their money as they see fit without taking tax  
considerations into account. The paperwork burden, for most taxpayers,  
will be reduced to filling out a postcard-sized tax return. Americans will  
get an honest bill and know how much their government costs them.  
Savings and investment income will be taxed, but only once. The  
punitive double taxation of savings in the current code will be gone. The  
flat tax meets the tax-reform criteria -- it is simple, fair, and pro-growth.

<h2>
SOCIALISMO VENEZOLANO SOCORRIDO POR EL FMI
</h2>     
     
     
Alejandro J. Sucre
<p>

CARACAS <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Con la ceremonia de la firma del prstamo de $1.400
millones, el Fondo Monetario Internacional est oficialmente de vuelta en
Venezuela desde el 3 de junio. El director gerente del FMI, Michael
Camdessus, nos record -lleno de orgullo- que a raz del anterior acuerdo en
1989 el gasto social y la inversin gubernamental aumentaron. Los polticos
venezolanos respiran ahora aliviados por el auxilio del FMI y los
inversionistas extranjeros estn alertas a oportunidades de negocios.
Irnicamente, el venezolano comn fue quien sali perdiendo.
Se han dado algunos pasos positivos. En enero, el gobierno venezolano
reabri el sector petrolero a inversionistas extranjeros. El nombramiento de
Teodoro Petkoff -un ex guerrillero comunista- como ministro de Planificacin
ha sido bien recibido por su nueva retrica pro mercado.  El gobierno acept
las condiciones del FMI sobre la eliminacin del control de precios y de
cambios, terminando tambin con el inmenso subsidio al precio de la gasolina.
Pero tales medidas en realidad significan muy poco. El FMI nos impuso sus
tpicas medidas de austeridad e incremento de impuestos.  Peor todava, el
prstamo del FMI slo sirve para  financiar la crisis de balanza de pagos,
la cual debi haber sido resuelta a travs de los mecanismos de mercado. Y
la apertura petrolera a inversionistas extranjeros lejos de significar la
privatizacin de la industria petrolera la aleja porque las utilidades
compartidas y los ingresos impositivos del nuevo esquema de explotacin irn
directamente a engrosar el estado. Esos nuevos ingresos lejos de ser
herramientas de desarrollo sern el nuevo sustento de las corruptas
instituciones polticas.  
<dd>Venezuela sigue dndole la espalda a la solucin a sus problemas: el
traspaso a manos privadas de los inmensos activos que el estado derrocha.
Por este camino seguimos avanzando hacia la desintegracin econmica,
mientras que los nuevos recursos petroleros y el acuerdo con el FMI
facilitan y financian esa fatal trayectoria.
<dd>Durante los ltimos 20 aos, el estamento poltico venezolano ha acumulado
control sobre los activos del pas a una velocidad vertiginosa. Se estima
que 70% de los activos productivos pertenecen al estado, contra 25% en 1970.
Las propiedades del estado incluyen todas las minas, el petrleo, fbricas
petroqumicas, las industrias de aluminio y acero, playas, puertos, gran
parte de las tierras agrcolas, inmuebles, hoteles, 60% del sistema
bancario, compaas manufactureras, estaciones de radio y televisin, etc. Y
todas esas empresas estatales, a excepcin de las petroleras, pierden dinero
a manos llenas. Sin el esquema de apertura petrolera y el financiamiento del
FMI, el estado venezolano se vera obligado a privatizar.
<dd>A pesar de los inmensos ingresos petroleros (ms de $350.000 millones desde
1976), estos ya resultan insuficientes para los polticos, drenando su poder
de comprar elecciones. Segn las ltimas encuestas, ningn poltico ni
partido goza de ms del 8% de las preferencias del electorado. Pero el
retroceso logrado ha sido dantesco. 
<dd>Desde 1976, el PIB per capita del venezolano ha cado en 39% y la inflacin
se ha multiplicado 110 veces. Hoy el dficit fiscal equivale al 16% del PIB;
el servicio de la deuda externa absorbe 25% de las exportaciones; la deuda
es de $35.000 millones; el desempleo de 20% y  51% de  la poblacin activa
trabaja en el sector informal de la economa. La clase media se ha contrado
de 25% a apenas 18% de la poblacin.  
<p>
En lugar de correr la arruga endeudndonos ms, aumentando impuestos y
tarifas de servicios pblicos, el gobierno debi superar la crisis
instrumentando las reformas necesarias: 
<ul>
<li>  Privatizacin del 20% de la industria petrolera para pagar toda la deuda
externa.
<li>  Liquidacin de $2.000 millones de activos bancarios asumidos por el
estado a raz de la crisis del sector financiero de 1994, para reducir la
deuda pblica interna y el costo de intereses.
<li>  Reducir el gasto pblico a travs de un programa de capitalizacin que
coloque en manos de los ciudadanos todos los activos del estado socialista,
incluyendo escuelas pblicas, hospitales y el 80% remanente de PDVSA.  Slo
devolviendo a la ciudadana la propiedad de los activos productivos de la
nacin se cambia el rumbo econmico. Los subsidios a la gasolina, los
impuestos ni las tarifas de los servicios pblicos se han debido alterar
antes de traspasarle a la ciudadana los recursos productivos del pas.
El FMI ha tenido un papel vergonzoso en toda esta comedia de errores.
Financiar el dficit fiscal con nuevo endeudamiento y elevando impuestos se
sacrifica y se empobrece ms al pueblo. Luego del alboroto propagandstico
de las ltimas semanas, la Venezuela de hoy sigue siendo la misma de ayer.
La economa sigue en manos de polticos y burcratas ineptos y corruptos,
mientras que los burcratas del FMI parecen creer que el capitalismo slo
funciona en las naciones del G-7y hay que evitar su contagio al mundo en
desarrollo.
</ul>
<dd>	Ningn plan del FMI ni pacto estatista con las grandes corporaciones
petroleras detendr la devaluacin, la inflacin y el progresivo
empobrecimiento, a menos que el ciudadano comn tenga los incentivos
necesarios para convertirse en verdadero motor de la economa. Por ahora,
los venezolanos estamos forzados a aceptar la Agenda Caldera-FMI: aumento de
impuestos y de los servicios pblicos y seremos testigos de cmo esos fondos
son despilfarrados. &copy;

NUNCA ANTES PAGAMOS MAS  EN IMPUESTOS

<P>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).-- Segn los ltimos datos del Departamento de Comercio, el
inexorable crecimiento de los impuestos bajo Bill Clinton ha alcanzado un
nuevo pinculo. Para el segundo trimestre de 1996, los impuestos federales
como porcentaje del PIB han alcanzado su nivel histrico ms alto. El
gobierno federal le sac del bolsillo a los estadounidenses $1.572.500
millones, mientras que el PIB fue de $7.547.600 millones. Eso coloca los
impuestos en 20,8% del PIB.
<P>
 Para asegurarme de que los impuestos federales nunca haban sido tan altos,
calcul las contribuciones como porcentaje del PIB desde que existe esa
informacin. Las cifras del PIB anual van hasta 1929 y la informacin
trimestral desde 1946 hasta hoy. En todo ese tiempo, slo durante cuatro
aos los ingresos del gobierno federal alcanzaron 20,5% del PIB, y durante
tres de esos cuatro aos estbamos en guerra.
<P>
 Los impuestos federales alcanzaron 20,5% del PIB en 1943, en medio de la
Segunda Guerra Mundial. Llegaron a 20,6% en el primer trimestre de 1951,
durante la guerra de Corea y a 20,7% en el segundo trimestre de 1969, cuando
el recargo tributario de la Guerra de Vietnam estaba vigente. La ocasin
anterior en que los impuestos estuvieron casi tan altos como actualmente
bajo Clinton fue durante la primera mitad del ao 1981, alcanzando 20,7% del
PIB, debido a que la inflacin de dos dgitos sufrida durante la
administracin del presidente Carter elev a la gente a tramos superiores
del impuesto sobre la renta.
<P>
 As vemos que en ningn perodo anterior el gobierno federal agarr tanto
en impuestos como hoy lo hace Bill Clinton.
<P>
 Tanto el Departamento del Tesoro como la Oficina Presupuestaria del
Congreso creen que las cifras del segundo semestre son una aberracin
resultante posiblemente de pagos por ganancias de capital ms altas de lo
esperado, por la subida de la Bolsa de Valores. Sin embargo, el actual nivel
de contribuciones es consistente con la creciente tendencia experimentada
desde que Clinton lleg a la Casa Blanca y nos encasquet el aumento
impositivo ms grande de la historia de Estados Unidos.
<P>
 Algunos grupos, como los izquierdistas del Center on Budget and Policy
Priorities, argumentan que los impuestos que pagan los individuos no han
subido porque los ingresos adicionales provienen de impuestos corporativos y
de aumentos en las primas de Medicare (el seguro estatal para los ancianos).
Eso es una ingenuidad. Los impuestos corporativos los termina pagando la
gente a travs de salarios ms bajos, precios ms altos o dividendos
inferiores. Y mayores primas de Medicare reducen el ingreso disponible de la
misma forma como lo hacen impuestos ms altos. Por lo tanto, la proporcin
de los impuestos en el PIB sigue siendo la mejor medida de la carga fiscal. &copy;

<p>
WASHINGTON(<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--  En 
base a sus actuales operaciones, la Organizacin de
las Naciones Unidas no merece el apoyo americano. Su burocracia prolifera,
sus costos se disparan, su misin est en permanente expansin y muy por
encima de su capacidad. Peor todava, con la constante ampliacin de sus
actividades, la ONU est siendo transformada de una institucin compuesta
por estados soberanos en una entidad cuasi-soberana. Esa transformacin es
una amenaza a los intereses nacionales y est siendo financiada
principalmente por los contribuyentes de este pas, quienes aportan ms de
$3.500 millones al ao, convirtindonos en el ms generoso benefactor de
esta organizacin sedienta de poder.
<P>
 La situacin es insostenible. La ONU tiene que ser totalmente reformada.
Sin embargo, el secretario general Boutros Boutros-Ghali ha ignorado las
mltiples advertencias, protegiendo su inflada burocracia e insistiendo en
la creacin de un ejrcito propio de las Naciones Unidas y el poder de
recolectar impuestos directamente. Del empeo reformista de su prximo
secretario general depender la supervivencia de la ONU.
 <P>
La ONU fue creada para ayudar a facilitar soluciones pacficas de disputas
internacionales. Pero la lite internacional que maneja la ONU desprecia la
nocin de intereses parroquiales, cuando lo que importa es el inters
mundial. Esa manera de pensar se ajusta al movimiento en favor de una mayor
centralizacin del poder poltico en manos de una lite, a costa de los
individuos y sus representantes locales. Slo ahora se comienza a comprender
el efecto destructivo de las burocracias centralizadas y del control estatal
de las actividades econmicas. Vemos que una vez establecidas, las
burocracias junto con las ddivas que reparten son casi imposibles de
desmantelar.
<P>
 A medida que nos acercamos al nuevo  milenio, el virus de la centralizacin
se extiende a nivel global y la ONU es el portador. Se trata de impedir que
una burocracia que no ha sido electa por nadie siga aumentando su poder a
costa de lderes nacionales electos democrticamente. 
 Cun grande es el problema? Segn los ltimos datos oficiales, la ONU
emplea a 53.744 burcratas. Segn esta inmensa burocracia, no existe
problema internacional, nacional ni local que no sea problema de la ONU. Ah
tenemos la reciente conferencia Habitat II en Estambul, donde la ONU gast
millones de dlares para tratar los problemas de las ciudades, asuntos que
legtimamente deben ser manejados por los gobiernos locales.
<P>
 No slo se trata de que la ONU no debe estar metiendo las narices en todo,
sino que al hacerlo empeora la situacin. En lugar de ayudar a las naciones
a que encaren sus problemas, la ONU hace lo opuesto al crear desincentivos.
Cuando todo problema local y regional se convierte en uno mundial, nadie es
responsable. Al ser la responsabilidad de todos se convierte en la
responsabilidad de nadie.
<P>
La guerra en Bosnia es el ejemplo perfecto. Confrontar el genocidio y la
agresin de Serbia era una responsabilidad europea y de Estados Unidos. Pero
la administracin Clinton y sus aliados europeos pasaron la responsabilidad
a la ONU, la cual acept una misin imposible de cumplir. Las operaciones de
paz de la ONU fueron la excusa para la inaccin, por lo que murieron decenas
de miles de civiles inocentes, mientras la ONU con una combinacin de
impotencia y negligencia no hizo nada para detener el genocidio.
<P> 
La ONU tiende a complicar todo dando excusas para que intervengan naciones
sin inters en determinados problemas. Qu tienen que ver Togo, Zaire,
Panam, Irlanda y China con la paz en el Medio Oriente? Lo que la ONU logra
es darle cabida a muchos pases que nada  contribuyen a las discusiones.
Haciendo de cada asunto un problema mundial, la ONU intenta crear un mundo
que no existe. Vale la pena preservar una ONU consciente de sus
limitaciones, pero una ONU que insista en imponer a naciones soberanas su
visin utpica est pidiendo que la desmantelen.
<P>
 La reforma necesaria incluye reemplazar al secretario general por otro que
comience desde el primer da reduciendo la burocracia, limitando las
misiones y redefiniendo objetivos. Se requiere un recorte de no menos del
50% de la burocracia. Mientras esta permanezca seguir encontrando misiones
para justificar su existencia. Y hay que acabar con conferencias y comits
innecesarios.
<P>
 Por ejemplo, el gran logro del Comit para el Uso Pacfico del Espacio fue
aprobar la resolucin por la cual los estados miembros reportaran todos los
contactos con seres extraterrestres directamente al secretario general.
Adems de masivas y derrochadoras conferencias, como la de Beijing sobre las
mujeres, la ONU est todo el tiempo patrocinando reuniones y paneles de
discusin, 7.000 de estos en Ginebra el ao pasado.
<P> 
Tambin hay que revisar a fondo el presupuesto. El presupuesto que maneja
el secretario general hay que reducirlo de $1.000 millones a $250 millones.
As cada programa tendra que pasar el examen del mercado, al valorar cada
nacin los programas en que participar, diciendo cunto est dispuesta a
pagar. Continuaran los programas vitales, mientras desaparecen aquellos
favorecidos slo por la burocracia interna.
<P>
 El negocio de la paz es el que ms ha crecido, de $230 millones en 1988 a
$3.600 millones en 1996. Ahora "mantener la paz" tiene mltiples
significados, desde instrumentar elecciones y alimentar a los hambrientos
hasta construir naciones.
<P>
 Lleg la hora para un ultimtum de Estados Unidos: o se reforma rpida y
dramticamente a la ONU o nos retiramos. Sin esta amenaza, nada suceder.
Retener parte de las contribuciones no ha funcionado. No podemos llegar al
ao 2000 con la estructura actual. Claro que la ONU se opondr, lo mismo que
muchas de las naciones menos desarrolladas que se benefician del sistema
actual y ganan influencia vendiendo su soberana a la organizacin. Por
ello, la responsabilidad del prximo secretario general ser inmensa. Se
trata de una tarea gigantesca, pero de no lograrse, no vale la pena salvar a
la ONU y yo, entonces, estara a la cabeza del ataque para que Estados
Unidos se retire.

<H2>LAS REDUCCIONES DE PERSONAL</H2>
Walter Williams*<br>
<p>



FAIRFAX, VIRGINIA  (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).-- Una de las estrategias utilizadas por los que
quieren controlarnos la vida es inventar una crisis. Las reducciones de
personal por parte de las grandes empresas, que a menudo se denuncian en la
prensa, es un ejemplo de esa estrategia.<p>
	Pongamos tales reducciones en su perspectiva correcta, preguntando si ello
resulta favorable para el pas o si el gobierno debiera intervenir para
evitarlo.<p>
	Cuando naci este pas, 95% de la poblacin tena de alguna manera que ver
con la agricultura. Hoy apenas 2% labran la tierra. Tremenda reduccin de
personal, pero ha resultado malo para la nacin? Ha debido el Congreso, en
el pasado, tomar cartas en el asunto para evitar la prdida de puestos en el
campo?<p>
	Aos atrs, la construccin pesada, de ferrocarriles, carreteras, represas,
puentes y tneles requera cuadrillas de hombres con palas y picos. Hoy,
unos pocos y muy bien pagados operadores manejan inmensos y sofisticados
equipos, apretando botones y moviendo palancas, logrando hacer en un da lo
que cientos no lograban hacer antes. La tecnificacin de la construccin
destruy miles de puestos de trabajo. Qu ha debido hacer el gobierno para
evitarlo?<p>
	Son inevitables las reducciones de personal cuando las empresas encuentran
mtodos ms baratos de produccin. La mano de obra tiende a ser el elemento
ms costoso, por lo que hay incentivos econmicos para automatizar. Cuando
se utiliza menos personal, el personal sobrante encuentra ocupacin en otra
rea de la economa. Si no se hubieran logrado formas de ahorrar mano de
obra en la agricultura, de dnde hubiesen salido los trabajadores
necesarios para producir todos los dems bienes y servicios que han
contribuido a nuestra riqueza? Si el 95% estuviera todava ocupado en
producir alimentos, no habra tiempo para obtener la educacin y el
entrenamiento necesario para aumentar la productividad.<p>
	El ao pasado Wal-Mart contrat 41.000 nuevos empleados, Motorola 5.000,
Intel casi 10.000. De hecho se crearon 9,5 millones nuevos puestos en los
ltimo cuatro aos. Si IBM y AT&T no hubieran encontrado la manera de
utilizar menos personal, en dnde hubieran las otras compaas conseguido
los empleados? La alternativa hubiera sido que se dispararan los sueldos y,
por consiguiente, los precios.<p>
	En una economa robusta, dinmica y en crecimiento, siempre habr
alteraciones en el uso de la mano de obra. Unos puestos desaparecen y otros
se crean. La intervencin del gobierno en este proceso slo empobrece a la
nacin. Seramos ms pobres si se hubiese mantenido por decreto al cochero y
al vendedor de hielo.<p>
	Nada de esto niega que las reducciones de personal causan penuria,
especialmente entre los padres de familia que tienen que pagar la hipoteca
de su casa y vestir a los hijos. Muchos tienen que aprender otros oficios o
aceptar sueldos ms bajos. Pero una economa sana y robusta facilita esa
transicin, mientras que todo lo contrario sucede en economas con leyes que
"protegen" el empleo con toda clase de regulaciones.<p>
	En cualquier momento, la inmensa mayora est empleada. Debemos aceptar
que se debilite la economa, extinguiendo toda innovacin y progreso en
beneficio de un relativamente pequeo nmero de trabajadores que pierden su
empleo como resultado de adelantos tecnolgicos, cambios del mercado y
reestructuraciones de las empresas? Pienso que no.  <p>

<title>MEXICO: BUENAS Y MALAS PRIVATIZACIONES -- 11/14/96</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">

<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>November 14, 1996</i><br>
<h2>MEXICO: BUENAS Y MALAS PRIVATIZACIONES
</h2>
Erick Guerrero R.*<br>
<p>
CIUDAD DE MEXICO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Los escndalos de corrupcin, trfico de
influencias y favoritismo durante el sexenio del presidente Carlos Salinas
de Gortari han desprestigiado en Mxico lo que, en esencia, es un proceso
necesario tanto para equilibrar el presupuesto del gobierno como para elevar
la eficiencia de la economa. Las empresas estatales suelen ser monopolios y
sin competencia no hay eficiencia en la utilizacin de recursos escasos, por
lo que es necesaria su privatizacin.
<P>
Los idelogos de izquierda, enemigos de todo aquello que huela a libertad
econmica y gobierno limitado, han sabido aprovechar la situacin para
confundir a la opinin pblica y tratar de detener las reformas. Identificar
al mercantilismo como una consecuencia inevitable de la privatizacin es la
bandera enarbolada por muchos polticos pristas y lderes sindicales que
ven en las privatizaciones, la competencia y el libre mercado una amenaza a
sus intereses y privilegios.
<p>
En Mxico hoy todo es culpa del "neoliberalismo": la marginacin, la
pobreza, el desempleo, la destruccin ecolgica, la delincuencia. "Esta
forma de conducir el debate... es sumamente inconveniente e indebida... es
caer en una especie de oscurantismo; en la Edad media todos los males que
impedan el avance se los atribuan al Diablo y decan que por el Diablo
estaban mal las cosas... todo lo malo era culpa del Diablo; no se explicaban
en trminos de la falta de trabajo, de la falta de iniciativa, de la
prohibicin que haba para explotar las ideas... quienes etiquetan un
conjunto de polticas por medio de un calificativo como el de "neoliberal",
cometen el mismo error", dijo el presidente Ernesto Zedillo en una entrevista.
<p>
La verdad es que apartando la retrica demaggica, la venta de empresas
estatales es el mecanismo idneo para transformar ramas enteras de actividad
y mejorar la situacin econmica de familias y trabajadores. As lo
comprueba la privatizacin de la industria siderrgica mexicana. A partir de
su venta al sector privado en 1991, el desempeo de la industria mejor
notablemente.
<p>
"La reorganizacin administrativa de las empresas acereras, la
modernizacin de sus plantas, la reduccin de los problemas laborales, el
aumento de las exportaciones y los montos de inversin realizados en los
ltimos aos, ejemplifican cmo una industria que en algn momento se
consider vieja, de bajo rendimiento y condenada a un deterioro permanente,
puede desarrollar un gran potencial a partir del esfuerzo de sus
propietarios y trabajadores, en un ambiente de intensa competencia local y
con el resto del mundo", afirma un estudio del CEESP.
<p>
Como casi todas las reas industriales que permanecen por largo tiempo en
manos del gobierno, la industria siderrgica fue dejada prcticamente en
ruinas. A pesar de que las siderrgicas oficiales reciban grandes
subsidios, crditos "blandos", fuertes descuentos en la compra de materias
primas, proteccin frente a competidores extranjeros, tanto los ndices de
productividad como los mrgenes de utilidad eran muy bajos, los conflictos
laborales iban en aumento y la calidad del producto dejaba mucho que desear.
<p>
Los sntomas eran los mismos sufridos por todas las paraestatales:
tecnologa obsoleta,  la falta de mantenimiento aumentaba el nmero de
accidentes y reduca la produccin. Haba una plantilla laboral excesiva: la
industria siderrgica paraestatal empleaba a 40 mil obreros para producir
7,5 millones de toneladas de acero, lo que daba una relacin de 190
toneladas por ao/hombre, contra 270 toneladas en Estados Unidos,  459
toneladas en Japn y 677 toneladas en Corea del Sur. La poltica de control
de precios aplicada por las autoridades descapitaliz a la industria y el
gobierno tuvo que declarar en quiebra a Fundidora Monterrey, una de las ms
importantes.
<p>
Para ser rescatada, se requera invertir $2,500 millones y en agosto de
1990 fue anunciada su privatizacin. A diferencia de lo que ocurri en otros
casos, el gobierno no busc obtener el precio mximo garantizndole conceder
un monopolio a un selecto grupo de inversionistas privilegiados sino que se
preocup realmente por modernizar la industria. Las empresas siderrgicas
fueron vendidas en poco ms de $1.500 millones, cantidad muy inferior a su
valor contable. Como no hubo componendas ni compromisos de tipo poltico, el
gobierno abri fronteras a la competencia extranjera, derribando aranceles y
dems protecciones. A casi seis aos, la transformacin ha sido total.
<p>
Las siderrgicas privadas mexicanas invirtieron ms de $3.000 millones en
modernizar sus plantas; al mismo tiempo que redujeron su personal a la mitad
-a 20 mil trabajadores-, duplicaron sus ndices de productividad, lo cual
les permiti formar importantes alianzas estratgicas con empresas
transnacionales en materia comercial y tecnolgica. En medio de la crisis
ms grave de los ltimos 64 aos, las maquiladoras y la industria
siderrgica fueron las nicas que mostraron crecimiento. En cuestin de
calidad, las empresas han obtenido la certificacin ISO-9000, lo que les
abri mercados en 40 pases de los cinco continentes.
<p>
As pues, tras la retrica antiprivatizadora no hay ms que una profunda
confusin e incapacidad en reconocer el verdadero origen del mercantilismo,
la corrupcin, el monopolio y el fraude. Esos males no son productos del
libre mercado sino del estatismo y del exceso de poder que concentran
funcionarios y polticos.

<h2>
EL SUICIDIO DE UN ALMIRANTE
</h2>
Carlos A. Ball*
<P>
MIAMI <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Algo anda muy mal, cuando se pega un tiro el comandante en
jefe de operaciones navales de Estados Unidos, responsable por un milln de
uniformados. Los debiluchos de carcter e inseguros de s mismo no alcanzan
esas posiciones y el historial del almirante Jeremy (Mike) Boorda indica
todo lo contrario. Se trataba de un hombre excepcional, el primero en la
armada de este pas que comenz como simple recluta para alcanzar la ms
alta posicin de las fuerzas navales.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;La noticia del jueves 16 de mayo fue que el almirante de 57 aos se haba
suicidado en su casa, dejando una corta nota dirigida "a los marineros",
cuyo texto no ha sido todava revelado. La razn dada fue el acoso
periodstico por parte de la revista Newsweek que cuestionaba la utilizacin
de dos diminutas letras "v" (por valor en combate) en un par de
condecoraciones de Vietnam, cuando Boorda tena el rango de teniente. En
efecto, esa tarde estaba pactada la entrevista -nunca efectuada- con un
reportero de la revista en su despacho, pero se debe aclarar que su
comandante en Vietnam, el almirante Elmo Zumwalt, afirm que Mike Boorda s
tena derecho a lucir esas condecoraciones. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Se trata del ms dramtico acontecimiento en una escalada de ataques contra
la naval que comenz con la ya famosa convencin Tailhook de aviadores de la
armada en 1991, donde luego de seminarios y conferencias sobre temas navales
un grupo de oficiales de ambos sexos terminaron en borracheras y orgas. El
escndalo fue magnificado por las fuerzas feministas que consideran la
cultura de "hombres machos" que predomina en la naval como algo con lo cual
hay que terminar, de manera que las mujeres puedan gozar de algn tipo de
"accin afirmativa" dentro de la armada que les asegure compartir las ms
altas posiciones en responsabilidad y en combate. Las feministas
consiguieron todo el apoyo de las altas esferas polticas en Washington, lo
cual convirti un incidente lamentable en la mayor derrota sufrida por la
marina de Estados Unidos desde la Segunda Guerra, costndole la carrera a
docenas de distinguidos oficiales a quienes ni siquiera se les comprob
haber tomado parte en la fiesta.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Una de las vctimas de Tailhook fue el antecesor del almirante Boorda, a
quin se oblig a adelantar su jubilacin. Se trat de una cacera de
brujas, donde los condenados no tuvieron la oportunidad de defenderse y la
hoja de servicio de valientes oficiales que dieron los mejores aos de su
vida a la defensa de la patria fue emborronada y destruida por las fuerzas
predominantes de la "poltica correcta", para quienes ser homosexual es "un
estilo de vida", pero silbarle a una mujer bonita es imperdonable.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dos de los hijos y una nuera del almirante Boorda son oficiales navales.
John Lehman, Secretario de la Naval en tiempos de Reagan, mantiene que Mike
Boorda fue "acorralado y linchado por una turba". Lo preocupante es que
muchos de aquellos sucios y melenudos pacifistas de los aos 60 hoy tienen
cargos claves en el gobierno del presidente Bill Clinton, quien en su
juventud presuma de "odiar" a los militares. Segn Lehman, los que hasta
hace unos das difamaban al almirante Boorda son los mismos que antes
alababan la economa sovitica, culpaban a Estados Unidos de la Guerra Fra
y despotricaban contra los esfuerzos del presidente Reagan en construir la
armada ms efectiva y poderosa de la historia de la humanidad, capaz de
mantener la paz.&copy;<p>

<H2>EL DEPORTE COMO MAESTRO</H2>
Michael Novak*<br>
<p>



WASHINGTON  (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--  No es fcil ser buena gente. Honestidad, lealtad,
auto-control, disciplina y consistencia son atributos que tienen que
aprenderse para tener una buena y exitosa vida. Son tambin las cosas que
distinguen a los buenos atletas. Por eso las historias de dedicacin al
trabajo, determinacin, saber aguantar derrotas y no perder la cabeza con el
xito son parte del buen camino.<p>
	Los atletas tienen que aprender a aceptar derrotas. Hay que aguantar el
calambre en la pierna y sobreponerse a las preocupaciones. El campen
triunfa sobre las presiones. De esa manera los deportes nos ensean a vivir.
Nos entrenan a cumplir con nuestras obligaciones y a obedecer rdenes. Pero
hay ms en la vida moral que eso y el deporte nos da la visin grande. El
deporte nos entrena a dominarnos. Aprendemos a fomentar nuestras habilidades
y a controlar nuestros hbitos, a darle la cara a retos difciles y a
convertirnos en mejores personas.<p>
	Lo esencial para convertirnos en personas morales es hacer el bien en forma
natural. Hacer las cosas bien, como parte de nuestra propia naturaleza. Eso
implica esfuerzo y dedicacin. A menudo se comienza cambiando nuestra
actitud y buscando motivacin. Uno debe querer cambiar y estar dispuesto a
trabajar por conseguir pequeas mejoras constantemente, a travs de mucho
tiempo.<p>
	En cierta forma, los deportes ensean mejor la moral que las leyes. Con
demarcaciones, las leyes definen lo que no se puede hacer y, en ciertas
ocasiones, tambin definen lo que s se puede hacer, al prescribir las
reglas. En el deporte tambin se tienen que aprender las reglas. Pero un
buen deportista tiene que ir mucho ms lejos, tiene que aadir fortaleza,
exactitud y gracia.<p>
	Y hay otros aspectos morales en el deporte. El deporte es esencialmente
competitivo y el deportista con suerte es el que se enfrenta a otros grandes
atletas que lo empujarn a alcanzar lo ms alto, de otra forma nunca
averiguara cun grande hubiera podido ser. Cuando no hay necesidad de
herosmo, no surgen hroes.<p>
	Algo parecido sucede en la vida moral. Hasta que no confrontamos un grave
problema no se prueban nuestras virtudes. Entonces es que nos enteramos de
lo que la fuerza moral significa y si la tenemos o no.<p>
	Las olimpadas nos recuerdan la tradicin moral del deporte. Los griegos no
las concibieron simplemente como un gran espectculo de entretenimiento.
Estaban ms bien calibrando virtudes, hbitos productivos, logros; eran ms
una exhibicin de la belleza del espritu humano que alguna distorsin
muscular del cuerpo. An hoy en da las olimpadas siguen siendo una
celebracin del espritu y de los valores clsicos.<p>
	Me pregunto qu haramos por la educacin moral de nuestros nios si no
existieran los deportes. En qu otra actividad los jvenes de hoy aprenden
a resistir el dolor y la derrota? Dnde ms se esfuerzan por alcanzar
perfeccin? Algunas veces se fajan a trabajar en sus estudios, pero a menudo
hacen el mnimo posible. Y en cuanto a las obligaciones y trabajos en la
casa, en la vida moderna no tienen la urgencia de antes y es realmente poco
lo que ayudan. Pero en los deportes aoran hacerlo bien. Es bello verlo.
Nunca vi a mis hijos con caras ms serias que cuando estaban compitiendo en
algn deporte.<p>
	Vale la pena tomar el deporte en serio. Cualquier labor que busca alcanzar
la excelencia ofrece un estupendo objetivo. No es fcil mantener presentes
las lecciones aprendidas en el deporte durante el resto de nuestras vidas,
pero cunto ms pobres seramos si no tuviramos al deporte como maestro. <p>

<h2>
LA LIBERTAD ECONOMICA ESTIMULA EL CRECIMIENTO
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
spanbio
.html">
Gary S. Becker*
</a>

<P>
CHICAGO (AIPE).- El colapso del comunismo y el xito  de los Tigres del
Asia estimularon un movimiento mundial hacia la privatizacin y la
desregulacin, ya que estos sucesos parecen indicar que la libertad
econmica es mucho ms efectiva que el control gubernamental en promover el
crecimiento. Los revisionistas han cuestionado tal conclusin, pero esta
recibi un resonante apoyo de parte de un importante estudio publicado por
tres economistas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La obra Libertad Econmica en el Mundo utiliza 17 clasificaciones para
evaluar el grado de libertad en los ltimos 20 aos en ms de 100 pases.
Los autores estimaron la restriccin a transacciones internacionales en
bienes y flujos de capital, los controles de precios, la incidencia de
empresas estatales, la importancia de subsidios y transferencias
gubernamentales, los niveles de impuestos, la libertad de mantener fondos en
el extranjero y la inflacin. Estos factores fueron, a la vez, combinados en
ndices de libertad econmica que clasifican a las naciones y muestran los
cambios registrados desde 1975.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Estos ndices aportan la ms convincente evidencia de que las naciones no
crecen sin considerable libertad econmica. El producto bruto per cpita de
las 10 naciones con ms libertad econmica aument en promedio a razn de
2,3% por ao entre 1980 y 1984, comparado con un miserable crecimiento de
1,3% en los 27 pases menos libres. Mientras ms libertad, mayor tendencia a
un rpido crecimiento.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	El ingreso real per cpita tiende tambin a ser mucho ms alto en los
pases con mayor libertad econmica. La media docena de pases ms libres
gozan de varias veces el ingreso per cpita de aquellos clasificados en el
medio y de ms de 20 veces que los menos libres. Se  muestra porqu muchos
de los pases africanos ocupan las ltimas 20 posiciones. Los apologistas
culpan a la dominacin colonial por el mal expediente de Africa, pero esa no
es la razn principal. Por el contrario, luego de la independencia muchas
naciones africanas imitaron el camino errado de los pases comunistas y
socialistas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Como muchas naciones mantuvieron una clasificacin de libertad estable en
los ltimos 20 aos, los resultados de aquellos que abrieron sus economas
son especialmente ilustrativos. La produccin de los 10 pases con el mayor
crecimiento de libertad econmica alcanz un crecimiento promedio de 2,7%
entre 1980 y 1994, mientras que las que ms restringieron la libertad
econmica sufrieron un crecimiento negativo. Chile, Portugal, Paquistn y
Mauritania, los cuatro pases en desarrollo con mayor aumento de libertad
econmica, crecieron mucho ms que los cuatro pases en desarrollo que
sufrieron aumentos en la intervencin gubernamental: Honduras, Irn,
Nicaragua y Venezuela.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Un creciente nmero de economistas niegan que el rpido crecimiento de las
economas asiticas comprueban la importancia de la libertad econmica,
indicando que sus gobiernos dirigen la actividad econmica. Indican que
Corea utiliz a los bancos estatales para aportar capital subsidiado a las
grandes empresas, que Taiwan controlaba las importaciones y los mercados
financieros, y que Singapur subsidiaba las inversiones extranjeras.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Sin embargo, estos nuevos ndices confirman que a pesar de tales
intervenciones, las economas en Asia han sido mucho ms libres que en otras
partes. Ocupan los primeros puestos en la clasificacin: Hong Kong es N 1,
Singapur N 3 y Japn N10. An Taiwan y Corea del Sur (nmeros 16 y 20)
gozan de libertad de comercio comparados con el resto del mundo.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lamentablemente, los polticos pocas veces estn dispuestos a tomar
medidas impopulares en la reduccin de la intervencin gubernamental. A
pesar de las altas tasas de desempleo en Europa occidental, pases como
Francia y Alemania han hecho muy poco por desregular, aparentemente porque
temen la reaccin de los electores.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Este nuevo estudio aporta evidencias persuasivas de que la libertad
econmica es esencial para el crecimiento econmico. Ciertos pases sufren
innecesariamente porque no se permite el florecimiento de su energa e
imaginacin, en un ambiente de libertad.

<H2>MEXICO: EL DEBATE ECONOMICO</H2>
Roberto Salinas-Len*<br>
<p>



CIUDAD DE MEXICO  (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).-- El llamado del presidente Zedillo a un debate
sobre la poltica econmica ha generado gran polmica sobre si se debe
cambiar el modelo y en cuanto a la participacin del Estado. Hay tres
aspectos del debate que son fundamentales: el crecimiento, la poltica
monetaria y la estructura institucional de la economa. 
No hay inconsistencia entre el llamado a debatir la poltica econmica y las
declaraciones presidenciales de que "no habr cambio en el modelo". Zedillo
tiene toda la razn; no puede haber un retorno al estatismo y al
proteccionismo, por ms que decirlo ofenda sensibilidades de aquellos que
persisten bajo la ilusin que el intervencionismo del Estado es la solucin
a los problemas de Mxico.<p>
	El hecho que la liberalizacin sea el nico camino viable no implica que no
haya elementos de estrategia econmica abiertos a debate. No es el fondo (el
qu), sino la forma (el cmo) lo que se pretende debatir.<p>
	La primera dimensin del debate, el crecimiento, es un caso dramtico por
las grandes diferencias que persisten en cuanto a poltica econmica. Por un
lado se discute si la economa va bien o mal, a la vez de cmo acelerar el
crecimiento vis-a-vis el proceso de abatir la inflacin. Por otro lado, se
contemplan los mecanismos radicales necesarios para lograr un alto
crecimiento de la economa. El gobierno mexicano plantea una tasa de
crecimiento anual de 5%; y si bien tal nivel es apenas suficiente para
generar los empleos que la fuerza laboral requiere, es ciertamente
insuficiente para superar el subdesarrollo. Por lo tanto, el debate debe
contemplar estrategias que permitan alcanzar un crecimiento sostenido de 8%
anual, congruente con la estabilidad de precios.<p>
	Sin embargo, entre los protagonistas de la poltica econmica se escuchan
diferentes versiones. El Banco de Mxico mantiene que la prioridad es bajar
la inflacin, mientras que otros, por la desesperacin de lograr la
reactivacin de la planta productiva, afirman que el crecimiento debe ser la
meta principal del gobierno. Muchos interpretan esa disyuntiva como una
lucha entre los obsesionados con la estabilidad de precios (inflacin baja,
a pesar de bajo crecimiento), y aquellos obsesionados con el crecimiento
(alto crecimiento, a pesar de alta inflacin). <p>
	Pero se trata de una disyuntiva falsa porque los objetivos se pueden
combinar. Tenemos que reducir la inflacin y simultneamente lograr un alto
crecimiento econmico. No se trata de abatir la inflacin a costa del
crecimiento y empleo ni de aumentar estos en perjuicio de la estabilidad de
precios. Hay que aumentar el nivel de vida y ello requiere alto crecimiento,
sano y sostenido.<p>
	La segunda dimensin del debate, la poltica monetaria, surge de la
necesidad de preservar el valor de la moneda. De lo contrario no hay ahorro.
Nos hemos comprometido en un sistema de flotacin, pero no se ha definido la
ruta cambiaria.<p>
	La tercera dimensin del debate es la estructura de incentivos a adoptarse
en la economa. Nuestro subdesarrollo es en gran medida por la ausencia de
un sistema de derechos de propiedad bien definidos. No contamos con
instituciones imparciales que aseguren el cumplimiento de contratos,
derechos de propiedad confiables o que nos permitan derivar todos los
beneficios del intercambio de bienes, debido a los altos costos de
transaccin impuestos por un exagerado intervencionismo del Estado en la
actividad econmica.<p> 
      	En los ltimos 15 aos, la economa mexicana ha crecido al raqutico
promedio anual de 1,9%. Y el nivel de vida ha cado dramticamente, ya que
se trata de un perodo donde aumentos bruscos de la inflacin fueron la
regla, no la excepcin. La explicacin fundamental de este escenario de
"estanflacion" (inflacin combinada con recesin) son nuestras muy poco
confiables instituciones y las psimas polticas econmicas. Por todo ello,
es importante abrir el debate sobre  los detalles de la poltica econmica
nacional. <p>

<h2>
LA INEFICAZ ESTRATEGIA CONTRA LAS DROGAS 
</h2>     
     
     
Agustn Navarro*
<p>

CIUDAD DE MEXICO <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- En 1919 fue ratificada la enmienda 18 de la
Constitucin de Estados Unidos, conocida como la "Ley de la Prohibicin" de
licores. La aplicacin de esa ley fue desastrosa en trminos de corrupcin y
florecimiento del crimen organizado hasta su derogacin en 1933. Los
efectos antisociales que tuvo la prohibicin del licor se asemejan a los que
enfrentamos hoy con las drogas. Las autoridades internacionales, encabezadas
y presionadas por el gobierno de Estados Unidos, estn concentradas en su
prohibicin al costo que sea, tanto poltico, econmico o social. El
fundamento conceptual es que ciertas drogas  -arbitrariamente seleccionadas-
son ilegales y sujetas a una persecucin implacable.
<dd>	Se argumenta que las drogas son perjudiciales y por tanto se debe evitar su
uso. Fuera de la consideracin bsica sobre quin tiene derecho a
determinar coercitivamente qu debe o no autoadministrarse un mayor de
edad?, conviene distinguir entre el uso y el abuso. Hasta los alimentos
pueden ser muy perjudiciales si se abusa de ellos. Por tanto, el simple uso
no es una justificacin suficiente para considerar algo ilegal y prohibirlo. 
Para demostrar lo anterior y exponer el grave error conceptual comparo tres
alcaloides (drogas): la nicotina, la cafena y la cocana (dos legales y una
ilegal), que comprueba la arbitrariedad oficial en su clasificacin.
<dd>	La nicotina es un alcaloide lquido muy alcalino que se obtiene de las
hojas del tabaco y es una de las drogas ms txicas que existen. Acta con
una rapidez comparable a la del cianuro de potasio. La dosis letal de
nicotina es de alrededor de 60 mg. y dosis tan pequeas como 4 mg. pueden
producir sntomas alarmantes en individuos no habituados. A pesar de que un
cigarro puede contener hasta 30 mg., la inhalacin de nicotina no resulta
tan txica como se esperara y son las secuelas del tabaquismo las ms
dainas. La nicotina produce al principio efectos estimulantes (disminuye el
aletargamiento y la fatiga) y posteriormente deprime el sistema nervioso,
mediante bloqueo neuromuscular sobre el sistema cardiovascular y
respiratorio. Tiene efectos antidiurticos severos, induce la liberacin de
adrenalina, produciendo excitacin, temblores y convulsiones, hipertensin
arterial, taquicardia, vasoconstriccin y aumento del flujo coronario.
Incrementa la secrecin bronquial y salival. Produce diarrea, nusea y
vmito. Su uso frecuente crea hbito y tolerancia. 
<dd>	La cafena es un alcaloide soluble del grupo de las xantinas que se
encuentra en distintas variedades de los frutos y semillas de las plantas
del caf, t, cacao, mate y en refrescos de cola. Es un poderoso estimulante
del sistema nervioso central. Mejora la asociacin de ideas y el flujo en el
pensamiento. Es un estimulante vasomotor y un potente diurtico, que tambin
contrae al msculo cardiaco y relaja al msculo liso bronquial e intestinal.
En dosis altas de cafena predomina la vasodilatacin perifrica sobre la
vasoconstriccin coronaria y pulmonar. Sin embargo, disminuye el flujo
sanguneo cerebral por el aumento de la resistencia circulatoria. Tambin
acorta el tiempo de coagulacin. La dosis txica fatal humana es de 10 gr.
Sin embargo, los sntomas de toxicidad (insomnio, excitacin, inquietud,
trastornos sensoriales en odo y visin, tensin y temblores musculares,
taquicardia, palpitaciones y aumento en el ritmo respiratorio) ya se
presentan a partir de ingestiones de 1 gr. Su uso frecuente crea hbito y
tolerancia. El t negro tiene un 2% de cafena, una taza de caf tiene entre
100 a 150 mg. de cafena y en individuos no habituados una sola taza puede
producir efectos txicos. 
<dd>	La cocana es un alcaloide que se obtiene de las hojas de la coca, que
contienen entre un 0,6% a 1,8% de este anestsico local que bloquea la
conduccin nerviosa en donde se aplica y que tiene un importante efecto
colateral como estimulante del sistema nervioso central, produciendo
inquietud, excitabilidad y locuacidad. Aumenta la capacidad del trabajo
muscular, disminuyendo la fatiga y acelerando el ritmo respiratorio. A la
estimulacin central le sigue una depresin. Su uso frecuente crea hbito.
Produce taquicardia, vasoconstriccin, aumento de la temperatura, dilatacin
de la pupilas. Se absorbe en todos los sitios de aplicacin, incluso  en las
mucosas. Ingerida, la cocana se hidroliza y es inefectiva. Se destruye
(metaboliza) ms rpidamente que la mayora de los alcaloides. La dosis
fatal es de aproximadamente 1,2 gr. Sin embargo, en individuos no
habituados, dosis desde 20 mg. tienen efectos txicos.
<dd>	An sin entrar a comparar drogas como el alcohol y la marihuana, no son
vlidos los argumentos de toxicidad de unas sustancias o siquiera el de la
letalidad de las dosis para hacer ilegales a unas drogas (cocana) y a otras
no (nicotina y cafena). El abuso del alcohol (droga legal) est ms
asociado a criminalidad, accidentes, destruccin familiar y dao corporal
que consumir marihuana (droga ilegal). Toda esta ingeniera burocrtica
prohibicionista se ha hecho para sustentar ese fundamentalismo
anticientfico que prevalece en la legislacin antidrogas y continuar
justificando que las drogas son un problema legal y criminal, en vez de uno
de salud pblica, de medicina y educacin preventiva, formas mucho ms
adecuadas para disminuir su uso y especialmente su abuso.
<dd>	Se han llenado las crceles de todos nuestros pases de presos por "delitos
contra la salud" (en California ms del 85%) y Estados Unidos ya ha gastado
ms de $150,000 millones en esta guerra santa, pero el narcotrfico y la
corrupcin siguen aumentando. Parecera  que los zares antidrogas y los
nuevos Elliot Ness esperan que se contaminen las fuerzas armadas de nuestros
pases para intervenir en forma directa como ocurri en Panam y que
nuestros sistemas bancarios, financieros y empresariales se vean inundados y
controlados por el dinero lavado No es, acaso, la ayuda tecnolgica y
financiera antidrogas la nueva "zanahoria" y el nuevo "garrote" que
condicionan el otorgamiento unilateral de la "Certificacin"? 
<dd>	Hay muchas formas de lucrar con las drogas. El crimen organizado -tanto en
su versin gangsteril y violenta, como en la de traje y corbata- bien sabe
que las dificultades impuestas slo aumentan sus mrgenes de
comercializacin. Pero hay otros "sepulcros blanqueados" que tambin lucran
desde la burocracia, con un puritanismo anticientfico y un fundamentalismo
casi religioso, combatiendo a las drogas en forma tal que nunca se resuelva
el problema y si se empeora, mejor para sus intereses personales.  
<dd>	Utilizar con propsitos comparativos la nicotina y la cafena no insina su
criminalizacin, sino probar lo discrecional y arbitrario de la
clasificacin actual de las drogas. Uno de los grandes placeres de la vida
es tomarse un buen caf  y  fumarse un buen tabaco. &copy;

<title>EL CANCER DE LA CORRUPCION -- 11/14/96</title>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>November 14, 1996</i><br>
<h2>EL CANCER DE LA CORRUPCION
</h2>
Carlos Boloa B.*<br>
<p>
LIMA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Defino la corrupcin como "el uso del poder pblico para el
enriquecimiento privado". Ciertamente que los beneficios obtenidos
ilcitamente pueden tomar la forma de dividendos polticos, pero en este
artculo centrar la atencin en las causas y consecuencias de sus
beneficios econmicos.
<P>
La tentacin de incurrir en corrupcin depende de tres variables: 
<ol>
<li>El monto de las transacciones econmicas en las que participa el funcionario;
<li>Su duracin en el cargo; y, 
<li>La sofisticacin y complejidad de los servicios pblicos en cuya provisin participa. 
</ol>
As es que la corrupcin
suele ser mayor en las compras de armamentos y pertrechos militares; en
segundo lugar, en las compras de bienes de capital; luego, en los contratos
de ingeniera civil y compras de productos; y, finalmente, en los honorarios
por consultoras.
<p>
La corrupcin es tan antigua como la institucin del gobierno y hoy en da
es un fenmeno global, cuyo monto se estima alcanza la cifra de tres
millones de millones de dlares. Ningn pas se puede considerar libre del
mal, aunque no todos lo padecen en iguales dimensiones: la corrupcin es ms
comn en naciones con regmenes de gobierno arbitrarios, autoritarios y de
planificacin centralizada.
<p>
La necesidad de combatir la corrupcin es insoslayable, puesto tiene efectos
perversos para la vida en sociedad: socava las bases morales de la
democracia y de la economa de mercado al introducir distorsiones en la
informacin y el conocimiento que se deberan transmitir a travs de la
libre competencia de bienes y servicios polticos y econmicos. Por ello, la
corrupcin empobrece. Est demostrado que los pases que cultivan normas de
tica y moral elevados terminan creciendo ms. Un informe reciente estima en
$20 mil millones las cuentas en bancos suizos de lderes africanos.
Adems, la corrupcin genera ineficiencia en trminos de prdida o de mala
asignacin de los recursos productivos de una sociedad. Algunos estudios
sealan que los montos destinados a la corrupcin pueden representar desde
2% hasta ms de 50% de los costos totales de los bienes y servicios que
producen las naciones.
<p>
La corrupcin no slo afecta el crecimiento sino tambin a la equidad. A
travs de ella, los privilegiados se benefician de las operaciones y
transacciones corruptas a expensas de los pobres. De esta manera, se crea un
gobierno ineficaz cuyo nico objetivo es seguir corrompiendo para mantenerse
en el poder, dejando de lado las prcticas del "buen gobierno" y generando
inestabilidad poltica.
<p>
La falta de limitaciones al poder ejercido por diferentes dependencias
gubernamentales contribuye a una deficiente rendicin de cuentas y la
corrupcin infringe un grave y profundo dao moral a los ciudadanos al
premiar la conducta ilcita y castigar la honesta. Con ello genera un
ambiente de cinismo que, al difundirse, provoca la alienacin y la apata
ciudadanas.
<p>
La ecuacin de la corrupcin es la siguiente: Corrupcin = Monopolio +
Arbitrariedad - Transparencia.
<p>
La corrupcin surge de los monopolios artificiales, cuando existe
arbitrariedad o discrecionalidad sin lmites y cuando no existe
transparencia en el proceso de toma de decisiones. Por tanto, a mayor grado
de arbitrariedad y a menor grado de transparencia, mayor ser el nivel de
corrupcin.
<p>
La mala organizacin del Poder Pblico es una fuente segura de corrupcin.
Cuando los Poderes del Estado funcionan sin independencia entre s, abundan
las tentaciones de corrupcin. En ms de un pas latinoamericano, por
ejemplo, el Poder Legislativo le cobra favores polticos al Poder Judicial,
quien, entonces, no lo controla ni fiscaliza.
<p>
La pregunta es cmo reducir la corrupcin. Si se eliminan los monopolios se
reduce la arbitrariedad y se incrementa la transparencia, permitiendo as
combatir eficazmente la corrupcin. Entre las medidas concretas para lograrlo:
<ul>
<li>Aplicar cabalmente las instituciones de la economa de mercado y el Estado de Derecho, reduciendo el intervencionismo estatal en la economa.
<li>Establecer reglas generales, iguales para todos. Un arancel uniforme, sin exoneraciones, y un impuesto general a las ventas uniforme, sin excepciones, contribuiran a disminuirla.
<li>Fomentar la transparencia en las operaciones del gobierno. Convocar, por ejemplo,  licitaciones con supervisin internacional y publicacin de resultados.
<li>Simplificar al mximo los trmites administrativos.
<li>Concientizar a la ciudadana, puesto que la educacin es la clave de la transparencia.
<li>Encarcelar a algunos cuantos "peces gordos" de la corrupcin para que sirva de ejemplo y escarmiento.
<li>Crear una carrera administrativa seria, que acabe con la politiquera y el compadrazgo.
<li>Subir los costos y reducir los beneficios de la corrupcin, para demostrar que la honradez es rentable y que el ser honesto rinde sus beneficios.
<li>Aprobar normas de conducta que promuevan la rendicin de cuentas, abriendo los estados financieros de las empresas que hagan contribuciones a partidos polticos.
<li>Crear una Comisin Independiente contra la Corrupcin, bajo un esquema parecido al de Hong Kong, uno de los pocos pases que ha avanzado consistentemente en este terreno.
</ul>
Para sacar adelante estas medidas, se requerir de una frrea voluntad
poltica y de un poder moral vigoroso, que congregue a todos los sectores de
la opinin pblica.

<h2>
ARGENTINA: PENSIONADOS POR MELANCOLIA
</h2>
Martin Krause*
<p>
BUENOS AIRES <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- 	Hay descubrimientos  que nos llenan de estupor o
asombro, otros no causan la menor sorpresa. En esta ltima categora se
encuentran los recientes anuncios acerca de la situacin del sistema
jubilatorio estatal argentino. 	
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Afectado por un enorme deficit que lo lleva a mostrar sus cuentas en rojo en
forma permanente, el gobierno decidi contratar a un reconocido
administrador de uno de los grupos empresariales ms importantes del pas
para que evaluara la gestin del sistema y presentara recomendaciones. Ahora
este experto ha dado a conocer su informe en el cual incluye, entre otras
cosas, las siguientes joyas burocrticas:
<p> Cinco personas, en la ciudad de La Plata, fueron jubiladas por estar
afectadas de melancola. 
<p> Hay 28.000 jubilaciones de fallecidos que se siguen pagando. 
<p> Supuestamente hay unos 4.500 ancianos de ms de 100 aos de edad cobrando
sus beneficios previsionales, cuya existencia no ha sido constatada por nadie. 
<p> Hay expedientes de jubilados con domicilios en lugares inexistentes; por
ejemplo, en el cruce de dos calles de la ciudad de Buenos que son paralelas.
<p> La Administracin Nacional de la Seguridad Social (Anses)  tiene 15
edificios en Buenos Aires destinados al archivo de expedientes. 
<p> Todava hay regmenes jubilatorios especiales que cubren a "enlazadores de
perros" y "conductores de perreras" que se retiran a los 55 aos, igual que
los zapateros y las bailarinas del Teatro Coln que son jubilados a los 40
aos de edad, mientras que para el resto de los ciudadanos se aplica el
mnimo de 65 aos. 
<p> Los abogados de Anses no se molestan en presentarse en las audiencias
judiciales u olvidan citaciones, con lo cual no es de extraar que la
institucin suele perder todos los juicios.
<p> Hay 138.056 demandas pendientes en los tribunales por ms de $ 2.400
millones de dlares. 
<p> Se han descubierto jubilaciones otorgadas a personas con apenas 3 o 5 aos
de aportes.
<p> En Tucumn lograron su jubilacin 30 personas presentando el mismo
electrocardiograma.<p>
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
La razn de todo esto no es que los funcionarios pblicos son ms flojos o
ms brutos que el resto de la humanidad, sino que no tienen ningn incentivo
para llevar a cabo una eficiente administracin de lo recursos. Todos sus
incentivos apuntan hacia no hacer olas, mantener el cargo, ganar puntos con
sus superiores polticos y acumular poder a travs de mayores presupuestos. 
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sin embargo, Argentina ha realizado una reforma del sistema previsional en
la cual se ha creado un nuevo rgimen paralelo y privado de capitalizacin
individual, el cual se desenvuelve con notable xito. Pero a diferencia de
la reforma implementada en Chile, aqu se mantiene el sistema estatal de
reparto como jubilacin mnima, en vez de eliminarlo con el transcurso del
tiempo como estn haciendo los chilenos.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Mantener  paralelamente el viejo sistema politizado significa mantener
todos los incentivos para que las situaciones ahora denunciadas sigan
generndose. Podr realizarse una limpieza, reformular la estructura,
modificar los procedimientos, pero seguir siendo manejado por gente cuya
eficiencia no es premiada ni su ineficiencia castigada, como sucede en el
sector privado, a travs del simple y claro mecanismo de las ganancias y las
prdidas. Los millones que se gastarn en la reorganizacin del sistema
seran mejor invertidos en su eliminacin total.

COLERA Y EL IMPERIALISMO SANITARIO

<P>
LIMA (AIPE).- En enero de 1991 se declar una epidemia de clera en el Per
que le cost la vida a cerca de 20.000 personas en cinco aos y afect a
otras 310.000. La epidemia se propag por 14 pases del continente americano
hasta llegar a convertirse, segn la Organizacin Mundial de la Salud, en la
sptima pandemia ms letal de este siglo.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	Pese a su virulencia, las causas de esta epidemia han estado rodeadas de
un sospechoso misterio. Generalmente se asocian con la ingestin de pescado
contaminado en algunos puertos peruanos del Pacfico, especficamente
Chimbote y Chancay, donde empez la epidemia. Se sealan como causas tambin
la insuficiencia de servicios de agua potable y defectos en la red que la
provee.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Ello no obstante, las ms recientes investigaciones revelan un hecho
aterrador. Al parecer, la causa del clera fue la reduccin de la cantidad
de cloro en el agua dispuesta por el gobierno peruano como consecuencia de
los consejos de la Agencia de Proteccin Ambiental de Estados Unidos (EPA,
por sus siglas en ingls).
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Segn un informe de la Organizacin Panamericana de la Salud,
aparentemente se habra reducido a 0,2 miligramos por litro la cantidad de
cloro que los acueductos peruanos aadan al agua. El promedio internacional
ponderado es de 0,3 miligramos por litro. Como el Per no se encuentra en la
media de salubridad y su infraestructura sanitaria es deficiente, el nivel
ptimo hubiera estado ms bien entre 0,35 y 0,4 miligramos por litro. Sin
embargo, como los grupos ecolgicos han persuadido a la EPA de que el cloro
causa cncer, especialmente cuando se descompone en trialometanos al
contacto con materia orgnica, la autoridades estadounidenses recomiendan
una reduccin del cloro.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Tratando de colocarse a la vanguardia de la tecnologa, los burcratas
peruanos habran seguido la recomendacin de los ambientalistas durante
1990, creando una reduccin de la barrera qumica contra las enfermedades en
el agua potable, de suerte que en enero de 1991 se declar la epidemia.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Aparentemente lo que sucedi fue que los funcionarios peruanos quisieron
ponerse en la moda ecolgica y convirtieron en "verde" el agua potable. Pero
era el verde de la contaminacin. El verde del clera. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Se trata, pues, de una lamentable y trgica negligencia que va a dar lugar
a mltiples escndalos. De hecho existe una inexcusable irresponsabilidad de
los funcionarios peruanos que mancha con un crimen ms al gobierno de Alan
Garca. Pero es tambin cierto que la responsabilidad de las autoridades
norteamericanas se hace inocultable, al extremo de abrirse posibilidades de
que los familiares de los muertos por el clera enjuicien al gobierno
norteamericano para conseguir una justa indemnizacin.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La EPA se convertira as en responsable de uno de los genocidios ms
grandes de la historia del continente americano; el cual, vista la
persistente campaa que ella hace para suprimir el cloro del agua en Estados
Unidos y otros pases del mundo, se convierte en una trgica advertencia. La
comunidad internacional no puede permitir que la demagogia y la
irresponsabilidad ecologista destruyan los precarios logros de la salubridad
pblica.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Este caso es, ciertamente, una tragedia, pero ensea cmo las inadecuadas
recomendaciones de los ecologistas pueden hacer dao, al extremo de condenar
a muerte a decenas de miles de personas. Los prejuicios ideolgicos pueden
convertirse fcilmente en armas letales cuando se convierten en regulaciones
pblicas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Probablemente el cloro tiene ciertos riesgos, pero un anlisis de
costo/beneficio no puede hacerse en este caso entre el cncer y el no cncer
solamente, sino entre el cncer y el clera. No vaya a ser que por pretender
alcanzar un futuro "polticamente correcto" regresemos al ms aterrador de
los pasados.

<H2>SER NUEVAMENTE REELECTO</H2>
William Ratliff*<br>
<p>
 

LIMA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>)-- El jefe maoista del norte del Per, Pedro Snchez Flores, fue
recientemente capturado mientras trataba de revivir la "guerra popular" de
Sendero Luminoso, el grupo guerrillero ms sanguinario de la historia
latinoamericana.<p>
	Pero ese movimiento est moribundo y los grupos que sobreviven estn ms
interesados en el narcotrfico que en el trfico de ideas. Esa ha sido una
de las victorias del presidente Alberto Fujimori, capaz de recuperar la
esperanza de la gente a travs de cambios revolucionarios. Hablar hoy del
Per es hablar de Fujimori. Desde que tom las riendas del pas en 1990, ha
acumulado poder en sus propias manos, retando a las lites tradicionales con
una democracia autcrata que es controversial tanto dentro como fuera del pas.<p>
	En 1990, Fujimori hered un pas paralizado no slo por la guerrilla sino
por una total ineptitud en el manejo de la economa, un narcotrfico en auge
y la generalizada desesperacin de la gente. Durante su mandato, la
inflacin se redujo de 7.500% a 10% anual y el crecimiento econmico de los
ltimos tres aos le ha ganado al Per el apodo de "jaguar suramericano" de
parte de un importante banquero internacional.<p>
	En una entrevista en el palacio de gobierno, el presidente me dijo que la
mayora de los estadounidenses no entendan esta revolucin, su efectividad,
durabilidad ni el sustento popular. "Profundas diferencias" surgieron entre
Estados Unidos y el Per luego de 1992 -dijo-, cuando disolvi a un Congreso
elitista que se opona al cambio. Fujimori insiste en que "la gente hoy
quiere accin, no retrica". La mayora es "ms realista, prctica y honesta
que los polticos" que prometen sin cumplir, ganndose el desprecio general.
Fujimori mantiene que el anterior Congreso haba sido elegido bajo un
proceso tan fuertemente controlado por los privilegiados que difcilmente se
poda considerar democrtico. Un nuevo Congreso fue electo en 1995,
controlado por quienes apoyan a Fujimori.<p>
	Las encuestas en junio colocaban la aprobacin de Fujimori en 65% y muchos
quieren que busque de nuevo la reeleccin en el ao 2000. Pero sus crticos
argumentan que al socavar las instituciones tradicionales, el populismo de
Fujimori ha despojado al pas de su base institucional. Para el presidente,
fue ms la obra de polticas discriminatorias y rentistas de las lites
polticas, econmicas, sociales y religiosas -an ms que el evidente
fracaso del gobierno de Alan Garca- lo que en 1990 le entreg un pas ruinas.<p>
	Como segunda generacin de inmigrantes japoneses, Fujimori se identifica
con la ignorada mayora indgena, la cual responde a su mensaje y liderazgo.
El mismo se senta excluido "por razones tnicas", concluyendo que la nica
manera de hacer que el gobierno sirva a la mayora de la gente fue
"conscientemente enfrentando a la mayora marginada contra esa lite". Para
ello, viaja incansablemente a todos los rincones del pas. Los resultados
electorales y las encuestas muestran que sus ms decididos partidarios son
los ms pobres de Lima y del interior del pas. Un reciente informe de Banco
Mundial muestra que esos son exactamente los que ms se han beneficiado bajo.<p>

<TITLE>Falcoff: LatinoAmerica Vista Desde Washington -- 8/7/96</TITLE>

<BODY  bgcolor="#FFFFFF"background="/townhall/background.jpg">

<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>August 7, 1996</i><br>
<H2>LATINOAMERICA VISTA DESDE WASHINGTON</H2>
Mark Falcoff*<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Para Amrica Latina, las noticias de nuestra campaa
presidencial son buenas y malas. Por segunda vez, en muchos aos, el tpico
de la regin no es decisivo, pero a la vez no hay razones particulares para
que los latinoamericanos teman, deseen la victoria o la derrota de uno de
los candidatos.
<dd>
Se trata de un viejo problema en las relaciones hemisfricas. Estados
Unidos es criticado por tomarlos demasiado en cuenta ("intervenir") o por
abandonar a Amrica Latina. En esta ocasin la ausencia de debate sobre
Amrica Latina podra verse como una seal positiva, por haberse alcanzado
un consenso respecto a la regin en cuanto a "democracia, libre mercado y
mayor intercambio comercial".
<dd>
Pero quedan asuntos pendientes. El primero es la expansin del TLC/NAFTA.
Chile ya debera pertenecer. Esa era la intencin de la administracin
Clinton hasta que colaps el peso mexicano. Mientras Mxico no se recupere
econmicamente (y vuelva a consumir inmensas cantidades de productos
estadounidenses) ser difcil que algn presidente de este pas arriesgue
capital poltico haciendo avanzar el proceso de integracin.
<dd>
Los latinoamericanos estn sorprendidos de lo sucedido con Chile, pas que
ha debido preceder a Mxico. Pero para la mayora de estadounidenses Mxico
representa el hemisferio; pocos han ido ms al sur. Los fracasos de Mxico
han sido proyectados a toda la regin. Eso es injusto y por ello Brasil y
Argentina tendrn que esperar entre cuatro y ocho aos. Lo positivo es que
ello ha ayudado a acelerar la integracin regional. La prxima vez que un
presidente de Estados Unidos decida patrocinar a un nuevo miembro del
TLC/NAFTA bien podra ser Mercosur.
<dd>
El nico candidato antilatinoamericano fue Pat Buchanan en las primarias
republicanas, quien gan en apenas un estado. Aunque las corrientes
contrarias al libre comercio persisten en ambos partidos, la tendencia es
favorable a Amrica Latina.
<dd>
El asunto de las drogas es ms conflictivo, pero esto tampoco cambiar
mucho segn el ocupante de la Casa Blanca. El argumento de la legalizacin,
elocuentemente presentado por personas con las ms variadas posiciones
polticas, no ha calado. Y la controversia encuentra su centro de gravedad
en el proceso de certificacin, a travs del cual el Departamento de Estado
cumple con el ritual anual de informar al Congreso y al presidente sobre las
naciones latinoamericanas que estn haciendo todo lo posible para combatir
la produccin y el despacho de drogas ilegales. No hay que ser muy cnico
para dudar que ese proceso de certificacin tenga algo que ver con el mundo
real.
<dd>
Andrs Oppenheimer lo explica muy bien en su ltimo libro. Poco antes de
las eleccin de Zedillo, la polica federal mexicana incaut 8 toneladas en
un jet Caravelle que hizo un aterrizaje de emergencia. Seis toneladas
desaparecieron y parte de los mismos paquetes fueron incautados por las
autoridades de Estados Unidos en la frontera. Aparentemente, el decomiso de
2 toneladas fue cantidad suficiente para ganarle a Mxico la certificacin
ese ao. Es una decisin significativa ante la descertificacin de Colombia
y la suspensin de la visa al presidente Samper, lo cual ha sido
profundamente traumtico para los colombianos, ya que la descertificacin
conlleva modestas pero altamente simblicas sanciones comerciales.
<dd>
La tercera cuestin pendiente es la inmigracin, algo muy complejo y
emocional. Algunas naciones dependen del dinero que remiten desde Estados
Unidos a familiares. No es probable que Mxico, por ejemplo, hubiera
sobrevivido el colapso financiero sin el dinero enviado a familiares desde
aqu. Otro dramtico ejemplo es el de la dispora salvadorea.
<dd>
La posicin latinoamericana respecto a la inmigracin es prudente y moral.
Muchos pases insisten que la inmigracin es un derecho humano universal.
As piensa Mxico, pero sin respetarle tal derecho a los guatemaltecos. Por
el contrario, la posicin de Estados Unidos ha sido irracional y poco
realista. No hay consenso nacional sobre el tema. La Proposicin 187 y la
legislacin patrocinada por republicanos para negar educacin y dems
servicios pblicos a nios ilegales son absurdas ante el hecho que el pas
no est dispuesto a hacer deportaciones masivas. La tarea es integrar a los
indocumentados, especialmente a sus hijos. Si los costos parecen
prohibitivos ahora, sern mucho mayores en el futuro. El tema, sin embargo,
no ha sido seriamente discutido en la campaa electoral.
<dd>
Indudablemente que el fantasma de la intervencin en Hait acosar al
prximo ocupante de la Casa Blanca porque el presidente Ren Preval no tiene
fuerza para imponer decisiones econmicas cruciales. Un mnimo de orden
pblico depende de la presencia de las fuerzas de la ONU, las cuales se
retirarn en uno o dos aos.
<dd>
El PRI bien puede perder las elecciones legislativas en Mxico y, en
cualquier caso, el sistema poltico mexicano enfrenta cambios fundamentales.
Por otra parte, Castro puede decidir vengarse de la Ley Helms-Burton
lanzando flotillas de balseros si no este verano, el ao que viene.
<dd>
Prximamente los estadounidenses tendrn que negociar un nuevo tratado con
Panam, permitiendo que permanezcan tropas all. Bajo el Tratado
Carter-Torrijos de 1978, todas las fuerzas militares estadounidenses deben
marcharse antes del fin del siglo. Los panameos que antes estaban ansiosos
de salir de los gringos han decidido ahora que su presencia es una pliza de
seguro que atrae inversiones y capital extranjero. Estados Unidos, por su
parte, tendr que decidir si quiere la responsabilidad de asegurar la
estabilidad poltica panamea.
<dd>
En conclusin, habr mucho en la agenda latinoamericana de la nueva
administracin. Quizs es positivo que estos temas no se politicen durante
la campaa.

<H2>UN NUEVO UNIVERSO MONETARIO</H2>
Richard Rahn*<br>
<p>

WASHINGTON  (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--Movilizar dinero annimamente, a la velocidad de la luz
y a cualquier sitio del mundo va pronto a ser tan fcil como oprimir algunas
teclas en su computadora. Las autoridades fiscales se sienten retadas y
amenazadas por esa nueva tecnologa y, como era de esperarse, algunos
funcionarios de los departamentos del Tesoro y de Justicia de Estados Unidos
estn proponiendo regulaciones que en esencia obligaran a cada ciudadano o
empresa estadounidense a reportar al gobierno cada ingreso y gasto efectuado
electrnicamente. Ni los nazis ni los soviticos alcanzaron tal nivel de
entremetimiento. Felizmente, muchos en el Congreso estn opuestos a tal
intento de negarnos lo que nos queda de privacidad financiera.<p>
	Estamos en una encrucijada. Mientras los gobiernos ms traten de imponernos
impuestos, regularnos, controlarnos y confiscarnos, mayor es el incentivo
del empresario y del inversionista para marcharse. Las nuevas tecnologas
permitirn hacerlo electrnicamente.<p>
	Las transferencias electrnicas reducen drsticamente el costo de
transacciones y la posibilidad de prdidas. Se adelantan varios
experimentos, uno de ellos en Amsterdam es operado por DigiCash y se llama
E-cash. Individuos podrn mover sus fondos de banco a banco, sin que los
bancos mismos se enteren sobre quin hizo el depsito o de qu pas provino.<p>
	Claro que a la oficina de impuestos no le gusta eso, pero el asunto est
fuera de su control. La gente podr escoger entre dos versiones del futuro.
La primera es la sociedad donde todas sus transacciones pueden ser
monitoreadas por el gobierno. La segunda le permitir escoger cules de sus
transacciones estarn al alcance de ojos curiosos y cules se mantendrn en
el anonimato.<p>
	Funcionarios gubernamentales argumentarn que sistemas annimos benefician
principalmente a los narcotraficantes, lavadores de dinero, terroristas y a
los que no pagan sus impuestos. Los libertarios, por su parte, alertarn del
peligro que presentan los gobiernos con total escrutinio sobre el ciudadano.
Los temores legtimos del gobierno se pueden apaciguar substituyendo el
impuesto sobre la renta con tasas bajas de impuestos a las ventas y
retenciones. De todas maneras, no hay duda que las actuales regulaciones
para acabar con el lavado de dinero estn fracasando y ello no justifica la
imposicin de restricciones adicionales a legtimas transferencias
efectuadas por ciudadanos honestos, en detrimento de nuestras libertades
civiles.<p>
	Esta revolucin electrnica significa que los bancos y otras organizaciones
podrn crear su propio dinero. La definicin de dinero como moneda de curso
legal creado por los gobiernos se volver menos y menos relevante. La
distincin actual entre dinero, bienes, servicios y activos desaparecer a
medida que se hagan intercambiables.<p>
	Los gobiernos no podrn detener esta revolucin porque es mundial y
demasiada gente tiene los conocimientos necesarios. La censura y la
regulacin no funcionarn porque el desarrollo de maneras de evadirlas se
mantendr muy por delante de quienes intentan las restricciones. Por las
mismas razones, los gobiernos totalitarios han dejado de controlar la
informacin porque la nueva tecnologa lo hace imposible de lograr. Los
gobiernos tendrn que admitir que el monopolio de su banco central en la
emisin de monedas desaparecer de la misma manera que los coches tirados
por caballos.<p>
	La batalla por la libertad financiera no est perdida. Para ganarla hay que
involucrarse en la reforma del sistema impositivo, la abolicin del impuesto
sobre la renta y su reemplazo por un sistema que no requiera del constante
escrutinio gubernamental. En la era de pagos cibernrticos no es posible
mantener el actual rgimen de impuestos. <p>

<h2>
POBRES PERO NO TONTOS
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
spanbio
.html">
Walter Williams
</a>

<P>
FAIRFAX, VIRGINIA (AIPE).- Entre 1965 y 1994, los programas gubernamentales
para eliminar la pobreza le costaron al contribuyente estadounidense
$5.400.000.000.000. Con esa cantidad se pueden comprar todas las fbricas,
toda la maquinaria industrial y todos los edificios de oficinas de este
pas. Con el dinero que queda, se pueden comprar todas las lneas areas, de
transporte terrestre y martimo. Y si todava tiene ganas de seguir de
compras, podra adquirir todas las estaciones de televisin, de radio y
plantas de energa elctrica, adems de todas las tiendas al detal y todas
las empresas mayoristas. Y todava quedaran suficientes fondos como para
comprar todo el sector agrcola, maderero y pesquero de la nacin. La
tragedia es que durante los prximos cinco aos se proyectan gastar
$2.800.000.000.000 en estos mismos programas.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Acaso los pobres reciben todo ese inmenso caudal de dinero? En 1993
haban 40 millones de pobres en Estados Unidos y se gastaron $324.000
millones en programas para combatir la pobreza, lo cual equivale a darle
$8.100 a cada persona pobre o $34.400 a cada familia pobre. Lo que en
realidad sucede es que el grueso de ese dinero no le llega a los pobres sino
que queda en manos de los parsitos que forman parte de la "industria de la
pobreza".
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Adems, la forma en que estos programas estn diseados simplemente le
impiden a la gente con ganas de ganarse la vida salir del crculo vicioso
impuesto por el gobierno. Por ejemplo, en el estado de Oregon, el "paquete"
de ayuda gubernamental que recibe una madre soltera con dos nios es de
$16.959 al ao. Para que le quede esa cantidad neta, despus de pagar
impuestos, esa misma mujer tendra que percibir un sueldo anual de $19,000,
o sea $9,23 por hora. En Hawai el "paquete" de ayuda social para esa madre
es $27.736, lo cual quiere decir que para mantener su nivel de ingresos
trabajando tendra que ganar $17,50 por hora. El monto de salario por hora
equivalente a los beneficios percibidos por una madre soltera con dos nios
es de $14,75 en la ciudad de Nueva York, $12,45 en Filadelfia, $11,35 en
Baltimore y $10,90 en Detroit.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Muchos de los beneficiarios de la ayuda social no tienen el entrenamiento
ecesario para ganar tales salarios. Son pobres, pero no son tan tontos como
para dejar de percibir beneficios que equivalen a $12 o $14 por hora para
esforzarse en conseguir un trabajo que les pague $5 o $6 por hora, adems de
tener que levantarse temprano, cumplir con la disciplina de un trabajo,
pasarse ocho horas diarias recibiendo rdenes de sus supervisores y gastar
en transporte, ropa adecuada, etc. Las encuestas muestran que el 70% de los
beneficiarios de ayuda social gubernamental no buscan empleo. En el largo
plazo, esto tiene devastadoras consecuencias para el pas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Para mantener el Estado Beneficencia, el Congreso le saca del bolsillo a
cada familia estadounidense que paga impuestos un promedio de $3.400 al ao.
Se trata de un nuevo tipo de esclavitud. El trmino es apropiado porque
significa que se est obligando fsicamente a alguien a hacer algo contra su
voluntad, en beneficio de otro. Como descendiente de esclavos, eso es algo
que comprendo bien y que me convierte en abolicionista.

<h2>
ECONOMA PARA GOBERNANTES
</h2>


Carlos Boloa B.*
<p>

LIMA <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- En Amrica Latina, los gobernantes de turno, los ministros de
Hacienda y los polticos en general no conocen -u olvidan- los principios
econmicos ms elementales, y aplican frecuentemente polticas populistas
que pueden parecer positivas por sus efectos inmediatos, pero que al final
generan profundos daos y padecimientos.
<dd>        Por ello, debemos siempre recordar a nuestras clases polticas los
fundamentos esenciales de la ciencia econmica. As, puede contribuirse a
que no se repitan los graves errores del pasado. Ojal nuestros gobernantes
comprendan y recuerden estos principios bsicos:
<dd> El bolsillo es el rgano ms sensible. Por tanto, nadie mejor que uno
mismo para cuidar su propio bolsillo.  Ello quiere decir, adems, que la
naturaleza humana responde a incentivos: los individuos prefieren tener ms
a tener menos. La gente prefiere un dlar en su bolsillo que en el bolsillo
de otro o del gobierno, salvo que reciba a cambio de ese dlar un bien o un
servicio equivalente al mismo. No es de extraar que los individuos se
defiendan cuando les intentan reducir sus ingresos. Las polticas de
cualquier gobierno que vayan en contra de la naturaleza humana fracasarn
tarde o temprano.
<dd> Nadie cuida lo que no es suyo. Este es el fundamento de la institucin y
el fortalecimiento de la propiedad privada. Otros tipos o regmenes de
propiedad -como la estatal, social, cooperativa o cualquier otra que
inventen los "ingenieros sociales"- llevan a que nadie se responsabilice de
ella. Tarde o temprano, todos tratan de sacar ventaja de ella, a costa de la
participacin de los dems.
<dd> No se puede gastar ms de lo que se tiene. Esto puede hacerse por un
tiempo, por medio del endeudamiento, pero al final las deudas se pagan. El
individuo, la empresa o el gobierno que intente romper esta regla terminar
quebrado o en la insolvencia. Al principio, deja de pagar sus deudas, luego
pierde sus activos y, finalmente, cae en la quiebra -que es sinnimo de
dejar de operar, empobrecerse y quedar sumido en la miseria-.
<dd> Los pases tambin quiebran. Este es un principio derivado del anterior.
Cuando gastan ms de lo que tienen, los pases primero caen en cesacin de
pagos con el exterior y luego optan por el camino de malutilizar el
monopolio que poseen de imprimir dinero discrecionalmente. Ello genera
inflacin, que es la forma ms hipcrita de encubrir la quiebra.
<dd> No hay almuerzos gratis. Definitivamente, las facturas siempre se pagan.
Ello no quiere decir que siempre las paga quien debe, ya que algunas veces
los grupos de inters logran pasarle la factura al resto de la poblacin. Al
recibir una ventaja del gobierno -por ejemplo, jubilarse a temprana edad o
con sueldos del personal activo, o subsidiar la produccin nacional con los
impuestos a la importacin-, hacen que estas facturas se financien con el
dinero de los dems.
<dd> Lo que no nos cuesta lo hacemos fiesta. Esta es una verdad tan evidente
que la vemos a diario. La gente no valora las cosas cuando no le ha costado
dinero o esfuerzo.  Cuando te regalan las cosas, no las cuidas ni las
consideras. Esto es cierto en el caso de un bien material, pero tambin de
un servicio como la educacin o la salud. Es preferible, por ello, que quien
reciba algo, tenga que sacrificarse tambin con algo -puede no ser dinero
sino tiempo u otro recurso que pueda aportar-.
<dd> Los precios y el empleo no se determinan por decreto. Los precios, el
empleo productivo y el crecimiento econmico no se pueden establecer por
decreto. Los precios se determinan por la utilidad y por la escasez relativa
de los bienes o servicios disponibles en un momento dado. As, el tipo de
cambio refleja la escasez o abundancia relativa del dlar; la tasa de
inters, la del crdito; y el salario, la de la mano de obra. El gobierno,
cada vez que intenta fijar o controlar precios, slo entorpece el
funcionamiento del mercado, generando escasez o abundancia artificiales
-lase mercados negros o desempleo-.
<dd> Ms gasto pblico equivale a ms impuestos. La idea de mayor gasto pblico
es apetecible cuando se piensa en aumentos salariales, gasto social o de
inversin. Sin embargo, ese gasto viene aparejado con impuestos. A alguien
hay que quitarle para pagarlo. La primera tentacin es quitarle a los ricos,
pero generalmente eso no resulta suficiente. La segunda tentacin es
endeudarse, pero toda deuda se tiene que pagar. La tercera tentacin es
generar inflacin, que resulta el impuesto ms injusto, puesto que empobrece
al asalariado, al jubilado y a la mayora de la poblacin.
<dd> La pobreza se combate creando riqueza. Quitar riqueza a los que tienen
para drsela a los que no tienen es el camino seguro para empobrecer un
pas. Igualar es sinnimo de empobrecer. &copy

<TITLE>Buscaglia: Corrupcion y Reforma Judicial -- 8/7/96</TITLE>

<i>August 7, 1996</i><br>
<H2>CORRUPCION Y REFORMA JUDICIAL</H2>
Edgardo Buscaglia*<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- A medida que Amrica Latina adelanta su proceso de
reforma econmica se hace ms evidente la necesidad de contar con un sistema
judicial eficaz. La democratizacin, la concentracin de la poblacin en
reas urbanas y la apertura econmica han aumentado la complejidad de la
interaccin social y, en consecuencia, la demanda por servicios judiciales
en la resolucin de conflictos. Adems, la economa de mercado exige
definiciones claras sobre derechos y obligaciones.
<dd>
El sistema judicial, que incluye todos los mecanismos necesarios para
interpretar las leyes y regulaciones, es un elemento clave en el desarrollo
econmico. Sin embargo, los tribunales latinoamericanos sufren de crecientes
demoras y de corrupcin, lo cual genera desconfianza en el sistema. En casi
todos los pases latinoamericanos se observa una falta de consistencia en la
aplicacin de la jurisprudencia, lo cual unido a retrasos en resolver casos
aumenta el costo de acceso a la justicia y tambin de realizar negocios e
inversiones.
<dd>
A medida que aumenta el costo de la justicia, la gente reacciona acudiendo
menos a los tribunales. Un reciente estudio muestra que la mayora de los
usuarios no se inclinan a acudir a un tribunal para resolver disputas porque
perciben el sistema como lento, incierto, costoso y de "pobre calidad". La
desconfianza en el sistema judicial es considerablemente mayor entre
empresarios pequeos y las familias de bajos ingresos.
<dd>
A menudo se argumenta que se sufre de presupuestos inadecuados, pero pases
como Dinamarca, Japn y Alemania, donde el pblico tiene gran confianza en
el sistema judicial, el gobierno asigna porciones menores de su presupuesto
que Argentina, Brasil, Colombia y Mxico, las naciones cuyos tribunales
gozan de la menor confianza por parte del pblico. No se ha comprobado
relacin alguna entre la eficiencia judicial y el tamao del presupuesto
asignado a los tribunales. Encuestas realizadas en Argentina, Venezuela,
Ecuador y Per muestran que entre 55% y 75% del pblico tiene una muy baja
opinin del sector judicial. La percepcin general es que el entrenamiento
de los jueces es pobre y que no se garantiza la igualdad ante la ley.
<dd>
Una pregunta clave es por qu los jueces a menudo se oponen a las reformas.
La respuesta se basa en que funcionarios gubernamentales se aprovechan de
los tribunales para obtener rentas ilcitas, lo cual en gran parte es
posible debido a la amplia discrecionalidad monoplica de que gozan los
jueces.  Por ejemplo, la costumbre de que los jueces reciben por separado a
las partes crea fuertes incentivos a la corrupcin. Como tampoco hay normas
establecidas sobre el lapso de tiempo antes de iniciar el juicio o sobre su
duracin, esto se presta a que funcionarios del tribunal cobren por agilizar
los trmites.
<dd>
Otro problema es la frecuente concentracin de poder en las manos del juez,
quien asume mltiples roles en cuanto a la programacin estratgica, el
manejo de personal, la administracin de recursos, control presupuestario y
la adjudicacin de casos, todo lo cual distrae su atencin de la resolucin
de casos pendientes y abre mltiples posibilidades de corrupcin, debido a
la ausencia de mecanismos internos y externos de control.
<dd>
La inercia frente a la necesidad de las reformas judiciales en parte se
explica porque los beneficios, tales como mayor inversin y crecimiento
econmico  son generales y a largo plazo, mientras que el costo es
individual e inmediato:  la desaparicin de los ingresos por corrupcin. Por
lo tanto, parte de las reformas tendran que incluir mayores beneficios a
corto plazo dirigidos a los funcionarios del sistema judicial, a travs de
generosas pensiones, promociones para los jueces y empleados de los
tribunales, nuevas instalaciones y ms amplios presupuestos.
<dd>
La corrupcin implica un rompimiento del cdigo de tica colectivo que
beneficia al individuo que paga bajo la mesa para conseguir lo que desea del
tribunal, pero la sociedad se perjudica por una cada de la productividad a
travs del tiempo causada por la generalizada percepcin de que la
asignacin de recursos se hace de manera poco equitativa, al ser determinada
por prcticas corruptas. El estudio de la historia econmica prueba que la
corrupcin sistmica observada en la administracin de justicia en Amrica
Latina seguir contribuyendo al retraso econmico de la regin.

<title>LA INVENCIBLE BUROCRACIA -- 11/14/96</title>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">

<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>November 14, 1996</i><br>
<h2>LA INVENCIBLE BUROCRACIA
</h2>
Luis Aguilar L.*<br>
<p>
MIAMI (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Me comentaban no hace mucho unos viajeros argentinos que el
presidente Menem est haciendo un vigoroso esfuerzo por podar las ramas de
la frondosa burocracia argentina. "Usted sabe", me decan "que hasta hace
poco conseguir un telfono en Buenos Aires era tan problemtico como viajar
a la luna". Claro que lo saba. En el Buenos Aires de antao la tardanza era
a veces tan dilatada que, cuando llegaba el telfono, era depositado
respetuosamente en la tumba del fallecido aplicante.
<p>
Las palabras no mitigaban mi escepticismo. La burocracia es como un ave
fnix que brota ms vigorosa de sus propias cenizas. Ahora, por ejemplo, ha
llegado la burocracia telefnica. Esa metlica voz invisible que, si uno
llama al hospital, le dice "si usted est grave apriete el dos, si ya se ha
muerto apriete el tres, que es la funeraria".
<p>
Es bueno recordar que la palabra "burocracia" tiene la misma raz latina
que "burla" y que "bur". Un burcrata es, por tanto, un seor que desde su
"bur" se burla de la gente que espera por su atencin. La especie, mucho
ms visible en los pases del Tercer Mundo, se extiende por todo el globo.
<p>
En el mundo socialista la burocracia asfixia. Siempre he mantenido que a la
Unin Sovitica la hundi una burocracia cada vez ms fuerte y un vodka cada
vez ms dbil. Por su parte, a Fidel Castro le humean las barbas cuando
habla de la burocracia cubana. "Aqu no se puede hacer nada sin firmar diez
mil papeles", grit una vez el lder iracundo. "Y cada vez que nombro una
comisin para erradicar el problema, la comisin crece, se expande y se suma
al monstruo burocrtico".
<p>
Conozco el caso de un brasileo que se cas en Sao Paulo con una
portuguesa. En esa poca la ley exiga que todos los documentos expedidos en
el extranjero tenan que ser traducidos por una institucin oficial.
Portugal no haba sido excluido. Como consecuencia, mi amigo tuvo que llevar
al Ministerio de Relaciones Exteriores todos los documentos de su futura
esposa para que fueran "oficialmente" traducidos del portugus al portugus.
<p>
En Espaa, el genial Wenceslao Fernndez Flores ilustraba la situacin con
un cuento travieso. Un da, un cientfico espaol descubri un mtodo
revolucionario de enlatar sardinas. Sabiendo que la exportacin de sardinas
era vital para Espaa, el inventor corri al Ministerio de Industria. Fue
recibido con la usual impasibilidad. Se le dijo que la aprobacin del
Ministerio de Economa era indispensable. All vol el anheloso inventor. Le
pidieron pruebas de la patente; lo enviaron a otros departamentos; le
exigieron sellos, firmas, declaraciones de planos y documentos de confirmacin.
<p>
Exasperado ante tales murallas de papel, con menos libras y ms canas, el
inventor retorn al Ministerio de Industria. "Pero es que ustedes no se dan
cuenta de que tengo en mis manos la prosperidad de Espaa?", se quej; "Es
que no se dan cuenta de que mientras aqu perdemos tiempo entre registros y
pruebas, algn extranjero puede descubrir la frmula y regalarle a su pas
la prosperidad que yo le ofrezco a Espaa?".
<p>
El empleado de turno no se inmut. "Clmese amigo. No lo tome a pecho. Aqu
todo requiere tiempo. Ve usted aquel viejito sentado en ese banco?". El
inventor le tir una ojeada a un venerable anciano de luengas barbas blancas
que fumaba plcidamente. "Pues bien", prosigui el empleado, "ese seor
descubri hace setenta aos cmo construir aviones de propulsin a chorro.
Era entonces un joven fogoso como usted y luch hasta el final. Hace diez
aos, el ministerio le otorg permiso de fabricacin. Claro que ya ni la
patente tiene sentido ni l se acuerda del invento, pero, despus de tantos
aos, sigue viniendo a visitarnos a fumar y a conversar. Este ministerio es
su casa".
<p>
Podra multiplicar ejemplos, hay algunos de una cierta delirante
originalidad. Como pasar por Guatemala cuando se inaugur el Ministerios de
Asuntos Especficos. Lo cual me dej pensando: qu tipo de asuntos se
tratan en otros ministerios, asuntos metafsicos? Pero prefiero terminar con
la aventura de un empresario en Francia.
<p>
Una vez, en Pars, un hombre de negocios norteamericano lleg jadeante y
presuroso a un ministerio de algo. Eran apenas las cuatro de la tarde y el
ministerio estaba desierto. "Qu es esto?", le pregunt atnito a un viejo
empleado que trapeaba lnguidamente los pisos. "Es que aqu no se trabaja
por las tardes?". Interrumpiendo su labor, y con una irona volteriana, el
francs le explic la situacin: "Aqu mon ami, los empleados no vienen por
la tarde y no trabajan por la maana... tu comprend?". Y prosigui su
metdica limpieza del piso.

EL 'COMERCIALISMO' OLIMPICO DE ATLANTA
</h2>     
<P>
Filip Palda*
<p>
VANCOUVER, CANADA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).
-- Algunos de los burcratas que controlan losjuegos internacionales acusaron de "vulgar" y de "comercializada" las
recientes olimpadas de Atlanta, prometiendo impedir su repeticin.
Samaranch y su grupo prefieren el fuete gubernamental antes que la mano
invisible del mercado. Pero veamos lo que en realidad sucedi en Atlanta.<P>
 Los juegos fueron organizados por gente que se puso de acuerdo entre s. La
belleza de los acuerdos y de los contratos es que obliga a la gente a pensar
y a hacer el mejor uso de la informacin. Si los organizadores quieren
construir un parque no emiten, simplemente, un cheque con cargo a los
contribuyentes de impuestos, sino que tienen que convencer a patrocinantes
como la IBM para que aporten el dinero. Entonces, esa empresa se pregunta si
el despliegue de su logotipo en ese parque justifica la inversin que los
organizadores exigen. Los ejecutivos tratarn de calcular si ello
representar un beneficio para los accionistas de la empresa, de manera
similar a como beneficiar a los espectadores y usuarios del parque. Slo
cuando las dos partes resultan beneficiadas funciona el mercado. Por eso las
olimpadas organizadas conforme al libre mercado, como la de Atlanta, son
democrticas y eficientes.
<P> Cuando el gobierno financia los juegos, los acuerdos sensatos son
reemplazados por imposiciones y tcticas de fuerza. Los contribuyentes
tienen que aportar el dinero, les guste o no. Ese tipo de financiamiento
produce una olimpada tipo Montreal, donde se cometieron equivocaciones por
mil millones de dlares a costa del pblico cautivo.
<P> El financiamiento a travs de impuestos impide que los organizadores hagan
uso de sus cerebros en inventar y desarrollar mejores maneras de servir a
los atletas. A qu burcrata con una bolsa de dinero proveniente de los
impuestos se le hubiera ocurrido el concepto del Aro Reebok? El Aro Reebok
era el sitio en Atlanta donde los atletas rusos participantes en las
olimpadas podan escoger equipos deportivos Reebok, por cortesa de la
empresa. En una olimpada de libre mercado, las naciones que hasta hace poco
estaban dispuestas a destruirse mutuamente buscaban maneras de ayudar a sus
atletas.
<P> La prensa ignor todo lo bueno que surgi al organizar los juegos con la
ayuda del comercio. Los periodistas ms bien se quejaban de la lentitud de
los autobuses en el trfico, de desperfectos en las computadoras y de los
agresivos vendedores de camisetas. Los reporteros no supieron detectar la
noticia ms importante: cmo los atletas, los empresarios y los espectadores
obtuvieron algo sin obligar al distante contribuyente de impuestos para que
pagara la cuenta por su entretenimiento y disfrute.

<TITLE>Posada: Estados Unidos y el Futuro de Colombia -- 8/7/96</TITLE>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>August 7, 1996</i><br>
<H2>ESTADOS UNIDOS Y EL FUTURO DE COLOMBIA</H2>
Miguel Posada S.*<p>
BOGOTA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- 	El ingreso de dineros del narcotrfico a la pasada campaa
electoral en Colombia desat una crisis poltica interna en el pas y gener
un deterioro notable en las relaciones del gobierno colombiano con Estados
Unidos. El gobierno norteamericano ha sido actor importante en el proceso
desatado, aplicando presin sobre el gobierno del presidente Samper en
varias formas.
<dd>
Primero vino la descertificacin de Colombia como pas comprometido con la
lucha antidrogas. Esta descertificacin deja el camino abierto al ejecutivo
de Estados Unidos para aplicar las sanciones que estime conveniente contra
el pas. Despus del proceso en la Cmara de Representantes que absolvi al
presidente Samper, el gobierno norteamericano le retir al mandatario
colombiano su visa de ingreso a Estados Unidos. Esta sancin, aplicada
adems a otros personajes de la vida poltica nacional, es la ltima
actuacin hasta el momento. Queda encima del gobierno colombiano y del pas
la espada de Damocles de las sanciones comerciales. 
<dd>	
En la batalla contra el llamado Cartel de Cali, la polica y las fuerzas
armadas han sido exitosas. Con la excepcin de Helmer Herrera, la cpula del
Cartel est en la crcel o fue dada de baja. Obviamente quedan muchos narcos
de menor jerarqua por detectar y capturar. Fue precisamente informacin
contenida en los documentos hallados en los muchos allanamientos realizados
la que aceler la crisis al revelar la profundidad de la penetracin que
haba logrado el Cartel en la clase poltica colombiana. La presin
norteamericana, odiosa por ser externa, ha sido importante para mantener en
marcha este proceso de limpieza, vital para Colombia ms que para los mismos
Estados Unidos. 
<dd>	
Indudablemente la incertidumbre causada por la crisis poltica ha tenido un
costo importante para la economa colombiana. Por otra parte, el dao a las
relaciones bilaterales que se ha producido, no slo por las actuaciones
concretas, sino por las declaraciones imprudentes de funcionarios de los dos
gobiernos, especialmente las del ministro del Interior Horacio Serpa,
probablemente ser subsanable en el mediano plazo. Pero queda el tema de las
sanciones. Aplicarlas sera un grave error por parte del gobierno
norteamericano. El retiro de preferencias arancelarias u otras sanciones de
tipo econmico ocasionaran graves daos a la economa colombiana.
Afectaran precisamente a las exportaciones sanas del pas. En el campo
poltico debilitara a quienes apoyan la limpieza y se abrira el campo a
quienes, apelando a un nacionalismo malsano, conviven y apoyan a los
narcotraficantes y a la guerrilla, esta ltima convertida hoy en el Tercer
Cartel del narcotrfico.
<dd>	
Es probable que desde Washington sea difcil apreciar la realidad de la
situacin poltica colombiana. El proceso de limpieza, como es apenas
natural, ha generado una polarizacin y un fraccionamiento poltico. Hoy no
se ven candidatos serios y competentes dentro de los partidos tradicionales
que tengan buenas probabilidades de tener xito electoral. Es posible que en
los dos aos que faltan para las elecciones presidenciales algunos
candidatos aceptables se puedan perfilar con ms claridad, pero una actitud
arrogante y falta de tacto de parte del gobierno de Estados Unidos trabajar
en contra de los buenos candidatos y a favor de otros, populistas o de
ideologa de izquierda, cuyo triunfo sera desastroso para el pas. La
embajada norteamericana en Colombia tiene la gran responsabilidad de
asesorar bien al Departamento de Estado en la materia. En estos momentos se
requiere firmeza pero tambin discrecin y paciencia de parte de Washington
para no generar una animadversin hacia Estados Unidos que hara difcil la
necesaria colaboracin de dos pases enfrentados a un enemigo comn.

<p>
CARACAS (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--
El bienestar econmico de una nacin se mide por el consumo
de bienes materiales. Los pases ms prsperos consumen ms alimentos, ms
servicios y ms bienes durables. Podemos, por lo tanto, afirmar que
bienestar es igual a desarrollo econmico. Y, desde luego, no se puede
con-sumir lo que no se ha producido, aunque no es indis-pensable producir
localmente todo lo que se va a consumir. Constantemente se intercambian
bienes producidos en el pas por otros producidos en el extranjero,
aumentando as la eficiencia. Pero los extranjeros no entregarn sus bienes
sino a cambio de otros, ya sea mediante el procedimiento arcaico del trueque
o la moderna transferencia de divisas. Es por lo tanto indispensable
producir para intercambiar. Consumo es igual a Produccin.
<P>Esto nos lleva a lo que llamo la ecuacin del bienestar: Desarrollo o
Bienestar = Consumo = Produccin. Esta ecuacin es vlida con independencia
del sistema econmico y poltico imperante. Es igualmente cierta para Angola
y para Alemania, para Venezuela y para Rusia, para Estados Unidos y para el
Japn.
<P>Podemos, entonces, afirmar que la nica manera de aumentar el desarrollo
econmico, el bienestar de la comunidad, es haciendo crecer el consumo a
travs de un aumento de la produccin. Y no existe otra forma de 
El Premio Nobel de la Paz Lord John Boyd Orr, en el prlogo de la edicin
de 1962 de la "Geopoltica del Hambre", afirm que dos terceras partes de la
humanidad estaban muriendo de hambre, tcnicamente calculada esa hambre en
razn del consumo de protenas, y que la solucin era la transferencia
masiva de recursos de los pases ricos de Occiden-te hacia el Tercer Mundo.
Afirmacin errada segn el proverbio chino, pero repetida durante aos,
hasta el cansancio, en todos los foros inter-nacionales y a travs de los
medios de comunicacin. 
<P>Resulta que en estos 34 aos los pases desarrollados han transferido al
Tercer Mundo, mediante ddivas o prsta-mos del Banco Mundial y del Fondo
Monetario Internacional -que jams cobrarn- la astronmica cifra de
$170.000 millones, sin que haya mejorado el consumo de protenas. Pero
seguimos oyendo y leyendo sobre la "injusta distribucin" de la rique-za
mundial.
<P>Esa transferencia de fondos del sector pblico de los pases desarrollados
al sector pblico de los pases subdesarrollados, a manos de gobernantes
casi siempre corrup-tos del Tercer Mundo, ha cumplido slo con la primera
parte del pro-verbio chino. Ha sido una transferencia masiva y astronmica
de fondos al mundo subdesarrollado, pero est muy lejos de haber sido
inversin en el sentido econmico. Ha sido capaz, eso s, de producir en el
mundo subdesarrollado una kleptocracia que se enriquece, una nueva casta
parsita de demagogos populistas que gana elecciones y por lo tanto tiende a
perpetuarse en el poder.
<P>Para que una inversin aumente la produccin, el bienestar y el desarrollo
de la comunidad, tiene que ser inversin privada, sometida a las reglas del
mercado y de la competencia, tanto nacional como internacional. Esa
inversin, cuando es extranjera, adems trae consigo una cultura industrial.
Con la inversin verdadera de capital extranjero se produce, adems del
traslado de fon-dos, el traslado de procedimientos productivos, de
entrenamiento de personal y de aplicacin de sistemas de produccin, de
tecnologa y mer-cadeo casi tan valiosos como el propio capital. Es esa
verdadera inversin un elemento indispensable para acelerar el desarrollo
econmico.

<H2>SEA BUENO, PRODUZCA UTILIDADES</H2>
Fred L. Smith*<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- El fracaso del socialismo ha obligado a muchos de sus
partidarios a buscar nuevas maneras de alcanzar viejos objetivos. Ahora una
variante popular es la "responsabilidad social de la empresa". Los ex
socialistas ahora admiten que el capitalismo juega un papel importante, pero
ese papel debe ser limitado porque omite valores importantes, tales como la
"equidad" en el trabajo, las ramificaciones ecolgicas de actividades
empresariales, el impacto sobre los nios y las minoras, las virtudes de un
trabajo seguro, etc. Alegan que si juntamos la eficiencia capitalista con la
justicia social, el mundo sera mejor. Es eso verdad?
<dd>	
Es cierto que el capitalismo tiene sus problemas, aquellos que el
economista Schumpeter llam "elementos destructivos creativos". Cuando una
gran empresa quiebra, causa el caos entre miles de vidas. Si un producto
est mal diseado o se utiliza de manera no anticipada el resultado puede
ser desastroso. Una industria puede manejar mal sus residuos y desechos,
tirndolos a un ro o al aire que respiran sus vecinos. A menudo la frialdad
impersonal del mercado amenaza los clidos valores de una sociedad tradicional.
<dd>	
No sera maravilloso si los ciudadanos-trabajadores, motivados por una
cvica filantropa y laborando en empresas conscientes de sus
responsabilidades sociales se unieran todos para eliminar la pobreza, el
racismo, la contaminacin y dems prejuicios e iniquidades del mundo? 
<dd>	
Cuidado. El resultado podra ser mucho peor que la realidad de hoy. El
movimiento en pro de la "responsabilidad empresarial" no comprende los retos
de la sociedad moderna: la necesidad de la especializacin y de
interacciones annimas. El altruismo es un atributo demasiado raro para ser
la base de una sociedad moderna porque no hay suficiente cantidad de Madres
Teresas para lograrlo. Como lo expres Adam Smith, una larga vida apenas
genera un reducido grupo de amigos ntimos, pero todos los das tratamos
pacficamente, a travs del mercado, con un inmenso mundo compuesto de
extraos. El comunitarismo no es suficiente para organizar a una sociedad
moderna. Confiar en los ms diversos intereses personales para organizar
tales relaciones no es el resultado de la maldad sino, ms bien, de la
necesidad.
<dd>	
Una empresa junto con sus accionistas debe ocuparse de su "familia"
corporativa inmediata: sus empleados y vecinos, sus suplidores y sus
clientes. Esos grupos tienen un inters en la prosperidad a largo plazo de
la firma. Extender esa relacin al resto del mundo es permitir que se
entrometa gente que no tiene ninguna razn para averiguar el valor de la
empresa ni importarle su supervivencia. La sociedad moderna es posible
porque la mayora de la gente est excluida de la mayora de las
actividades. Las instituciones del mercado -propiedad privada, contratos, la
compaa annima- son dispositivos de exclusin. Estos crean esferas
circunscritas de responsabilidad y poder, en las cuales cada uno de nosotros
juega papeles especializados para mutuo beneficio.
<dd>	
Una empresa no se funda para resolver los problemas del mundo. Su formato
distingue a un grupo de personas como accionistas -los que aportan capital-
de todas los dems. La empresa contrata gerentes para administrar el capital
en beneficio de los accionistas. Inclusive, el inters de los accionistas
tiende a limitarse a si la empresa es lucrativa o no; a si su dinero estara
mejor invertido en otra parte. No tomar eso en cuenta y pretender que "su
empresa" es "mi empresa" nos conduce al colectivismo, lo cual socava las
bases de la sociedad moderna y amenaza con devolvernos a un pasado tribal.

<h2>
DEFENSA DE LA LEY HELMS-BURTON
</h2>     
     
     

Alvaro Vargas Llosa*
<p>


MADRID <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Durante una reciente gira por varios pases latinoamericanos
para presentar un libro que acabo de perpetrar con Carlos Alberto Montaner y
Plinio Apuleyo Mendoza -"Manual del perfecto idiota latinoamericano"- me han
preguntado hasta la saciedad: quin es el ms idiota de todos?  Siempre
contest que los idiotas son muchos pero que, con toda justicia
entomolgica, debe sealarse contemporneamente a Fidel Castro como la reina
de la especie. Y aad que son idiotas quienes creen que el problema
principal de Cuba es el embargo estadounidense, que su levantamiento
precipitara la cada de Castro y que la "ley Helms-Burton" es una
conspiracin contra la soberana de Canad, Mxico, Espaa, Francia, Japn o
la Cochinchina.
<dd>	Se ha desatado en Espaa una fuerte campaa contra la "ley Helms-Burton" de
una inequvoca ndole nacionalista. Detrs de todos los argumentos respira
el orgullo espaol herido por una legislacin norteamericana supuestamente
imperialista. Un anlisis puramente legal bastara para demostrar que lo
nico que ha hecho Estados Unidos es ejercer su derecho como pas. La ley no
dice que se va a penalizar a quienes inviertan en Cuba sino a quienes
trafiquen con propiedades que fueron de norteamericanos y dejaron de serlo
por un acto, no de derecho, sino de fuerza. Quienes no trafiquen con estas
propiedades pueden seguir comerciando con Cuba, del mismo modo que Cuba
puede seguir montando empresas en el exterior para burlar el embargo, como
lo hizo durante tantos aos desde su famoso Departamento MC que acab en el
juicio estaliniano contra el general Ochoa, De la Guardia y compaa. Como
le dijo recientemente el canciller argentino Di Tella al canciller cubano,
Cuba puede comerciar todo lo que quiera con el mundo, siempre que pague.
<dd>	Pero no es ste argumento legal -basado en que Estados Unidos tiene derecho
a proteger a sus ciudadanos, ejerciendo as la funcin esencial que tiene el
Estado- el que quiero traer a colacin. En Espaa, las razones para apoyar
la ley son ms poderosas que en todos los otros pases del planeta. Se
invoca en estos das, con las venas del cuello hinchadas, los derechos de
las pocas decenas de empresarios espaoles que han decidido -con poco
sentido de sus propios intereses- hacer negocios en la Cuba de hoy. Por qu
tendran estos intereses que ser ms importantes, a la hora de juzgar la ley
Helms-Burton, que los de las decenas de miles de comerciantes espaoles
cuyas propiedades y negocios fueron confiscados por Castro.  El comercio
minorista estaba prcticamente en manos de espaoles en la Cuba de fines de
los 50 y unos 30 mil espaoles expropiados por Castro nunca fueron
compensados por aquel acto de brutalidad.
<dd>	Pero hay ms: si escarbamos un poco en la historia cubana de este siglo
llegaremos a la conclusin de que un porcentaje elevadsimo de la poblacin
es espaola. Entre la poblacin cubana blanca (40% del total), quienes no
tienen ascendencia espaola inmediata son una minora. En 1902 un censo
estableci que la mitad del milln trescientos mil habitantes eran espaoles
(incluyendo, para desgracia de Amrica, a un tal Angel Castro). En los aos
siguientes llegaron a Cuba ochocientos mil nuevos inmigrantes espaoles,
entre asturianos, gallegos y canarios, que inclinaron decisivamente la
balanza demogrfica hacia el lado espaol. Y no era una inmigracin hija o
nieta de espaoles, era espaola y punto. De esa inmigracin son hija y
nieta directas las dos generaciones que hoy constituyen el universo de
vctimas de la dictadura castrista y est en marcha una tercera.
<dd>	Si es vlida la premisa de Palmerston de que la poltica exterior de un
pas debe ser defender los interese de sus ciudadanos, quin puede afirmar
que Espaa debe oponerse a la ley Helms-Burton?
<dd>	Pero hay an ms: est entre los intereses de Espaa, tambin, defender la
democracia en los pases latinoamericanos. Esto significa, en trminos
prcticos, penalizar a las dictaduras. Todava est muy lejos del continente
americano la conciencia de que la libertad es indivisible, que no se puede
separar la libertad poltica de la libertad econmica. Aunque hay muchos
ejemplos americanos de libertad a medias, ningn caso ha contribuido ms a
la confusin ideolgica y moral que el caso cubano. El ltimo episodio de la
larga batalla de Castro en favor de la confusin es la "opcin china": el
intento de crear unos espacios de capitalismo dentro de estructuras de poder
comunistas o simplemente despticos. La piedra de toque de esa operacin es
la inversin extranjera. Se vende la idea de que Cuba al menos va hacia la
libertad econmica, lo que engendrar la libertad poltica. Que este
razonamiento es farisaico lo demuestra el hecho de que Yugoslavia, que tuvo
relaciones econmicas privilegiadas con las democracias desarrolladas,
sigui siendo una dictadura comunista hasta los acontecimientos
cataclsmicos que todos conocemos, y el hecho de que Ceausescu, a quien fue
concedido el trato preferencial por Estados Unidos, se aferr al poder  en
Rumania por 24 aos.
<dd> Aunque es cierto que las sanciones econmicas no bastan para tumbar
gobiernos, no hay duda de que las inyecciones econmicas vitaminizan a las
dictaduras. Y aunque la Cuba de Castro no ofrece ninguna seguridad jurdica
a los inversionistas extranjeros, ni hay all las mnimas condiciones
econmicas para que los capitales hagan buen negocio, la existencia de estas
inversiones provee un sostn al rgimen de Castro y le facilita la siniestra
inculcacin del "sndrome de Estocolmo" entre sus vctimas, psicolgicamente
dependientes de la nica mano que les pone un mendrugo en la boca.
<dd>	Es una buena cosa que Jos Mara Aznar no se haya dejado acorralar por la
histeria antiyanqui durante la visita de Al Gore y que haya mantenido muy
claras las prioridades; incluso si se est formalmente obligado a oponerse a
la "ley Helms-Burton", no debe perderse nunca de vista que la batalla
principal en el caso cubano es contra la tirana y a favor de sus vctimas,
y que Estados Unidos -nico pas del mundo que intenta hacer algo concreto
contra Castro- no es responsable ni de que Cuba sea una inmensa fbrica de
sufrimiento ni de que 10 millones de cubanos no lleguen a producir la
tercera parte de los $30.000 millones que los exiliados cubanos producen
cada ao en el pas libre que les abri las puertas cuando todos los dems
se las cerraban.
<dd>	Desde agosto de 1994, cuando Castro lanz a 30.000 balseros contra las
costas de la Florida (y Washington desperdici la oportunidad de acabar de
una vez por todas con la dictadura), uno tena la impresin de que la nica
prioridad en la poltica exterior hacia Cuba era evitar nuevos inmigrantes.
Gracias a un error poltico monumental -el asesinato de los pilotos de
"Hermanos al Rescate"-, Castro precipit una saludable alteracin de las
prioridades en la poltica exterior norteamericana hacia Cuba. Mantengamos
esas prioridades donde deben estar. &copy;

<h2>
AMERICA LATINA: MAS MITOS QUE METAS
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Luis Aguilar Len*

<P>
MIAMI (AIPE).-  Proclamar que la Amrica Latina est en crisis implica un
cierto simplismo. La Amrica Latina vive en crisis. Desde la batalla de
Ayacucho hasta nuestros das, la historia de la Amrica Latina es la
historia de una crisis.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	En ocasiones la crisis estalla en revoluciones y golpes de estado;
usualmente se desarrolla con reprimida violencia, ltimamente, cuando la
democracia ha asomado su vendada cabeza en el continente, flotan los ecos de
enormes deudas externas, guerrillas con mscaras de narcotrfico (o
viceversa), roces fronterizos y, sobre todo, una corrupcin oficial que,
como una ola de mugre, se abate sobre el continente derribando presidentes,
ministros, partidos y debilitando al propio sistema democrtico.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Cabe preguntarse: Hacia dnde va la Amrica Latina?  Dnde estn los
planes de futuro?, cules son las metas reales?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Las respuestas podran comenzar sealando que la Amrica Latina vive tan
intensamente algunos mitos que apenas si se preocupa por sealarse metas.
Hace ms de 150 aos, por ejemplo, nos proclamamos jvenes y, hasta hace muy
poco, excusbamos todo tropiezo como natural error de la inexperiencia. Nada
aprendimos de aquella irona de Oscar Wilde: "La juventud de Amrica es una
de sus ms viejas tradiciones".
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Despus surgi el mito de nuestra latinidad, una frmula defensiva de una
elite criolla en busca de una identidad rasgada por aquel comentario de
Bolvar: "Si no somos ni indios, ni negros, ni europeos, qu somos?". Las
minoras cultas dieron con una respuesta luminosa: somos latinos. Y as de
golpe, a pura voluntad, nos adscribimos a un terico mundo latino, a la
vieja Roma y, sobre todo, a nuestra amada Francia.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	El amor de los latinoamericanos por Francia es uno de los fenmenos ms
curiosos de la historia. Francia nunca se ocup mucho de la Amrica Latina,
excepto para enviar tropas a Hait, a Mxico y la marina de guerra a la
Argentina. Pero todo se le perdonaba a la madre Francia, tierra de poetas
egregios, "maestra de la vida risuea", cuyo Pars los latinoamericanos
sentan como suyo.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	En las casas de las elites cultas no podan faltar grabados y libros
franceses. Los latinos aprendan La Marsellesa antes de aprender los himnos
nacionales. El genio de Vctor Hugo produca vrtigos. Tan apasionada
admiracin no hubiera sido daina, que Francia mucho nos poda ensear, si
no hubiera desembocado en una ms deletrea exageracin: el culpar a los
yankees por todos los males del continente.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	En 1898, sacudidas por la derrota de Espaa y por la evidencia del
podero norteamericano, las minoras latinoamericanas exacerbaron ese otro
rostro del mito. Casi sin quererlo, el uruguayo Jos Enrique Rod esboz la
frmula. Los gringos son ricos, poderosos, industriales y trabajadores, pero
son como Calibn, les falta alma, no tienen verdadera cultura, no son
espirituales. En cambio los latinos son como Ariel, los anima el espritu,
son los hijos y descendientes del imperio romano y de la inmortal Atenas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Como siempre, el mito estrangul la meta. Saltando sobre la realidad
histrica, olvidndonos de que, como descubri ms tarde Benito Mussolini,
los italianos de hoy no son descendientes de los romanos de Csar, los
latinoamericanos nos dedicamos a solazarnos en nuestra espiritualidad y a
maldecir al pujante yankee, el Mr. Danger de Rmulo Gallegos, que nos
despreciaba. En vez de aprender por qu el Norte era poderoso para, como
aconsejaba Sarmiento, encontrar el camino del xito, se nos ense que era
peligroso volvernos "materialistas", embijarnos con la industrializacin,
estudiar y adoptar urgentsimas reformas. Ariel, con su alada visin del
mundo, no tena que preocuparse de tales bajos menesteres, le bastaba
alimentarse de sueos y retrica.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Ante tal desmesuramiento del mito de nuestra latinidad, se explica el
sarcasmo del peruano Manuel Gonzlez Prada:
<blockquote>"Aqu yace Carlos Oblongo,
de pura estirpe latina...
la madre lleg del Congo,
y el padre vino de China..."</blockquote>
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Las dos guerras mundiales, y la tajante realidad de un mundo dividido en
pueblos desarrollados y subdesarrollados, ayudaron a disipar algo el sueo
de la espiritualidad latina. Pero para entonces el mito haba contribuido al
dao colectivo. Nos habamos quedado a la zafa de la industrializacin. Y
dentro de nuestro hipottico mundo latino, masas empobrecidas reclamaban su
derecho al progreso.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Frente a tal ineludible realidad, las minoras latinas revitalizaron tres
viejos mitos: la hermandad latinoamericana, el indigenismo, y la obligacin
del Estado de ser padre y protector de todos los ciudadanos. Los pases de
poblacin india cantaron al mestizaje, lo cual era bien justo, y proclamaron
la superioridad de las culturas precolombinas sobre la espaola, lo cual es
bien discutible. Y todos los gobiernos, dictaduras o democracias,
continuaron el paternalismo estatal, padre de parlisis y de corrupcin.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Ah est, entre muchos problemas, la corrupcin poltica que debilita y
mina todo esfuerzo. Y por qu no buscamos mtodos para embridarla? Con
cul mito vamos a encubrir nuestra responsabilidad colectiva?

<H2> DROGA COLOMBIANA Y 'MULAS' VENEZOLANAS</H2>
Carlota Wigglesworth*<br>
<p>

LONDRES  (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).-- Un creciente nmero de mujeres latinoamericanas est siendo
atrapado en el terrible mundo de la pobreza y el vicio, al dedicarse al
srdido transporte de drogas. <p>
Tengo tiempo  trabajando  con mujeres  latinoamericanas en crceles de Gran
Bretaa, detenidas casi todas en los aeropuertos de Heathrow y Gatwick por
transportar drogas, principalmente cocana. En los ltimos meses he notado
un cambio radical y preocupante en la mecnica de esa importacin. Venezuela
se perfila como el puerto de salida de la droga proveniente de Colombia,
Per y Bolivia con destino a Europa. Por aos, en el grupo de 94 latinas
encarceladas en Inglaterra, haba una sola venezolana y la mayora eran
colombianas. Este ao, el nmero de venezolanas ha aumentado
considerablemente y aunque las detenciones son de nacionalidades variadas,
todas procedan de Venezuela. La edad promedio es de 22 aos; casi todas son
madres solteras, sin medios para mantener a sus hijos.  Sin ningn tipo de
recursos ni de apoyo familiar, terminan siendo reclutadas por los
narcotraficantes, quienes se concentran en los sectores pobres. En
Venezuela, 84% de la poblacin vive hoy en la pobreza y madres desesperadas
son especialmente vulnerables a las promesas de los narcotraficantes. <p>
	El reclutamiento de las llamadas "mulas" funciona de la siguiente manera.
Los agentes identifican a mujeres con deudas y desespero por cubrir las
necesidades bsicas de su familia. Le ofrecen "amistad" y ayuda material.
Cuando la mujer se enreda, la obligan a pagar la deuda trabajando en el
transporte de paquetes con droga. Si la desdichada trata de salirse del
compromiso, la amenazan con maltratar y hasta matar a sus hijos y dems
familiares. Una vez que la mujer est atrapada, la obligan a tragar
cpsulas, burdamente preparadas, rellenando condones o dedos de guantes
quirrgicos con cocana. Algunas han tragado hasta 100 cpsulas o las
"embalsaman"; esto es, sujetan pequeas bolsas de cocana al cuerpo con
vendajes. As las montan, generalmente por primera vez, en aviones. Otras
traen droga en tacones falsos, en el forro de la ropa, en maletines y bolsos
de mano, en cosmticos y hasta en alimentos.<p>
	Las autoridades britnicas estn muy bien equipadas para detectar
contrabando de drogas y los inspectores de aduana son muy competentes. Aqu
la ley es muy severa respecto al narcotrfico.<p>
En los aeropuertos de Londres presencio continuamente duras interrogaciones
a travs de intrpretes. Las someten a exmenes de rayos X y las detienen en
celdas hasta que la droga ingerida sea evacuada. La droga se pesa y se
analiza para establecer su pureza y cantidad, de lo cual depender la
ulterior sentencia.<p>
	Del aeropuerto estas mujeres son trasladadas a la prisin de Holloway,
donde permanecen hasta ser sentenciadas, unos seis meses ms tarde. Luego,
las transfieren a prisiones en el interior del pas, donde cumplen condenas
de 7, 9 o 12 aos. Sin saber el idioma ni conocer el sistema legal o las
regulaciones de la crcel, estas mujeres ingresan a un infierno, donde el
peor castigo es no saber de sus hijos y familiares.<p>
	Tenemos varios casos de mujeres que dejaron hijos pequeos a cargo de una
amiga cuando salieron de viaje "por una semana", bajo promesas de $200 a
$600 por transportar cocana con un valor en la calle de 30 a 45 mil
dlares. Los nios, quienes pronto dejan de estar a cargo de la amiga,
generalmente tan pobre como la "mula", seguidamente ingresan al implacable
crculo de la pobreza-vicio-droga-crimen.<p>
	La mujer una vez reclutada no tiene escape. Si cumple con xito su primera
misin, vuelven a usarla; si la detienen, la familia es vctima de
represalias. Visito a tres  mujeres que les  mataron los hijos. Una
colombiana recibi en la crcel la noticia del asesinato de su hijo de 16
aos, a quien durmiendo en casa de la abuela lo ejecutaron de un tiro en la
sien. A otra colombiana le mataron la hija saliendo de una tienda en Cali y
a un tercer nio lo arroll y mat un automvil, mientras que al hermano de
otra detenida lo asesinaron a palos. Vi los certificados de defuncin tengo
las pruebas.<p>
	Una espaola, detenida al llegar de Venezuela, cuenta que para drogarse se
endeud con el cartel y fue reclutada, "una vez que entras en ese circulo
-me dijo- no te puedes salir aunque lo desees y trates... despus de uno de
mis intentos de escapar, mataron a mi hermano en represalia".  <p>
	No quiero slo ayudar en lo que puedo a estas desdichadas mujeres, sino
tambin dar a conocer este horrible drama para evitar que otras muchachas
caigan en la misma tentacin, creyendo que los narcotraficantes les van a
resolver sus problemas. Slo lograrn destruir sus vidas y exponer a seres
queridos a la tortura y el asesinato. <p>

<TITLE>Ball: Por Fin Arranca Dole -- 8/7/96</TITLE>

<i>August 7, 1996</i><br>
<H2>POR FIN ARRANCA DOLE</H2>
Carlos A. Ball*<br>
<p>
MIAMI (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- El 5 de agosto en Chicago, el candidato republicano Bob Dole
comenz su discurso anunciando su plan de crecimiento econmico de la
siguiente forma: "Es estupendo estar aqu. Estupendo poder dar este discurso
antes que Bill Clinton obtenga una copia y trate de darlo l". Clara manera
de decir que desde que comenz la campaa el presidente Clinton, con
habilidad de camalen, se ha apoderado de una tras otra bandera republicana.
<dd>	
La ms importantes de esas banderas hasta la fecha haba sido la reforma de
la beneficencia pblica, ante el fracaso de una billonaria poltica que
lejos de sacar de la pobreza a los ms desdichados ha institucionalizado la
dependencia, creando consecutivas generaciones de personas que no trabajan y
de nias solteras teniendo hijos. La decisin de traspasar el dinero y la
responsabilidad a los estados, a la vez de la imposicin de un lmite mximo
de por vida de cinco aos en la dependencia de la caridad pblica significa
la aceptacin de una doctrina antagnica a la filosofa de la izquierda
estadounidense, hasta ahora consentida por la administracin Clinton. Es
ms, al presidente anunciar que no vetara -como antes lo hizo- la reforma
de la beneficencia propuesta por los republicanos, ello motiv a muchos
congresistas demcratas a apoyarla tambin, conscientes de la proximidad de
elecciones legislativas en noviembre y de que el pas entero se ha movido a
la derecha.
<dd>	
En su discurso, Dole agarr y corri con la bandera que mejor define a los
republicanos: bajos impuestos como camino hacia un gobierno ms pequeo y
limitado. Continu diciendo: "este es un discurso que Bill Clinton jams
podr dar". Y resumi su programa as:<ul>
<li>Equilibrar el presupuesto.
<li>Reducirle el peso de los impuestos a la clase media.
<li>Proveer nuevas oportunidades educativas a los americanos.
<li>Reformar el sistema fracturado de litigios y demandas.
<li>Acabar con regulaciones federales innecesarias.
<li>Y restaurar la promesa del sueo americano.
</ul><dd>	
Dole dijo que los americanos son corredores olmpicos con un peso de 50
libras en las piernas y ya es tiempo de deshacernos de cadenas y grilletes,
haciendo referencia a las mltiples ataduras impuestas por el gobierno.
Segn Dole, la "clintoeconoma" ha aplastado la clase media con altos
impuestos y bajo crecimiento.
<dd>	
As como en Amrica Latina los polticos tratan de ganarse a los pobres,
que son mayora, en este pas el grueso del voto est en la clase media y
las estadsticas favorecen a Dole porque desde que Clinton ocupa la Casa
Blanca los ingresos del gobierno federal han aumentado en $322.000 millones
(29%) y la recaudacin de impuestos federales por cada persona aument a
$5.365 o 25% desde 1992. En ese mismo perodo el ingreso por trabajador
aument slo en 10%. Dole afirma que es "increble que la familia ahora
gasta ms en impuestos que en el total por alimentos, ropa y vivienda".
<dd>	
Las medidas concretas que propone incluyen una reduccin general de 15% (en
tres aos) en las tasas de impuesto personal. Un crdito fiscal de $500 por
cada nio menor de 18 aos. Reduccin de 50% del impuesto de ganancias de
capital (de 28% a 14%) para motivar la reinversin en las pequeas empresas
que aportan tres de cada cuatro nuevos empleos. Ampliacin de las cuentas
individuales de pensiones, libres de impuestos para que la gente ahorre ms.
Y, por ltimo, insistir que el Congreso imponga una super mayora de 60%
para cualquier futuro aumento de impuestos.
<dd>
Promete no descansar hasta que todo el sistema impositivo sea reemplazado
por uno ms simple, ms justo y ms plano. Dole dijo que hoy la  opresiva
oficina del impuesto es el doble de grande que la CIA y cinco veces ms
grande que el FBI. Cumplir con las leyes impositivas requiere el trabajo a
tiempo completo de casi tres millones de personas, ms que todos los
miembros de las fuerzas armadas. "Soy optimista, creo que los funcionarios
del impuesto pueden ser entrenados para que hagan cosas provechosas... y
comenzar pasando la carga de las pruebas a los fiscales para de nuevo
presumir la inocencia de los ciudadanos hasta que se compruebe lo contrario
acabar con las auditoras tipo KGB mi administracin liberar a los
americanos de la tirana de los impuestos el objetivo es crear un
crecimiento econmico de 3,5% o ms al ao y la historia muestra que los
recortes de impuestos estimulan el crecimiento y aumentan la recaudacin".
Dole termin su discurso citando a Winston Churchill, pero oigo ms bien un
eco de las  propuestas de Steve Forbes, a quien duramente combati en las
primarias.
<dd>
Es difcil confiar en los polticos y los de Estados Unidos no son muy
diferentes. Bush prometi no aumentar los impuestos y Clinton prometi
rebajarlos. Ninguno de los dos cumpli su palabra. Pero indudablemente que
Bob Dole por fin ha logrado obtener la atencin del electorado; la campaa
se vuelve interesante y ms importante an que el nombramiento del candidato
republicano a la vicepresidencia sera que se designara a Steve Forbes como
secretario del Tesoro. Pase lo que pase fue l quien coloc a los impuestos
en el tapete. <p>

<title>
BUCARAM, UN PRESIDENTE FOLKLORICO 
-- 
11/14/96
</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<blockquote><blockquote>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>
November 14
, 1996</i><br>
<h2>
BUCARAM, UN PRESIDENTE FOLKLORICO 
</h2>
Franklin Lpez B.*
<br>
<p>
NUEVA ORLEANS (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Se dice que Abdal Bucaram, el nuevo presidente del
Ecuador "tendr un xito absoluto o ser un fracaso rotundo". El problema de
la incertidumbre se basa ms en el fraccionamiento de las fuerzas polticas
ecuatorianas que en la inhabilidad del presidente en especificar un plan
coherente de trabajo. 
<p>
En primer lugar, el sistema poltico ecuatoriano est diseado para la
inercia. Los grupos dominantes tienen capturada a la dirigencia poltica y
civil de tal manera que es prcticamente imposible iniciar cambios
radicales. El Congreso ocupa su tiempo en discusiones intiles; cuando
logran reunir qurum inician juicios polticos con el nico objetivo de
empantanar la accin del Ejecutivo y si a eso sumamos las acciones
obstaculizadoras de un sector judicial politizado es fcil concluir que el
statu quo tiene todas las de ganar.  
<p>
                En segundo lugar, existe en el pas una enorme desconfianza
del "neoliberalismo".  Inclusive la Conferencia Episcopal se ha declarado en
contra del neoliberalismo "salvaje". Los sindicatos, los grupos indgenas,
la Unin Nacional de Educadores, las asociaciones estudiantiles
universitarias, los empleados del gobierno nacional, de las provincias y
municipios tienen un formidable poder de convocatoria; cuando perciben una
amenaza a sus intereses salen a las calles en manifestaciones violentas,
cierran carreteras, crean disturbios o se declaran en huelga, lo que en el
Ecuador significa la toma de las instalaciones y la interrupcin de las
labores ordinarias. Los dirigentes slo necesitan enarbolar la etiqueta
"neoliberalismo" para impedir cualquier cambio que no les convenga. 
Tercero, los partidos polticos, tanto de izquierda como de derecha,
realizan clculos polticos para el siguiente perodo. Cuentan con que el
gobierno de turno se desgaste y as poder llegar al poder.  An ms,
propician el descontento con quejas sobre las partidas presupuestarias o
sobre los nombramientos de gobernadores u otras autoridades y lo hacen desde
el Congreso o mediante paros de ciudades y pueblos. 
<p>
                Frente a esta realidad no es mucho lo pueda hacer un
presidente, inclusive uno con el temperamento de Bucaram.  Adems, Bucaram
se topa con elementos endgenos que van hacer su labor an ms difcil.
Entre sus opositores estn los que han llegado a sus actuales posiciones por
su afiliacin poltica, aquellos que no tienen otra ideologa que la de
disfrutar del cargo pblico, aquellos que creen que "hacer gobierno"
significa "hacer de las suyas", aquellos que dicen defender los intereses
del pueblo sin comprender el alcance de sus propuestas. Y de todos estos
est llena la administracin actual. 
<p>
                Otro elemento endgeno es el folklorismo ecuatoriano, de lo
cual no se escapa ni el mismo presidente: un da se cree Julio Iglesias,
otro da se corta el bigote en subasta, un da regala su salario a los
mendigos, otro da llama "burro" a un ex presidente y luego pide disculpas a
los burros. La caracterstica primordial de lo folklrico es el simbolismo;
es decir, es ms importante la forma que el fondo, valen ms las intenciones
que los resultados.  En lo folklrico dominan las imgenes y los espejos;
los mitos y los espejismos sustituyen a la realidad. Poco importan los
hechos, lo esencial son las emociones. El Ecuador es un pas folklrico por
antonomasia, por eso algunos comentaristas lo han llamado Absurdistn o pas
de Ripley. Un ejemplo basta: el ao pasado, una organizacin llamada Manos
Limpias decidi "limpiar" los tribunales, cmo?, pues con escobas y baldes
de agua. Lo importante, repito, es el simbolismo, las intenciones, "sentirse
bien".  Hoy el folklore ha llegado al poder con todo su colorido, pompa y
esplendor. 
<p>
                El tercer elemento endgeno es la tendencia al
autoritarismo. Se militarizan las aduanas, se cierran los locales que venden
licor, se aprehende a muchachos de pelo largo, se amenaza con la crcel a
los especuladores, se cancela sbitamente un contrato con una empresa de
petrleos; en definitiva, la tnica que va apareciendo es que el "que no
est conmigo est contra m".  Claro que esto es comprensible frente a los
factores antes mencionados, pero me temo que ms que ser producto de la
frustracin es el resultado de una tendencia natural del temperamento del
presidente hacia "hacer lo que le da la gana". 
<p>
  Pero no todo est perdido. Aunque en menor grado, hay factores de cambio
hacia un mundo mejor. Entre stos es importante la actitud de Bucaram hacia
la bsqueda de soluciones prcticas y sus sueos de reeleccin. Aunque no
tiene una ideologa definida, Bucaram es  sincero en su afn de lucha contra
lo que l percibe como "oligarquas", los grupos de poder que se amamantan
de la teta del estado. Intuye el problema sin comprenderlo en su totalidad y
por ello se ha rodeado de individuos que tienen un visin bastante liberal.
En lo econmico el ms conocido es Domingo Cavallo, pero tambin hay
asesores chilenos para reformar el seguro social, bolivianos para la
capitalizacin de las empresas estatales y as algunos cambios se  realizarn. 
En conclusin, la presidencia de Abdal Bucaram no ser ni de grandes
transformaciones ni de grandes desastres.

<h2>RNC TALKING POINTS:<br>
TOP TEN REASONS TO BALANCE THE BUDGET </h2>
</center>
<hr>
<br> 
As conferees from both Houses of Congress meet to reconcile 
differences between the recently passed House and Senate budget 
resolutions, it is important to remember why we must balance the budget 
and what a balanced budget will mean to all of us. We've heard the 
arguments from Bill Clinton and the Democratic leadership in Congress 
about why we can't balance the budget by 2002 and why we can't reduce 
spending. Given the doom and gloom rhetoric coming from their corner, 
many Americans may be wondering why we would want to balance 
the budget at all. Here are ten good reasons: <p>
A balanced budget will reduce the burden of debt on our children. The 
national debt is now $4.8 trillion. A child born today will pay $187,000 
in taxes over his or her lifetime -- just to pay the interest on that debt. 
That's more than $3,500 in taxes every year of their working lives to 
pay for our debt. And if we do nothing, that debt will balloon to nearly $8 
trillion in 15 years (source: Joint Economic Committee of Congress). <p>
A balanced budget will enable us to return to the American people more 
of their hard-earned tax dollars. Federal taxes as a share of median family 
income have steadily increased from 5% in 1950 to almost 25% today. In 
fact, if the average family today paid the same percentage of their income 
in taxes as their parents did, they would have roughly $10,000 more to 
spend at the end of the year. As we balance the budget, we can reduce the 
tax burden on families (sources: Heritage Foundation and Cato Institute). <p> 
A balanced budget will bring down interest rates. Deficit spending raises 
interest rates as government borrows more. A balanced federal budget 
will result in a drop in interest rates of approximately two percentage 
points or more. This will mean a savings of $37,440 on a $75,000, 30-
year home mortgage. It will mean a savings of $900 on a $15,000 car 
loan. Everything you borrow money for will cost less (source: Joint 
Economic Committee of Congress). <p> 
A balanced budget will increase economic growth. Time magazine 
reports (see attached article) that Roger Brinner, chief economist with the 
forecasting firm of DRI/McGraw-Hill, estimates balancing the budget 
would raise America's yearly output an extra 2.5% over the next 10 years. 
That would mean an average of an extra $1,000 a year for each American 
family. <p>
A balanced budget will create more jobs. Economic growth means more 
jobs, and a balanced budget is estimated to result in 6.1 million more jobs 
over the next ten years (source: Joint Economic Committee of Congress). <p>
A balanced budget will increase our standard of living. The nonpartisan 
Concord Coalition concludes that without deficit spending and debt, the 
average family income today would be $50,000 instead of $35,000.  
When asked what a balanced budget will mean for most Americans, Alan 
Greenspan, Chairman of the Federal Reserve, told Congress: "I think 
their real incomes and purchasing power of their real incomes would 
significantly improve ... they would look forward to their children doing 
better than they." <p>
A balanced budget will strengthen the American dollar. Clinton's deficits 
have been driving the U.S. dollar to record lows, and the most dramatic 
drop was right after he and the Democrats in Congress defeated the 
balanced budget amendment. The devaluation of our currency ultimately 
leads to a lower standard of living. But the passage of Republican 
bills in Congress to balance the budget has caused the dollar to bounce 
back. As The Washington Post reported 5/19/95, "The U.S. dollar has 
rebounded in foreign exchange markets during the past several weeks, in 
part because of a growing belief among foreign investors that the United 
States is moving to put its economic house in order." <p> 
A balanced budget will ensure that our retirement programs are safe. 
Medicare and Social Security are programs that seniors have paid into all 
their lives, and we must be able to meet our commitments to them. 
Younger people paying into these programs now must also be assured 
that the funds will be there for them when they retire. The only way to 
preserve and protect these programs is to balance the federal budget 
once and for all, so we will always have the necessary resources 
available. As Bob Myers, long-time Chief Actuary of the Social Security 
Administration has said: "If we continue to run federal deficits year after 
year, and if interest payments continue to rise at an alarming rate, we 
will face two dangerous possibilities. Either we will raid the trust funds to 
pay for our current profligacy, or we will print money, dishonestly 
inflating our way out of indebtedness. Both cases would devastate the 
real value of the social security trust funds." <p> 
A balanced budget will allow us to spend money on programs we need, 
rather than interest on the debt. If we do nothing, entitlements and interest 
on the debt will consume all tax revenues in just 17 years. Balancing the 
budget will ensure the federal government has the money it needs to 
defend our country, fund education, build roads and perform other 
necessary and important functions of government (source: Entitlement 
Commission). <p> 
A balanced budget will restore the American Dream. Rising interest rates, 
higher taxes, and stagnant wages are robbing us of the American Dream. 
Since the early 1970s when government spending began to balloon, 
Americans' incomes have stayed flat. In 1993, the first year of 
Clintonomics, median family income declined by $709 (source: U.S. 
Census Bureau). If we balance the federal budget, interest rates 
will drop, taxes can be lowered, and wages will increase. In short, we will 
restore the American Dream for millions of hard-working American 
families.  <p>

<H2>LIBERALISMO</H2>
Franklin Lpez B.*<br>
<p>



NUEVA ORLEANS (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).-- No cabe duda que el Estado intervencionista,
estabilizador, asistencialista, planificador e igualitario result ser un
fracaso. La cada del muro de Berln y el desmantelamiento de la Unin
Sovitica fueron manifestaciones fehacientes del desencanto de los pueblos
con el modelo estatista y socialista. Ese desencanto no se circunscribe a
los antiguos pases comunistas sino que se extiende a todos los confines de
la tierra.<p>
Pero las reformas poltico-econmicas que se han instrumentado en muchos
pases, aunque con diversos matices conceptuales, lamentablemente se han
aglutinado todas bajo la etiqueta de liberalismo o neoliberalismo.  As se
calific la poltica de Collor de Mello en Brasil, la de Carlos Andrs Prez
en Venezuela, la de Salinas de Gortari en Mxico, la de Fujimori en el Per
y la de Carlos Menem de Argentina. Si bien es cierto que algunas de esas
polticas tienen un corte liberal, no es menos cierto que la praxis
poltico-econmica de estos regmenes no goza de una cohesin conceptual
liberal autntica. Por eso, muchos no saben o confunden lo que es y lo que
propone el liberalismo.  <p>
     	Para algunos, la alternativa frente al fracaso del Estado
intervencionista es el caos, el desorden, la anarqua, la ley de la selva,
en otras palabras el "capitalismo salvaje" que supuestamente resultara de
la aplicacin del liberalismo manchesteriano o anarco-capitalista.  Nada ms
lejos de la realidad. El liberalismo es una doctrina de Estado, cuyo fin
primordial consiste en crear y defender un marco legal e institucional en el
cual florece la libertad individual. Carlos Alberto Montaner escribe: "El
liberalismo es un modo de entender la naturaleza humana y una propuesta para
conseguir que las personas alcancen el ms alto nivel de prosperidad
potencial que posean, dentro del mayor marco de libertad".<p>
     	El liberalismo busca una sociedad en la cual cada individuo tenga la
potestad de elegir los medios que ms le convengan para obtener sus propios
fines, sabiendo que tal esfuerzo conduce a mejorar las condiciones del resto
de la sociedad, siempre y cuando se respeten los derechos de terceros. El
economista espaol Pedro Schwartz afirma: "Nosotros [los liberales] no nos
ocupamos del individuo, que sabe lo que quiere, que lleva su propia vida la
mayor parte de las veces con buen seso; nos preocupamos del Estado, por las
razones de su existencia, por la necesidad de que funcione bien, por el
temor de que se desve de su tarea para convertirse en un mecanismo opresor".<p>
     	Frecuentemente, de buena o mala fe, se confunde al liberalismo con el
mercantilismo, donde los que gozan de poder econmico se asocian a quienes
ejercen el poder poltico para disfrutar de privilegios,  protecciones,
crditos blandos, monopolios y dems ventajas en perjuicio del bolsillo y de
la libertad de seleccin de los consumidores, es decir, del pueblo.
En cualquier caso, el libre mercado es slo un aspecto del pensamiento
liberal. El liberalismo implica libertad poltica y econmica, propiedad
privada e imperio de la ley, estabilidad fiscal y transparente
administracin de la justicia, moneda sana y orden pblico, defensa nacional
y libertad de comercio, tanto en el mbito nacional como internacional. Ser
liberal no es slo amar la libertad para tener la oportunidad de prosperar,
es ser tolerante de los gustos, flaquezas y prioridades de los dems,
defender el individualismo y propugnar la privatizacin de las empresas
pblicas. Es todo eso y mucho ms. Ser liberal es creer en los dems, en la
dignidad y diversidad del hombre.<p>
Estas condiciones no son producto del sentido comn ni son verdades
absolutas o evidentes. Son resultado de la discusin, del debate, de la
experiencia de otras naciones y del estudio. Ningn liberal argumenta ser
dueo de la verdad. Es posible acercarse a ella a travs de la duda,
buscando su confirmacin o su negacin en el quehacer humano y en la
experiencia de la vida diaria. Tal es la esencia del liberalismo verdadero. * <i><center>*Economista ecuatoriano, profesor de la Universidad de Nueva Orleans. </center><i><p>

<H2>LA FALACIA DE LA VENTANA ROTA</H2>
Walter Williams*<br>
<p>
FAIRFAX, VIRGINIA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--
Con cada leda de "Economa en una leccin",
escrito por el ya fallecido Henry Hazlitt, quedo ms impresionado por la
manera clara que este economista y periodista entenda los fundamentos de la
economa y con la agudeza de su ingenio.
<P>En el cuento de Hazlitt sobre la ventana rota, unos maleantes tiran una
piedra y rompen la ventana de una panadera. El panadero sale enfurecido,
pero alguien le dice que lo sucedido tiene su lado bueno. Los $250 que
cuesta reemplazar la vidriera le dar trabajo al cortador de vidrios.
Despus de todo, si las ventanas nunca se rompieran, qu sucedera con el
negocio de los vidrios? Al panadero tambin le recuerdan el efecto
multiplicador. El vidriero tendr $250 para gastar en otros comercios y
estos comerciantes gastarn a la vez ese dinero, continuando la cadena. Uno
podra entonces concluir que los maleantes lejos de ser una amenaza pblica
son benefactores de la sociedad.
<P>Hazlitt dice que la primera conclusin es correcta. El vidriero no va a
estar ms apesadumbrado por el vandalismo de esos muchachos que el dueo de
la funeraria por la muerte de alguien. Al panadero, sin embargo, le va a
costar $250 que pensaba ms bien gastarse en la compra de un traje nuevo. La
ganancia del vidriero va a ser a costa del sastre. Desde el punto de vista
de la comunidad, esta se empobrece por el valor de un traje que hubiera sido
confeccionado. Es fcil concluir que el vandalismo estimula la economa
porque se ver la nueva ventana, pero como el panadero no puede ahora
comprase el traje, el desempleo del sastre resulta invisible.
<P>Hay muchas maneras en que se nos engaa con diferentes versiones de la
falacia de la ventana rota. Algunos maestros ensean que aunque la Segunda
Guerra Mundial fue espantosa, nos sac de la Gran Depresin. No es as. Hubo
un incremento en la demanda por armamentos y Estados Unidos tena los
recursos para fabricar el equipo de guerra. Pero esos recursos hubieran
podido ser utilizados en fabricar casas, automviles y neveras.
<P>Una variante de la falacia de la ventana rota es cuando el alcalde, los
jefes sindicales y la cmara de comercio nos dicen que tenemos que gastar
dinero proveniente de los impuestos para construir un centro de
conferencias, un estadio o un puente, por los empleos que se crearan. Los
impuestos provienen de los contribuyentes. Si los contribuyentes no se ven
obligados a pagar esos impuestos gastarn su dinero en carros, muebles, la
remodelacin de sus casas y dems cosas que tambin crean empleo. As que al
igual que en el cuento de la ventana rota, algunos empleos se crean,
mientras que otros desaparecen o no se llegan a crear. La ventaja para los
polticos que fomentan el gasto pblico es que los empleos creados son
visibles, mientras los que se eliminan o no se llegan a crear resultan
invisibles.
<P>El Seguro Social es otra variante de la falacia de la ventana rota. Los que
apoyan el sistema se maravillan de los beneficios. No tienen idea cunto
mejor estaran si hubieran colocado ese dinero en planes privados de
pensiones. Entonces, entre los beneficios tendramos una tasa nacional de
ahorro superior, una tasa mayor de inversin, un producto interno bruto 18%
ms grande, segn algunas estimaciones. Todo eso es invisible, mientras que
los cheques del Seguro Social son visibles.
<P>Leer a Hazlitt lo convertira a usted en una persona mejor informada que la
mayora de los economistas.

RESULTADOS DE LA AYUDA EXTERNA

<p>
BALTIMORE <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- El presidente francs, Jacques Chirac, ha debido
considerar inhspito a Washington, cuando recientemente se dirigi a una
sesin conjunta del Congreso. Pocos senadores y representantes hicieron acto
de presencia, enviando ms bien a sus asistentes.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Aparentemente ignorando el desaire, Chirac procedi a aleccionar al
auditorio sobre las equivocaciones de la poltica exterior de Estados
Unidos. Trat de colocar una pesada culpa sobre nuestros hombros por no
gastar ms en ayuda externa: "No abandonemos a su suerte a los pases ms
pobres de la tierra, especialmente a los pases del Africa. No los dejemos
en el crculo vicioso de la exclusin, permitiendo se agoten las fuentes de
asistencia oficial, ayuda que es indispensable para que avancen hacia la
democracia y el desarrollo".
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ese argumento ha sido utilizado por los franceses y otros europeos por
aos. Desde la Sptima Sesin especial de las Naciones Unidas en 1975, los
europeos han adoptado el objetivo de la ONU, en cuanto a que las naciones
desarrolladas deben transferir 0,7% de su PIB a los pases en desarrollo. En
conjunto, los pases industrializados derraman ms de $50.000 millones al
ao sobre las naciones pobres. Tales transferencias corresponden a ms o
menos 9% del PIB de esas naciones subdesarrolladas. Dinamarca, Noruega,
Suecia y Holanda sobrepasan la norma de la ONU y Francia casi si la alcanza.
Estados Unidos es el rezagado, al tranferir algo ms del 0,1% de su PIB,
convirtindose en blanco seguro de los fanticos de la ayuda externa.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Lo que hace ridcula esta situacin es que ninguno de los donantes se ha
molestado en averiguar si su generosidad logra algn bien. Por el contrario,
los benefactores se han opuesto abiertamente a todo anlisis econmico
objetivo sobre la ayuda externa, mientras apoyan los rebuznos de acadmicos
que predican gastadas frases sobre el tema.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Un destacado crtico que no ha sido silenciado es lord Peter Bauer del
London School of Economics. Por dcadas las investigaciones de P.T. Bauer
han revelado con detalle el dao infligido por la ayuda externa. El ao
pasado se le uni otro economista del London School of Economics, Peter
Boone, quien public un esplndido anlisis cuantitativo sobre la
efectividad de la ayuda externa para la Oficina Nacional de Investigaciones
Econmicas. Boone hace picadillo del sermn de Chirac.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Utilizando estadsticas de 97 pases receptores de ayuda exterior, Boone
concluye:
<p> No existe relacin alguna entre los niveles de ayuda y las tasas de
crecimiento de los pases receptores, implicando que falta de capital no es
una causa fundamental de pobreza.
<p> La ayuda externa no tiene impacto alguno en reducir las tasas de impuestos
o eliminando otras polticas distorsionantes que retrasan el crecimiento en
las naciones pobres.
<p> La ayuda externa logra un impacto insignificante en mejorar las mediciones
bsicas de desarrollo humano, tales como la mortalidad infantil y el
porcentaje de nios en las escuelas.
<p> La ayuda externa es muy efectiva aumentando el tamao del gobierno y
llenndole los bolsillos a las elites de los pases receptores. 75% de la
ayuda externa se utiliza para aumentar los gastos gubernamentales, lo cual
aumenta el clientelismo y el poder de funcionarios y polticos. La situacin
de la gente pasa a depender de la poltica gubernamental y de decisiones
oficiales. Esto distrae la energa empresarial de sus actividades privadas
para concentrarlas en la obtencin de favores, privilegios y corrupcin.<p>
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Quizs porque tambin son polticos, pocos dirigentes de los pases ricos
se han dado cuenta que la ayuda externa hace ms dao que bien. A la fecha
slo un lder ha captado el efecto corrosivo de la ayuda externa y ha tenido
el coraje de denunciarla. Vclav Klaus, primer ministro de la Repblica
Checa dijo: "No slo nos ufanamos de poderlo lograr nosotros mismos, sino
que estamos profundamente convencidos que tal ayuda es negativa y
contraproducente". Esa actitud ayuda a comprender porqu ese es el pas
excomunista ms exitoso.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Hasta Francia se est viendo obligada a reducir su ayuda externa para
ceirse a los criterios del Tratado de Maastricht. Eso ser bueno para
Francia y mejor para los pases que estn siendo corrompidos por la ayuda
francesa.&copy; <p>

<h2>
UN DEPARTAMENTO DE ESTADO VERDE
</h2>     
     
     
James H. Sheehan*
<p>

WASHINGTON <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- El secretario de Estado Warren Christopher ha declarado
la proteccin mundial del medio ambiente como principio fundamental de la
poltica exterior de Estados Unidos. En discursos recientes, el Sr.
Christopher anunci la "Iniciativa Ambiental para el siglo XXI", como agenda
ambiciosa de las iniciativas diplomticas verdes que tiene la intencin de
promover con renovado vigor por todo el mundo.
<dd>	Esta poltica ha sido "considerablemente influenciada" por el
vicepresidente Al Gore, de donde provienen muchas de las iniciativas
ambientales de la administracin Clinton. Tal influencia comenz con el
nombramiento de Tim Wirth al cargo de subsecretario de Estado para asuntos
mundiales. Ms recientemente, Christopher orden el comienzo de la promocin
de una ideologa amistosa hacia la Tierra por parte del Departamento de
Estado. Y en marzo hizo un peregrinaje a Brasil para demostrar su compromiso
con los bosques tropicales.
<dd>	La administracin Clinton est usando el medio ambiente como tema para
atacar al Congreso Republicano y sus abortados planes de reformar la
poltica ambiental y de recortar el presupuesto en esta rea. Creyendo que
el ambientalismo es un buen tema electoral, Christopher ha propuesto
restricciones internacionales a los bosques, ocanos y al uso de materias
qumicas. Los activistas ambientales aplauden estas propuestas como un muy
esperado adelanto. Pero no van a ser muy populares entre el pblico. Muchos
estadounidenses se voltearon contra Clinton en las ltimas elecciones
parlamentarias porque medidas excesivas de este tipo daan la economa y
devalan sus propiedades. La terca insistencia en este tema muestra la
inconexin del gobierno con el votante comn.
<dd>	Mientras los estadounidenses han sealado sus deseos de menores impuestos y
un gobierno ms pequeo, el Departamento de Estado exige ms dinero para ser
gastado en programas burocrticos de las Naciones Unidas y del Banco
Mundial. Los estadounidenses no quieren gastar el dinero de sus impuestos
para sostener a gobiernos extranjeros ni para subsidiar a las grandes
corporaciones.
<dd>	Luego de un invierno congelado, el Departamento de Estado apoya
restricciones a la utilizacin de energa a travs del Tratado de las
Naciones Unidas sobre Cambio Climtico. Se estima que las propuestas del
Departamento de Estado para regular el uso de combustibles como el petrleo
y el carbn costarn 600.000 puestos de trabajo y aadirn un dlar al
precio de cada galn de gasolina. La protesta pblica por el costo de la
gasolina recientemente llev al Congreso a tratar de rebajar los impuestos
aumentados por Clinton. Si la utilizacin de combustibles contribuye al
efecto invernadero, entonces el viento polar que sopla sobre Estados Unidos
durante el invierno debiera ser menos fro en vez de ms fro.
<dd>	El Departamento de Estado quiere que el Senado ratifique el Tratado de
Biodiversidad, que contiene clusulas sobre inventarios nacionales de la
flora y la fauna, reviviendo viejas propuestas de planificacin central por
parte de los gobiernos sobre el uso de la tierra. Adems de imponer onerosas
regulaciones a la biotecnologa, la ratificacin del Senado obligara a los
contribuyentes a subsidiar restricciones similares en pases extranjeros.
<dd>	La agenda verde del secretario Christopher incluye la participacin de
Estados Unidos en la reciente Cumbre de la Ciudad, Habitat II, llevada a
cabo en Estambul. Esta fue otra de una serie de conferencias de las Naciones
Unidas sobre el ambiente, la poblacin, la pobreza y los derechos de las
mujeres. En Estambul se trat de conseguir el consenso de que el "desarrollo
sostenible" se convierta en principio fundamental en el desarrollo de las
ciudades y, al igual que en las anteriores conferencias, las discusiones
tuvieron que ver con la redistribucin mundial del ingreso y mayor
intervencin de los gobiernos en la economa.
<dd>	El intento de la administracin Clinton de mezclar cuestiones ambientales
con relaciones diplomticas est destinado al fracaso. Los estadounidenses
no favorecen mayores gastos en programas internacionales. Aunque algunos
gobiernos extranjeros sern tentados a colaborar con el presidente Clinton,
con la esperanza de recibir asistencia financiera, otros se darn cuenta que
las consecuencias de tales imposiciones ambientales conllevan costosas
restricciones al crecimiento econmico y al desarrollo. A fin de cuentas,
todo eso representa niveles inaceptables de intervencin extranjera en los
asuntos internos de naciones soberanas e independientes. &copy;

<h2>
MODERNISMO DESCONCERTANTE
</h2>

Walter Williams*
<p>

FAIRFAX, VIRGINIA <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Tener 60 aos significa pertenecer a otra
generacin y tener problemas ajustndose a la vida moderna. No vivimos en
una poca donde el sentido comn y la responsabilidad personal se dan por
sentado.
<dd>	Hace unas semanas mi esposa me compr un mueble de madera sin pulir para mi
oficina, con la esperanza de que se viera ms ordenada. Como persona
razonable proced a leer las instrucciones en la lata del tinte para la
madera, antes de comenzar a aplicarlo. La etiqueta tiene la siguiente
advertencia: "No se ingiera". Y me pregunt, hay gente capaz de agarrar una
lata de tintura para madera y empinrsela? Alguien suficientemente estpido
para hacer eso seguramente no sabe leer. Por qu , entonces, tal
advertencia? Me imagino que los abogados de la firma fabricante temen que
alguien se tome el contenido y demande a la empresa, consiguiendo varios
millones con la decisin de un juez que la culpe por la estupidez del
demandante.
<dd>	Tambin est el asunto de la juventud estadounidense. Me he pasado la vida
adorando a los nios, no a todos, pero s a la mayora. Ahora los nios se
han convertido en mis enemigos. Los nios permiten ser utilizados como
herramientas de un gobierno entrometido. Apenas alguien habla de dar menos
dinero del gobierno para los almuerzos escolares, alguien se monta con un
nio en el escenario y grita, "pretenden matar de hambre a este nio
inocente!" Cuando se hacen esfuerzos por reformar la beneficencia pblica
haciendo trabajar a quienes sean fsicamente capaces de hacerlo, lo primero
que omos son gritos contra "los hambreadores de nios y madres indefensas".
Cuando los tiranos en el Congreso quieren restringir por la fuerza lo que
podemos ver en la televisin y en el Internet o prohibir a adultos que fumen
si les da la gana, de nuevo son los nios los que usan como instrumentos.
<dd>	Si los nios quieren recobrar mi cario y mi fe en ellos tienen que dejar
de ser utilizados como armas por tales granujas. Los nios deben convocar
una rueda de prensa y decirle a la nacin que si alguien quiere saber lo que
ellos piensan tienen que preguntrselo a ellos y no a quienes se han
autodenominado sus representantes y defensores.
<dd>	Otro problema de desajuste a mi edad es que no s tratar a las damas como
si fueran hombres. Cuando viajo en transporte pblico, suelo ofrecer mi
asiento a una seora, si no hay otro puesto disponible. Cuando camino por la
acera con una dama, tomo instintivamente el lado de la calle y le abro las
puertas que encontremos. Algunas lo ven como caballerosidad, mientras que
ahora otras se ofenden, sintiendo que trato de insultarlas. Cmo distinguir
de antemano a las damas de las mujeres?
<dd>	Adems est el asunto de las razas. Los expertos ahora dicen que la
patologa de la vida de muchos negros es el resultado de un legado de
esclavitud, segregacin y racismo. Por eso muchos jvenes negros no saben
leer ni escribir, prolifera entre ellos el delito y menos del 40% crecen en
un hogar con padre y madre. 
<dd>	Pero en 1950, cuando yo estudiaba en la escuela pblica Benjamin Franklin
del norte de Filadelfia, no sabamos de ningn nio que no supiera leer y
escribir. A partir de 1870, la mayora de los nios negros vivan en hogares
con su pap y su mam. Los barrios negros, incluyendo el vecindario de
viviendas gubernamentales donde yo viva, eran suficientemente seguros como
para dormir con todas las puertas y ventanas abiertas durante los meses
calurosos del verano. Cmo engrana eso con lo que dicen ahora los expertos
raciales en cuanto a que la esclavitud y el racismo son las causas de los
problemas actuales? La nica explicacin es que los efectos de la esclavitud
y el racismo saltan generaciones enteras, afectando a la de hoy, pero no a
la de ayer. Nada de eso suena muy lgico, no es verdad?&copy

<title>VENEZUELA: DESAPARECEN LAS IMPORTACIONES LEGALES -- 11/14/96</title>
</head>

<i>November 14, 1996</i><br>
<h2>VENEZUELA: DESAPARECEN LAS IMPORTACIONES LEGALES
</h2>
Vladimir Chelminski*<br>
<p>
CARACAS (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- El comercio irregular de mercancas importadas, en
particular de los equipos de oficina, mdicos, de sonido y vdeo, las
neveras, cocinas, lavadoras, etc. alcanza  hoy niveles sin precedentes en
Venezuela. Tan grave es el problema que conocidas empresas multinacionales
como Sony, Panasonic, Hitachi, Compact, Hewlett Packard, Phillips, Epson,
que ofrecen sus productos cumpliendo con todas las leyes, se estn
preparando para marcharse y abandonar sus operaciones en el pas.
<p>
Por comercio irregular me refiero a mercancas de contrabando que no pagan
aranceles que promedian 20%, bienes robados o utilizados como pretexto para
lavar dinero proveniente del trfico internacional de estupefacientes,
tambin artculos de segunda mano que son vendidos como nuevos o
comercializados evadiendo el IVA de 16,5%, impuesto que en ciertos renglones
llega hasta 36,5%.  Este mercado negro que se ha disparado en Venezuela este
ao atenta contra la viabilidad del comercio establecido y muchos de los
compradores no tienen idea de la procedencia de lo que adquieren ni
sospechan la posibilidad de futuros problemas, en cuanto a calidad y
garantas de servicio y repuestos.
<p>
Con la progresiva desaparicin de los representantes y distribuidores
legtimos de esas marcas tiende tambin a desaparecer el personal entrenado
para cumplir con la garanta y reparacin de bienes costosos, como
computadoras y televisores, a la vez que la ciudadana se va acostumbrando
tanto a la corrupcin oficial como al incumplimiento de la ley, aceptando la
evidente ausencia de seguridad jurdica.
<p>
Segn estadsticas presentadas por el Consejo Nacional del Comercio y los
Servicios, las ventas al detal durante el primer semestre de este ao
cayeron en Venezuela 50%, comparadas con el mismo semestre del ao pasado;
la venta de vehculos cay en 65% y la venta de alimentos se redujo en 35%.
No se conoce la proporcin de esas ventas que ahora se realizan en la
economa informal.
<p>
La Cmara de Comercio de Caracas apoya la reforma de las aduanas anunciada
por las autoridades porque suele tomar 10 a 15 das retirar mercancas de
los puertos venezolanos. La reforma apunta a la simplificacin y aceleracin
de los trmites. Se oponen los que hoy viven  del robo de mercancas
almacenadas en los puertos y de la extorsin a los importadores para
agilizar complicados y anticuados trmites oficiales.
<p>
Cuando Transparency International, prestigiosa institucin alemana,
cataloga a Venezuela reiteradamente como uno de los pases ms corruptos de
Amrica Latina y del mundo, lo hace principalmente por la mala fama de
nuestro sistema judicial y de nuestras aduanas. Cuatro veces han fracasado
los intentos de reformar el sistema aduanal venezolano en los ltimos cuatro
aos, lo cual es indicativo del poder poltico y econmico de sus
opositores. La reforma anunciada comenzar con un plan piloto en la aduana
martima de La Guaira y se espera sea pronto extendida al resto de los
puertos y aeropuertos venezolanos.
<p>
Esta reforma es un primer paso para eliminar el contrabando que debe ser
seguido de la rebaja y unificacin de impuestos, a todas luces excesivos. El
bienestar nacional reclama la unificacin de aranceles en alrededor de 7% y
del IVA en 10%. El Fisco recaudar mucho ms cobrando 7% sobre todas las
importaciones que cobrando 20% de las que hoy cumplen con la ley. Y quienes
hoy se arriesgan pagando sobornos para evitar el pago tanto del IVA como de
los aranceles difcilmente continuaran hacindolo con impuestos razonables.
<p>
Otra fuente de fraude y corrupcin es el puerto libre de la isla de
Margarita, donde se  conceden privilegios a determinados ciudadanos que le
son negados a todos los dems. No slo los residentes de Margarita necesitan
incentivos. Incentivos tambin requieren los que han invertido a travs de
los aos en establecer sus marcas y el buen nombre de sus establecimientos
comerciales, ofreciendo el buen servicio de su personal entrenado y precios
competitivos para su clientela. Son estos los comerciantes que por la
ignorancia econmica y poca visin de legisladores y funcionarios estn
desapareciendo.

<h2>
EL CAPITALISMO CHECO
</h2>
Vclav Klaus*
<p>
WASHINGON <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.-  En 1996, por sexto ao consecutivo, en la Repblica
Checa tenemos un presupuesto equilibrado, lo cual es un logro importante. Y
eso no se trata de inventos econmicos sofisticados sino de la habilidad de
los lderes polticos en decir que no a gastos excesivos.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Han pasado casi seis aos desde que colaps el comunismo y estamos entrando
a una nueva era que llamamos postransformacin. Ya las medidas
gubernamentales importantes para la transformacin se tomaron. No prevemos
implementar nuevas medidas extraordinarias. Como suelo decir, la ciruga
termin y estamos en la sala de recuperacin. Los retos que ahora
enfrentamos y las obras por realizar son ms normales, lo que significa que
los libros de texto de economa elemental son de mayor utilidad ahora para
nosotros que hace cinco o seis aos. 
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Comenzamos todo el proceso de transformacin con una clara visin de adonde
queramos ir, basado en los principios de "laissez faire", una economa de
mercado sin adjetivos calificativos, propiedad privada, gobierno pequeo, un
estado de derecho, libertad y responsabilidad individual.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Una clara visin es absolutamente crucial, pero no es suficiente. Hay que
contar con una estrategia para instrumentar esa visin. Y no me refiero a
planes constructivistas porque sabemos que no es posible promover la mano
invisible del mercado con la mano visible de polticos o intelectuales
omnipotentes. Sabamos que tenamos que desregular, liberalizar y privatizar
en cada etapa del proceso de transformacin, an ante la realidad de un
mercado dbil y por lo tanto ineficiente. Por ello nuestra estrategia fue
flexible y pragmtica. Se trataba de un proceso evolutivo, del comunismo a
la sociedad libre, que no poda ser dictado desde arriba.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Conceptualmente era simple. Hace algunos aos se hablaba de la economa de
la transformacin, pero eso es un disparate. Es suficiente aplicar la
economa, la sociologa y las ciencias polticas normales.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
La privatizacin fue crucial y comenzamos de cero. Me daba risa cuando
algn banquero occidental me deca de la importancia de privatizar el
correo. Mi respuesta era que primero tenamos que privatizar las bodegas de
comestibles, al peluquero, al cafetn y al taller mecnico.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Las diferencias con las privatizaciones en Inglaterra son notables. All
privatizaban tres o cuatro empresas cada ao, mientras que nosotros
privatizbamos tres o cuatro empresas cada hora. Y ahora hemos alcanzado la
posicin en donde podemos discutir si vamos a privatizar 100% los
ferrocarriles o slo parcialmente.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
En cualquiera de las etapas, la nica manera de proceder es a travs de la
economa de libre mercado, con propiedad privada y precios que reflejen
libremente el valor real de las cosas. Esa es la nica manera de preservar
la humanidad y el medio ambiente. Sabemos que el mayor peligro para el medio
ambiente es la liquidacin de la propiedad privada y el rechazo de los
precios libres, como fuente de informacin para saber sobre la escasez
relativa de los diferentes recursos. Los mayores crmenes contra el medio
ambiente han ocurrido en pases donde no hay propiedad privada, mercados ni
precios.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nuestra misin ahora es defender la libertad econmica, evitando la
reaparicin del dirigismo, de intervenciones gubernamentales restrictivas e
improductivas, que ahora se presentan bajo nuevas banderas, pero que son tan
dainas como en el pasado. El peligro yace en la introduccin de nuevas
polticas basadas en los intereses de grupos de presin, en la ideologa del
corporativismo y el sindicalismo, en falsas teoras de justicia social, en
el ecologismo agresivo, etc.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Las ltimas cifras del crecimiento de la produccin industrial checa es de
21%, de la construccin 19%, mientras que el desempleo es de 2,8% y aunque
la tasa de inflacin sigue siendo exagerada - 8% -, somos el pas
excomunista con la ms baja inflacin.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Queremos seguir abriendo nuestro pas en todos los campos. En diciembre
fuimos aceptados en la OCDE, el llamado club de los pases ricos, el primer
pas excomunista que se hace miembro. Hace poco eso era apenas un sueo para
mi. Y tenemos la intencin de ser tambin miembros de la OTAN y del proceso
integracionista europeo, a pesar de las objeciones que tenemos sobre la
excesiva regulacin y control ejercido desde Bruselas. Sin embargo, queremos
ser miembros porque estamos empeados en convertirnos en una nacin europea
normal.&copy; <p>

<h2>
EDUCACION ESTATAL Y POBREZA
</h2>

<P>
SANTIAGO DE CHILE (AIPE).- Desde el tiempo de los conquistadores espaoles,
la bsqueda de riqueza en Chile se dirigi hacia el suelo. Para algunos esto
signific la exploracin en busca de minerales valiosos escondidos bajo
tierra: oro y plata, despus salitre y finalmente cobre. Para otros fue el
cultivo de la tierra frtil que produce trigo, frutas y madera. Siglos ms
tarde, las principales exportaciones de Chile todava provienen del suelo.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Pero si la importancia econmica de la tierra es un asunto en que existe
pleno acuerdo, la interrogante acerca de "cmo" debe generarse la riqueza en
Chile ha sido el campo de batalla de  doctrinas econmicas opuestas. Ese
debate, que adopt especial fuerza en los aos 60, degener en un violento y
agudo conflicto que produjo una enorme crisis econmica y la quiebra del
sistema democrtico.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La doctrina socialista, ya sea en su variante comunitaria o marxista, no
comprendi que el verdadero capital productivo es aquel que deriva su valor
a travs de la creatividad y diligencia de su propietario operando en
mercados libres. Por el contrario, erigieron al Estado como gran
redistribuidor de riqueza.	La esencia de esa visin estatista se encarn en
la gran Reforma Agraria de 1966. El gobierno democratacristiano de la poca
intent demostrar que la riqueza se poda redistribuir tan fcilmente como
la tierra.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	El concepto de propiedad reflejado en la Reforma Agraria se extendera
luego a la expropiacin de la minera del cobre y a un ataque generalizado
al derecho de propiedad. Los estatistas creen que la propiedad no necesita
realmente un dueo y son firmes partidarios de la propiedad pblica, pues
ella efectivamente significa que nadie es dueo.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Pero no slo debe tener la propiedad un claro dueo; el dueo debe tener
la suficiente seguridad para que se interese por mantener e invertir en su
propiedad. Si el Estado puede disponer de la propiedad privada, quitndole a
unos y entregndole a otros, ni los ganadores ni los perdedores de ese
ejercicio del poder poltico se sentirn protegidos y seguros de su
propiedad, como para asumir riesgos e invertir capitales para incrementar su
valor.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	En 1981, la Reforma Minera chilena enfrent a la visin socialista que
haba generado la Reforma Agraria y gener la ocasin para un claro y
dramtico contraste. Al crear verdaderos derechos de propiedad en el sector
econmico de mayor tamao y de mayor sensibilidad poltica, el mensaje a los
inversionistas nacionales y extranjeros fue que la propiedad privada en
Chile era, desde ese momento, un derecho absolutamente seguro.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	As fue como, en 15 aos, se llevaron a cabo en Chile dos reformas de gran
importancia y conceptualmente antagnicas, cada una ofreciendo su definicin
del tipo de economa que sera preferible para el pas. Un gobierno
demuestra coherencia en su poltica econmica segn cmo contesta una
pregunta bsica: Cul es la llave del tesoro? La Reforma Agraria y la
Reforma Minera fueron dos respuestas distintas y contrapuestas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La Reforma Agraria produjo una crisis de la produccin agrcola y la
quiebra de la fbrica social del pas, mientras que la Reforma Minera ha
significado inversiones extranjeras por $7,153 millones, destinados a
desarrollar riqueza, crear trabajos productivos, transferir tecnologa y
recursos sustanciales para invertir en capital humano.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	El concepto de propiedad reflejado en la Reforma Minera de 1981 consolid
una visin nueva acerca de cmo crear riqueza.  Aunque en Chile tal visin
gan el debate de los 80, esta visin fundamental no ha sido todava
aceptada ni adoptada en temas que sern de la mayor importancia en el siglo
XXI. En efecto, la contestacin a cul debe ser el motor del progreso
nacional?, permanece indefinida en la ambigua respuesta de la economa mixta.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La economa mixta que postulan los estatistas es la que exprime con toda
clase de impuestos al sector privado moderno y eficiente para apoyar al
sector pblico anacrnico, ineficaz, politizado y crecientemente corrupto.
La doctrina de la economa mixta es la que condena a los nios pobres a
educarse en escuelas pblicas mediocres, en vez de darles acceso a las
escuelas privadas que escoge, casi sin excepcin, cualquier familia con
recursos suficientes, independientemente de su inclinacin poltica.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Pero est ocurriendo un cambio trascendental. Si histricamente la riqueza
fue creada poniendo los recursos naturales al servicio del hombre, en el
futuro la llave de la creacin de riqueza -la llave del tesoro- ser el
cultivo de la inteligencia y el conocimiento humano.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Hoy la extraccin de minerales o productos agrcolas del suelo se apoya
ms en el uso de inteligencia que en fuerza humana. Pero aunque Chile ha
modernizado importantes sectores de su economa y de su sociedad, el sistema
estatal de educacin se encuentra en una profunda crisis porque est basado
en la misma estructura conceptual que origin la Reforma Agraria y que
mantiene a  la mayor empresa  de cobre, Codelco, en poder del Estado.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Es un trgico error postular que la preocupacin especial por los pobres
exige que el Estado produzca cobre y educacin. Todo lo contrario. No
podemos permitir que la mala calidad de la educacin estatal los condene a
una pobreza perpetua, cuando existe una alternativa.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	El meollo del asunto es que la definicin de lo que es riqueza cambi y la
poltica moderna debe reconocerlo as. Hoy en da la riqueza fundamental es
el capital humano y el insumo bsico es el conocimiento. Es probable que sea
menos perjudicial para un pas tener empresas estatales produciendo acero o
explotando minas que escuelas administradas por la burocracia estatal. Una
profunda reforma educacional es la tarea ms urgente e importante de nuestra
sociedad.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Es absurdo seguir considerando a las escuelas como parte del gasto social
asignado para mitigar los efectos de la pobreza. Por el contrario, las
escuelas deben estar en manos de los ms capaces en llevar adelante los
mejores proyectos educacionales -programas, metodologas, infraestructura-
que compiten entre s, para ofrecer a los jvenes las mejores alternativas.
Esto slo pueden hacerlo empresarios privados dispuestos a desarrollar su
iniciativa y arriesgar sus capitales a cambio de una legtima ganancia. Los
profesores deben dejar de ser funcionarios pblicos regidos por un estatuto
que uniforma la mediocridad, pasando a ser actores activos de los proyectos
educacionales y recibiendo mejor ingreso, ya sea por la prestacin de sus
servicios o como dueos de las escuelas. El rol del Estado debe centrarse en
subsidiar la educacin de los ms pobres y asegurar la transparencia y
competitividad del sistema.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	As las escuelas podrn transformarse en los centros productivos
estratgicos del pas porque all se jugar la ventaja competitiva de las
naciones en el siglo XXI. La educacin no slo reemplazar al suelo frtil y
a los yacimientos de minerales como el recurso clave para el desarrollo y la
creacin de riqueza, sino que tambin ser el ms significativo determinante
de la eliminacin de la pobreza.

<TITLE>Ball: Jack Kemp -- 9/04/96</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<blockquote><blockquote>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>September 04, 1996</i><br>
<H2>JACK KEMP</H2>
Carlos A. Ball*<br>
<p>
MIAMI (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- A mis aos pensaba que ya no me entusiasmara ningn poltico
y menos una campaa presidencial. Pero he tenido dos sorpresas en 1996.
Primero con Steve Forbes y ahora con la candidatura de Jack Kemp a la
vicepresidencia, la cual ha mejorado radicalmente las probabilidades de que
Bob Dole sea el prximo ocupante de la Casa Blanca.<p>
	Cuando oigo hablar a los polticos, siempre me pregunto en qu me estn
tratando de engaar? Kemp y media docena de otros, como John McCain y Dick
Armey, son las excepciones. Kemp habla con el corazn y mirando a los ojos.
Cuando en medio de la Convencin Republicana en San Diego abraz y bes a su
hijo -quien lo present-, pareca que estbamos viendo a un padre latino
besando a su hijo de mediana edad en pblico.<p>
	En enero de 1995, Kemp anunci que no buscara la nominacin presidencial
de su partido para las elecciones de 1996. Las nuevas reglas de
financiamiento electoral obligan a los candidatos a dedicarse de lleno a
conseguir decenas de miles de pequeos contribuyentes, algo que le
disgustaba y, adems, todava estaba pagando las deudas incurridas en su
anterior intento. Dos meses ms tarde, en marzo de 1995, fue nombrado por
Bob Dole y Newt Gingrich presidente de la Comisin Nacional sobre
Crecimiento Econmico y Reforma Impositiva para estudiar la mejor manera de
reestructurar el sistema de impuestos, del cual todo el mundo se queja y que
ha sido no slo la principal fuente de corrupcin poltica sino el mayor
freno a la prosperidad y al crecimiento.<p>
	Jack Kemp no es el nico poltico estadounidense consciente de la necesidad
de retomar el camino del crecimiento econmico para que "la marea" levante
el nivel de vida de todos los ciudadanos, como sucedi aqu en los aos 50,
60 y 80. Pero Kemp s es el nico de ese grupo que es percibido por la
generalidad de los votantes como alguien realmente preocupado por los
pobres, por los habitantes de los barrios, por los inmigrantes y las minoras.<p>
	Hay cierto aire artificial cuando algunos de los principales lderes del
Partido Republicano se acercan a las comunidades latinas de Los Angeles y
Chicago o a los barrios negros de Detroit y Miami. Eso no sucede con Kemp.
El no est all por ganar puntos; sinceramente est en activa bsqueda de la
mejor manera de resolver los problemas que confrontan los ms dbiles de la
sociedad. Como Secretario de Vivienda y Desarrollo Urbano, bajo Bush,
introdujo el concepto de las Zonas Emprendedoras para promover -con bajos
impuestos- la creacin de empresas y de empleos en los barrios pobres de las
grandes ciudades, a la vez que fomentaba el traspaso de la propiedad de
apartamentos de los proyectos residenciales del gobierno a manos de los
inquilinos, sabiendo que al convertirlos en propietarios de su vivienda
adquiran la dignidad y confianza conducentes a romper las cadenas de la
dependencia en la beneficencia pblica.<p>
	Sobre la inmigracin, Kemp dijo el 18 de febrero de este ao: "Tenemos que
comprender que estamos obteniendo algunos de los mejores y ms brillantes
cerebros de todo el mundo para que inviertan sus talentos en la economa
estadounidense. Nos estamos volviendo ms competitivos y ms prsperos y,
en el proceso, no estamos desplazando ni devaluando a trabajadores americanos".<p>
	Luego de una casi total concentracin del esfuerzo de los republicanos en
equilibrar el presupuesto federal, lo cual es importante pero no enciende el
entusiasmo de los electores, Kemp (y su discpulo Forbes) argumentaron que
el dficit es la consecuencia de un mal mayor. No podemos conformarnos con
los actuales niveles mediocres de crecimiento econmico, 2 a 2,5% anual,
cuando a raz de las rebajas de impuestos de Kennedy, el crecimiento entre
1960 y 1964 alcanz 4,7% anual, y luego de las rebajas impositivas de
Reagan, el crecimiento anual promedi 3,1% de 1981 a 1988. <p>
	Kemp aspira que el Plan Dole, al cual tanto l como Gary Becker
contribuyeron, conduzca a un crecimiento de 3,5%, lo cual doblara el tamao
de la economa de Estados Unidos para el ao 2008.<p>
	En sus propias palabras: "La inmensa burocracia gubernamental que
soportamos fue creada durante los ltimos 60 aos con buenas intenciones,
pero con una filosofa redistributiva que condujo a resultados
contraproducentes. Dando la cara a esa realidad, los republicanos cometemos
un grave error cuando tratamos de ahorrar primero en los programas sociales.
Eso permite que se nos acuse de poner la carreta de la austeridad fiscal
antes que el caballo de crecimiento econmico rpido".<p>
	Kemp, adems, tiene una visin mundial que ha brillado por su ausencia bajo
Clinton y Gore, quienes han tratado de pasar responsabilidades y liderazgo a
las Naciones Unidas, con consecuencias lamentables. Luego de la Primera
Guerra, Estados Unidos le dio la espalda al mundo y sus leyes
proteccionistas aunadas a polticas monetarias constrictivas convirtieron
una recesin en la Gran Depresin que no termin sino con la Segunda Guerra.
Luego de esta ltima predomin la apertura al mundo y la expansin econmica
que condujo al triunfo en la Guerra Fra. Cuatro aos ms de Clinton, con su
desidia hacia todo lo extranjero, podra repetir los dolorosos sucesos de
los aos 30 y terminar de enterrar la visin de Reagan y Bush sobre un
continente americano integrado econmicamente, bajo un floreciente
capitalismo democrtico.<p>
	Aquellos que menosprecian la posicin de la vicepresidencia no ven que ella
colocara a Jack Kemp en el lugar clave para aspirar a la presidencia en el
ao 2000, lo cual me convierte en optimista acerca del nuevo milenio. <p>

<title>Budget Reform</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
Washington Watch<br>
Volume 6, Number 10<br>
September 23, 1995<br>

<h2><center>KEEPING BUDGET REFORM ON TRACK</h2></center><br>

	White House Chief of Staff Leon Panetta and Senior Counselor George Stephanopoulos know the drill well. They are using today the same tactics they employed in 1990 when they successfully maneuvered President George Bush into breaking his "no new taxes" pledge. Today, they decry "a train wreck" they say will occur if Congress makes spending cuts stick. <p>
	First, some background. The U.S. Government will begin the 1996 Fiscal Year October 1.  Congress has spent the last nine months paring down Clinton budget requests, eliminating billions in future wasteful spending, and pushing for a balanced budget by 2002.<p>
	House Republicans earlier this year passed a FY 1996 budget resolution that calls for a balanced budget by FY 2002.  They tried to cut federal taxes by $354 billion over the same seven-year period, but Senate liberals limited tax relief to  $245 billion. Clinton and his  congressional supporters vigorously denounced both the proposed tax cuts and the 2002 balanced budget target. <p>
	
<h3><center>Media's False Picture</h3></center><br>
	Journalists describe the major difference between Congress and the president as a dispute over whether to balance the budget in a seven-year or ten-year period.  However, the Congressional Budget Office's (CBO) analysis of Clinton's  proposed budget found a $209 billion shortfall in the year 2005 -- the very year that he claims to achieve a balanced budget.  His ten-year proposal also produces $2 trillion in new federal debt.  <p>
	Liberal critics of the GOP budget plan attack the tax cuts, claiming that they favor the rich or that they will gouge Medicare.  They claim the tax cuts will "explode the deficit,."  But more than half (55 percent) of the House-passed tax relief  is dedicated to the $500-per-child tax credit.  And approximately three-quarters of this tax credit is slated to go to families with incomes less than $75,000;  nearly five million families at the lowest levels will be freed from federal income taxes. Senate GOP leaders have strongly suggested that the final composition of the tax package will be very "family friendly."<p>
	Conservatives see savings in the cuts in discretionary spending programs and welfare reform.  They also note that Medicare spending is projected to increase at twice the rate of inflation even as reforms are instituted to restrain the rate of growth.  The argument that tax cuts "explode the deficit" is answered by pointing out that tax revenues actually increased by more than the rate of inflation during the 1980s.  If spending increases had been held to the rate of inflation, we'd have a budget surplus today. <p>
	Not a penny can be spent unless both houses of Congress approve. This gives the GOP tremendous leverage to set conditions on the use of taxpayers' money. Funding battles are also battles over abortion, federal subsidies for pornographic art, the gay agenda and liberal legal activism. Congress has an obligation to use its "power of the purse" to protect the legitimate interests of the American family.<p>
	
<h3><center>A Contest of Wills <br></h3></center>
	Who will blink first, Bill Clinton or Congress?  Both sides may try to get through October by passing "continuing resolutions. But, by early November, the Treasury's authority to borrow will expire.  Congress can then apply conditions to legislation to raise the debt ceiling.  If the budget dispute is not resolved by then, a real clash is possible. But essential services like mail delivery, air traffic control and Social Security will continue during this dispute. Doubtless there will be a great hue and cry from the liberal interest groups who see their funds disappearing.<p>       
	A government shutdown poses great risks for liberal interest groups.  What happens if a few weeks or months go by and the public doesn't miss the "services?"  That would provide a very powerful argument for reducing spending even further. Our national debt and much of our cultural decline have been the products of several decades of reckless government spending. If it takes a  liberal "train wreck" to get our country back on track, that may be a small price to pay. <p>

<h2>
FALSEDADES AMBIENTALES
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

S. Fred Singer
</a>

<P>
FAIRFAX, VIRGINIA (AIPE).- Cinco temas ambientales demuestran las
distorsiones y el mal uso de la ciencia en el diseo de polticas
gubernamentales, durante el ltimo ao:
</blockquote>
<ol>
<li>Recalentamiento de la Tierra: Durante 1995, cuentos de terror predecan
catstrofes por el "efecto invernadero", mientras que la evidencia sobre el
supuesto recalentamiento era cada vez ms dbil. En la primera Conferencia
del Tratado Climtico Mundial, en abril del ao pasado en Berln,
descubrimientos cientficos fueron ignorados, se procedi a establecer un
Secretariado Permanente y a preparar una megaconferencia. En septiembre, por
iniciativa del vicepresidente Al Gore, otra reunin en Washington promovi
un nuevo temor ligado al recalentamiento: la propagacin de enfermedades
tropicales que afectaran a 3.000 millones de personas. En noviembre en
Madrid y en diciembre en Roma, el Panel Intergubernamental sobre Cambios
Climticas, auspiciados por las Naciones Unidas, se las ingeni para aprobar
dos informes preliminares en borrador, ambos muy econmicos con la verdad.
Presentaron los hechos en forma selectiva, mientras se abstuvieron de
incluir datos que indican cero recalentamiento.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Ante una burocracia desbocada a la que no le importa la evidencia
cientfica, Estados Unidos debe retirarse del Tratado antes de que las
Naciones Unidas nos lleven a la ruina econmica.
<li>Ozono estratosfrico y el cncer de la piel: Desde el 31 de diciembre
est prohibida la fabricacin de gases tipo fren y otras substancias
qumicas bajo la errada creencia que es la manera de evitar una epidemia de
cncer de la piel. La evidencia cientfica no existe y todo se bas en una
conferencia de prensa en 1992, donde se habl de un inminente "agujero de
ozono rtico" que nunca sucedi. No hay evidencia de que las radiaciones
ultravioletas que alcanzan la superficie terrestre estn incrementndose y
mediciones en laboratorios muestran que el melanoma mortal del cncer de la
piel no es afectado por el nivel del ozono atmosfrico.
<li>Humo de segunda mano: En noviembre el Servicio de Investigacin del
Congreso encontr que no hay respaldo cientfico en la teora que el humo de
fumadores causa cncer entre los no fumadores, ya que hubo manipulacin de
las cifras presentadas en las investigaciones de la Agencia de Proteccin
Ambiental (EPA).		
<li>La falsa alarma del gas radn: Antes de la Segunda Guerra, pequeas
dosis radioactivas eran consideradas saludables. Los ricos disfrutaban de
baos termales con agua ligeramente radioactiva. Inclusive nuestros cuerpos
contienen radioactividad natural. Se sabe que dosis radioactivas por debajo
de cierto nivel no son dainas. Sin embargo, la EPA insiste en que el radn
es "la principal amenaza ambiental contra la salud", causando que familias
gasten miles de dlares en detectar y erradicar el radn de sus casas.
<li>El ruinoso afn por "cero riesgo": La ms costosa de todas las
regulaciones es la Clusula Delaney de 1958 que impone el concepto de cero
riesgo. Cuando inmensas dosis de substancias como PCB, dioxn, ETS, alar,
etc. resultan fatales para ratones, se prohibe su inclusin en alimentos,
aunque el contenido sea nfimo. Esto cobra significacin cuando se toma en
cuenta que las regulaciones ambientales estn costando $150.000 millones al
ao, o sea $1.500 por cada familia estadounidense. 
</ol>
<blockquote>
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La misin principal del Proyecto Ciencia y Medio Ambiente es estudiar el
uso y el mal uso de la ciencia en referencia a leyes ambientales, poniendo
al descubierto fraudes y mitos, como los del asbesto, la lluvia cida y el
alar, para mencionar slo unos pocos que han causado el derroche de miles de
millones de dlares.

<p>

NUEVA YORK <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Esta ciudad se conoce mundialmente por su historia
empresarial y fue en gran parte creada por generaciones de inmigrantes. Las
nuevas corrientes migratorias provenientes del Caribe, Amrica Latina y
Europa oriental vigorizan los viejos barrios con su empuje e iniciativa.
Nueva York est siendo envuelta por una nueva ola de modestos inmigrantes
con iniciativa individual.
<dd>	Veamos algunos ejemplos de la investigacin hecha para el Instituto para la
Justicia por Howard Husock de la Escuela de Gobierno John F. Kennedy de
Harvard. En los barrios de Brooklyn y Queens, cientos de autobusetes -casi
todos manejados por inmigrantes del Caribe- trasladan pasajeros regularmente
hasta las estaciones del metro. El precio del pasaje es inferior al de los
autobuses pblicos  y, segn los usuarios, el servicio es mejor y ms confiable.
<dd>	En Harlem y otras barriadas negras surgen de la noche a la maana salones
de belleza que se especializan en peinados de mltiples y diminutas
trencillas. En las esquinas y lotes vacos de los barrios surgen
"pulgueros", ferias y mercados de vegetales, donde caribeos y africanos
venden toda clase de productos, desde franelas hasta libros, mientras otros
preparan alimentos de todas partes del mundo. Se estima que los vendedores
callejeros en Nueva York ya suman 25.000.
<dd>	En una ciudad donde el 10% de la poblacin vive de la beneficencia pblica
y decenas de miles estn presos por trfico de drogas, esta explosin de la
iniciativa individual es alentadora, pero las autoridades tratan de
aplastarla, hostigando y hasta arrestando a la gente por el "crimen" de
intentar ganarse la vida productivamente.
<dd>	Los conductores de los autobusetes informales no logran conseguir licencias
de la ciudad para operar y an cuando las obtienen son multados y hasta
confiscados por recoger pasajeros en una parada "oficial" de autobs. A las
peluqueras negras se les niega una licencia a menos que tomen mil horas de
clases de cosmetologa que para nada le sirven en su negocio. Al no tener el
permiso municipal, se les obliga a trabajar en la clandestinidad por el
pecado de ejercer una profesin que el gobierno se empea en regular.
<dd>	Los vendedores callejeros que aplican por un permiso pronto se dan cuenta
que las autoridades aprueban menos de una cuarta parte y se les dificulta
hasta conseguir una planilla de aplicacin. Y si los taxista "piratas" en
lugar de responder a llamadas  telefnicas recogen pasajeros en la calle o
de los aeropuertos tienen que adquirir un "medalln" que en el mercado
cambia de manos por $200.000, cantidad totalmente fuera del alcance de estos
nuevos empresarios que comienzan desde abajo.
<dd>	Las leyes, licencias, permisos y certificaciones ocupacionales cubren 73
pginas del Directorio Oficial de la Ciudad de Nueva York. Se requiere de
una licencia para reparar un videocasete, vender entradas para la lucha
libre, o establecer un estacionamiento.
<dd>	Aunque Nueva York es de lo peor, las manicuristas en Charlotte, los
taxistas en Boston y los vendedores callejeros en San Diego sufren de
similar acoso por parte de las autoridades municipales. El Instituto para la
Justicia adelanta la publicacin de investigaciones sobre las barreras
legales contra la libre iniciativa en Baltimore, Boston, Charlotte, Detroit,
Nueva York, San Antonio y San Diego. Estamos decididos a llevar adelante en
los tribunales y ante la opinin pblica una campaa para restaurar la total
proteccin constitucional a la libertad econmica. &copy

<h2>
VENEZUELA Y LA PRIVATIZACION
</h2>

Oscar Garca M.*
<p>

CARACAS <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Para que en Venezuela podamos vivir en un Estado de
derecho, con una economa libre de mercado, el gobierno debe despojarse de
las empresas industriales, comerciales y bancarias. En sus manos no
funcionan y producen prdidas en lugar de beneficios.
<dd>	Un reciente estudio indica que entre 1970 y 1995 se realizaron
transferencias fiscales de alrededor de cien mil millones de dlares a las
empresas estatales de Guayana (acero, aluminio y energa elctrica). La
magnitud de esa cifra supera nuestra capacidad de comprensin. Pero si
hacemos slo dos comparaciones nos daremos cuenta de su dimensin. La
capitalizacin burstil, de la totalidad de las compaas que se cotizan en
la Bolsa de Valores de Caracas, a mayo de 1996, es de cinco mil   millones
de dlares, aproximadamente. O sea, que con esos cien mil millones de
dlares se hubiesen podido comprar 20 veces todas las acciones de todas las
compaas inscritas (las de Venezolana de Cementos, La Electricidad de
Caracas, Banco Provincial, Sivensa, Manpa, Mantex, etc.). Inslito, no es
verdad?
<dd>	Otra comparacin: al cierre de abril de 1996, la totalidad de los depsitos
en los bancos, tanto pblicos como privados, ascenda a 6.945 mil millones
de dlares. Esos cien mil millones en transferencias equivalen a ms de 14
veces los depsitos de la banca venezolana.
<dd>	Y, en qu se invirtieron? Pues en empresas que hoy da muy poco valen
(pues sus prdidas son inmensas y su ineficiencia proverbial), pero
sirvieron y sirven para algo mucho ms importante, apoyar al sistema de
privilegios, favores, ddivas y quin sabe cuntas cosas ms en que se basa
el sistema poltico venezolano.
<dd>	Al privatizarse esas empresas que los polticos denominan "bsicas y
estratgicas" casi como por acto de magia desaparecern las transferencias
y, ms importante an, se comenzar a tener un grupo de empresas productivas
y se estimular el mercado de capitales.
<dd>	Este punto es de especial importancia. En Venezuela no hay medios
suficientes de canalizacin de los ahorros. Si hoy fuera aprobada una Ley de
Fondo de Pensiones similar a la instituida en Chile hace 15 aos, con gran
xito y en beneficio de los trabajadores, habra mucha dificultad en poder
colocar esos fondos en el sector privado y podra el gobierno con facilidad
caer en la tentacin de absorberlos para continuar financiando sus dficit.
<dd>	Un ejemplo de la bondad de la inversin en privatizaciones: recientemente
el Sunday Times de Londres public un reportaje donde analiza las
privatizaciones inglesas y afirma que si alguien invirti 1.000 libras
esterlinas en cada una de las 20 mayores privatizaciones, tendra hoy da
una cartera con un valor de 140.000 libras esterlinas. Lo cual es una muy
buena ganancia. El promedio de retorno de las compaas privatizadas es de
599%, que supera al promedio del Financial Times que fue para el mismo
perodo de 354%.
<dd>	La privatizacin es buena para todos, pero resulta muy difcil superar los
obstculos polticos y an ms los personales y partidistas de sus
opositores. Poco a poco la opinin pblica impulsar esos cambios.&copy

<h2>
CHILE: POLITICOS QUIEREN MONOPOLIOS
</h2>
Ciro Quintana*
<p>
SANTIAGO DE CHILE <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Los empresarios estn pendientes de las encuestas
y estudios de mercado por la informacin que ofrecen sobre las orientaciones
y el comportamiento de los consumidores. No ocurre los mismo en el mundo
poltico, donde se reacciona frente a los sondeos de opinin pblica segn
sus resultados. Cuando stos favorecen, las encuestas son un bocado. Por el
contrario, cuando dan en las narices, se acusan los trabajos de sesgados,
muestras mal estructuradas, encuestas no rigurosas o simplemente las ignoran.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Esto ltimo est ocurriendo en Chile. Los polticos sistemticamente han
venido ignorando los diversos sondeos pblicos que reiteradamente reflejan
un creciente desprestigio de la actividad partidaria y desvalorizacin de
las tareas parlamentarias. La suma de pequeos factores han causado la
brecha, cada vez mayor, que separa a los polticos de la ciudadana, de lo
cual ningn partido se escapa.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
El elemento que quiz ha ayudado ms a construir la mala imagen poltica a
nivel de opinin pblica es la tendencia de los dirigentes de tratar de
aprovechar la infraestructura del Estado para obtener ventajas ms en
beneficio propio que en el de sus representados.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Dentro de tal lnea se inscribe el nuevo intento, esta vez propiciado desde
las propias filas del Poder Ejecutivo, de sacar adelante un proyecto de ley
que permita al Estado entregar recursos para que los partidos polticos
financien sus campaas electorales. Es cierto que la cantidad propuesta -12
millones de dlares- parece insignificante, pero ante la opinin pblica
surge como un nuevo intento de escamotear fondos que deben ser destinados a
tareas socialmente ms importantes, como por ejemplo mejorar la situacin de
los pensionados del viejo sistema estatal (unas 500.000 personas reciben
menos de $100 mensuales) y ampliar las oportunidades de educacin y de salud
para los sectores ms desposedos.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
El argumento de los partidarios del financiamiento pblico de las campaas
electorales es que hay que terminar "con el maridaje obsceno entre el dinero
y la poltica", es decir, la obtencin de financiamiento por vas "oscuras",
ya que en la actualidad la militancia de los partidos es incapaz de
suministrar los fondos necesarios ni siquiera para el mantenimiento del
aparataje mnimo de estos. Otro argumento es que hay que transparentar el
financiamiento de las colectividades polticas.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ninguna de esas justificaciones aguantan el ms mnimo anlisis. Para que
los partidos se independicen totalmente del apoyo financiero de sectores
privados, o bien de los organismo oficiales, tendran que recibir del Estado
un aporte financiero superior a los $100 millones. Y tal cantidad generara
un proceso corruptivo al interior de los partidos que los conducira al
descalabro moral y tico, como ocurre en otros pases donde el Estado
financia la poltica. En cuanto a la transparencia, alguien cree
ingenuamente que los partidos polticos van a dar a conocer todas las ayudas
recibidas?
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Hay que tomar tambin en consideracin otras consecuencias derivadas de
encauzar recursos del Estado a los partidos polticos. La ms relevante es
la monopolizacin de la representacin popular por parte de las actuales
entidades. Qu posibilidades tendran candidaturas independientes en ese
escenario?  Incluso, qu oportunidades encontraran los movimientos nuevos
de insertarse en la poltica?  Sin exagerar, se trata de un camino que
demuestra que los grupos polticos no son amigos de la competencia ni del
libre mercado y prefieren mil veces un esquema oligoplico, donde solamente
puedan participar los ya conocidos o los apadrinados, aun cuando para
obtenerlo deban incurrir en gastos abusivos, financiados a la fuerza por
todos los contribuyentes.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Es sorprendente la actitud del gobierno de Eduardo Frei, la cual seala que
an no ha comprendido la preocupacin general respecto a que el Estado debe
reducir su nivel de gastos, factor que ha impedido que Chile pueda vivir con
tasas de inflacin bajas, al nivel de las naciones desarrolladas. <&copy;p>

<h2>
BRASIL PICA EN PUNTA
</h2>
Alejandro Antonio Chafuen*
<p>
FAIRFAX, VIRGINIA <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Hay tres elementos claves que los ejecutivos de
empresas multinacionales toman en cuenta al decidir sobre dnde invertir:
estabilidad poltica, estabilidad monetaria y respeto a los derechos de
propiedad. Justo cuando los titulares de la prensa mundial reportan el
impasse entre Estados Unidos y China por la piratera no controlada de
pelculas, msica y programas de computacin, el presidente del Brasil,
Fernando Henrique Cardoso, procedi a firmar una ley de patentes de
productos farmacuticos que puede servir de modelo al mundo y que representa
un importante paso de Brasil hacia el liderazgo econmico en nuestro hemisferio.
Brasil enfrenta tremendos retos econmicos. Debe mantener una moneda
estable, reforzar su sector financiero, liberalizar sus leyes laborales y
privatizar un gran nmero de empresas estatales. Luego de varias dcadas de
equivocadas inversiones, la reformas resultan dolorosas. Para hacer menos
traumtica esa transformacin, Brasil requiere considerables influjos de
inversin extranjera. La nueva ley de patentes har mucho ms fcil atraer
el capital requerido y debido a la debilidad de la actual legislacin
argentina en la materia, aquellas inversiones que hubieran hecho en dicho
pas las industrias de alta tecnologa ahora irn al Brasil.
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     	La nueva ley brasilea es un hito en la dinmica de la
infraestructura econmica mundial para la innovacin mdica. Favorece la
medicina, la ciencia, la investigacin, el crecimiento econmico y la
atencin mdica para la gente del Brasil y el resto de Amrica del Sur. Se
trata de un nuevo ingrediente en la estrategia de liberalizacin poltica y
econmica, impulsando al Brasil hacia un verdadero liderazgo entre las
economas en desarrollo y los mercados emergentes, fijando rumbo para
alcanzar un posicin clave entre las democracias industriales  del siglo XXI.
  <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
     	Desde tiempos de Adam Smith, prominentes economistas han mantenido
que la riqueza de las naciones depende de un vasto mercado, sin trabas a la
divisin del trabajo y respeto por la propiedad privada. La inmensa riqueza
natural y humana del Brasil, junto a su nueva posicin de liderazgo en el
dinmico mercado latinoamericano, prometen ofrecer oportunidades econmicas
de excepcin. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Analistas con los ms diversos enfoques, incluyendo tanto al Vaticano como
al Valle Silicn, coinciden en que los activos ms importantes en la era de
la informacin son intangibles. La fortaleza econmica hoy depende en gran
parte de ideas, informacin y conocimientos, lo cual convierte la propiedad
intelectual en ingrediente esencial. Una buena ley de patentes, como la
recin promulgada en Brasil, es de especial importancia para la innovacin
farmacutica, al reducir el inmenso riesgo que conlleva el descubrimiento y
desarrollo de nuevas medicinas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
El costo promedio de una nueva droga es de $500 millones y el proceso toma
12 aos. Lo sorprendente es que el grueso de los descubrimientos mdicos no
se logran en dependencias gubernamentales ni universidades, sino en las
empresas privadas que realizan las investigaciones. En este sentido, las
estadsticas en Estados Unidos son determinantes: 99% de las medicinas ms
frecuentemente prescritas fueron desarrolladas por la industria privada y el
equivalente al 92% de las nuevas sustancias qumicas aprobadas entre 1981 y
1990 provinieron de laboratorios privados. Sin embargo, las universidades,
los hospitales, la industria y los gobiernos forman parte del esfuerzo
conjunto de investigacin que el sistema de patentes hace posible. 
Para Brasil, el beneficio de la nueva ley ser la transferencia de
conocimientos y   tecnologas, enriqueciendo sus procesos de investigacin y
desarrollo. La empresa innovadora conoce ms que cualquier otra las
caractersiticas sobre las nuevas medicinas, por lo que juega un papel
crucial para la comercializacin y transferencia de informacin al cuerpo
mdico. Sin patentes, cualquiera puede vender las medicinas, pero se pierde
el importante aporte al tratamiento de pacientes hecho por la firma que las
desarroll, imposibilitando a su vez la creacin de centros locales de
investigacin y desarrollo. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Ultimamente, un impresionante grupo de naciones -Canad, la Repblica Checa,
Corea del Sur, Mxico y Taiwan, entre otras- ha mejorado substancialmente
sus leyes de patentes y ahora Brasil se coloca a la cabeza de ese grupo. Las
naciones en este sentido rezagadas, como Argentina y la India, pagarn un
alto precio, en el retraso de sus centros de investigacin y en la salud de
la ciudadana.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
La idea del hemisferio americano unido por la libertad de comercio, la
tradicin constitucional republicana y los derechos humanos sigue siendo un
sueo que slo se har realidad con la convergencia de estructuras legales
basadas en los principios que han permitido a las civilizaciones madurar y
desarrollarse. Los derechos de propiedad intelectual forman parte integral
de tales principios y la iniciativa brasilea favorece justamente esa
dinmica. <&copy;p>

<h2>
MALAS COPIAS DEL SISTEMA CHILENO DE PENSIONES
</h2>

Mary Anastasia O'Grady*
<p>

SANTIAGO DE CHILE <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Cuando el "efecto tequila" hizo estragos en
Amrica Latina en 1995 y se retiraron capitales de la regin, Chile fue poco
afectado. Eso se debi en parte a su alta tasa de ahorro interno de
alrededor de 27% del PIB.
<dd>	En gran parte tan alta tasa de ahorro se debe a la reforma del sistema de
pensiones promulgado en 1980 e iniciado en 1981. Una vez que a los chilenos
se les dio el control sobre sus ahorros para el retiro, opciones sobre la
administracin e incentivos para retirarse del sistema pblico de pensiones,
la privatizacin tom vuelo. As comenz el auge del ahorro que hizo
prosperar el mercado local de capitales.
<dd>	La reforma del Seguro Social chileno tuvo tanto xito que las naciones
vecinas que sufren de bajas tasas de ahorro comenzaron a copirselo. Pero
por razones parroquianas el modelo chileno ha sido modificado en todas
partes, modificaciones que han debilitado los resultados. Aunque los
trabajadores de esos pases se han estado cambiando a sistemas de pensiones
privados, la conversin ha sido mucho ms lenta, lo cual ha conducido a los
crticos a sostener que el xito chileno se debe a la naturaleza nica de
Chile, su gente y su cultura poltica.
<dd>	Estn equivocados. La reforma funciona en todas partes y el modelo chileno
es transferible. Y ahora que las altas tasas de ahorro se han convertido en
el objetivo de los reformistas en todo el mundo, vale la pena comparar el
exitoso modelo chileno con las malas copias que han conducido a resultados
mediocres.
<dd>	El objetivo es, o debiera ser, dar las mejores pensiones al mayor nmero de
trabajadores, al menor costo posible. En Chile as se hizo al promover
cuentas individuales, cuyos beneficios reflejaran el esfuerzo individual en
ahorrar, al mismo tiempo que se promovi la competencia entre los
administradores privados de fondos. Un mercado competitivo impulsado por
ahorradores motivados gener buenos rendimientos.
<dd>	Al mismo tiempo, Chile tom los pasos necesarios para ir eliminando
paulatinamente el viejo sistema estatal de reparto, que es costoso,
ineficiente y est condenado a la insolvencia. Eso fue clave porque de otra
manera hubiera sido un freno al crecimiento econmico. Y ms importante an,
el gobierno adopt un nuevo lema: los incentivos funcionan.
<dd>	Desde 1981, todos los nuevos empleados en Chile optan por el sistema de
cuentas individuales bajo una administracin privada escogida por el
trabajador. Slo a los antiguos trabajadores se les permiti quedarse en el
sistema estatal, si as queran. El establecer una fecha de cierre para el
sistema estatal gener confianza en el nuevo sistema de capitalizacin.
<dd>	Durante la transicin a un sistema individual de capitalizacin, el
gobierno tuvo que buscar la forma de pagar obligaciones a los retirados a
medida que se reducan los ingresos del viejo sistema. Los jvenes ya no
estaban aportando las cuotas necesarias para pagar a los retirados ya que
ese dinero iba a sus cuentas individuales. El gobierno, entonces, emiti
Bonos de Reconocimiento a aquellos que ya haban contribuido, definiendo el
monto de las acreencias oficiales.
<dd>	A los trabajadores que se cambiaron para el sistema privado se les ofreci
una rebaja en la contribucin mandatoria y por ley todo el beneficio de este
recorte fue a parar a los trabajadores. Impuestos a la nmina para cubrir
pensiones, invalidez y salud que alcanzaban entre 30% y 35% en el viejo
sistema se redujeron a alrededor de 20%. Los trabajadores que se cambiaron
vieron de inmediato aumentar sus ingresos.
<dd>	Por el contrario, en Per, Colombia y la Argentina se ignor la
contradiccin que significa continuar paralelamente con el viejo sistema
estatal, dejando escoger a los trabajadores entre los dos. Algunos de los
nuevos que ingresan al mercado de trabajo optan por el sistema estatal
quebrado bajo la vieja creencia que el gobierno conseguir los fondos.
<dd>	Esos gobiernos continan drenando recursos del sector privado para
subsidiar un sistema estatal ineficiente. En la provincia de Buenos Aires
esto se hace al recolectar un impuesto a los empleadores de 12,6% para el
sistema estatal. Al mismo tiempo los empleados en el sistema privado aportan
obligatoriamente 11% para su propia pensin y pagan un impuesto de 3% que va
al sistema estatal. El resultado es una deduccin por nmina de 26,6% slo
para pensiones. Acabar con el sistema pblico sera lgicamente lo mejor.
<dd>	Originalmente el sistema peruano ofreca dos opciones desiguales. El
sistema estatal requera contribuciones de 9% del salario, 3% aportado
directamente por el trabajador y 6% por su empleador, mientras que a los
trabajadores que optaban por el sistema privado tenan que sacar de su
bolsillo 14%. Exactamente lo opuesto a lo que se haba hecho en Chile, donde
los trabajadores recibieron incentivos para cambiarse. No sorprende que
muchos peruanos dudaron cambiarse. Posteriormente Per igual las
retenciones y desde entonces no sorprende que el nmero de los que se
cambian al sistema privado ha crecido dramticamente.
<dd>	Otro error inicial en Per es el mismo cometido en Colombia, donde se le
permite a los trabajadores cambiarse de uno a otro sistema. Eso socava la
confianza en el sistema privado y retarda el crecimiento de la industria de
administracin de fondos de pensiones.
<dd>	Pero el gobierno colombiano fue an ms lejos al hacer publicidad por
televisin diciendo que el sistema privado no era confiable. En Chile, por
el contrario, el gobierno instrument una campaa de mercadeo para educar a
la gente sobre la privatizacin.
<dd>	Hoy el gobierno argentino opera su propia empresa de administracin de
fondos en competencia con el sector privado y garantiza un rendimiento. Como
en el gobierno no es necesario generar utilidades, puede subsidiar su propia
ineficiencia, gozando de injusta ventaja. A pesar de ello, el rendimiento de
la administracin gubernamental ha sido pobre y los ahorradores ms
experimentados escogen entre los administradores privados.
<dd>	El sistema chileno funcion porque sus diseadores crearon un mercado
competitivo. Para lograrlo tuvieron que limitar el papel del estado e
hicieron nfasis en la necesaria relacin entre esfuerzo y recompensa. La
gente tiende ahorrar si es motivada a hacerlo. Los chilenos, igual que el

<h2>
EL BANCO MUNDIAL: 50 AOS DE FRACASOS
</h2>

Bryan T. Johnson*
<p>

WASHINGTON <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- El presidente Clinton recomienda que Estados Unidos
aporte ms dinero a instituciones como el Banco Mundial y su administracin
se comprometi a dar $800 millones a la Agencia para el Desarrollo
Internacional, una de las subsidiarias del Banco. Eso es $100 millones ms
que en el ltimo presupuesto. Darle ms dinero al Banco Mundial es ignorar
la abrumadora evidencia de que sus programas han hecho muy poco en promover
el crecimiento econmico de las naciones menos desarrolladas. Es ms, ignora
las lecciones econmicas sobre las verdaderas causas del desarrollo.
<dd>	Desde su fundacin en 1944, el Banco Mundial ha participado en unas 165
naciones, argumentando que los pases menos desarrollados tienen pocas
posibilidades de prosperar sin substanciales prstamos subsidiados
provenientes del mundo desarrollado. Adems, considera estar en una posicin
nica para enfrentar ese reto, por lo cual debe continuar transfiriendo
capital a las naciones pobres.
<dd>	El Banco Mundial est simplemente equivocado. Las estadsticas muestran que
los ms viejos receptores de dinero del Banco Mundial no estn hoy en
mejores condiciones que cuando recibieron el primer prstamo y muchos estn
peor. 	Aquellas naciones que han salido del subdesarrollo durante los
ltimos 30 aos lo lograron liberando las fuerzas productivas en sus
economas. Los mejores ejemplos son Hong Kong y Singapur.
<dd>	Hoy el Banco Mundial tiene 178 miembros; slo 12 pases no son miembros.
Los aportes de los miembros dependen del tamao de sus economas. Estados
Unidos ha sido el mayor contribuyente, habiendo aportado $53.000 millones
desde 1944. 
<dd>	El propsito original del Banco fue prestar a las naciones desbastadas por
la Segunda Guerra para que reconstruyeran sus infraestructuras. Los bancos
privados no hacan estos prstamos por ser demasiado arriesgados y porque
muchas de esas naciones haban incumplido sus obligaciones despus de la
Primera Guerra. Pero mientras el Banco Mundial prest $543 millones a
naciones de Europa Occidental entre 1945 y 1950, las inversiones privadas de
Estados Unidos alcanzaron $1.760 millones durante el mismo perodo. 
<dd>	Para 1950 era obvio que el Banco Mundial haba servido su propsito y para
mediados de los 60 comenz a transformarse en una agencia de beneficencia
internacional. El cerebro de esta transformacin fue el ex Secretario de
Defensa estadounidense Robert McNamara, bajo quien se formul el concepto de
"desarrollo sostenible". Resumidamente eso significa que los pases menos
desarrollados pueden obtener niveles de desarrollo sostenible slo si
suficientes recursos son transferidos de los pases ricos a los pobres. El
Banco Mundial contina totalmente identificado con esa manera de pensar.
<dd>	Desde su fundacin el Banco ha provisto ms de $356.000 millones,
principalmente a naciones pobres. De 66 naciones menos desarrolladas que han
recibido fondos del Banco durante ms de 25 aos, 37 no estn hoy en mejor
situacin y 20 estn peor. De esas 20, las economas de ocho se han
contrado en 20% o ms.
<dd>	Entre 1965 y 1995, Nicaragua recibi $637 millones de ayuda del Banco
Mundial. En esos 30 aos el ingreso per capita de los nicaragenses se
redujo de $1.752 al ao a $875. Niger recibi del Banco ms de $589 millones
entre 1965 y 1995, mientras que el ingreso per capita de esa nacin africana
cay de $605 a $280. Despus de tres dcadas es evidente que los receptores
de ayuda a largo plazo no alcanzan un "desarrollo sostenible".
<dd>	La principal razn del estancamiento en esas naciones es falta de libertad
econmica y la mayora de los prstamos del Banco van a pases sin libertad
econmica. De los 18 pases receptores de fondos del Banco cuyas economas
han retrocedido 16 son economas "no libres" o "reprimidas" segn el Indice
1996 de Libertad Econmica y se caracterizan por altos impuestos, barreras a
las importaciones, restricciones a las inversiones extranjeras, onerosas
regulaciones, controles de precio y de salarios, infames polticas
monetarias e inmensos mercados negros.
<dd>	Es obvio que el enfoque del Banco Mundial ha fracasado y el retiro del
apoyo de Estados Unidos no slo ahorrara miles de millones a los
contribuyentes sino que le dara la oportunidad a naciones del mundo menos
desarrollado a romper las cadenas que los han mantenido empobrecidos.&copy

<H2>CHILE: REDISTRIBUYENDO POBREZA </H2>
Ciro Quintana*<br>
<p>


SANTIAGO DE CHILE (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--
Uno de los aspectos ms destacados de los dos
gobiernos de la concertacin centroizquierda que ha tenido Chile en aos
recientes ha sido su reiterada accin en beneficio de los sectores ms
desposedos del pas. Ante estudios que sostenan, a comienzos de los 90,
que el 40% de la poblacin sufra de pobreza, las administraciones de
Patricio Aylwin, primero, y ahora Eduardo Frei (hijo) han desplegado una
importante batera de medidas en todos los campos tras la meta de reducir al
mnimo este problema. Ello ha tenido, como contrapartida un incremento
sustancial de impuestos para financiar programas sociales, lo cual ha
catapultado a Chile a alcanzar uno de los primeros puestos en cuanto a carga
impositiva en Amrica Latina (17% del PIB).<p>
Para sorpresa del gobierno, pese a los grandes esfuerzos redistributivos
desplegados, la distribucin del ingreso en el pas no ha mejorado ni
siquiera una dcima en relacin al panorama advertido al trmino del rgimen
militar, segn el informe de la Comisin Nacional de Justicia y Paz de la
Conferencia Episcopal de Chile. El quintil ms rico de la poblacin sigue
recibiendo 58,1% del ingreso, mientras que el ms pobre apenas recibe 4,6%.
El gobierno chileno no sabe dnde ha fallado ni conoce el monto de las
filtraciones que impiden que los recursos lleguen efectivamente a quienes
estn destinados, los ms pobres.<p>
	En todo caso, la denuncia episcopal sirvi de base para reanimar a los
grupos que reclaman mayores impuestos. Para estos, la realidad demuestra la
injusticia de la actual estructura impositiva del pas y, por lo tanto,
segn ellos se debe acrecentar an ms el aporte de los sectores ms
pudientes y lograr as una ms justa distribucin. Lo que no esperaban estos
sectores es que un estudio efectuado por dos importantes funcionarios de
gobierno, uno de ellos el Subsecretario de Desarrollo Social, revel que no
haba relacin alguna entre la ms pareja distribucin del ingreso y la
proporcin de poblacin en situacin de pobreza. El estudio se aboc a
investigar la situacin de las diversas regiones del pas y determin que en
aquellas regiones donde la distribucin es ms desigual hay un cuadro de
pobreza menor que la detectada donde el panoramas es ms igualitario. Toda
una paradoja que est obligando a replantear el problema de la pobreza y a
comprender que en aquellos lugares donde es permitido que un creciente
nmero de personas se hagan muy ricas, los pobres se vuelven menos pobres.
Como sostiene el Instituto Libertad y Desarrollo, fundacin privada chilena
de estudios pblicos, no se combate la pobreza imponiendo una distribucin
ms igualitaria de los ingresos, con lo cual slo se logra redistribuir
pobreza, lo que por generaciones ha sucedido bajo todos los regmenes
socialistas de la historia, desde Europa oriental hasta Cuba.<p>
	Lo que se espera es que este segundo gobierno de la Concertacin revise sus
mtodos, rechace los viejos mitos socialistas y reconozca lo importante que
es construir un camino que motive y facilite la generacin de riqueza, nico
medio capaz de proporcionar nuevas oportunidades y expectativas a la
poblacin que hoy vive en situacin de pobreza. La experiencia demuestra que
aquellos gobiernos que han colocado en primer plano la erradicacin de la
pobreza a travs de programas del sector pblico siempre acaban con un
balance deplorable en este campo. <p>

<P>
NUEVA YORK (AIPE).- La noche del 11 de abril, Lady Thatcher fue la oradora
durante la celebracin del 50 aniversario de la Fundacin para la Educacin
Econmica (FEE) en el Waldorf-Astoria. Prcticamente todos los defensore del
libre mercado, los derechos de propiedad y la libertad individual alrededor
del mundo han sido influenciados por la labor pionera de Leonard Read
(1898-1983) y por FEE, la institucin por l fundada en 1946 para promover
la libertad, incrementar la comprensin pblica de la economa de mercado y
reconocer lo perverso y nocivo de la intervencin gubernamental.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Read naci en una granja en Michigan y deca que su entrenamiento
econmico comenz a los ocho aos: "Mi padre me puso a ordear vacas desde
temprana edad y as aprend la relacin entre el trabajo y un litro de
leche. Todo lo dems en economa son aditamentos a esa leccin bsica".
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Cuando Read era director ejecutivo de la Cmara de Comercio ms grande de
Estados Unidos, en Los Angeles, invit al profesor Ludwig von Mises a dar
una serie de conferencias en 1944. Mises pensaba que lo que "realmente
importa es el resultado de la lucha intelectual entre los partidarios del
socialismo y los del capitalismo". En 1946, Mises ingres a FEE, dictando
conferencias anuales a maestros, periodistas y estudiantes en la sede de
Irvington-on-Hudson.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	La libertad siempre es una vctima de la guerra. Entonces la
"reconstruccin" estaba siendo planificada por los nuevos burcratas
internacionales. Las virtudes del Estado Bienestar, del Plan Marshall, de
los controles de precios y salarios se debatan apasionadamente. Mi primer
viaje a Estados Unidos fue en 1945; adems del Empire State, lo que ms me
impresion fue que mi madre no poda comprar zapatos sin un cupn del
gobierno y que a pap le servan su caf con una diminuta bolsita de azcar.
Yo era demasiado joven para darme cuenta que el racionamiento y la escasez
son los resultados inevitables del control gubernamental sobre la economa
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;El ao anterior, Friedrich von Hayek haba publicado "Camino de
servidumbre", mostrando que la barbarie es la consecuencia no intencional
del fascismo, del comunismo y de la social democracia. Esa obra marc el
renacimiento del liberalismo clsico y tuvo gran influencia en Estados Unidos.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Leonard Read fue uno del selecto grupo de intelectuales invitados por Hayek
a reunirse en la aldea suiza de Mont Pelerin, en abril de 1947, donde se
fund una sociedad para unir los entonces desperdigados esfuerzos por la
libertad. Seis miembros de FEE asistieron a esa conferencia y se
convertiran en frecuentes colaboradores de la revista The Freeman. Adems
de Hayek, Mises y Read, otros distinguidos economistas, politlogos y
periodistas estuvieron en Mont Pelerin: Karl Popper, Milton Friedman, Lionel
Robbins, George Stigler, Fritz Machlup, Henry Hazzlitt, F.A. Harper,
Bertrand de Jouvenel, W. Rpke, Frank Knight, Walter Eucken, Aaron Director,
John Davenport, etc.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Read, FEE y su revista tuvieron una extraordinaria influencia en el
surgimiento de instituciones liberales por todo nuestro hemisferio,
especialmente en la Argentina, Mxico y Guatemala. Alberto Benegas Lynch,
presidente de la Cmara de Comercio de Buenos Aires, conoci a Read, Mises y
Hayek durante un viaje a Nueva York en 1950. Benegas, quien a los 86 aos
sigue siendo un incansable luchador por la libertad, fund en 1957 el Centro
de Estudios sobre la Libertad y una revista similar a la de FEE. Su hijo
Alberto recibi en 1968 una beca de FEE para completar su tesis de doctorado
en Estados Unidos y hoy es director de la Escuela Superior de Economa y
Administracin en Buenos Aires.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Alejandro Chafun es otro de varios argentinos becados por FEE. Se cas y
se qued a vivir en Estados Unidos, conociendo a Sir Antony Fisher, fundador
del Institute of Economic Affairs en Londres, la institucin que hizo
posible la revolucin thatcheriana en Inglaterra. Sir Antony haba visitado
FEE en 1952, quedando impresionado por la forma de popularizar la economa
de mercado, a travs de programas educacionales. Despus de fundar lo que
hoy es el Manhattan Institute, Sir Antony estableci el Atlas Economic
Research Foundation para apoyar la labor de instituciones liberales por todo
el mundo. Chafun es hoy presidente de Atlas.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;FEE tambin sirvi de modelo a los pioneros liberales en Mxico: Luis
Montes de Oca, Gustavo Velasco y Agustn Navarro, fundadores del Instituto
de Investigaciones Sociales y Econmicas, financiado principalmente por Hugo
Salinas Rocha. Montes de Oca haba sido Secretario de Hacienda y presidente
del Banco Central. Velasco, profesor de leyes, era presidente de la
Asociacin Bancaria, mientras que Navarro era el ms distinguido periodista
independiente, cuando el PRI ejerca su frreo control sobre la prensa y el
suministro de papel. Ellos invitaron a Mises a Mxico en 1942, 1946, 1949 y
1958. Hoy, Agustn Navarro hijo escribe una columna semanal para AIPE y es
presidente del Centro Mises. El nieto de Salinas, Roberto Salinas Len, es
director ejecutivo del Centro de Estudios sobre la Libre Empresa y en enero
de este ao organiz la primera reunin de la Sociedad Mont Pelerin
realizada en Mxico.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;La directiva de FEE y Lady Thatcher entregaron durante la ceremonia del 50
aniversario una medalla a Manuel Ayau, de Guatemala, fundador en 1972 de la
Universidad Francisco Marroqun. Sus 12.000 estudiantes, no importa la
carrera, deben completar una instruccin bsica en economa para graduarse.
Segn Ayau, "el xito debe depender de lo bien que se complazca a los
consumidores en el mercado y no de complacer al gobierno la labor de los
amantes de la libertad est en la lucha contra el privilegio".
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Durante medio siglo FEE ha cambiado nuestras vidas promoviendo la libertad
en nuestro hemisferio y ms all.

<title>The Shattering of the Cable T.B. Monopoly -- PFF</title>
</head>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>
<h1>The Shattering of the Cable T.V. Monopoly</h1>

<b>by George Gilder [from the Feb. 95 <i>American Civilization</i>]</b>
<P>
The entire landscape of companies that we currently think of when we talk
about telecommunications competition is about to be entirely transformed.
The cable companies and regional Bell phone companies and long distance
carriers, all of these different entities which people imagine are somehow
permanent players are going to assume an entirely different configuration
over the next five years or so. As a matter of fact, they already would
have assumed a completely different configuration driven by the
overwhelming tides of technology had the regulators not risen up massively
against it.
<P>
During the 1980s Michael Milken and a bunch of other junk bond purveyors
did the crucial initial steps for the reconstruction of this industry.
Milken directed a total of $15 billion to: TCI, which was then a small
cable company; MCI, which was a competitor in the long distance market;
McCaw, which was the foundation of a national cellular system; Turner,
which was really the key cable programming company; and a whole array of
other companies.
<P>
All of these firms which now are crucial for the landscape of
telecommunications emerged from the restructuring process launched by
Drexel and other companies during the 1980s. But that came to a halt when
the entire establishment rose up against this threat to its power.
<P>
Thus today we have an inexorable clash between technology and this now
congealed set of arbitrary companies which are governed by arbitrary and
inapplicable regulations. If this clash is won by the forces of innovation
and technology, then the United States can continue to lead the world in
all of these technologies, as we have for the last decade and even into the
1990s.
<P>
For example, between 1987 and 1992, U.S. companies commanded 47.7 percent
of the profits in the world economy and 37.3 percent of the revenues during
the time after this 1980s destructuring. And that destructuring yielded
about $1.5 trillion in new wealth, as Michael Jensen of the Harvard
Business School has estimated.
<P>
And the opportunities now are far greater, but it entails recognizing that
the existing companies -- the regional Bell phone and cable companies --
are all obsolete. They don't represent anything that corresponds with the
true driving forces of technology -- the sand and glass and air
technologies -- which will be the foundation for this new economy.
<P>
The sand comes in the form of the silicon sliver the size of your thumbnail
inscribed with a logical pattern as complex as a street map of America,
switching its traffic in trillions a second. And that technology is going
to move to a billion transistor chip in the next five or six years. A
billion transistor chip -- equivalent to the processing power of 16 Cray
YAMP supercomputers, or 42 telephone companies' central office switches
that would cost some $300 million -- is manufacturable on a single chip for
less than $100. This technology is just six or seven years away.
<P>
Meanwhile, the communications technology -- fiber optics -- is moving about
twice as fast as the microelectronics technology. You will have probably a
million fold rise in bandwidth over the next decade or so in the ground, as
fiber optic threads, as thin as the human hair, as long as Long Island, are
fed by a laser as small as a grain of salt and as bright as the sun. This
is fiber optics technology. It's on a million fold rise in its capacity
over the next decade.
<P>
Wireless technology is moving just as fast, and it overthrows all the
assumptions of the regulators. People keep asking questions about the cable
companies: Do we have to continue to regulate cable companies? Well, cable
companies will probably die unless they're deregulated.
<P>
The current direct broadcast satellite (DBS) technology, which reaches
everywhere in the country and shortly everywhere in the world, has 150
channels, and soon upward of 400 channels, of high resolution video. This
kind of competition is devastating to cable companies.
<P>
Cable is not a monopoly, it's fighting for its life. And this will mean
that cable companies will have to start serving the really big market,
which is two way computer communications. Whenever I go to a cable company,
I always tell them that in the next decade that they are going to make far
more money offering two way service to computers than they do delivering
entertainment to TVs. And, indeed, that's what cable companies will have to
do.
<P>
But in order to do that, they have to collaborate with telephone companies.
So all of these laws that prohibit collaboration between cable companies
and phone companies in their own region have to go. It is not for a free
market, it is not open competition in communications, all of the existing
competitors are kept segregated.
<P>
A two wire solution will not work. It will delay the emergence of an
information superhighway or whatever term you chose by as much as a decade
because it doesn't pay to have two wires delivering the same service to
everybody's home. And that's what DBS is delivering in abundance.
<P>
Thus we should allow cable companies and phone companies to collaborate in
their own regions, to use this huge unique American resource of this
broadband pipe that's already there. If not, we are not going to have
broadband communications. What we'll have is various attempts to combine
content and conduit pumping some special array of programming into homes.
<P>
That is the John Malone of TCI model, as it's called. It's where you get
control of a bunch of programming and you get control of the pipe to the
home and you gain monopoly profits from that control. And if you have
reasonably narrow band pipes, somebody has to control content, and it
doesn't matter whether you're Reed Hunt or Mother Theresa, you still have
to decide who goes on the pipe.
<P>
But the real promise of this era, what all of these new technologies offer,
is bandwidth abundance. And if you have a true broadband network, then the
whole Malone model, the whole idea of controlling content and controlling
the conduit, collapses. If you're a movie company, for example, and you
have broadband networks, you aren't going to want to restrict your movies
to one conduit or to one channel, you're going to want to go on everybody's
conduit.
<P>
If you own a broadband conduit, you're not going to want to restrict
yourself to just one company's movies. You're going to want everybody's
movies. If you're supplying these broadband two way conduits, you're going
to find your biggest business is communication, teleconferencing,
telecommuting, video telephones -- the whole array of services that will
emerge when you have a truly broadband network in place.
<P>
The key is that there are no monopolies in store in this new world, where
the technology doubles every year or so. The whole idea of one person
establishing a permanent system, like the old AT&T monopoly, is entirely
quixotic in this new world.
<P>
While everybody debated in Congress over the terrible monopoly commanded by
the cable companies just this year, not only did the cable companies lose
their monopoly; they lost their edge in service, the number of channels,
everything. And this kind of surprise is going to happen over and over
again.
<P>
Wireless telephony means that the local loop is competitive now. There are
some 18 million cellular phone subscribers now. There's soon going to be
PCS. There's a whole array of new wireless technologies.
<P>
And digital wireless overthrows the basic assumption of local telephone
regulations, which is that it costs more to supply rural customers, like
me, than urban customers -- 30 times as much sometimes. But with wireless
digital service, it's just as cheap to serve rural customers as urban
customers. So the whole foundation for cross subsidies collapses.
<P>
With this kind of on rush of technological change, monopolies are not the
issue. This will overthrow all the hierarchies and monopolies, pyramids,
and power grids of the established communications infrastructure. It's all
going to be overthrown.
<P>
A completely new configuration will emerge if the capital markets and the
technologies are allowed to combine to reshape this landscape in
confirmation with this miraculous technology that now is available to it.
<P>

Approach, which was co-sponsored by PFF.</i>

<h2>GUERRA CONTRA FABRICAS LATINOAMERICANAS</h2><br>
Irwin Stelzer*
<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columinsits/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Los altos ejecutivos estadounidenses estn descontentos.
Primero fueron el blanco de crticas por sus altos salarios, enfrentan
incertidumbre en la Bolsa de Valores y, adems, estn siendo acusados de
explotar a mujeres y nios en los pases en desarrollo.<dd>
	Las empresas estadounidenses dependen de contratistas y subcontratistas
extranjeros que manufacturan de todo, desde franelas para Gap hasta zapatos
Nike. Esto fue llevado a la atencin del pblico cuando denunciantes
revelaron que la ropa vendida con el nombre de una conocida presentadora de
televisin estaba siendo producida tanto en Honduras como en la ciudad de
Nueva York bajo malas condiciones de trabajo.<dd>
	En el escndalo que sigui, Kathie Lee Gifford, la presentadora de
televisin, casada con un conocido atleta, pidi perdn con lgrimas en los
ojos ante una Comisin del Congreso, mientras su marido distribua billetes
entre los oprimidos trabajadores en Nueva York y todo ello era filmado por
las cmaras de televisin.<dd>
	Simultneamente, Michael Jordan, la estrella del baloncesto firmaba un
contrato por $25 millones, una cantidad que fcilmente doblar con su
patrocinio de Nike. Los denunciantes lo acusaron, entonces, de ganancias
inmorales, mientras los trabajadores que manufacturan los Nike ganan unos
pocos dlares al da.<dd>
	Peor todava, algunas de las fbricas que producen marcas americanas
mantienen condiciones indeseables, por lo menos segn el estndar de este
pas, acostumbrado al aire acondicionado en las factoras. As que adems de
acusaciones de trasladar la manufactura de sus productos a otros pases y
despedir empleados estadounidenses, a los ejecutivos ahora se les acusa de
explotar a nios del Tercer Mundo para aumentar sus ya groseras ganancias.<dd>
	Las acusaciones provienen no slo de reformistas bien intencionados sino de
sindicatos empeados en reducirle la competencia al obrero estadounidense.
Se trata de una guerra de los sindicatos en contra de la globalizacin de la
economa.<dd>
	Lamentablemente, los argumentos sobre la responsabilidad de las empresas
norteamericanas hacia los trabajadores extranjeros estn dominados por
emociones ms que razones. Una activista me inform haber logrado convencer
a una cadena de tiendas a dejar de utilizar muchachas para elaborar la ropa
que venden. Cuando le pregunt qu estaban haciendo ahora esas jvenes
salvadoreas desempleadas, me contest que asuma habran regresado a la
escuela. Es mucho ms probable que estn ahora trabajando por salarios ms
bajos y en peores condiciones.<dd>
	Es cierto que Nike se ha convertido en un gigante, pero que est obligado a
hacer ms que obedecer la ley de los pases donde opera es una propuesta
dudosa. No es probable que los trabajadores de las naciones en desarrollo
estaran mejor si Estados Unidos restringe la fabricacin en el extranjero.
Un ejecutivo me cuenta que l paga $25 mensuales a trabajadores chinos,
quienes se han convertido en los ricos del pueblo. En Honduras, los
trabajadores que cosen pantalones Levi's ganan $5,40 al da, el doble del
salario mnimo.<dd>
	Los que se la dan de protectores de los trabajadores mexicanos y
centroamericanos estn tratando de acabar con puestos de trabajo que ofrecen
oportunidades escasas en esos pases, sin aumentar los precios que los
consumidores pagan por tales productos. <p>

<title>Phil Gramm Speech</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<h2>Speech by Phil Gramm</h2><p>
<h3><i>January 1st, 2001</i></h3>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Any candidate running for President ought to be able to tell you what 
they want America to look like after their programs are in effect.  It is 
particularly fitting that one of the final days of the first term of the 
next president will be January the 1st, 2001 -- the beginning of the new 
millennium.  If you choose me to be your next President, here's the 
America I will work with you to create on that day.<p>
<center><h3>BALANCED BUDGET</center></h3><p>
On January the 1st, 2001, your life will be better and your future will be 
brighter because the federal budget will be balanced.  For the first time in 
over thirty years, the government in Washington will be forced to operate 
in the black and pay its bills.  The  50 cents out of every dollar we save 
that today is siphoned off to pay for government deficit spending will be 
available to build new homes, new farms and new factories; to create new 
jobs, new growth and new opportunity.<p>
Americans will be surprised at the benefits they get when government is 
again forced to live within its means.  In the five years since 1950 when 
the federal government actually balanced the budget, prime interest rates 
averaged 3.5% and mortgage rates averaged 4%.<p>
Owning your own home will again be part of the American dream, and 
today's workers will become tomorrow's small business owners, as 
Americans will again quit their jobs and strike out on their own to start 
their own businesses.<p>
<center><h3>TAXES</center></h3><p>
On January 1, 2001, the federal government will be spending just 18 
cents out of every dollar earned in America, down from 22 cents today.  
What does that mean to you and your family?  It means $3,900 per family 
that will be spent by you rather than by Washington.  Our flat tax will be 
fully in place by January 1, 2001, and you will be able to fill out your tax 
return on a post card.  <p>
By January 1st, 2001, excessive regulations that now add as much as 33% 
to the cost of building jet engines and nearly double the price of new 
vaccines will have been lifted.<p>
By January 1st, 2001, no family farm or small business in America will 
have to be sold to pay inheritance taxes.  When you build up your 
business or farm your family will have it for keeps. <p>
<center><h3>ECONOMY</center></h3><p>
On January 1st, 2001, private investment will be at an all-time high.  
More jobs will be created and your family will earn more and keep more 
of what you earn.  With the creative genius of America once more 
unleashed, no spot on the planet will be safe from our commercial 
onslaught. <p>
By January 1st, 2001, French farmers, Japanese semi-conductor 
manufacturers, and German auto makers will be lobbying their 
governments to erect protectionist walls against American goods. And as 
President I will knock down those barriers.  <p>
<center><h3>GOVERNMENT</center></h3><p>
On January 1st, 2001, I see an America where our government will be 
doing less, but what it does it will be doing better.  Medicare will be an 
efficient health care delivery system and our seniors will know that the 
government has honored its contract with them.  Medical costs will be 
under control because we will have the right to choose the health care 
plan that best fits our needs, a plan that is competitive and efficient.  
Social Security benefits will be guaranteed and young people will be able 
to invest more in their own private retirement plans and medical savings
accounts.<p>
<center><h3>WELFARE</center></h3><p>
By January the 1st, 2001, able-bodied men and women now riding in the 
welfare wagon will have had to get out of the wagon and help the rest of 
us pull.  We will have stopped giving more and more money to 
encourage people to have more and more children on welfare.  And the 
illegitimacy rate will be falling as fast in the year 2001 as it is rising 
today.  Those who can and should help themselves will be doing it again.  
And they will be learning to love it.  And those who truly need help will 
get it in programs tailored by their own states and run in their own 
communities in partnership with their churches and charitable 
organizations.<p>
<center><h3>CRIME</center></h3><p>
It always makes me mad when I go to my mother's house and see the bars 
she has on her windows.  On January 1st, 2001, those bars will be down.  
My mother will be able to walk around her neighborhood on the darkest 
night and not be afraid, and the people she's afraid of today will have bars 
on their windows.<p>
By January 1st, 2001, your family will be safer because we will be 
grabbing violent criminals by the throat, and the 7% of criminals who 
today commit 70% of the violent crimes will be in jail where they belong.  
We won't be building federal prisons like Holiday Inns anymore.  The 
weight rooms will be gone, so will the color televisions and the air 
conditioning.  Our federal prisons will be mini-industrial parks, where 
prisoners work 10 hours a day, 6 days a week.  Prisoners will be working 
during the day to pay for the cost of their incarceration and going to 
school at night. When criminals have served their full sentences they will 
leave prison with the skills they learned working, they will be able to read 
and write and they will be drug-free.  And they won't be eager to go back 
to prison.<p>
By January 1st, 2001, the sound of children playing and people chatting, 
neighbors talking to neighbors, will replace the sound of gunfire and 
sirens in America's cities.  The law will require ten years in prison 
without parole for possessing a firearm during the commission of a 
violent crime or a drug felony, twenty years for discharging it, and when 
a brutal, predatory criminal kills one of our neighbors, he will be put to 
death.  <p>
By January of 2001, we will have begun taking down the metal detectors 
in our schools, and drug dealers will know that if they sell drugs to our 
children, they are going to go to jail for ten years without parole, no 
matter who their daddy is or how society has done them wrong.
<center><h3>EDUCATION</center></h3><p>
America will not have an education President on January 1st, 2001; we 
will have something a lot better.  You will be an education parent again.  
By January 1st, 2001, there will be no federal Department of Education.  
Half of the $32 billion it now spends every year will be back in the hands 
of families in the form of an education tax credit, so that you can invest 
your own money in your own children's education. The other half will go 
back to local school districts so local parents, local teachers, and locally 
elected school board members can again set education policy. There will 
be no federal Goals 2000 -- I will repeal Goals 2000.  Education policy 
will be set by you in your home and in your schools.  <p>
With you in charge of your child's schools, the schools of America will 
for the first time in 50 years be on their way to leading the world in math 
and science, in reading and reasoning.  They will once more teach our 
heritage and our history.  Our children will graduate ready to lead 
America and the world in the high-tech, global economy.  <p>
<center><h3>VALUES</center></h3><p>
By January, 2001, America's forty year experiment with Washington 
imposing values on our people will be a bad but fading memory.  Having 
opposed Bill Clinton's efforts to impose his values on America, I will 
never try to impose my values on you.  There's only one person 
who'sever lived who I would trust to impose values on America.  And 
when He comes back, He won't need government to impose His values.  
In the meantime, we will entrust the formation of values to the American 
family.  The values of our families, refined through each family's own 
faith, will permeate up from our homes, through our neighborhoods and 
our communities to form our nation's values. <p>
And America will be a more virtuous America. When we put families 
first in America again we will love ourselves, our neighbors and our 
country better for it.  Our children will have voluntary prayer in the 
schools again, and every American will have the guaranteed right of 
religious expression.  And putting families first means respecting the 
sanctity of human life.  By January 1st, 2001 the federal government will 
have stopped funding abortion and groups that advocate it.  Federal 
judges will be appointed who will faithfully interpret the Constitution, not 
make it up as they go along.<p>
<center><h3>QUOTAS</center></h3><p>
In taking the oath of office, I will place my hand on the Bible and swear 
allegiance to a Constitution that enshrines equal justice under law.  When 
my hand comes off that Bible, I will pick up a pen and by Executive 
Order end quotas and set-asides in the Executive branch of American 
government.  I will veto any bill that requires quotas or set-asides.  I will 
fight for equal and unlimited opportunity for all but there will be special 
privilege for none. <p>
With our best effort, by January, 2001, Martin Luther King's dream that 
men and women in America will be judged not by the color of their skin 
but by the content of their character will have come true.  And with a 
strong economy, strong families and pervasive opportunity, we will 
rediscover in America what ordinary people with more opportunity and 
more freedom than any people who have ever lived can accomplish in 
this extraordinary land of ours.<p>
<center><h3>DEFENSE</center></h3><p>
By January of 2001, we will have rebuilt our national defenses and will 
recruit and retain the finest young men and women who have ever worn 
the uniform of this country.  We will provide them with the best training 
and the finest weapons that Americans can build.  We will guarantee that
even in a world where the lion and the lamb are lying down together, 
America will always be the lion.  On January 1st, 2001 nowhere in the 
world will Americans be in combat under U.N. command.  <p>
<center><h3>ELECTION</center></h3><p>
The election for President in 1996 is not just a contest between candidates 
and political parties, it is a choice between two very different visions for 
America's future.  Bill Clinton believes that a brighter future will be won 
with more government.  I believe it will be won with more freedom.<p>
In Bill Clinton's America on January 1, 2001, our federal government 
looks pretty much the way it's looked for the last 40 years-- except it is 
bigger, more expensive, and more powerful.  But we reject that America.  
The test results are in:  big government had 40 years to do the job and it 
failed.<p>
If we are bold enough in defining our vision of an American future 
dominated by freedom and family, Bill Clinton will be remembered as 
the last President of a liberal era when big government arrogantly thought 
it knew best.  Bill Clinton is yesterday's president wedded to yesterday's 
government.  I will be tomorrow's President.  I will lead America back to 
the future to reaffirm, as our founders did, the revolutionary idea that 
ordinary people with freedom and opportunity can decide their own 
destiny and the destiny of the world.<p>
<center><h3>NORMAN ROCKWELL</center></h3><p>
As we ask our people to look up from the crisis of the present and to 
share our vision of what America can be, some will say that our vision 
looks a lot like a Norman Rockwell painting.  And I won't deny it.  But 
should we accept anything less?  After all, Norman Rockwell's paintings 
presented America as we wanted it to be and as we knew it could be.  
And I see Norman Rockwell paintings in the making everywhere in the 
history of our families and in the history of our country.<p>
I can see a Norman Rockwell painting of my wife's family.  Her 
grandfather came to America as an indentured laborer to work in the 
sugar cane fields in Hawaii.  He had no money.  He spoke not one word 
of English.  He didn't know anybody in America.  He came with a dream, 
with a devout faith, and with willing hands.  Twenty-five years later, his 
son, my wife's father, got on a freighter leaving Hawaii to come to the 
mainland with $25 he'd won in an essay contest and the dream of going 
to college.  He came home to Hawaii as an engineer and became the first 
Asian American ever to be an officer of a sugar company in the history of 
Hawaii.  And under President Reagan and President Bush, his daughter, 
my wife, served as the chairman of the Commodity Futures Trading 
Commission, where she oversaw the trading of all commodities and 
commodity futures, including the same cane sugar that her grandfather 
came to America to harvest.  I'm not sure that even Norman Rockwell 
could have captured that story in a painting.  But the only thing 
extraordinary about that story is that there is nothing extraordinary about 
that story.  It's a story of an ordinary family in an extraordinary country. <p>
Neither of my parents graduated from high school, but my mother had a 
dream before I was born that I was going to college.  I resisted.  I failed 
the third, seventh, and ninth grades, but it didn't make any difference to 
my mother. My mother prodded me every step of the way through 
collegeto a Ph.D. in economics because in the America we grew up in, 
mother's dreams did not die easily.  Too many mothers' dreams are dying 
too easily in America today.  And I want our America back.<p>
We have a right to dream great dreams because we're Americans.  If 
American history proves anything, it proves that with leadership and 
courage what we can dream we can do.  <p>
Our founders dreamed they could start the world over again and they did 
it in America.  With God's help we can make our dream, The American 
Dream, a reality.  Now and forever.<p>

&quot;The author of The Conservative Mind is as relentless as his enemies, Karl Marx and Harold Laski, considerably more temperate and scholarly, and in passages of this very readable book, brilliant and even eloquent.... It is history as well as argument. Familiar decades and political theories and controversies which usually, in our lifetime, have been illuminated by a searchlight from the left, are here revealed in unfamiliar highlights and shadows by Mr. Kirk's dexter beam."<P>

<title>Dick Armey's Statement</title>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<h2>STATEMENT BY CONGRESSMAN DICK ARMEY HOUSE WAYS AND MEANS COMMITTEE</h2>
</center>
June 8. 1995<p>
<hr>
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee,<p>
Thank you for this opportunity to discuss the issue of tax reform. I would like to begin by complementing you, Mr. Chairman, for holding these hearings this week. I couldn't agree with you more that the current tax system needs to be replaced.<p>
The hearings this week reveal more, however, than a recognition on your part of how counterproductive our current tax system is. These hearings also illustrate that you, Mr. Chairman, are a refreshing change, particularly for those who study Public Choice. Public Choice is a school of economics that seeks to explain the political process. A key premise in  Public Choice theory is that politicians maximize votes by securing benefits to small segments of the electorate, the cost of which are largely lost on the population at large.<p>
Public Choice theory tells us that a chairman of the Ways and Mans Committee might use his position to disburse favors  to narrow interests. We are here today, however, because this Chairman is committed to a neutral tax system which will advance the broader public interest. The tax reforms being discussed this week would give average Americans far more, and elected officials far less, control over resources in our economy. Make no mistake abut it, the proposals before this Committee would expand freedom and opportunity for the American people. I want to take this opportunity to commend the Chairman for his eagerness to place the public interest over any other consideration.<p>
Mr. chairman, when you announced this week's hearings,  you stated that any tax reform proposal should meet four goals. I agree with those goals, and my testimony today will focus on them. Before I explain why the flat tax meets these goals, let me begin by briefly outlining how my proposal would work.<p>
How it Works<p> 
My plan. which is based on a 1981 proposal by Hoover Institution fellows Robert Hall and Alvin Rabushka would scrap the existing tax code entirely.  Instead, all income would be taxed once and only once at the single low rate of 17 percent. To minimize revenue loss, the rate would initially be set at 20 percent, then drop to 17 percent in year three.  Income is defined as the total of wages, salary, and pensions. There would be no credits or deductions, although each taxpayer would receive a generous family allowance. Beginning in year three of the plan, this allowance, which is indexed for inflation, would be $13,100 for an individual, $26,200 for a married couple, and $5,300 for each child. A family of four would have to earn $36,800 before it owed a penny of federal income tax.<p>
Business income would be handled with equal simplicity. A corporation would simply subtract expenses  from revenues and pay 17 percent on the remainder. Revenues are defined as corporate, partnership, professional, farm, and rental income. The base is gross revenue less purchases of goods and services, capital equipment, structures, land, and wage and pension contributions to employees.<p>
Goal No. 1 Simplicity<p>
Like you, Mr. Chairman, I believe the first goal of tax reform should make the tax code easy to comply with and reduce the role of the federal government in the American people's lives. Unfortunately, the current tax code is complex and intrusive. Each year Americans spend 5.4 billion man-hours preparing their taxes for the government. That's more time than it takes to build every car, truck, and van manufactured in the United States. The IRS now sends out eight billion pages of forms and instructions each year. Laid end to end, they would stretch 28 times the circumference of the earth. After seven decades of amendments, revisions, exemptions, loopholes and extensions, the code has become an incoherent mess.<p>
Does the flat tax make this system more simple and less burdensome? It certainly does. By eliminating the various credits, deductions and loopholes, the flat tax makes the tax system so simple Americans could file their taxes on a form the size of a postcard. Not only would this dramatically reduce the time and resources devoted to complying with the tax code, it would also maybe the federal government  far less intrusive. Americans would need to reveal far less information to the Internal Revenue Service, and under much less duress, than the current system.<p>
Goal No. 2 Promote Saving<p> 
Tax reform should encourage greater saving and investment. Perhaps the worst feature of  today's tax code is its discriminatory treatment of saving. Consider how the present tax code treats saving and investment. Today, we double tax business earnings, which places a strong bias against saving and investment. For example, we tax business earnings through the corporate income tax and then tax dividends -- which are, in fact, after-tax payments. This double taxation of the same stream of income creates a strong bias against saving and investing. Obviously, this makes saving and investing much less attractive relative to consumption. And the nation is poorer as a result.<p>
Capital is the lifeblood of an economy. Without capital, workers cannot enhance their productivity and their wages stagnate. Today's double and even triple taxation of income discourages saving. reduces the pool of capital available to entrepreneurs and workers, slows productivity and wage growth, lowers living standards, and, as a side effect reduces revenue to the Treasury.<p>
Like the other alternatives the committee is considering this week, the tax base of the flat tax is consumption. By eliminating the double taxation of saving and providing for the full expensing of capital investment, the flat tax functions as a kind of consumption tax, much favored by economists. In this sense, the Domenici-Nunn proposal for a consumer income tax and my flat tax arc trying to accomplish the same thing. They are blood brothers in spirit. This goal would be achieved, as well, by a national retail sales tax, or even a European-style value added tax. All of these plans can lay claim to the title of "consumption tax."<p>
Goal Now 3 ~ Improve ~ Competitiveness<p>
Mr. Chairman, the third goal for tax reform you mentioned is  to improve the international competitiveness of American workers and businesses. The flat tax would make the US the most attractive nation in the world for investment, produce a higher economic growth rate and raise living standards.  It would liberate America's businesses to be more efficient replacing today's maze of politically targeted tax breaks with a system that is perfectly neutral as between types and sizes of business, between economic sectors, and between types of investment.  America's entrepreneurs could make decisions based on what makes the best economic sense, rather than diverting talent and resources for tax avoidance strategies.<p>
In other words, the flat tax would relieve the economy from what economists call 'dead weight" or social welfare loss. According to Juncs L. Payne, just the compliance costs of today's tax code add up to $232 billion. When other costs of the current as tax distortions which shift resources away from their most efficient use, thus lowering output -- axe included, the cost to the economy is well into the hundreds of billions of dollars. These costs are pure waste and directly lower the standard of living of the American people. The flat tax would eliminate the vast majority of these costs and dramatically improve the performance of the economy.<p>
The flat tax would also lower the burden currently placed on work, saving, and investment. It rewards work by lowering the top marginal income tax rate from 40 percent to 17 percent. It rewards saving by ending the current double taxation 'of salving, sweeping away the estate tax, the capital gains tax, and the double tax on dividends. And it rewards investment by permitting businesses to immediately deduct all expenses, plant, and equipment. Thus, the flat tax would produce higher productivity and economic growth, leading to higher employment ant wages.<p>
When adding the effects of more work effort, a higher capital stock, and improved incentives for entrepreneurial effort, Professors Hall and Rabushka estimate that a flat tax would increase per capita income by $1,900 by the year 2002. In other words, a typical family of four in America would see its income increase $7,600 more than if we preserve the tax system we have today. Let me emphasize that while this is a truly astonishing number, it is based on the consensus of the economic literature and this is a mainstream estimate. Many studies suggest the number would be even higher.<p>
Border Adjustability<p>
Some have suggested that our tax system should tax imports and not tax exports as a way of making US businesses more competitive in the world market. Congress should make the tax code "border adjustable," as tax policy people put it. The sales tax, VAT, and the Domenici-Nunn USA Tax are all border adjustable, but the flat tax I have proposed is not.<p>
Supporters of a border adjustable system say that it would increase US competitiveness by taxing imports and not taxing exports. This way, American firms receive an advantage over foreign firms and that will favorably alter the balance of trade.<p>
In my view, a border adjustable tax will not be effective in reducing the trade deficit. It's an Immutable law of economics which says that trade surpluses and deficits are linked to the amount a nation lends or borrows. When saving is low, the trade deficit must be high. A tax on imports which is merely a substitute for another tax will not effect the amount Americans save. That means the trade deficit not only will stay the same, it must stay the same. as a basic principle of economics.<p>
Economists might explain it this way: If there is more investing happening in our economy than can be financed by our saving, then foreign investors must be accountable for the difference, In effect, they are taking the money we give them for their cars and VCRs and using it to buy our stocks and bonds, thus supplying the investment capital that we don't supply ourselves. This difference is the "trade deficit."<p>
The only way to change the deficit, then, is to change our savings rate. If we increase our saving relative to our domestic investment, we have less need for foreign cash. The trade deficit will then drop, as we spend relatively less money buying foreign goods and relatively more investing at home.<p>
But anything we do to tax incoming foreign goods--including putting a sales tax on them will have no effect on the amount of money Americans are putting into domestic stocks and bonds or even their own bank accounts. There is simply no relationship between them.<p>
What will happen instead is this: Our exports will increase at first because of the new tax advantage.  Since our saving will remain the same, the dollar will be artificially strengthened. This will make our exports more expensive and imports cheaper, and the original balance of trade will be gradually restored--along with the trade deficit. The policy will be self-defeating.<p>
Even if a border adjustment were to work, I still believe it would be unwise. It would make goods Americans buy --whether produced here in America or abroad--more expensive. while foreigners could purchase American-made goods cheaper. It's hard to see how Americans benefit from paying higher prices than foreigners do to purchase American products.<p>
Adam Smith makes a relevant point in  The Wealth of Nations.  Smith reminds us, "Consumption is the sole end and purpose of all production; and the interests of the producer ought to be attended to, only so far as it may be necessary for promoting that of the consumer."  In a border adjustable system  however, to borrow from Smith again, "the interest of the consumer is almost constantly sacrificed to that of the producer, and it seems to consider production, and not consumption as the ultimate end and object of all industry and commerce."<p>
God No. 4 -- Diminish the Underground Economy<p>
Your final goal, Mr. Chairman, is to increase revenue from the underground economy and others who currently do not comply with the tax laws.  While by its very nature it is difficult to measure, the underground economy is estimated to be in the hundreds of billions of dollars.  Of course,  much of the underground economy is trade in illegal activities such as drugs and  prostitution. This income will never be taxed under any tax system.  However, most of the underground economy is trade in legal goods and services that goes unreported.  Taxing this portion of the underground economy should be an important goal of any tax reform.<p>
The issue of the underground economy is a very serious one because the computer revolution is fundamentally transforming our economy in a way that will make it much more difficult for the federal government to collect revenue. Personal computers, modems and fax machines have made it possible for greater numbers of people to work out of their homes instead of at large businesses, Many of these small businesses can avoid paying taxes far more easily than large companies because they can operate invisibly. The domestic  growth of on-line services such as the Internet portends an era when more goods and services will be traded without a paper trail. making it more difficult for the IRS to audit. As these trends accelerate, our tax system is truly becoming more voluntary everyday. That's why it's especially important to develop a tax code for the 21st Century that Americans are willing to voluntarily comply with.<p>
I am confident the flat tax would shrink the underground economy because it eliminates the three primary excuses for noncompliance. These are, first, the current system's maddening complexity; second, the low likelihood of getting caught; and third, the feeling that today's system is somehow rigged to favor special interests "at my expense" - which, for the most part, it is. Stripped of these rationales for noncompliance, the great majority of taxpayers will find it much easier to pay their taxes and they will be more willing to do so because they will perceive the system as fair. Even for those who still wish to cheat, they will find it much harder to elude detection in a simple system. Therefore, the underground economy will actually shrink.  After all, if you give the American people a tax system that is honest, direct, simple, low, and fair -something they have not had in decades -- does it not stand to reason they would be more inclined to pay their fair share?<p>
I should point out that many advocates of a sales tax have argued that it would more effectively tax the underground economy. The neighborhood drug dealer almost always serves as the illustration. Since the drug dealer declines to file a 1040 form. the argument runs, maybe we would could at least recoup some of his income through a sales tax. The government may have no record that he exists, but when he buy a sports car the government will collect tax from hirn.<p>
That sounds compelling at first, but it doesn't hold together. The reason is this: Both systerns will equally fail to tax the drug trade for the simple reason that the drug dealer will not play along in either one. If there is an income tax place, he won't report his income. If there's a sales tax in place, he won't report his income.  If there's a sales tax in place, he won't collect tax from his customers.  Either way, the government loses exactly the same amount of money.<p>
Consider the following example. Suppose there is a drug dealer and a drug consumer who each earns $50,000. Thus, the total income in the economy is--and the tax base should be-- S100,000. Under an income tax system, we wish to tax the income of both people, while under a sales tax we wish to tax the purchases of both people. Under an income tax, we tax the income of the drug consumer (assuming he is law-abiding citizens besides his use of illegal drugs), but we don't tax the income of a drug dealer. Total tax base: $50,000. While under the sales tax we tax the purchases of the drug dealer, we don't tax the purchases of the drug consumed. Total tax base: S50,000. It has to be the case that neither system taxes the value of the drug trade because the amount people who spend on drugs must equal the income of the drug dealer. And since the dealer will not report sales or income tax, neither system will capture the value of the drug trade.<p>
The same would hold true for the underground economy in legal goods and services as well--which of course is much larger. The proverbial plumber who doesn't report his house call for income tax purposes today would not report it for sales tax purposes either. At best, it would be a wash. That assumes that the sales tax would not encourage more economic activity to underground, which I believe it would. Historical experience demonstrates that a national sales tax of 20 percent would cause the underground economy to explode.<p>
A Final Goal: Fairness<p>
Let me briefly discuss another virtue of the flat tax that I believe is important. The flat tax is fair because everyone pays the same rate, with no special breaks going to politically favored groups. The plan I have proposed is true to the idea of fairness we all learned in grade school: Everyone should be treated the same.<p>
At the same time, it is progressive, thanks to the generous family allowance. The plan is progressive because the family allowance is worth more the less you make. For example, a family of four making $36,000 would pay zero percent of its income in income tax, a family making $50,000 would pay  5 percent of its income and a family making $200,000 would pay 14 percent of its income. I estimate the plan takes about ten million low-income taxpayers off the rolls entirely. This is the definition of progressive.<p>
Conclusion<p>
Mr. Chairman, as you have often pointed out, the current tax system is broken and must be replaced. I commend you for your leadership in holding these hearings ant for outlining a set of criteria for the tax reform debate. I am proud to say that the flat tax meets each of your criteria It would raise revenue efficiently with as little duress and paperwork as  possible. It would end the discriminatory treatment of saving and investment and promote growth in the economy. It would make American businesses the most competitive in the world, creating jobs, boosting wages, and raising living standards. It holds the greatest promise for shrinking the underground economy  by causing taxpayers to be more willing and able to comply with the tax system. And it is neutral--it would beat everybody the same.<p>
For all these reasons, Mr. Chairman, I hope you will give the flat tax the close and thoughtful examination this increasingly popular idea deserves.<p>
Thank you.<p>

<h2>
COMO AYUDAR A LOS NIOS 
</h2>

Robert Rector*
<p>

WASHINGTON <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Recientemente, el capitolio federal fue el escenario de
la manifestacin organizada por el Fondo de Defensa de los Nios. El
objetivo anunciado era llamar la atencin sobre la situacin de los nios en
este pas, mientras que el propsito no anunciado era lograr el continuo
crecimiento del Estado de Bienestar y criticar a los congresistas reformistas.
<dd>	Mientras que la manifestacin tena toda la razn en llamar la atencin
sobre la situacin de muchos nios estadounidenses, es irnico que los nios
estn sufriendo debido a las polticas apoyadas por los organizadores de la
protesta. Los nios sufren porque el Estado de Bienestar izquierdista ha
destrozado los fundamentos morales de los barrios pobres, derrumbando el
matrimonio, destruyendo la tica de trabajo y dejando una estela de
patologa social.
<dd>	El fracaso de la Guerra contra la Pobreza surge de su premisa falsa, la
creencia de que la pobreza material es el meollo del problema de los nios
de los barrios. Segn este punto de vista, al reducir la pobreza se aumenta
automticamente el bienestar de los nios, logrando su desarrollo. De igual
manera, como la pobreza es la "causa" del crimen, del fracaso escolar, de la
ilegitimidad, de las drogas y de la erosin de la tica del trabajo, el
aumento de la beneficencia pblica reduce no slo la pobreza sino al mismo
tiempo todos los dems problemas sociales. De tal lgica simplista surgi el
esfuerzo durante 30 aos en aumentar los beneficios, expandir la
elegibilidad, crear nuevos programas y aumentar el presupuesto. La
manifestacin del Fondo de Defensa de los Nios repiti toda esta vieja
cantaleta.
<dd>	Pero la historia impugna esa ingenua creencia. En 1950, casi una tercera
parte de la poblacin de Estados Unidos era pobre (el doble de la tasa
actual). En 1920, ms o menos la mitad de la poblacin era pobre segn el
estndar actual. Si fuera verdad que la pobreza material es la causa de los
problemas sociales, debiramos haber tenido problemas muchos ms graves en
esas pocas que ahora, cuando la realidad es todo lo contrario: el crimen,
la disolucin de la familia y la mayora de los dems problemas sociales no
eran la sombra de los que confrontamos hoy.
<dd>	Tanto la historia como el sentido comn indican que los valores y las
habilidades existentes en las familias y no sus ingresos son los que
determinan el rendimiento de los nios. Las familias exitosas tienden a
tener valores slidos en cuanto al autocontrol, postergar placeres, trabajo,
educacin y matrimonio, todo lo cual traspasan a sus hijos. El intento de
aumentar artificialmente el ingreso familiar beneficia muy poco a los nios,
pero va lejos en su destruccin de los mismos valores que son claves para el
xito. El punto que la izquierda rehusa reconocer es que la beneficencia
pblica tiene efectos secundarios: engendra dependencia e ilegitimidad que
son nefastos para el desarrollo de los nios. Por ejemplo, entre las casi 5
millones de familias que reciben beneficios, el tiempo que estn bajo esos
programas promedia casi 13 aos. Segn el informe en 1994 de June O'Neill,
la directora de la Oficina de Presupuesto del Congreso, aumentar el lapso en
que un nio recibe beneficencia pblica puede reducir su inteligencia en
20%. O'Neill deja muy claro que es la dependencia de la beneficencia y no la
pobreza lo que realmente hace dao a los nios.
<dd>	Al pagar ms a las mujeres para que tengan ms hijos fuera del matrimonio,
la beneficencia pblica juega un papel importante en la promocin de la
ilegitimidad. Nacer fuera del matrimonio y crecer en un hogar con una madre
soltera triplica los problemas emocionales y de comportamiento entre los
nios, a la vez que tambin triplica su actividad sexual, dobla la
probabilidad de que las nias tengan hijos fuera del matrimonio y que los
nios incurran en actividades delictivas que los har terminar en la crcel.
<dd>	No es posible ayudar a los nios persistiendo en polticas equivocadas. El
sistema actual de beneficencia pblica tiene que ser reemplazado y hay que
terminar con el crecimiento automtico de los gastos en beneficencia. La
beneficencia no puede continuar siendo una calle de una sola va; los
beneficiarios tienen que trabajar para recibir la ayuda. Hay que reducir la
ilegitimidad restringiendo las ddivas en efectivo a las muchachas solteras
con hijos.
<dd>	Las instituciones religiosas han sido dramticamente exitosas en reducir la
actividad sexual de los jvenes, el delito, las drogas y dems problemas.
Una manera de darle acceso a los pobres a tales fuentes de esperanza es a
travs de vales que puedan ser utilizados por las familias pobres para
mandar a sus hijos a escuelas privadas, incluyendo escuelas religiosas.
<dd>	Pero la ciudadana debe recordar que el bien intencionado gobierno grande
que quiere mantener una izquierda que apoda a los reformistas como
"anti-nios" est promocionando justamente todo aquello que daa a nuestra
juventud: la beneficencia pblica.&copy

<i>August 7, 1996</i><br>
<H2>ARGENTINA: EL GRAN DESAFIO DEL NUEVO MINISTRO</H2>
Gerardo Bongiovanni*<p>
ROSARIO, ARGENTINA (<a href ="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Roque Fernndez, el nuevo ministro de Economa,
tiene credenciales tcnicas intachables. Graduado de la Universidad de
Chicago fue uno de los creadores del Centro de Estudios Macroeconmicos
Argentinos (CEMA). El peso argentino ha sobrellevado bien la transicin,
pero ahora Fernndez tendr que afrontar el dficit fiscal que lleva ya ocho
trimestres y que se ha agudizado en los ltimos tiempos. 
<dd>
Uno de los principales problemas de la economa argentina es el persistente
aumento del gasto pblico que en  1991 fue de $47.300 millones y que se ha
disparado 74% en cuatro aos, alcanzando $82.300 millones para 1995. Es
cierto que buena parte de este aumento se explica por el reconocimiento de
deudas pblicas -como en el caso de las jubilaciones y pensiones-, pero si
se piensa que en este mismo lapso se han privatizado decenas de empresas
pblicas -casi todas ellas deficitarias-, transferido cargas al sector
privado, como el mantenimiento de rutas ahora realizado a travs de peajes,
y se han eliminado organismos y dependencias, tal incremento resulta
verdaderamente asombroso.
<dd>
Algunos ejemplos ilustran la urgencia de reformas: la Presidencia de la
Nacin, con sus diez secretaras y doce organismos dependientes tiene 20.000
personas a su cargo y un presupuesto anual de ms de $1.200 millones, casi
el doble que lo que gasta el Poder Judicial Federal.
<dd>
El nmero de secretaras y subsecretraras ministeriales no ha hecho ms
que aumentar en los ltimos aos, no obstante un decreto del ao 1990 que
limitaba su nmero. A principios de 1991 haba 10 secretaras y 55
subsecretarias; hoy llegan a 58 y 111 respectivamente. Ahora se anuncia la
decisin de eliminar algunas, pero simultneamente se crearn tres o cuatro
nuevos ministerios que seguramente compensarn dichas reducciones.
<dd>
Captulo aparte es el llamado gasto social. En Argentina los gastos
sociales representan ms del 60% del total de gastos del gobierno. Estos
dineros no llegan a quienes lo necesitan sino que se quedan en el largo
camino de la burocracia. La paradoja es que se crean organismos para ayudar
a los pobres y luego 70% de sus presupuestos se gastan en sueldos de
burcratas. La nica pobreza que as se alivia es la de los empleados pblicos. 
<dd>
Pero indudablemente donde mayor es el caos y la irresponsabilidad oficial
es en las provincias y municipios. El empleo pblico provincial pas de
580.000 agentes en 1991 a ms de 1.100.000 en 1995, un incremento de 90%. En
tanto el gasto total de las provincias y municipios creci en 82% desde 1991
a 1995, de $20.700 millones a $37.700 millones.
En algunos estados hay un burcrata provincial por cada diez habitantes. Y
en general, el rubro salarios consume entre 70% y 80% de los presupuestos
provinciales, lo que claramente es indicativo del exceso de personal.
<dd>
El gobierno nacional trata de afrontar la situacin mediante "pactos
fiscales", a travs de los cuales compromete a los gobiernos provinciales
fondos y les exige como contrapartida que avancen en las privatizaciones de
bancos, energa, agua, etc. Hasta ahora los resultados han sido mediocres
debido a que, bajo el sistema fiscal argentino, el gobierno nacional recauda
la mayor parte de los impuestos y los "coparticipa" entre las provincias,
que a su vez hacen los mismo con los municipios.
<dd>
Este sistema fiscal de "arriba hacia abajo", en donde los estados y
ciudades generan una pequea parte de su presupuesto y reciben el resto,
desalienta toda intencin de ahorrar y reformar, ya que no hay premios ni
castigos, a la vez que se aleja a la administracin pblica del control
ciudadano. En Argentina, el grueso de las funciones gubernamentales son
asumidas por el gobierno federal.
<dd>
El ministro Fernndez parece estar consciente de la necesidad de
profundizar las reformas, reducir el peso de los impuestos e imponer
disciplina y eficiencia en el sector pblico. De no lograrlo, los mercados
internacionales nos impondrn la necesaria disciplina, un escenario que no
sera muy bonito.

<title>SEGURO SOCIAL: APRENDIENDO DE AMERICA LATINA -- 11/14/96</title>

<h2>SEGURO SOCIAL: APRENDIENDO DE AMERICA LATINA
</h2>
Gary S. Becker*<br>
<p>
BUENOS AIRES (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Desde 1989, Argentina rpidamente ha introducido
revolucionarias reformas para reducir el control y las regulaciones
gubernamentales. La privatizacin de su sistema de seguridad social ha sido
el paso ms importante en los ltimos dos aos. La experiencia argentina
muestra que, aun bajo circunstancias econmicas muy difciles, una nacin
puede convertir exitosamente su viejo sistema de reparto en un plan privado
de pensiones, con cuentas individuales.
<p>
El sistema de reparto cobra impuestos a los trabajadores para pagar las
pensiones de los retirados. El impuesto combinado a trabajadores y
empleadores en Argentina haba alcanzado 50% de la nmina, una aplastante
carga que desalentaba la creacin de puestos de trabajo, por lo que el
desempleo es de 17%.
<p>
Para evitar tanto los impuestos de Seguro Social como las exageradas
regulaciones, muchos trabajadores y empresas se pasaron a la economa
informal, estimndose que casi la mitad de los trabajadores argentinos
trabaja ilegalmente.
<p>
Cuando tantos trabajadores dejaron de aportar al Seguro Social, la
proporcin de aportantes a beneficiarios lleg a ser uno a uno, la ms alta
en el mundo. As se creo un crculo vicioso de altos impuestos a la nmina
empujando a trabajadores a la informalidad, lo cual presionaba para aumentar
an ms los impuestos.
<p>
El programa de privatizacin de pensiones iniciado en 1994 le da la opcin
a los trabajadores de quedarse en el viejo sistema estatal o transferir sus
contribuciones -fijadas en no menos de 11% de sus salarios- a uno de los
muchos fondos privados. Ms del 60% han optado por los fondos privados.
<p>
Los trabajadores, con cuentas individuales, acumulan un patrimonio para su
retiro, adems de que ganan intereses y dividendos sobre sus inversiones.
Los fondos hasta ahora han invertido principalmente en bonos
gubernamentales, pero se irn cambiando a acciones y bonos de empresas
privadas a medida que se recupere la economa argentina. Estas inversiones
ampliarn el mercado de capitales y mejores rendimientos aumentarn la tasa
de ahorro. Para impedir riesgos excesivos, el gobierno argentino supervisa
la colocacin de los fondos.
<p>
Los impuestos a la nmina que pagan trabajadores y empresas han podido
reducirse en 10 puntos. El mejor rendimiento de los fondos privados
significa que los trabajadores pueden aportar menos de lo que hacan al
viejo sistema y, de todos modos, recibir pensiones mayores. Y el aporte a la
seguridad social, en el caso de los trabajadores dej de ser un impuesto
para convertirse en una inversin, por lo que algunos trabajadores comienzan
a abandonar la economa informal.
<p>
Los economistas tienden a preocuparse por la transicin de un sistema de
reparto a la seguridad social privada. Pero Argentina est confirmando lo
que Chile demostr hace 15 aos: la transicin puede ser manejada fcilmente
porque el sistema privado es tanto ms eficiente.
<p>
An as los opositores a la privatizacin mantienen que no conviene en
Estados Unidos y Europa e insisten en asustar a los pensionados diciendo que
se les recortarn los beneficios. Todo lo contrario, la transicin debe ser
mucho ms fcil en Estados Unidos y Europa por gozar de mercados de
capitales mucho ms desarrollados que en la Argentina. Pero s se har ms
difcil en la medida de que se posponga porque el nmero de retirados est
creciendo ms rpidamente que el nmero de trabajadores.
<p>
Las naciones industrializadas deben sentirse agradecidas porque los
latinoamericanos estn mostrando el camino a seguirse y han sido pioneros en
la privatizacin del seguro social. Tanto los pensionados como los
trabajadores de las naciones ricas apoyaran la privatizacin si supieran lo
exitosa que ha sido en Argentina, un pas con mayores problemas econmicos
que las ms estancadas economas europeas.

<h2>
SE CAE LA PRIVATIZACIN EN MEXICO
</h2>     
     
     
Roberto Salinas-Len*
<p>

CIUDAD DE MEXICO <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- La polmica sobre la privatizacin de la
petroqumica mexicana se ha polarizado entre aquellos que celebran el
monopolio estatal de la industria petrolera como smbolo de soberana
nacional y los que reclaman nuevas estrategias para capitalizar y modernizar
uno de los sectores ms atrasados, pero con mayor potencial de crecimiento
en la economa mexicana.
<dd>	Este es otro de tantos dramas que ha sufrido nuestra economa desde el
estallido de la crisis financiera. La privatizacin es una forma de aumentar
la productividad de las empresas, de permitir que el gobierno elimine
derroches presupuestales y se logren atraer nuevas inversiones de capital
productivo. Sin embargo, la mayora de los mexicanos ven la privatizacin
con malos ojos, ms como un instrumento de amiguismo para privilegiar a unos
pocos a costa de un pueblo desesperado y empobrecido.
<dd>	Por otra parte, la ciudadana percibe que la llamada soberana nacional se
manipula a conveniencia,  para que lderes corporativistas y sindicales
mantengan su poder personal, ya que lo que se anuncia como propiedad de "la
Nacin" no es en realidad propiedad de nadie. Los grupos de oposicin
(sindicatos, intelectuales de izquierda, representantes de la burocracia
mexicana) proponen realizar un referndum sobre si se debe privatizar o no
las plantas petroqumicas. Pero ms que un referndum lo que se necesita es
ampliar la propiedad de esas empresas entre numerosas personas y grupos. As
se ha hecho con xito en pases como Chile, Inglaterra y la Repblica Checa,
donde la venta de empresas a los trabajadores y entre las clases ms
humildes produjo un fuerte apoyo a la iniciativa privatizadora.
<dd>	Es desafortunado que el debate se haya centrado sobre si se debe privatizar
la petroqumica o no, en vez de cmo se debe realizar una necesaria
privatizacin. La realidad es que las empresas llamadas "privadas" tienden a
ser ms pblicas que las empresas "pblicas", las cuales tienden a estar
bajo el frreo control y funcionar para beneficio de burcratas y polticos.
La industria petrolera mexicana es un triste ejemplo de todo esto.
<dd>	Claro que si la privatizacin se concibe como PRI-vatizacin, es decir,
como medio para fortalecer el esquema mercantilista mexicano, donde el
precio y los ingresos para el fisco son las principales prioridades, como
sucedi con la privatizacin de la banca, entonces el referndum debera dar
un voto negativo. Pero sera muy diferente si la privatizacin abarca un fin
popular, de privatizar la propiedad de la petroqumica entre el ms amplio
sector posible.
<dd>	En realidad, el fiel cumplimiento de una privatizacin bien estructurada es
ms importante que el precio en s de la venta. Es fundamental usar la
privatizacin como medio de acceso universal a la propiedad, preferiblemente
por un nmero significativo de nuevos accionistas. En Mxico, la motivacindel proceso no es popular ni mucho menos de aumentar la tenencia de
propiedad entre un creciente sector ajeno a los corredores del poder
gubernamental. Se habla, ms bien, de la "reestructuracin" del sector
pblico y de la "racionalizacin de la participacin estatal en la economa".
<dd>	El esquema que se pretende usar en el caso de la petroqumica no respeta la
necesidad de diversificar la estructura accionaria de las empresas entre la
poblacin y la falta de apoyo oblig al gobierno zedillista a revocar la
participacin de empresas extranjeras, aun cuando estas son las que podran
contribuir ms a la modernizacin del sector petroqumico. Ello signific un
triunfo parcial para los antagonistas jursicos del falso nacionalismo que
tanto dao le han hecho a Mxico. &copy;

<title>LA ARGENTINA DESPUES DE CAVALLO</title>

<h2>
LA ARGENTINA DESPUES DE CAVALLO
</h2>     
Mark Falcoff*<P>
<BR>
WASHINGTON  (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).-- Pocos funcionarios en la historia de Amrica Latina han
gozado de la reputacin internacional -y del poder interno- de Domingo
Cavallo, hasta hace poco ministro de Economa. Con su salida comienza una
nueva era en la poltica argentina.
<P>
 Durante 5  6 aos, el equipo Menem-Cavallo tuvo extraordinario xito no
slo en frenar una inflacin galopante sino en restaurar la confianza
internacional respecto a la economa argentina. Ello suministr un cojn
poltico no disfrutado antes por ningn otro gobierno en la Argentina y
Menem al centrar su campaa por la reeleccin del ao pasado en la
estabilidad monetaria logr aumentar en dos puntos, a 51%, su participacin
en el voto popular. Hoy, las encuestas sealan una aprobacin por Menem de
apenas 20%.
<P>
 Cmo el poltico ms exitoso en la Argentina desde Pern (fundador de su
partido) ha sufrido tan dramtica cada en la aprobacin popular? La
contestacin corta es que los argentinos dan como un hecho la estabilidad
monetaria y ahora tienen prioridades diferentes, como el desempleo que
alcanza marcas sin precedentes. Otros asuntos preocupan tambin, como el
alto costo de la vida, la criminalidad y un sistema judicial corrupto e
ineficiente. Los argentinos quieren un gobierno ms serio, algo
aparentemente imposible para Menem.
<P>
 Rumores de corrupcin hacen muy difcil la labor del nuevo ministro de
Economa. La actitud general parece ser que si el gobierno roba y derrocha
los recursos, porqu voy a pagar impuestos? Esta reaccin explica en parte
la cada masiva de recursos anunciada por el sucesor de Cavallo, Roque
Fernndez, en su primer discurso televisado.
<P>
 El primer reto del pobre Fernndez es explicar a los argentinos que el
dficit fiscal es mucho mayor que el anunciado por Cavallo, el cual
alcanzar este ao $6.600 millones (un peso = un dlar). Para reducirlo, el ministro 
anunci una serie de nuevos impuestos, la rebaja del ingreso sujeto
al impuesto sobre la renta y la extensin a 65 aos para que las mujeres
sean pensionadas. Peor todava, Fernndez anunci aranceles a repuestos y
equipos que reducirn la rentabilidad de muchas de las fbricas modernas.
<P>
 Tales medidas draconianas que reducirn el nivel de vida de la aporreada
clase media se presentan como necesarias en la defensa de la paridad
peso/dlar, pero as slo podemos esperar ms de lo mismo: ningn incremento
en el empleo ni reactivacin econmica. Por ello muchos peronistas se estn
distanciando de Fernndez y del presidente Menem.
<P>
 Sin embargo, la oposicin sigue dividida. La tradicional oposicin al
peronismo ha sido la Unin Cvica Radical, pero los argentinos recuerdan la
hiperinflacin sufrida durante la administracin del presidente radical Ral
Alfonsn (1983-1989), la cual lo oblig a renunciar con siete meses de
anticipacin al trmino de su perodo. Para horror de los radicales,
Alfonsn inform a la prensa en agosto que no haba abandonado totalmente la
idea de candidatearse nuevamente.
<P>
 La esperanza radical es el nuevo alcalde de Buenos Aires, donde vive un
tercio de la poblacin del pas. Fernando de la Rua, elegido en julio,
disfruta de 63% de aprobacin en las encuestas. El fue congresista por ms
de 20 aos y tiene reputacin de hombre decente y honrado, algo raro en la
poltica argentina. Pero no le gusta arriesgarse ni tomar decisiones
difciles y ser retado por dos miembros del ala izquierda de su partido,
Rodolfo Terragno (actual presidente del partido) y el congresista Federico
Storani.
<P>
 Desde 1993 surgi una tercera fuerza izquierdista con Frepaso, cuyo
candidato presidencial en 1995, Jos Octavio Bordn, qued en segundo lugar.
Pero en la eleccin del alcalde de Buenos Aires obtuvieron resultados
decepcionantes y Bordn anunci su retiro de la poltica. Frepaso no es un
partido sino una coalicin de grupos disimilares unidos en contra del statu
quo y actualmente organiza una serie de apagones, bocinazos y cacerolazos.
 Argentina ha sufrido una cada en su nivel de vida en los ltimos dos aos
y la oposicin comparte el odio hacia Menem, su familia, sus allegados y sus
polticas econmicas. La esperanza de que un inmenso influjo de inversiones
extranjeras absorberan el desempleo generado por las privatizaciones no se
ha hecho realidad. No sucedi porque muchos de esos ex empleados pblicos no
son capaces de convertirse en trabajadores productivos. Durante 50 aos el
objetivo del gobierno fue el pleno empleo aun con el deterioro de los
sueldos. El sistema educacional es obsoleto y no est preparado para formar
trabajadores en la era de la computacin.
<P>
 Menem ha sido presidente por siete aos, por ms tiempo que cualquier otro
excepto Pern. Duerme largas siestas y toma extensas vacaciones en el
exterior. Apenas aparece la oportunidad de un viaje sale con 100
acompaantes. Sin embargo, en el pasado ha sorprendido tanto a amigos como a
enemigos con su capacidad de enfocar y dominar situaciones difciles. Tendr
que repetirlo pronto, si es que piensa dejar una buena situacin cuando
termine su mandato dentro de tres aos. &copy;

<title>Statement of Principles on Telecommunications Policy -- PFF</title>
</head>
<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/pff/notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="/pff/pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>
<h1>Statement of Principles on Telecommunications Policy</h1>
Rapid technological advances are creating a revolution in communications.
These advances are making possible countless new products and services
which could vastly improve the quality of life in America and the
competitiveness of the U.S. economy. However, these developments are being
impeded by a complex and outdated web of governmental regulations.
<P>
This year, Congress will be considering a broad range of regulatory reform
initiatives. Telecommunications policy reform, with its potential impact on
one of the largest and most vital sectors of the U.S. economy, should be
considered a crucial part of these efforts. Needed reforms include:
<OL>
<LI>Elimination of barriers to competition. Government should not be in the
business of protecting monopolies. Federal and state policies that bar
competition in the provision of local telephone, cable and other services
should be eliminated.

<LI>Elimination of artificial barriers between industries. Provision of many
telecommunications services is kept artificially segregated by the AT&T
consent decree, federal law, and FCC regulations. Barriers between
telecommunications services should be eliminated as soon as possible. In
particular, the long-distance service and manufacturing restrictions in the
AT&T consent decree should be eliminated by a date certain. Similarly,
outdated cross-ownership restrictions on broadcasters should be eliminated.


<LI>Reduction of the burden of regulation. Policymakers should rely upon
markets and consumers--not regulation--to determine prices and services.
The role and scope of FCC regulation should therefore be greatly reduced.

Competitive markets--including those for competitive local services and
AT&T's long-distance service--should not be regulated. In less competitive
markets where regulations has proved harmful to consumers, such as cable
television, regulation should also be rolled back. In no case should
rate-of-return regulation be used.

<LI>Elimination of protectionist policies. Currently, federal law bars
non-citizens from holding most FCC licenses. As a result, not only are
consumers denied the benefits of additional investment from abroad, but
foreign governments are encouraged to restrict U.S. investment. These
restrictions should be repealed.

<LI>Elimination of telecommunications subsidies. Current telecommunications
policies contain billions of dollars in hidden cross-subsidies intended to
further universal service and other goals. These payments are not targeted
to those in need and are hidden from public view. If not eliminated, any
subsidies should be limited in scope, targeted to those in need and subject
to normal appropriations processes.

<LI>Freeing the radio spectrum. The electromagnetic spectrum is currently
subject to an inefficient system of central planning and control.
</uL>
Frequencies should instead be assigned and allocated based on market
forces, allowing new technologies to develop and consumer preferences to be
better served. Licensees should be allowed to use frequencies for any
purpose, as long as users of the spectrum should be extended the same First
Amendment protection as other media.
<P>
Congress has a rare opportunity this year to implement long-overdue reform
of telecommunications policy. Instead of trying to adapt an outdated
regulatory scheme to today's telecommunications landscape, Congress should
allow markets and consumers to determine the course of this industry.

<h2>
CUBA: LAS MENTIRAS OFICIALES
</h2>     
Vladimir Chelminski*<BR>
<P>
CARACAS (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).-- Toda Amrica Latina, excepto Cuba, pudo ver la entrevista
que le hizo Dan Rather a Fidel Castro y el posterior debate sobre la misma
entre Ricardo Alarcn, presidente de la Asamblea del Poder Popular de Cuba y
Jorge Mas Canosa, presidente de la Fundacin Nacional Cubano-Americana. La
aseveracin del Sr. Alarcn de que el deseo de emigrar a Estados Unidos no
es un fenmeno cubano sino ms bien una realidad latinoamericana tiene algo
de verdad. La diferencia es que en Cuba la gente est desesperada por comer
completo, sufre una total falta de libertad y la imposibilidad de soar en
una vida mejor dentro de su patria.
<P>
Puede ser que muchos de los pobres de Amrica Latina
quisieran emigrar a Estados Unidos, pero no estaran dispuestos a correr los
mismos riesgos. Y mienten las autoridades cubanas cuando aseguran que la
falta de todo en la isla se debe al embargo estadounidense, pues estamos en
la era de las comunicaciones, por lo que es posible importar mercancas de
diferentes orgenes siempre y cuando se pague con moneda dura. La verdadera
causa de la escasez en Cuba es que el socialismo destruy todo incentivo por
producir e intercambiar.
<P>
Lamentablemente, por toda Amrica Latina campea la miseria, pero tambin hay
que aclarar que en gran parte ella se debe a la irresponsabilidad individual
que nos ha caracterizado en materia de paternidad, como tambin a que en
muchos aspectos vitales hemos seguido modelos socialistas no muy diferentes
al cubano.
<P> 
Esferas tan importantes como la educacin, la salud, el
transporte, la produccin y distribucin de energa han sido socializadas
por nuestros gobiernos, los cuales tambin han tendido a monopolizar la
explotacin de nuestras riquezas naturales y de aquellos renglones en los
que gozamos de ventajas comparativas, eliminando as la competencia, sin la
cual no existe eficiencia alguna en la produccin ni en la distribucin.
<P>
La mayora de nuestras constituciones fueron redactadas o
enmendadas por simpatizantes de las ideas de Marx y Lenin, las mismas que
inspiraron la revolucin castrista. En el resto de Amrica Latina, el estado
no ha sido tan horriblemente cruel y sanguinario, pero a travs de una
constante intervencin en la vida y el trabajo de los ciudadanos tambin ha
logrado retrasar nuestro desarrollo y nuestra habilidad de competir en el
mundo moderno.
<P>
Los cubanos prefieren emigrar a Estados Unidos, pero en su
defecto lo haran gustosamente a  cualquier otro pas del hemisferio
occidental, mientras que nadie en su sano juicio intentara jams emigrar a
Cuba, a menos de que sea perseguido por la justicia.
<P>
El respeto a los derechos de propiedad, que son la base de
la prosperidad y seguridad en Estados Unidos, fue el principal objetivo
atacado frontalmente por la Revolucin Cubana. La propiedad no es muy
respetada tampoco por la mayora de los polticos latinoamericanos, quienes
se aprestan a rechazar la Ley Helms-Burton, la cual pretende impedir que se
trafique con propiedades de ciudadanos estadounidenses que la revolucin
confisc, sin compensacin alguna.
<P>
Sobre expropiaciones arbitrarias en Amrica Latina tenemos
una larga y triste experiencia, aunque es plida frente a la de los cubano.
Como es tan tenue el respeto a la propiedad privada  en Amrica Latina,
nuestros lderes no estn en capacidad de entender bien una ley que se
refiere a  propiedades robadas por el estado. El da que el pueblo de Cuba y
del resto de Amrica Latina entienda cabalmente la importancia del concepto
de la propiedad como institucin social fundamental que alienta la
administracin cuidadosa de recursos escasos, comenzar entonces una
revolucin pacfica conducente a la prosperidad, el orden y el amor por la
patria. 
<P>      
Pero est claro que el problema cubano es mucho ms
dramtico que el del resto de Amrica Latina, a la vez que es inslito que
por todo el continente se desplacen sacerdotes propagando laTeologa de la
Liberacin, la idea de que una revolucin como la cubana  puede ser el
remedio para nuestros males. Es tambin absurdo que nuestros gobernantes
continen apoyando la dictadura castrista frente a un pas libre como
Estados Unidos. &copy;

aprender de Chile la mejor manera de proteger a las personas retiradas.
<P>
 Aunque Chile no goza actualmente de una economa idealmente libre (a escala
mundial ocupa el rango 22 entre los 150 pases evaluados), s tiene la
economa ms libre de Amrica Latina. Si incluimos a las naciones del
Caribe, Bahamas est por delante de Chile, en el puesto nmero 9, a nivel
mundial.
<P>
 Lamentablemente, el hemisferio tambin cuenta con tres de las economas ms
reprimidas del mundo: Cuba, en el puesto 148, adems de Surinam y Hait,
empatados en el puesto 133.
<P>
 Esta evaluacin y jerarqua provienen del "Indice de Libertad Econmica
1997", editado conjuntamente por Heritage Foundation y The Wall Street
Journal, libro a publicarse el 16 de diciembre. All Hong Kong sigue
ocupando el primer puesto, como la economa ms libre del mundo. Este
volumen de 520 pginas presenta estadsticas comparativas sobre el nivel de
libertad econmica en 150 naciones.
<P>
 El Indice muestra a otros 13 pases de Amrica Latina y el Caribe con
economas bsicamente libres: Panam (31), El Salvador empatado con Trinidad
y Tobago en el puesto 34, Jamaica (36), Argentina (42), Belice y Uruguay
empatados en el puesto 43, Paraguay (46), Costa Rica empatado con Guatemala
y Barbados en el puesto 50, Bolivia (59) y Per (64).
<P>
 Los pases sin libertad econmica en el hemisferio incluyen al Ecuador
(75), Colombia (78), Honduras (84), Brasil y Mxico empatados en el puesto
94, la Repblica Dominicana (100), Guyana (104) y, a la cola, Nicaragua y
Venezuela en la posicin 108.
<P>
 En cada pas se analizan diez factores determinantes: si tienen una
poltica de intercambio comercial abierta o restrictiva, las tasas del
impuesto personal y empresarial, el grado de intervencin gubernamental en
la economa, si goza de una moneda estable, el grado en que motiva o
desalienta la inversin extranjera, si los salarios y precios son libremente
determinados por el mercado o fijados por el gobierno, cun efectivamente se
protegen los derechos de propiedad, el volumen de regulacin estatal y el
tamao de la economa informal. A cada pas se le asigna una nota en cada
una de estas 10 reas, del uno (mejor) al cinco (peor). Luego se saca un
promedio de estas notas y al pas se le asigna su posicin segn el promedio
obtenido.
<P>
 Adems de presentar un informe anual sobre el grado de libertad econmica,
este libro de Heritage y The Wall Street Journal  explica porqu unos pases
prosperan y otros retroceden. Las naciones econmicamente ms libres son
tambin las ms ricas, con el mayor ingreso per capita.
<P>
Por qu es esta una informacin importante? Tomemos el caso de Bangladesh,
en el puesto 118, un poco peor que Venezuela y Nicaragua. Si Bangladesh
contina con sus actuales polticas econmicas le tomar 102 aos alcanzar
el actual nivel de vida de Estados Unidos y de Europa occidental. Por el
contrario, si Bangladesh aplica polticas similares a Chile, obteniendo un
crecimiento de 6% anual, su gente alcanzara el nivel de vida de Estados
Unidos en 40 aos. La clave es la libertad econmica.
<P>
 Aunque la liberacin econmica no puede transformar a una nacin de la
noche al da, varios pases de nuestro hemisferio estn avanzando por ese
camino: Chile, Ecuador, Guatemala, Per, Barbados y Jamaica han seguido
progresando sucesivamente en las tres ediciones anuales del Indice. Por el
contrario, Venezuela y Colombia han retrocedido durante el mismo tiempo.
<P>
 El clima, la cultura, la educacin, la geografa, la infraestructura, la
fertilidad de sus tierras, sus riquezas naturales y la innovacin
tecnolgica contribuyen al xito econmico de un pas, pero ninguna nacin,
a largo plazo, tiene xito sin libertad econmica. Esto lo han demostrado
Chile y los "tigres" del Asia (Hong Kong, Singapur, Corea del Sur y Taiwan).
Amrica Latina est cada da ms consciente de ello.

<i>August 7, 1996</i><br>
<H2>LAS CIUDADES NECESITAN MENOS, NO MAS, GOBIERNO</H2>
Harry Browne*<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- El gobierno no funciona. No mantiene la seguridad en
nuestras ciudades, no educa bien a nuestros hijos, la beneficencia
gubernamental es un incentivo a no hacer nada y no entrega el correo a
tiempo. Sin embargo, durante la campaa electoral oiremos mltiples
propuestas sobre nuevos programas para arreglar tales problemas, a pesar de
haber sido el gobierno quien los ha causado.
<dd>	
Examinemos los tres principales retos que enfrentan las ciudades hoy en
da: psimo sistema educativo, programas desbocados de beneficencia y
crmenes violentos. Aunque parecen ser problemas eternos son en realidad
relativamente nuevos. Estados Unidos era muy diferente en los aos 50.
<dd>	
La educacin no era perfecta, pero los graduados de bachillerato podan al
menos leer los exmenes de admisin a la universidad. La gran mayora de los
muchachos se graduaban de bachillerato con una educacin bsica en historia,
geografa, ciencias y matemticas.
<dd>
La beneficencia estatal era prcticamente desconocida. De ello se ocupaban
instituciones privadas y si acaso haba una pequea oficina en la parte
trasera de la alcalda. En tales sitios, cualquiera tena que explicar cmo
se haba metido en problemas y qu estaba dispuesto a hacer para salir de
ellos. Si su historia era creble y cumpla con sus promesas, se le ayudaba.
Debido a que no se necesitaba mucha beneficencia pblica, muchos
desconocamos su existencia.
<dd>
La estadstica de crmenes eran una fraccin de la actual. Cuando crec en
un suburbio de Los Angeles, sola caminar una milla para ir al cine, a las
10 de la noche los viernes, sin la menor preocupacin por mi seguridad. Hoy
no me siento seguro caminando las mismas calles a la 10 de la maana.
<dd>
Qu ha cambiado desde los aos 50? Mucho y el cambio ms grande de todos
ha sido la invasin del gobierno federal a nuestras ciudades y nuestras vidas.
<dd>
El patrn es el mismo en todas partes. El gobierno federal ofreci pequeos
subsidios para complementar los presupuestos municipales y estatales; luego
aument los subsidios. Una vez que el gobierno local se haba convertido en
adicto a tales subsidios tuvieron que obedecer para seguir recibiendo
dinero. Como resultado de todo esto, gran parte de las decisiones hoy se
toman en Washington. Los presupuestos locales son exageradamente altos, en
muchos casos porque el gobierno local tiene que gastar grandes sumas de su
propio dinero para calificar en la obtencin de fondos federales.
<dd>
El Congreso republicano ha respondido prohibiendo mandatos federales que no
asuman sus costos y al ofrecer traspasar a los estados fondos libres de
ataduras. Pero ninguna de las dos respuestas es suficiente. Tenemos que
quitarnos de encima todos los mandatos federales, tanto los que paga el
gobierno central como los que no. Los polticos de Washington no saben lo
que conviene a su ciudad. Y cul es la ventaja de enviar dinero a
Washington para que luego sea devuelto? Tenemos que quitarnos al gobierno
federal de encima en educacin, beneficencia y control criminal.
<dd>
Y aunque estos son los problemas ms obvios no son los nicos. Washington
hace tambin dao interfiriendo en la construccin de carreteras, en salud,
en el ambiente, etc.
<dd>
Segn el censo, el gobierno federal, estatal y local toma el 47% del
ingreso nacional en impuestos. Al tratar de resolverlo todo a travs del
gobierno, hemos agravado los problemas de las ciudades e imposibilitado a
los contribuyentes enfrentar sus propios problemas.
<dd>
Debemos empezar el camino de la recuperacin limitando al gobierno federal
a slo aquellas funciones determinadas por la Constitucin. Eso reducira el
tamao del gobierno lo suficiente como para revocar el impuesto sobre la
renta, permitiendo a las ciudades resolver sus problemas.
<dd>
Para ver el alcance de esta revolucin fjese cunto le deducen de su
sueldo en impuesto sobre la renta y Seguro Social. Entonces pregntese lo
que usted podra hacer con ese dinero. Pondra a sus nios en colegios
privados que ofrecen mejor educacin y valores? Ahorrara para abrirse por
su cuenta como siempre lo ha deseado? Se mudara a una casa mejor?
Ayudara ms a su obra de caridad preferida?
<dd>	
Usted trabaja por ese dinero y debiera poder decidir su uso. Eso no es
funcin de los polticos, quitndoselo para luego devolverle lo que les
parece, como si usted fuera un nio recibiendo una mesada.
<dd>	
Hay algn beneficio que el gobierno le da que usted no pueda reemplazar
con creces con el dinero que ahorrara en impuestos?
<dd>	
Es hora de volver a tomar posesin de nuestras ciudades, de nuestro dinero
y de nuestras vidas.

<b>Comments:</b><P>

<ul>
"Conservatives often get too caught up in the many proble
ith the was affirmative action is currently implemented, and forget the reason it's there at all.
It is not enough to just get rid of race-based preferences, we must create opportunities for minorities and all of society through pro-growth tax policies.
<br>A negative message of "anti-affirmative" action will get the Republican party
nowhere unless it is backed up with a positive message of hope and opportunities
created."<br><b>Charles, Washington DC</b><P>

"Racial tensions are very real and
the rights of minorities do need to be protected.  Perhaps the affirmative action programs of the past three decades have been helpful in at least weakening
 barriers that existed, especially in the better-paying professions.  We now
e a generation of senior managers, many of whom really believe that they have an
 obligation to ensure that women and minorities are given opportunities for advancement.  <br>Though these programs may have been necessary to help overcome the
barriers of tradition and expectation, they have had incidious effects as we have seen  minorities of mediocre talent promoted to levels of high responsibility.  These unmerited promotions are damaging to the esteem of our institutions
and are as debilitating to those of little merit who are promoted as they are those of great merit who are passed over.  We need to move as quickly as possile
to a color- and sex-blind system of merit.
<br><b>Judy, Vienna, VA</b>

<P>
I believe neither the Republicans nor the Democrats
are serious about ensuring fairness in hiring practices (note the Democrat-controlled Congress's long-standing
policy of exempting themselves from all the affirmative
action laws they have passed over the last 25 years as
well as the Republicans missing the opportunities they
have had over the years to demonstrate any understanding
of racial inequity).<br>
I will hold both parties responsible for the lack of pro-
gress this year and with any increase in racial tensions
or inequity in treatment of all people of any race. <br><b>John, South Charleston</b><P>
 
"I coach the Debate Team at Transylvania University, a member
 of the National Educational Debate Association, and our resolution this semester deals with Affirmative Action. From the massive amount of research my team
has done it is very clear
that Affirmative Action is a joke.  It promotes a very small group of minorities,
 while failing to address the real needs of the very people it is suppossed
help.<br>
It is typical of governmental attempts at solving problems.  It simply does not
work."<br><b>James, Lexington, KY</b><P>


"I hope the March accomplishes its stated goal of helping men
return to their families as better individuals and citizens. <br>I hope that all men who heard about the march take this as a wake up call to them. Too many people in this country are waiting for someone else to fix their problems. I wish that politicians from both parties would realize that they are simply tearing this country further apart by their constant pettiness. Instead of trying to shift the blame from one party to another, they should understand that they are a group.
That is why congress was composed. <BR>
Whether they are Republican or Democrat or Independent, they should be responsible. In a crime, there is an idea of accomplice. In politics, there is no such idea, only men trying to appear to be perfect.
Sorryy to be so winded, I am really getting sick of hearing both sides blame each
er. It makes it difficult to believe anybody.<br><b>Mark, Scottsdale, AZ</b><P> 


Affirmative Action has never affirmed anyone's worth in
 society.  The proof is that achievement of any sort by any of the eligible classes holds no validity, even in their own eyes.  The presence of the possibility that decisions are made based on such superficial standards promotes envy, malice and distrust.<Br>
The MMM, and their threat of lawsuit about the count released by the park service only illustrates the difference between races.  A difference that all the social programs in the world cannot hide.  Although blacks and hispanics now openly
exercise their right to speak about segregation (and territorial control),
only a limited license is granted to whites, and those who try to practice segregation have the fate of Randy Weaver to consider.<br><b>Patty, Chantilly, VA</b><p>

Affirmative action programs were good when they started.
<BR>
Martin Luther King woke americans up to prejudice and the
need for real equality in america. The congress then passed
laws and they were almost immediately grafted and corrupted
The Bumper sticker which says " Crime wouldn't pay if the
Government ran it" is true. We need government to set 
guidelines and make laws, but it is people who must learn
to do right and be just.<BR>
 For Black people to support Farakan
is to turn their backs on the principles that Martin Luther
King fought for. We white Americans need to do the right
thing because it is right not because some muslim demands it.
Islam is in direct opposition to what this country stands for.
Liberals scream separation of church and state and then
rush to support a cult that will divide us and tear down the
advancements we have made. I say we should look to the
real Black leaders, such as Dexter Scott King, and seek to
encourage them and stand firm with Martin Luther Kings'
principle of a truely integrated america.<br><b>Michael, West Palm Beach, FL</b><P>

<H2>TERRORISMO FISCAL CONTRA PRENSA MEXICANA</H2>
Erick Guerrero R.*<br>
<p>
CIUDAD DE MEXICO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--
El PRI, partido en el poder en Mxico desde hace
67 aos, est incrementando la represin sobre la sociedad para no perder el
control en las elecciones federales de 1997 y una de las armas que utiliza
son los fiscales del impuesto sobre la renta.
<P>
El prximo ao estarn en juego diputaciones, senaduras y gobernaciones en
diversas provincias. Existe el riesgo de que por primera vez en la historia
Mxico tenga un Congreso de oposicin, en manos del PAN, partido
conservador, lo que implicara cierto control sobre el ejercicio del poder
presidencial, hasta ahora casi absoluto. Muchos analistas polticos dan como
un hecho que la poblacin, descontenta por la crisis, ejercer el "voto de
castigo" contra el PRI.
<P>
Mientras tanto, el ministerio de Hacienda afirma que la evasin alcanza
niveles histricos y que este ao slo lograr recaudar en el impuesto al
consumo (IVA) $7.000 millones, comparado con $9.200 del ao pasado. Se trata
de una reduccin de 24%, motivada por el desempleo, las quiebras
empresariales y el deterioro del poder adquisitivo. El gobierno tendr, por
primera vez en siete aos, un dficit en el presupuesto para el prximo ao.
<P>
El PRI necesita dinero para cubrir el dficit fiscal y para ganar las
elecciones, a la vez que busca maneras de reprimir las crticas de sus
opositores. Por ello se comienzan a aplicar las viejas tcticas contra los
medios de comunicacin, para que estos no alienten el descontento popular y
deterioren la imagen del partido de cara a las elecciones. En el pasado se
les cortaba el suministro de papel a los peridicos crticos; ahora se
utiliza el terrorismo fiscal.
<P>
El lema de los terroristas en Europa es "mata a uno y atemorizars a diez
millones". El lema del Fisco en Mxico parece ser "encarcela a uno y
atemorizars a los otros". El ministerio de Hacienda ha desatado una campaa
de persecucin en contra de lderes empresariales, triplicando los
procedimientos por evasin.  El ms reciente alcanz a Juan Francisco Ealy
Ortiz, presidente y director de El Universal, el diario ms viejo de la
capital, de amplia circulacin nacional y que se ha distinguido
recientemente por mantener una lnea editorial crtica del gobierno de
Ernesto Zedillo.
<P>
Las autoridades acusan a Ealy Ortiz de evasin dolosa por $5,5 millones, de
presentar datos falsos, pagos no efectuados, declaracin de ingresos menor a
la real y cuentas bancarias que no "engranaban" en su contabilidad.
<P>
"Al seor Ealy no se le persigue por lo que dice ni por lo que escribe. Se
le persigue por lo que nos debe. No se le persigue como periodista. Se le
persigue como empresario evasor", afirma Toms Ruiz, subsecretario de
ingresos de Hacienda. Los enemigos de Ealy Ortiz aseguran que siempre fue
adulador de presidentes y beneficiario de gobiernos anteriores. Sin embargo,
para amplios sectores de la opinin pblica, se trata de un acto
autoritario, llevado a cabo con el propsito de sofocar las crticas.
<P>
Los dirigentes empresariales ms importantes del pas condenaron la orden
de aprehensin girada en contra del director de El Universal y protestaron
que fuese tratado como delincuente. El intento de captura se realiz con
lujo de prepotencia, por medio centenar de agentes judiciales que se
presentaron con armas de alto poder. "Ni siquiera en contra de
narcotraficantes despliegan esa fuerza... los contribuyentes son tratados
por el fisco peor que narcotraficantes...", coment un analista. Hacienda
dio amplia difusin y publicidad al asunto, como para que sirviera de
escarmiento general.
<P>
Los abogados defensores afirman que el gobierno ignor olmpicamente un
acuerdo de reestructuracin de adeudos fiscales que Ealy Ortiz haba firmado
meses atrs con el Fisco, lo que demostrara la arbitrariedad de los
funcionarios.
<P>
El presidente Zedillo, en su segundo informe de gobierno del 1 de
septiembre, dijo que sera aplicada "toda la fuerza del Estado" en contra de
los grupos guerrilleros. Pero lo que nunca se imaginaron los ciudadanos es
que "la fuerza del Estado" tambin sera aplicada en contra del sector
productivo. Y mucho menos que empresarios y periodistas seran tratados como
criminales y delincuentes. La pregunta en todas las mentes es quin ser el
prximo?

<h2>
VENEZUELA: CRONICA DE DOS AJUSTES
</h2>
Carlos Sabino*
<p>
CARACAS <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Los llamados "paquetes de ajuste" en Venezuela tienden a
parecerse mucho, como dos gotas de agua. Ello ocurre por motivos bastante
definidos. Los dos programas de ajuste econmico -el que comenz Carlos
Andrs Prez en febrero de 1989 y tuvo que detener tres aos despus, y el
que se inici hace un mes bajo la presidencia de Rafael Caldera- se han
encaminado a resolver problemas fiscales y cambiarios apremiantes, que ya no
admitan dilacin. Prez se encontr con un rgimen cambiario controlado que
generaba una disparidad enorme entre el precio del dlar oficial y el que se
transaba libremente, en tanto que Caldera volvi a imponer el control de
cambios para darse cuenta, ao y medio despus, que le resultaba imposible
sostenerlo; tanto en 1989 como en 1996 las arcas fiscales estaban
prcticamente agotadas y no haba recursos para cumplir con los compromisos
ms inmediatos del estado. En ambas ocasiones se han presentado amplios
"programas sociales" que, bien mirados, no son sino simples transferencias
indiscriminadas de dinero para reducir los costos polticos de quienes toman
las medidas.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
No extraar por ello que ambos liberaran el mercado cambiario y que se
hayan levantado algunos subsidios que resultaba imposible mantener, como el
de la gasolina, por ejemplo. No hay en esto ninguna propuesta ideolgica de
fondo, ningn modelo de sociedad que se trate de desarrollar. Cuando las
cuentas no salen es preciso reducir los gastos, aumentar los ingresos o
combinar de alguna manera ambas cosas. Se trata de una vieja receta conocida
desde el tiempo de los fenicios.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Este tipo de ajustes, importantes y necesarios como puedan ser, no bastan
sin embargo para definir una poltica econmica de largo plazo, pues se
dirigen simplemente a resolver el problema coyuntural. Detrs de ste,
escondidas a la vista del observador superficial, se encuentran las
verdaderas causas que llevan a los pases a situaciones de "desajuste" que
luego se hace imperioso remediar.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
En Venezuela, estas causas tienen directa relacin con el papel asfixiante
que tiene el estado frente a la sociedad civil. Este no slo posee el
petrleo y otras industrias fundamentales (acero, aluminio, electricidad,
etc.), as como una buena proporcin de todos los terrenos existentes, sino
que emplea al 20% de la poblacin activa total, regula y controla toda
actividad imaginable y se caracteriza por una ineficiencia descomunal.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Modificar esta maquinaria poderosa, pero incapaz de una accin efectiva, es
la tarea central que tiene la sociedad venezolana. No se trata entonces de
aumentar los impuestos, pues si bien con ello se mejoran las cuentas
fiscales se siguen ahogando y contrayendo las actividades productivas, ni de
vender algunas empresas pblicas que estn quebradas o dan prdidas. Se
trata de emprender un verdadero cambio estructural, de privatizar todo
aquello que puede ser gestionado eficientemente por los particulares, de
modificar la arbitraria legislacin que tenemos, de reducir drsticamente el
tamao de la burocracia pblica.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Si esto no se realiza volveremos, en poco tiempo, a una situacin parecida
a la que tenamos hace un mes: el estado gastar los nuevos recursos que
reciba, volver a endeudarse y sus cuentas, finalmente, se desequilibrarn
otra vez. De nuevo habr que emprender un ajuste, devaluar, subir los
precios de los servicios pblicos y aumentar los impuestos, empobreciendo
an ms a la sufrida sociedad venezolana.
	<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Venezuela, otra vez, como hace siete aos, est soportando la inflacin y

no sirvi en la ocasin anterior, si no se avanza una modificacin
estructural de la economa del pas. <p>&copy;

<H2>GASTO SOCIAL O DERROCHE FISCAL?</H2>
Luis Pazos*<br>
<p>
CUIDAD DE MEXICO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--
Una crtica frecuente de los partidos de izquierda
al gobierno es el insuficiente nivel de gasto social. Constantemente se
exige el aument del gasto pblico en obras sociales. 
<P>
El presidente Ernesto Zedillo, en referencia a la importancia del gasto
social en su administracin, seal en su segundo informe anual que "de cada
cien pesos que el gobierno programa gastar, ms de la mitad, 54 pesos, se
destinan a mejorar las condiciones de vida de las personas, las familias y
las comunidades". Ese porcentaje, ms de la mitad del gasto total del
estado, es similar a lo que tericamente ha sido destinado por casi todos
los gobiernos mexicanos en los ltimos 25 aos a lo que llaman gasto social.
Las condiciones de vida de las personas, las familias y las comunidades,
tericamente destinatarias de ese gasto social, lejos de mejorar en el
ltimo cuarto de siglo han empeorado su situacin. Aritmticamente podemos
concluir que los 54 pesos de cada cien de gasto social han sido casi en su
totalidad derrochados y desperdiciados.
<P>
Sobre el nmero de familias beneficiadas por los subsidios, el presidente
seal en su ltimo informe: "A travs del sistema de abasto popular se
atiende a cerca de 30 millones de personas, principalmente del medio rural.
Se apoya a 2,8 millones de familias de bajos ingresos para el consumo de
tortilla y a 5,2 millones de nios para el de leche". El abasto popular que,
segn dijo el presidente atiende a 30 millones de personas, se instrumenta
principalmente a travs de la Confederacin Nacional de Subsistencias
Populares (CONASUPO). Es un hecho conocido por el pblico que ese organismo,
representativo del gasto social, ha sido una de las principales fuentes de
enriquecimiento de la alta burocracia. Gran parte de lo subsidios al maz y
a la leche han ido a parar realmente a cuentas en el extranjero de
familiares de funcionarios, no slo bajo Salinas de Gortari, sino desde que
fue creada esa empresa estatal. 
<P>
Una cosa es ayudar a los ms pobres y otra sostener que esa ayuda se d a
travs de la burocracia gubernamental que, como lo demuestra la experiencia
en todo el mundo, en poco beneficia a los marginados. La solucin no es
cambiar los directivos de los organismos estatales de asistencia social cada
seis aos ni encarcelar a aquellos que circunstancialmente se les descubren
manejos fraudulentos, sino buscar nuevas formas para que los recursos ahora
destinados al gasto social no se queden en el camino, principalmente en
manos de quienes los administran.
<P>
Si el gobierno dejara de gastar los 54 pesos por cada 100 pesos que destina
al llamado gasto social, que a la fecha en muy poco ha beneficiado a los
mexicanos pobres y recorta, a la vez, en 54% sus gastos, podra reducir, sin
crear un dficit, tanto el tope del impuesto sobre la renta a la mitad (a
17%),  como el IVA tambin a la mitad (a 7,5% ) y rebajar al mismo tiempo el
impuesto de la gasolina tambin en 50%. Esos cambios provocaran tal
actividad y bienestar econmico, que los tericos destinatarios del gasto
social encontraran de inmediato oportunidades de elevar su nivel de vida. 
Por qu es difcil instrumentar tan favorables cambios?  Porque cientos de
miles de burcratas han sido por mucho tiempo los verdaderos beneficiarios
de gran parte del llamado gasto social y se oponen a perder sus prebendas.
La mayor parte del gasto social se queda en sueldos, prestaciones,
desviaciones, negocios y gastos de operacin de la burocracia encargada de
manejarlo. Y aun lo poco que llega a los pobres es distribuido con criterio
de clientelismo poltico ms que de acuerdo a verdaderas necesidades
econmicas. 
<P>
Existe una clara contradiccin entre quienes por un lado sealan la
inoperancia y corrupcin del gasto social, pero al mismo tiempo exigen que
el gobierno incremente ese mismo gasto social.

<H2>LA VIENA DE MISES Y HAYEK</H2>
Carlos A. Ball*<br>
<p>
VIENA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--  Mi anterior viaje a Viena fue en 1968, cuando los venezolanos
viajbamos con una moneda dura por todo el mundo. Entonces me hosped en el
Hotel Imperial, quiz el ms bello de todos los hoteles clsicos europeos,
donde uno abre los ojos por la maana admirando increbles frescos en el
techo de la habitacin y se tira de un cordn detrs de la cama para que a
los pocos segundos aparezca un mesonero de levita preguntando qu apetece
para el desayuno.
<P>
 Los rusos ocuparon a Austria hasta 1955, pero esta capital del viejo
imperio no ha logrado despertar de un largo letargo socialista que sigue
predominando junto al fro y hmedo otoo. Se trata de un socialismo menos
ineficiente que los del Caribe: el tranva que tomo cada maana para asistir
a las conferencias de la Sociedad Mont Plerin (fundada por Hayek hace 49
aos) funciona con limpieza y precisin alemana, y jams me han pedido el
boleto porque las autoridades asumen que lo compr. Me imagino que el pasaje
est altamente subsidiado porque con 20 chelines austracos -unos dos
dlares americanos- puedo hacer todos los viajes que quiera durante un da.
Por el contrario, tomarse un caf o comerse una deliciosa torta de chocolate
es una inversin que amerita cierta reflexin previa. Adems, cualquier cosa
que uno coma lleva un impuesto de 10% y lo que se bebe 20%.
<P> 
Los economistas que miden el nivel de vida de los pueblos le asignan los
primeros puestos al Japn, Suiza y Alemania sin tomar en cuenta los precios.
El japons de clase media vive en un apartamento poco ms grande que el
clset de un hogar americano y la ama de casa alemana tiene que comprar
alimentos todos los das porque su nevera es ms o menos del tamao del
televisor que ocupa un lugar de honor en el "family room" estadounidense.
 Mi impresin de Viena se repite: una gran capital sin mucho pas para
sostenerla; edificaciones ms fastuosas que las de Pars o Londres, pero
donde predomina una triste nostalgia por el irrepetible esplendor de fines
del siglo XIX, algo no padecido con la misma intensidad en otras capitales
de viejos imperios. Me qued en casa de un pariente noble de amigos
argentinos, el palacio del prncipe Kinsky, una impresionante mansin
barroca del siglo XVIII en el centro de la ciudad, lo cual por unos das me
ha permitido asomarme a esa esplendorosa poca que termin con el retumbar
de los caones, en agosto de 1914.
<P>
 Con Carl Menger naci en Viena, en 1871, la economa moderna o neoclsica.
Fue el fundador de la escuela austraca, seguido por su brillante discpulo
Eugen von Bhm-Bawerk en la ctedra de economa de la Universidad de Viena.
El rostro de Bhm-Bawerk ilustra hoy los billetes de cien chelines. Estos
economistas austracos centraron sus investigaciones en las motivaciones del
individuo y en la forma cmo este acta en reaccin a sus propias
motivaciones, preferencias y valoraciones. Esas preferencias del consumidor
a su vez impulsan y ordenan la actividad productora de bienes y servicios,
conduciendo a los inversionistas hacia la ptima utilizacin de los
recursos. Tambin concluyeron que gastos en mano de obra y materiales no
confieren valor a los productos y servicios, sino que su valor procede
exclusivamente de las apreciaciones del consumidor. 
<P>
Estos economistas vieneses se dieron cuenta que cuanto mayor es la cantidad
de un producto menor es el valor que se le atribuye a cada unidad. Por ello
el agua y el pan son baratos, mientras que el oro y los brillantes son caros. 
 Ludwig von Mises ingres al seminario de Bhm-Bawerk en el ao 1900 y luego
procedi a avanzar la teora econmica indicando que el "precio" del dinero
(su poder adquisitivo) es determinado por el mercado en la misma forma que
se determina el precio de cualquier otro bien, en funcin de la cantidad
disponible. La gente gasta rpidamente cualquier moneda que pierde su valor
y ahorra en otra moneda que lo mantiene.
<P> 
Una estupenda ancdota de Mises se refiere a la consulta que le hicieron
durante la violenta inflacin que sobrevino en Austria luego de la Primera
Guerra. Cuando le preguntaron cmo remediarla, Mises insisti que se
encontraran con l a la medianoche en una calle de Viena. A esa hora y
rodeado de altos funcionarios dijo: "oyen ese ruido?... es la imprenta del
Banco Central imprimiendo billetes... prenla".
<P> 
No conoc a Mises, pero s a su alumno Friedrich A. von Hayek y en esta
visita a Viena convers con su hijo Laurence y su nuera Esca. No voy a
tratar de describir la obra de Hayek en un prrafo pero si algo lo defini
fue su fiel creencia en el poder de las ideas, lo cual caracteriza al
liberalismo mismo. Hayek mantena que lo que est conscientemente presente
en la mente de un hombre es apenas una diminuta parte de las ideas en que
basa su manera de pensar, de lo cual surge lo que llam "el orden
espontneo" que es la consecuencia imprevista del accionar independiente de
millones de individuos. En sus propias palabras: "sera un error  creer que
para alcanzar un grado ms alto de civilizacin tenemos simplemente que
instrumentar las ideas que ahora nos guan. Si vamos a avanzar, tenemos que
dejar espacio a una continua revisin de nuestros actuales conceptos e
ideales".
<P> 
Los palacios, museos, monumentos y estatuas de Viena nos recuerdan las
batallas y glorias del pasado, pero son Mises y Hayek quienes representan la
victoria de las ideas liberales en nuestro siglo, triunfantes frente al
cruel socialismo estatista y la empobrecedora planificacin central. Para mi
son ellos el ms grandioso legado de Viena. &copy;

<h2>
CAUSA COMUN DE LIBERALES Y CATOLICOS
</h2>

Manuel Ayau*

<P>
CIUDAD DE GUATEMALA  <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Las antiguas diferencias existentes entre la
Iglesia Catlica y los liberales en Amrica Latina siguen teniendo
resultados desastrosos. Hay alguna esperanza de reconciliacin? Pienso que s.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Cuando a los 13 aos ingres a un colegio catlico interno en California,
me impresion la notable diferencia de los catlicos en Norteamrica. Quizs
el hecho que en el Nuevo Mundo hispnico el catolicismo gozaba de una
posicin predominante con respecto a otras religiones explicaba esa posicin
altanera y arrogante que no era el caso en Estados Unidos, donde al tratarse
de una minora era ms abierta y tolerante. Esa mayor tolerancia de los
catlicos anglosajones abarcaba tambin una filosofa econmica y poltica
ms liberal.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Lamentablemente, la Iglesia Catlica en Amrica Latina hered de Espaa un
prejuicio antiliberal y su antagonismo hacia el sistema capitalista, aunque
hay que aclarar que no hubo tal antagonismo contra los capitalistas mientras
estos formaban parte del sistema mercantilista, en el que la misma Iglesia
Catlica jugaba un papel protagnico.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	El mundo anglosajn tom el camino capitalista, alejndose del
mercantilismo criticado en lo moral y en lo econmico por Adam Smith,
provocando mejoras sin precedentes en las condiciones de la humanidad. Los
catlicos anglosajones se beneficiaron del liberalismo econmico y de la
Revolucin Industrial, mientras que en Estados Unidos el federalismo -que
significa la descentralizacin del poder y el libre comercio entre los
estados- represent la creacin del ms grande y duradero mercado comn de
la historia moderna. Es difcil ser anticapitalista con una experiencia tan
exitosa, aunque algunos sigan tratando. En el mundo anglosajn el trmino
liberal se asociaba con virtud y compasin, por lo que el apelativo fue
raptado por los defensores del colectivismo, del paternalismo y de la
sociedad irresponsable. Por el contrario, en el mundo hispano la palabra
liberal sonaba impa, anticlerical y mezquina.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	A pesar de los esfuerzos del Papa Juan Pablo II, la alta jerarqua de la
Iglesia en Amrica Latina no ha hecho un esfuerzo sincero en comprender la
esencia de la controversia ni en dejar atrs las actitudes del pasado. Sus
acciones indican no estar interesados en un anlisis intelectual riguroso y
honesto, por lo que sigue prevaleciendo su condena generalizada contra todo
lo que suena a liberal o neoliberal. Hay excepciones, pero estas son ms
raras a medida que se sube en la jerarqua de la Iglesia, lo cual tiende a
alejar de ella a los catlicos liberales.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Como la mayora de la poblacin latinoamericana sigue hundida en la
pobreza, los sacerdotes deberan estudiar economa, comenzando con la
Escuela de Salamanca, para que sepan diferenciar entre el mercantilismo y el
capitalismo que ellos llaman, con desprecio, "neoliberalismo".
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Tan feliz como soy con la prosperidad creada por las privatizaciones y por
economas ms abiertas, me decepciona que la actual transicin hacia el
capitalismo es ms bien pragmtica, desposeda de principios ticos. La
palabra clave suele ser "eficiencia". Privatizar y desmonopolizar para
obtener mejor gerencia e ingresos fiscales, no como un acto de respeto hacia
los derechos de la gente de adquirir y vender su propiedad y de ejercer la
libertad de servir a los dems con su trabajo e ingenio. Abrir las fronteras
para hacer la economa ms eficiente, no en reconocimiento del derecho de
los ciudadanos a intercambiar lo que es suyo, sin tener que ver con dnde
viven los compradores o vendedores. Evitar la inflacin porque es
econmicamente ineficiente y no porque se trata de una prctica deshonesta
de los gobernantes. Llego a pensar que si el socialismo hubiera resultado
econmicamente eficiente todava seguira siendo respetable.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Lo que todava muchos ignoran es que el mercado, como bien lo dijo Hayek,
se fundamenta en un sistema de reglas generales de justa conducta para
proteger los derechos individuales y el cumplimiento de contratos. Esa
generalizada desconfianza en el mercado se manifiesta en los intentos de
"regularlo", como si ya no estuviese regulado por reglas abstractas que
protegen la vida, la libertad y la propiedad. La bsqueda de un objetivo
comn es el camino a la reconciliacin entre catlicos liberales y
antiliberales. Todos aspiramos a una sociedad ms virtuosa, caritativa y
responsable, a una sociedad moral y antimercantilista.&copy; <p>

<TITLE>Becker: Hay que Imponer Limites al Gasto Gubernamental -- 8/7/96
</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY bgcolor="#ffffff" background="/townhall/background.jpg">
<blockquote><blockquote>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>August 7, 1996</i><br>
<H2>HAY QUE IMPONER LIMITES AL GASTO GUBERNAMENTAL</H2>
Gary S. Becker*<p>
CHICAGO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- No es ningn secreto que el sistema impositivo de Estados
Unidos es complejo y acosado por altas tasas. El nivel actual de los
impuestos reduce el crecimiento  y la eficiencia econmica al desviar
recursos productivos hacia esfuerzos por evitarlos y evadirlos. Por lo tanto
un sistema ms simple y ms parejo hara una gran diferencia. Pero para ser
efectiva, una reforma de los impuestos tendra que estar acompaada de
medidas que desalienten el crecimiento del gasto gubernamental.
<dd>	
Cuando se calculan los resultados de una simplificacin de los impuestos y
de reducir las tasas, a menudo se asume que el gasto gubernamental es
independiente del sistema impositivo. Recientemente, cuando el Wall Street
Journal pregunt a 12 economistas lo que pensaban de la tasa nica de
impuestos, todos la apoyaron, pero apenas unos pocos mencionamos el efecto
que tendra en los gastos gubernamentales.
<dd>	
El proceso poltico de las democracias virtualmente garantiza que el gasto
gubernamental dependa de la estructura impositiva. La mayora de los grupos
de presin tienen deseos insaciables de favores gubernamentales. El nico
freno a sus pretensiones es la resistencia de los contribuyentes. Si se
debilita esa resistencia a travs de una reforma impositiva que reduce el
costo de cumplimiento y los efectos perniciosos contra el ahorro y el
esfuerzo personal, el gasto gubernamental tender a aumentar. Mayores gastos
gubernamentales causarn ms dao que el beneficio obtenido por la reforma
impositiva.
<dd>	
El argumento que la resistencia contra impuestos ms altos es mayor cuando
la carga es ms pesada y ms transparente se comprueba por el hecho de que
los dueos de propiedades han sido los lderes de rebeliones antiimpuestos
en varios estados. Los impuestos a la propiedad  son onerosos porque son
altos y visibles. Robert Hall y Alvin Rabushka del Hoover Institution han
demostrado que las familias podran hacer su declaracin de impuestos en una
postal si el sistema actual fuese reemplazado por una tasa nica de 20%,
eximiendo del pago a los de bajos ingresos. Pero no toman en cuenta si ese
sistema ms simple y eficiente sera a la vez una tentacin para que el
Congreso y el presidente aumenten la tasa, a travs del tiempo, para
financiar viejos programas e iniciar otros nuevos.
<dd>	
Mi colega de la Universidad de Chicago Casey Mulligan y yo estamos
compilando pruebas sobre que la estructura impositiva est ntimamente
ligada al gasto gubernamental. Los impuestos al valor agregado comenzaron
con tasas mdicas en los aos 60. Hoy el IVA en Europa excede 20%. El
resultado es que el IVA ha permitido una rpida expansin del gasto
gubernamental.
<dd>	
Los impuestos del Seguro Social tienen una tasa nica aplicable desde el
primer dlar de ingresos. Comenzaron siendo muy bajos en los aos 30, pero
fueron aumentando hasta hoy, cuando los aportes del patrn y del empleado
significan 15% de los sueldos. Tales impuestos han sobrepasado 25% en muchos
pases europeos. Impuestos de tasa nica del Seguro Social han sido una
manera cmo los gobiernos han recabado inmensas cantidades de dinero. En
Estados Unidos proveen casi la misma cantidad que el impuesto sobre la renta
individual.
<dd>	
La estrecha relacin entre la estructura impositiva y los gastos
gubernamentales indica que la simplificacin tiene que ser combinada con un
mayor control del gasto pblico. Un presupuesto equilibrado puede ser un
paso en la direccin correcta, siempre y cuando el equilibrio se alcance
bajando gastos y no subiendo impuestos.
<dd>	
Ultimamente el gasto gubernamental en Estados Unidos ha sido frenado por la
recaudacin. Tanto el presidente Clinton como los miembros de ambos partidos
en el Congreso hubieran propuesto aumentos considerables a los gastos en
salud y en otros programas si el electorado no los hubiera obligado a
preocuparse del dficit. El gasto pblico de muchas naciones europeas fuera
mayor si no tuviesen que mantener su dficit presupuestario por debajo de 3%
del PIB para ser admitidos en la unin monetaria planeada para fin del siglo.
<dd>	
Pero hay que encontrar otras maneras de limitar gastos, especialmente si se
introduce la tasa nica. Se podra establecer un tope del gasto federal en
funcin del PIB, con la excepcin en tiempo de guerra u otra emergencia
nacional. O fijar como lmite el actual nivel en funcin del PIB, a menos
que una supermayora en el Congreso, de 60% o ms, vote por una proporcin
mayor.
<dd>	
A menos que se combine con mejores controles del gasto gubernamental, los
grandes beneficios de una tasa nica o de sistemas simplificados se
desperdiciaran en expansiones manirrotas, subsidiando industrias, la
agricultura, la beneficencia pblica y dems programas polticamente
atractivos. <p>

<h2>
MANUAL DE IDIOTAS
</h2>

Enrique Ghersi*
<p>

LIMA <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- Todo empez en el bar del hotel don Pancho de Benidorm, en el
sur de Espaa. Las Primeras Jornadas Liberales Iberoamericanas organizadas
en Espaa por el peruano Fernando Iwasaki haban convocado a un grupo de
intelectuales para discutir sobre la situacin de la libertad en el mundo.
Al final de los debates, cuando un grupo liderado por Plinio Apuleyo
Mendoza, Carlos Alberto Montaner y Alvaro Vargas Llosa miraba la televisin,
el noticiero dio cuenta de que el futbolista argentino Diego Maradona, de
visita en Cuba, se haba proclamado admirador y partidario acrrimo de Fidel
Castro.
<dd>	Apenas se inform de ello, Plinio estall en furia. Carlos Alberto calcul,
casi de inmediato, los millones de dlares que Maradona poda haberse
embolsado con este golpe de efecto. Y Alvaro, ms agresivo an, sostuvo la
necesidad de despegar de inmediato una campaa internacional dirigida a
denunciar los excesos de la intelligentsia latinoamericana, en el supuesto
asaz dudoso de que el futbolista la integrase.
<dd>	La primera vez que o la frase fue cuando, hastiado ya por la indignacin,
Montaner sostuvo que el futbolista era el prototipo del "idiota
latinoamericano". Esa especie de bpedo impune capaz de sostener sin el
menor reparo la verdad de perogrullo o trivialidad de moda, a cambio de
aparentar ser una persona informada y seria.
<dd>	Hoy los tres escritores nos ofrecen una versin, polmica y apasionada de
este problema con su "Manual del Perfecto Idiota Latinoamericano" que,
publicado por Plaza & Janes, acaba de ser presentado en diferentes capitales
del continente por una gira trashumante de los autores.
<dd>	La intelectualidad latinoamericana ha estado influenciada por los
arquetipos. Renunciando a su creatividad y no queriendo ver sus indudables
aportes, el tpico intelectual de nuestro continente es aquel que se conduce
por la moda europea, al abrigo del temperamento norteamericano y con la
reminiscencia tnica suficiente. Este personaje recorre nuestra historia sin
el menor inters por la realidad. Slo se fija en el prejuicio, generalmente
el suyo propio, sentenciando a cada rato una media verdad en torno de la
cual construye un conjunto de falsas proposiciones.
<dd>	Domina la sociologa. Sabe antropologa y economa. Escribe versos y es
oportunista. Nuestro idiota es un personaje admirado y temido. Su opinin
predomina en los crculos acadmicos, resulta apreciada en los polticos y
remunerada en los empresariales. Todo perfectamente contradictorio con su
presumida modestia. Hace ya tiempo que se necesitaba un detenido estudio de
tan notable fenmeno.
<dd>	El "Manual" es un libro de combate, llamado a crear polmica y a refutar
-con sarcasmo y aguda crtica- los lugares comunes y las verdades de
perogrullo ms usuales de la intelectualidad latinoamericana.
<dd>	Primero cataloga errores. Luego los formaliza, exponindolos suscintamente
a fin de refutarlos a continuacin. Posteriormente derriba mitos sin dejar
ttere con cabeza, incluidos Gustavo Gutirrez, Eduardo Galleano y Jos
Carlos Maritegui. Finalmente, con gran irona, presenta los diez libros ms
ledos por el "idiota" y una impresionante galera de medias verdades, por
la que desfilan frases de lo ms graneado de nuestras elites, incluidos
Mario Vargas Llosa y los tres mismos autores.
<dd>	En sntesis, se trata de un libro polmico fundamental para el liberalismo
finisecular en Iberoamrica que rescata, de la clsica idea del panfleto, la
indignacin y la irona como argumentos retricos de la libertad.&copy

<title>QUE VA A PASAR EN BRASIL? -- 11/14/96</title>

<h2>QUE VA A PASAR EN BRASIL?
</h2>
Mark Falcoff*<br>
<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- En octubre los brasileos votarn por alcaldes y
miembros de los concejos municipales, siendo estas elecciones la primera
prueba confrontada por Fernando Henrique Cardoso desde que fue electo
presidente hace dos aos. Tambin ser una indicacin de apoyo o rechazo a
su anunciado programa de liberalizacin y reforma econmica.
<P>
Dos hechos ayudan a comprender mejor al Brasil. Uno es su parecido con
Estados Unidos respecto al tamao, autonoma propia, concentracin en sus
asuntos internos, con culturas e idiomas diferentes al resto de Amrica. En
ninguna otra nacin latinoamericana se oye a la gente hablar acerca de su
pas como un gran poder del futuro. Lo mismo que los estadounidenses, los
brasileos tienen que buscar la manera de reinventar su gobierno.
<p>
A pesar de mltiples problemas, las estadsticas brasileas son
impresionantes, comenzando con que es la novena economa ms grande del
mundo. Su comercio internacional alcanz casi $80.000 millones en 1995,
colocndolo en el lugar N 23. Sus recursos naturales son imn de
inversiones extranjeras.
<p>
El tipo de centrismo poltico representado por Cardoso (culturalmente de
izquierda, pero econmicamente ligeramente a la derecha del centro) se
parece algo a la posicin del presidente Clinton. No es de extraar,
entonces, que hayan hecho buena amistad, lo mismo que sus esposas, quienes
son activistas polticas.
<p>
Cardoso a la fecha ha tenido un xito modesto. Su credibilidad poltica se
seguir basando en el xito del Plan Real que en efecto liga la moneda
brasilea al dlar. Tambin logr la promulgacin de la mejor ley protectora
de la propiedad intelectual en la regin. Pero las reformas cruciales a los
impuestos, a la asistencia y seguro social siguen esperando laaprobacin del
Congreso.
<p>
A lo contrario del resto del hemisferio, el presidente brasileo es
relativamente dbil frente a un Congreso extraordinariamente poderoso. Y los
legisladores reflejan fielmente la extrema diversidad de ese inmenso pas,
por lo que en ausencia de un partido poderoso y disciplinado es muy difcil
alcanzar el consenso. Adems, la nueva Constitucin es un documento difcil
que imposibilita la efectividad gubernamental. Qu otra Constitucin
reglamenta el tiempo del descanso para tomar caf en las industrias? Al
supervisar todo aspecto de la vida econmica y social de la nacin, requiere
enmiendas constitucionales para cualquier cambio significativo. Hasta que se
logren algunas alteraciones es imposible permitir la participacin privada y
extranjera en petrleo, minera, electricidad y telecomunicaciones.
<p>
Los mismos obstculos se aplican a la eficiencia de los servicios pblicos
y a la privatizacin del Seguro Social. Pero sin esas reformas corre peligro
el Plan Real y un retorno a la hiperinflacin liquidara lo que queda del
poder poltico de Cardoso, a la vez que tendra catastrficos efectos tanto
para el Brasil como para sus vecinos.
<p>
La salud econmica del Brasil en gran medida determina el bienestar, no
slo de pases pequeos como Uruguay y Paraguay, sino tambin el de naciones
medianas como Argentina, Colombia y Per. Slo Venezuela, con sus masivas
reservas petroleras, sobrevivira el colapso de Brasil.
<p>
La importancia econmica de Brasil se manifiesta en el xito de Mercosur,
una rea de libre comercio que ya se extiende a Argentina, Paraguay y
Uruguay. Desde el colapso del peso mexicano y la paralizacin del TLC/NAFTA
hasta Chile ha aplicado para ingresar a Mercosur.
<p>
Pero las instituciones polticas brasileas se mantienen curiosamente
rezagadas en un pas que avanza en otros frentes. Las elecciones municipales
no son determinantes de las polticas nacionales, pero se consideran buen
termmetro del sentimiento nacional. Sin embargo, como lo indica Alexandre
Barros, los votantes que favorecen mayor desregulacin y ms privatizaciones
pueden castigar a la administracin Cardoso por su lentitud en esos campos.
Pero Barros tambin cree que los electores que quieren mayor intervencin
estatal tambin castigarn a un gobierno que perciben como neoliberal.
"Cara, yo gano", dice Barros, "sello, tu pierdes".
<p>
Es difcil evaluar las tendencias en un pas con una sociedad tan diversa y
rudimentaria. Pero a lo contrario de sus vecinos, los brasileos no optan
por soluciones extremistas. Eso le da al Brasil un aire superficial de
calma, aun cuando el crimen se dispara y la brecha entre ricos y pobres
sigue siendo inmensa.
<p>
El verdadero problema es que mientras la comunidad poltica brasilea no
est dispuesta a tomar decisiones difciles acerca de las reformas
econmicas, el pas puede perder su mnima estabilidad monetaria, de la que
depende tanto su poblacin como sus vecinos.

HAITI, EL GRAN ENGAO

Haiti, El Gran Engao*
</h2>
John Sweeney*
<br>
<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Hace dos aos regres a Hait Jean Bertrand Aristide
bajo la proteccin de 20.000 soldados estadounidenses enviados por el
presidente Clinton para restaurar la democracia en un pas que nunca la ha
experimentado. La administracin Clinton alega que su intervencin militar
en Hait ha sido uno de los mayores xitos de la poltica exterior en la
historia americana. La realidad es que no se diferencia mucho de las dems
aventuras extranjeras de Clinton: Bosnia, Irlanda del Norte, Corea del Norte
y el Medio Oriente.
<p>
Los contribuyentes estadounidenses han desembolsillado ms de $2.000
millones para financiar la intervencin en Hait y todava ninguno de los
propsitos de la "Operacin Rescate de la Democracia" ha sido alcanzado. No
se ha establecido una firme y duradera democracia. Continan los asesinatos
polticos. Siguen las presiones econmicas y polticas para que la gente
emigre a Estados Unidos. 70% de la poblacin no sabe leer y 60% est
desempleada. Escuadrones armados estn surgiendo en el interior de la isla.
<p>
La eleccin presidencial del 17 de diciembre de 1995 result ser ni justa
ni libre, segn el Centro Carter y la presidencia de Ren Preval consolida a
Aristide como gobernante absoluto, ya que Preval har el papel de ttere por
cinco aos hasta que Aristide pueda volver a ser candidato en el ao 2000.
Gracias al apoyo de Clinton, Aristide es el lder poltico ms temido y
poderoso de Hait desde tiempos de 'Pap Doc' Duvalier. Desde su regreso,
Aristide tambin se ha hecho millonario. Los tmidos intentos privatizadores
de Preval han sido bloqueados por Aristide y nada se ha adelantado en abrir
una economa que sigue estancada.
<p>
Bejamin Gilman, presidente del Comit de Relaciones Internacionales de la
Cmara de Representantes del Congreso de Estados Unidos afirma que la
administracin Clinton "sabe desde principios de 1995 que escuadrones de la
muerte operan bajo la direccin de los jefes de seguridad del presidente
Aristide". El embajador de Estados Unidos en la isla, William Swing, inform
sobre el primero de estos asesinatos en un cable al Departamento de Estado
el 18 de febrero de 1995. Luego, en septiembre de 1995, Swing inform que el
gobierno de Aristide haba obstaculizado las investigaciones del FBI de
estos mismos asesinatos polticos. Unos 24 lderes democrticos, opositores
de Aristide, fueron asesinados en 1995, mientras muchos soldados americanos
permanecan en la isla. Todos los asesinatos fueron relacionados
directamente a los jefes de seguridad del Palacio Presidencial y Aristide
rechaz las peticiones privadas del embajador Swing y del subsecretario de
Estado Strobe Talbott para que destituyera a los culpables.
<p>
Esa misma guardia palaciega, entrenada en Virginia a un costo para los
contribuyentes estadounidenses de $5,5 millones, sigue cuidando a Preval y
exterminando a la oposicin durante 1996. El 13 de septiembre de este ao,
el gobierno de Estados Unidos envi urgentemente a 46 agentes del
Departamento de Estado y del Pentgono a Puerto Prncipe al enterarse de
rumores de golpe contra Preval. Entonces fue cuando Preval destituy al jefe
de la guardia de seguridad presidencial y a su asistente, tras una reunin
secreta con Talbott, Swing y Anthony Lake, asesor de Seguridad Nacional del
presidente Clinton.
<p>
El gobierno de Clinton est engaando al Congreso y al pblico con respecto
a Hait. La complicidad de la administracin en la poltica interna haitiana
es tan sucia que el presidente Clinton se ha visto obligado a invocar
razones de estado para tapar el total fracaso de la Operacin Rescate de la
Democracia. Aristide, un cura antiamericano que ahorc los hbitos y
pblicamente daba el visto bueno a los asesinatos de sus opositores, antes
de ser tumbado en 1991, tiene a la Casa Blanca agarrada por el pescuezo.
Clinton puede mantener el mito de una frgil paz en Hait mientras Aristide
se lo permita. Hait sigue siendo un polvorn que estallar poco despus de
la retirada de las ltimas tropas de Estados Unidos y de las Naciones Unidas.

<title>Benegas: LA MAQUINA DE SUBSIDIAR -- 5/16/96</title>

<h2>
LA MAQUINA DE SUBSIDIAR
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
spanbio
.html">
Alberto Benegas-Lynch (h)*
</a>

<P>
BUENOS AIRES (AIPE).- A principios de siglo el economista y socilogo
italiano Vilfredo Pareto deca que es difcil  implantar la libertad
econmica porque "el privilegio, incluso si debe costar 100 a la masa y no
producir ms que 50 a los privilegiados, perdindose el resto en falsos
costos, ser en general bien aceptado, puesto que la masa no comprende que
est siendo despojada, mientras que los privilegiados se dan perfecta cuenta
de las ventajas de las que gozan". 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Una vez que se abren las compuertas de los subsidios se monta una mquina
que hace que se desate una competencia por los recursos escasos de lo que se
ofrece. De este modo los empresarios desvan su atencin del mercado y la
centran en quienes otorgan subsidios. Se desata as una lucha para ver quin
saca mejor partida a expensas de los dems, ya que el subsidio
necesariamente proviene de los bolsillos de otros que resultan expoliados.
Pero aqu no se trata simplemente de una suma cero, es decir, de una
transferencia coactiva de unos a otros. La competencia por obtener se desata
debido a que los recursos son limitados. Tambin son limitados los
privilegios, aunque no se trate de una transferencia directa de recursos,
puesto que si todos son privilegiados no habra privilegiados.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Esa competencia se lleva a cabo en base a ofertas de uno u otro tipo que
realizan los competidores a manos de los oferentes de privilegios. No
necesariamente debe recurrirse al cohecho directo o indirecto. Pero, en
cualquier caso, para proceder en este sentido se montan sistemas de cabildeo
para acercarse al poder, sea para convencer al burcrata de la "bondad" de
la propuesta o, debido a que no hay criterio racional para otorgar el
subsidio, para concretar una oferta monetaria a los efectos de que se
resuelva el privilegio en beneficio del postulante.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Supongamos que se trata de un subsidio de $10 millones; en este caso el
empresario estar dispuesto a invertir hasta $9 millones para lograr el
subsidio de referencia, lo cual, desde la perspectiva del resto de la
comunidad significar $19 millones derrochados. Los primeros $10 millones
significan un despilfarro debido a que todo subsidio implica que se sacan
recursos de las reas preferidas por la gente hacia las reas preferidas por
los gobernantes del momento.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	El sustento de lo que hemos bautizado como "la mquina de subsidiar"
radica en los incentivos que generan marcos institucionales debilitados y
corrompidos. En este sentido, David Friedman seala que en regmenes de este
tipo a muy pocos se les ocurre bregar por la abrogacin de cientos de leyes
para que todos se beneficien por igual de una sociedad abierta, puesto que
resulta mucho ms expedito y fructfero pelear por una nueva ley que otorga
un privilegio. Dice Friedman que el mecanismo consiste en buscar la manera
que 20 millones de  personas paguen un dlar cada una y el beneficiario se
alce con el botn de $20 millones. De este modo slo se oir la voz fuerte
de quien busca el privilegio y no se oir la de los perjudicados que
individualmente pierden poco. Incluso, si el beneficiario contrata
pseudointelectuales y pseudoperiodistas, para que justifiquen el desmn,
lograr que los expoliados lo apoyen. Solamente se oye la voz apagada entre
tanta bulla de intelectuales que quieren quebrar un sistema en el que los
incentivos operan para que se robe al prjimo en lugar de concentrarse en la
produccin sin privilegios. Estas voces resultan anmicas en medio de una
feroz puja para que los vndalos puedan enriquecerse a costa  de los dems.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Es por todo esto que se tiene la falsa impresin de que la sociedad
consiste en una batalla campal resultante de una inexorable confrontacin de
intereses. De esta visin surgen las propuestas fascistas del corporativismo
conducentes a los tristemente clebres "pactos sociales" por los que los
capitostes de cada sector deben negociar en torno a una mesa para dar la
impresin de que intereses irreconciliables se negocian en aras de una nunca
alcanzada "paz social". Esta visin no permite ver la armona de intereses
inherentes al estado de derecho y la igualdad ante la ley. Quienes comparten
esta visin no parecen capaces de entender la coordinacin libre y
voluntaria que se lleva a cabo a travs del proceso de mercado.

<h2>POLITIZACION Y CORRUPCION DE LA JUSTICIA
</h2>     
     
     
Carlos Ball*
<p>

MIAMI <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- De todas las plagas que han acosado a Amrica Latina en los
ltimos aos, la ms funesta ha sido la creciente politizacin de nuestros
sistemas judiciales, lo cual a su vez ha fomentado la corrupcin. Si la ley
no es respetable, no se acata y surge el caos.
<dd>	Es un fenmeno regional que a medida que nuestros pases se fueron
democratizando, mientras los dictadores y caudillos iban siendo desplazados
por gobiernos democrticamente electos, el nombramiento de jueces comenz a
hacerse en funcin de afiliaciones y tendencias partidistas, lo cual al
transcurrir de los aos se ha degenerado en el desprestigio de la
institucin y su exposicin a la manipulacin poltica o a la descarada
venta de fallos y sentencias al mejor postor.
<dd>	Otra influencia extraordinariamente negativa es que las ms poderosas
multinacionales que operan hoy en Amrica Latina no son ya las viejas United
Fruit y Standard Oil Company sino los carteles del narcotrfico. Y gracias a
la poltica de Washington de declarar la guerra a la fabricacin y al
transporte ms que al consumo de las drogas, el campo de batalla fue
trasladado a nuestros pases, donde el sueldo mensual de un polica o de un
juez equivale a lo que gana diariamente un vendedor al detal de drogas en
las calles de Nueva York o Los Angeles.
<dd>	Sin seguridad jurdica no puede florecer la inversin ni la creacin de
empleos. La apertura econmica en pases como Mxico, Venezuela y hasta
cierto punto Argentina, donde las privatizaciones beneficiaron
principalmente a aquellos cercanos al poder, no genera la prosperidad
general y altos niveles de empleo que rpidamente se traducen en apoyo
electoral a las reformas econmicas. Por el contrario, surgen violentas
oleadas contra el mal llamado neoliberalismo que en su versin
latinoamericana tiende slo a beneficiar a elites polticas y empresariales,
al terminar pagando el pueblo ms por los bienes y servicios de las viejas
empresas estatales ahora convertidas en monopolios privados, mientras el
producto de las privatizaciones se aplica a mantener burocracias excesivas,
a campaas electorales y a cuentas particulares de los gobernantes y sus
familiares en el extranjero.
<dd>	En Venezuela se desat una cnica persecucin poltica contra los banqueros
"prfugos" de la justicia. Entre ellos hay unos cuantos gngsters bien
conocidos, pero tambin entre esos 400 que les han dictado autos de
detencin hay muchos que no eran responsables, cometieron pecados veniales o
equivocaciones, pero que obviamente no tienen ninguna fe en un proceso
judicial totalmente politizado. Todos fueron metidos en la misma canasta
ante la desesperacin del gobierno de Caldera de encontrar culpables de la
debacle venezolana y en su campaa por desprestigiar al "capitalismo" y la
reforma econmica iniciada por Carlos Andrs Prez.
<dd>	Por otra parte, me contaba recientemente un alto ejecutivo de una
multinacional en Buenos Aires, quien antes ocup una posicin similar en
Caracas, que la corrupcin del sector privado en la Argentina est mucho ms
generalizada que en Venezuela porque para cerrar ventas importantes a otras
empresas hay que pagarles comisiones a los gerentes de compras. Es decir, el
sector privado all ya fue contagiado por las prcticas del sector pblico.
<dd>	La trascendencia del Imperio de la Ley y de la seguridad jurdica la expuso
F. W. Maitland hace ms de un siglo al escribir: "El ejercicio del poder en
forma imprevisible origina alguna de las mayores limitaciones, pues la
limitacin, cuanto menos previsible, es mayor y ms temida. Nos sentimos
menos libres cuando sabemos que en cualquier momento y sobre cualquiera de
nuestras acciones puede recaer una limitacin, y, sin embargo, no podemos
prever tales limitaciones Las reglas conocidas, por muy malas que sean,
interfieren menos con la libertad que las decisiones basadas en reglas que
no son previamente conocidas". 
<dd>	Cuando las decisiones judiciales y la interpretacin de las leyes se hacen
en funcin de los intereses polticos del momento, la supuesta libertad
poltica se convierte en un gran engao y la gente comienza a echar de menos
los mejores tiempos que se vivan bajo algn autcrata, cuando al menos
estaba claro lo que se poda o no hacer y el crculo de privilegios era
mucho ms reducido. &copy

<H2>EL GRAN GOBIERNO EN RETROCESO</H2>
Chris Sarlo*<br>
<p>
VANCOUVER, CANADA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).-- Se nota la tendencia hacia menos regulaciones y
gobiernos ms pequeos. Aunque el tamao y alcance del gobierno tienden a
subir y bajar, lo que Robert Nozick llama "el zigzagueo de la poltica",
podemos decir que una contraccin gubernamental permanente se lleva adelante
en Canad, Estados Unidos, partes de Europa, en el sur de Asia, Nueva
Zelanda y, ms recientemente, en Israel.<p>
	Parecen haber tres razones fundamentales en la reduccin del tamao del
estado: filosfica, econmica y pragmtica. Filosficamente se puede
argumentar que una vez dejado atrs los eufemismos, el estado es bsicamente
un instrumento coercitivo que restringe la libertad individual y la
creatividad. En trminos econmicos, el caso es que la intervencin
gubernamental reduce la eficiencia de la economa, lo cual resulta en menos
empleos y un nivel de vida ms bajo. La razn pragmtica es sencilla: una
inmensa deuda pblica y la inconveniencia poltica de aumentar los impuestos
significa que el gobierno tiene que recortar sus gastos. En Canad predomina
esta ltima razn. La deuda obliga a reducir el tamao del estado.<p>0
	Cualquiera que sea la motivacin, la contraccin del estado se puede hacer
bien o mal. Un ejemplo de lo ltimo es la llamada poltica de "contrato
social", donde se tratan de reducir gastos sin reducir el nmero de
funcionarios pblicos. Ese camino confronta graves problemas. Primero, parte
de la causa de la deuda pblica es que el gobierno es demasiado grande, hay
demasiada gente trabajando en el sector pblico. Se llega a esa situacin
por creer que no hay problema que no pueda ser resuelto con la creacin de
una nueva agencia, comisin o superintendencia.<p>
	En estos asuntos hay que preguntarse si lo que queremos que el gobierno
haga por nosotros lo podemos nosotros mismos hacer mejor. Acaso en este o
aquel campo el mercado y los arreglos particulares de la gente pueden
producir mejores resultados que la accin estatal? De ser as, tenemos que
resistir la tentacin de pedir que el gobierno lo haga. Todas las sociedades
deben hacerse peridicamente esta pregunta clave.<p>
	Probablemente habr un consenso sobre las principales funciones del estado,
respecto a las funciones de la polica, justicia y defensa nacional. Habr
tambin consenso sobre exclusiones. En Canad, por ejemplo, cada da hay ms
oposicin a que el gobierno confiera subsidios a empresas privadas,
incluyendo la agricultura. Y el financiamiento gubernamental de grupos de
presin es cada da ms criticado. Tambin es ahora polticamente posible la
privatizacin de servicios pblicos como el correo y el sistema de pensiones
del Seguro Social.<p>
	El verdadero debate surge en las reas de salud, beneficencia, regulacin y
ayuda extranjera. Mientras no est clara la necesidad de tener monopolios
estatales en esas reas, no ser fcil combatir los argumentos en favor de
la intervencin estatal. Lo que s sabemos es que los adelantos tecnolgicos
hacen cada da ms viable la privatizacin y la eliminacin de regulaciones.<p>
	Una vez que hayamos decidido cul es el papel apropiado para el gobierno,
hay que eliminar todas las dems funciones que no se justifican. Claro que
hay que proceder con compasin y ello incluye campaas de entrenamiento de
empleados pblicos para que se puedan ganar la vida en otras actividades.<p>
	La reconsideracin peridica del papel del estado, con el propsito de ir
pasando funciones al sector privado que ste pueda llevar a cabo con mayor
eficiencia, es algo esencial para todas las naciones que quieran evitar los
costosos errores del pasado. <p>

<TITLE>Leon: Un Encuentro de Perfectos Idiotas -- 8/7/96</TITLE>

<i>August 7, 1996</i><br>
<H2>UN ENCUENTRO DE PERFECTOS IDIOTAS</H2>
Roberto Salinas Len*<p>
CIUDAD DE MEXICO (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- El encuentro organizado por los zapatistas de
Chiapas contra el "neoliberalismo" es una dramtica demostracin del
subdesarrollado pensamiento que motiv la reciente publicacin del libro
"Manual del Perfecto Idiota Latinoamericano". Todos los males del orbe se le
atribuyen al "neoliberalismo": el narcotrfico, la pobreza, la marginalidad,
la tirana del dinero, la cartera vencida, la iniquidad fiscal, el
imperialismo cultural Slo se les olvid sealar la impotencia sexual, el
malestar estomacal y la derrota de Mxico por Nigeria.
<dd>	
Una linda causa, oponerse a un fantasma como el "neoliberalismo", descrito
con esa belleza sentimental que caracteriza la retrica del que sabe mucho
de nada, experto en conceptos indefinidos, literatos como Carlos Monsivais
que afirma: "el neoliberalismo, una de las realidades mas oprobiosas del
planeta". 
<dd>	
Fue un encuentro de perfectos idiotas latinoamericanos. Son tres las
caractersticas que  los definen y las tres se ponen de manifiesto en las
declaraciones del encuentro. La primera caracterstica es el
"antigringuismo". Se insiste que Estados Unidos es la fuente de los males de
la regin, desde el mbito comercial hasta el poltico. En Mxico, la
perspectiva del idiota antiliberal impide aprovechar uno de los recursos mas
valiosos del pas: nuestra vasta frontera de 3,000 kilmetros con el mercado
ms grande del mundo. El sentimentalismo nacionalista de  los sermones
contra el neoliberalismo no borran el hecho que la gran mayora de las
exportaciones mexicanas disfrutan del inmenso mercado vecino ni que gran
parte del capital extranjero que necesitamos puede obtenerse en los mercados
financieros al norte de la frontera.
<dd>	
Estados Unidos es un mercado privilegiado, aun con disposiciones tan
nocivas como sus leyes de proteccionismo subrepticio. Nos conviene
aprovechar la geografa con apertura comercial e instrumentar una poltica
sensata de inversin extranjera. No aprovecharlo, acusando a los vecinos del
norte de causar todos nuestros problemas es una verdadera marca de idiotez.
<dd>	
Una segunda caracterstica del idiota antiliberal es su fatalismo; la idea
que los problemas de Mxico son producto de fuerzas exgenas, que el destino
nos ha dictado el subdesarrollo. En  ocasiones se cita la cada de los
precios del petrleo y el peso de la deuda externa; en otras, la
globalizacin financiera, los capitales especulativos, hasta la propia
existencia de mercados financieros. Mxico es un pas joven, cuyos actores
son parte de una generacin devaluada por la cultura antiprogreso. En los
ltimos 25 aos, la economa mexicana ha sufrido mayores desequilibrios
socioeconmicos que en los 150 aos anteriores, aun cuando ocupamos una de
las regiones mejor dotadas en el mundo.
<dd>	
Es curioso que el idiota antiliberal nunca se pregunta por qu pases como
Singapur y Taiwan, sin riquezas naturales, han logrado alcanzar el nivel de
vida de los ingleses y, por el contrario, por qu Mxico, Venezuela y
Brasil, teniendo de todo sufren de tanta pobreza. La razn es la debilidad y
la politizacin de nuestras instituciones. 
<dd>	
Un pas donde se respetan instituciones como el derecho de propiedad y los
contratos, sin permisos ni favoritismo poltico, acumula mayor inversin en
capital humano y as genera  riqueza. Se trata de crear incentivos y
confianza. La postura fcil siempre es culpar al otro, sin reconocer los
errores que tanto le han costado a nuestra devaluada generacin.
<dd>	
La tercera caracterstica del idiota antiliberal, de aquel que todas las
noches antes de dormir hace grgaras con lo "social", es la teora del
pastelito: la idea que la riqueza es un factor preestablecido y lo que se
necesita son buenos planificadores que la distribuyan justamente, como si se
tratara de las porciones de un pastel. A ello se aade tratar de solucionar
la pobreza a travs de una poltica fiscal: ms y ms gasto, sin importar
sus nefastas consecuencias. La distribucin "equitativa" de la riqueza que
propone el idiota latinoamericano implica una injusta transferencia de
recursos del sector productivo al sector burocrtico, generando rentismo e
imposibilitando la formacin de capital, con lo cual ms bien se logra una
masiva distribucin de la pobreza.
<dd>	
El encuentro zapatista en Chiapas fue un encuentro de envidia, la
caracterstica ms perniciosa del idiota latinoamericano. Segn el
periodista e historiador ingls Paul Johnson, la envidia "es la mas
peligrosa de todas las emociones populares el Estado todopoderoso es fuente
de muchos males; pero sobre todo es el mejor custodio de la envidia".

<H2>ESPAA: EL CAMINO DE LA PROSPERIDAD</H2>
L. Jacobo Rodrguez* <br>
<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--
El nuevo gobierno espaol, elegido en marzo en reemplazo
de los socialistas que ocuparon el poder por 14 aos y dejaron la economa
en estado catico, se apresura a cumplir con las estipulaciones de la moneda
nica europea. Estos requisitos, que los pases de la Unin Europea deben
cumplir para finales de 1997 para poder ingresar como miembros fundadores de
la Unin Monetaria Europea (UME), exigen que la deuda pblica no sobrepase
el 60% del PIB, que el dficit fiscal no pase del 3% del PIB y que la tasa
de inflacin no sea ms que punto y medio superior a las tasas ms bajas de
los pases miembros.
<P>Con una deuda pblica equivalente al 65% del PIB, un dficit fiscal
estimado este ao en 4% del PIB y una tasa de inflacin de medio punto por
encima del objetivo, las posibilidades son buenas de que Espaa cumpla. Sin
embargo, tratar simplemente de remendar el Estado de Bienestar no es una
alternativa viable, ya que dejara a Espaa en desventaja competitiva frente
a sus socios europeos. Por el contrario, el nuevo gobierno debe instrumentar
reformas de mercado que fomenten el crecimiento econmico, aumenten la tasa
de empleo y atraigan de nuevo la inversin extranjera.
<P>Lamentablemente, los polticos espaoles estn poniendo demasiado nfasis
en alcanzar los requisitos de la UME, en vez de enfrentar los defectos
estructurales de la economa que condujeron a una tasa de desempleo del
22,4%.  Por ejemplo, en vez de eliminar programas pblicos costosos e
innecesarios, el gobierno est tratando de reducir el dficit a 3%
congelando los salarios de los funcionarios pblicos. Tales "soluciones"
pueden lograr que Espaa entre precariamente en la UME a finales de 1997,
pero el nuevo presidente del gobierno, Jos Mara Aznar, debera ms bien
reducir substancialmente el papel del Estado en la economa.
<P>Algunos pasos se han dado, incluyendo gestiones para privatizar algunas
empresas estatales. Pero hay que ir ms lejos porque el Estado de Bienestar
espaol ha fracasado miserablemente. Aznar deber afrontar con coraje la
crisis antes que ese Estado de Bienestar colapse por su propio peso. 
<P>Hay que reformar el sistema pblico de pensiones, liberalizar el mercado
laboral y simplificar el cdigo fiscal. El actual sistema de pensiones
consume cerca del 10% del PIB y va camino a la quiebra. Si las pensiones se
mantienen a los actuales niveles, ellas de por s producirn un dficit
equivalente al 4% del PIB para el ao 2025. Y, dadas las tendencias
demogrficas de Espaa, reducir los beneficios de los actuales o futuros
pensionistas o aumentar las cotizaciones de los trabajadores (actualmente
28% de la nmina) no evitar la quiebra. Esta es la conclusin de un estudio
recientemente publicado por el Crculo de Empresarios.  
<P>Ese estudio muestra que tanto los trabajadores como los empresarios se
beneficiaran con la instrumentacin de un sistema de capitalizacin
individual, fiscalmente viable y similar al exitoso sistema chileno.  Pero
el Sr. Aznar ha declarado que cualquier reforma de las pensiones se har
dentro del marco del actual sistema pblico de reparto.
<P>Si la crisis del sistema de pensiones comienza ahora a hacerse evidente, la
crisis en el mercado laboral ha plagado a Espaa durante aos.  Espaa tiene
la tasa de desempleo ms alta del mundo industrializado. Las amplias
regulaciones estatales diseadas para ayudar a los trabajadores y a los que
buscan empleos han resultado contraproducentes. Costosas leyes sobre
despidos y vacaciones han aumentado exageradamente el costo de la mano de
obra y disminuido la tasa de empleo fijo.
<P>Tambin falta que la nueva administracin fije una poltica fiscal clara.
El reemplazo de la tasa mxima del impuesto sobre ganancias de capital de
56% por una nica del 20% fue seguida por aumentos de impuestos al tabaco y
bebidas alcohlicas, y  se esperan aumentos al agua y las medicinas.
<P>No se ha adelantado en las promesas electorales de reformar el cdigo
fiscal. Ms bien, el gobierno ha tratado de extraer ms fondos del sector
privado combatiendo la evasin de impuestos. Habra mayor cumplimiento si la
estructura del cdigo fiscal, que tiene 17 tramos, se simplificase y si la
tasa marginal del 56% fuera reducida.
<P>Si bien es cierto que la UME ofrece beneficios, hoy la economa espaola no
est en posicin de disfrutarlos y probablemente tampoco lo estar a finales
de 1997. El nuevo gobierno servir mejor al pueblo espaol si adopta
reformas de mercado, en lugar de tratar de salvar a un sistema
socioeconmico fracasado. Los espaoles eligieron a Aznar porque estaban
cansados de la corrupcin causada por la poltica estatista e
intervencionista del gobierno de Felipe Gonzlez. Solamente un golpe de
timn permitir a Espaa satisfacer las aspiraciones de sus ciudadanos.

<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>
<i>August 7, 1996</i><br>
<H2>VENEZUELA: PETROLEO Y MISERIA</H2>
Oscar Garca M.*<p>
CARACAS (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- Hace slo 14 aos, en 1982, el venezolano que tena un
billete de 500 bolvares en el bolsillo poda cambiarlo en cualquier banco
por $116,28. Ahora ese mismo billete de 500 bolvares apenas vale $1,05,
menos de cien veces. Este proceso de devaluacin e inflacin resulta
inexplicable en un pas dotado de una riqueza petrolera casi sin fin. El
petrleo no fue sembrado, como hace 60 aos propuso hacer Arturo Uslar
Pietri, en un editorial del diario Ahora. Por el contrario ha sido utilizado
para subsidiar las crisis.
<dd>
No hemos logrado con los ingresos del petrleo construir una economa
moderna y productiva. Al contrario, al haber sido manejados los recursos
petroleros por el Estado, se han malbaratado y despilfarrado de tal manera
que la Venezuela de hoy puede ser definida con dos palabras contrapuestas:
"petrleo y miseria".
<dd>
Siguen ingresando cantidades asombrosas de dinero provenientes de las
exportaciones petroleras -para este ao ms de $20.000 millones-, lo cual
sera ms que suficiente para 23 millones de habitantes que slo importan
bienes y servicios por alrededor de $8.000 millones. Pero el  nivel de
pobreza alcanza  80% de la poblacin. Un absurdo imperdonable.
<dd>
El Estado recibe los ingresos y en lugar de utilizarlos para sentar las
bases de un crecimiento sostenido, los despilfarra en una enorme burocracia
ineficiente, una industria estatizada y un aparato clientelar.
<dd>
Aunque los ingresos petroleros seran ms que suficientes para cubrir las
necesidades financieras del gobierno, a nuestros polticos les resultan
insuficientes y el Estado recurre al incremento en los impuestos para cubrir
infinitas necesidades. Los impuestos son un mal necesario, pues destruyen
riqueza, extinguen incentivos y deben ser siempre usados para gastos
estrictamente necesarios: la seguridad (que no hay), justicia (casi
inexistente), defensa, relaciones internacionales, educacin y salud.
<dd>
En casi todos esos rubros los gobiernos venezolanos no han sido capaces de
prestar servicios razonables; al contrario, han hecho colapsar algunos que
en su momento fueron tolerables.
<dd>
Ahora, cuando el mundo entero est de regreso y ha sido ampliamente
comprobado que las altas tasas impositivas, en lugar de aumentar, reducen
los ingresos fiscales, se empea nuestro gobierno en aumentar fuertemente
las cargas a una poblacin ya exhausta.
<dd>
El impuesto inflacionario que ha azotado a los venezolanos entre 1976 y
1995 es de 9.494%. El impuesto inflacionario desde 1994 a mayo de 1996 es de
288,59%. La inflacin genera una transferencia de riquezas tremendamente
injusta, especialmente de los ms dbiles y pobres al gobierno. Los ms
ricos se protegen de la inflacin con inversiones inmobiliarias y cuentas en
el extranjero.
<dd>
Los ingresos petroleros de Venezuela han continuado aumentando y por
diversas circunstancias seguirn hacindolo, facilitando a los polticos
postergar reformas estructurales fundamentales y necesarias, como lo son la
creacin del Estado de derecho y las esencialsimas privatizaciones. 
<dd>
La voluntad poltica para realizar cambios estructurales bajo la anunciada
Agenda Venezuela ya comienza a flaquear, segn el propio ministro de
Planificacin Teodoro Petkoff. De ser as, la Venezuela del futuro seguir
siendo la misma de hoy: mucho petrleo y mucha miseria.
<dd>
Para cambiar y prosperar -y puede lograrse esto con relativa rapidez- es
necesario reducir el tamao del Estado privatizando, dejando en manos de la
iniciativa privada el manejo del aparato productivo del pas. Este proceso,
aparentemente traumtico para quienes han vivido tantos aos bajo ambientes
populistas e intervencionistas, es la solucin tanto de corto como de largo
plazo, que permitir bajar la inflacin, crear empleos y desarrollar la
productividad, devolvindole as a la nacin venezolana su optimismo y
bienestar.

<h2>
MEXICO: CORRUPCION  DE LAS LEYES 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
spanbio
.html">
Agustn Navarro
</a>

<P>
CIUDAD DE MEXICO (AIPE).- Se sabe que la corrupcin no es un fenmeno
exclusivamente mexicano, pero en los ltimos tiempos lo que aqu sucede ha
llamado la atencin de los medios de comunicacin de todo el mundo.


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Siguiendo el "principio de la causalidad", es decir, respetando la
inexorable relacin entre "causa y efecto", descubrimos que esa corrupcin
es perfectamente consistente con la naturaleza de nuestro sistema poltico,
econmico y jurdico. En efecto, el origen -y por tanto la solucin- de la
corrupcin radica en buena parte en las normas vigentes (leyes, reglamentos,
decretos, etc.), que no slo produce, sino que estimula e inmuniza a la
expoliacin. Se trata del saqueo al amparo de la ley, frase descriptiva de
la corrupcin acuada en 1850 por Federico Bastiat en su magistral obra "La
Ley". Bastiat defini a la ley como "la organizacin colectiva del derecho
individual a defenderse". El punto de partida, por lo tanto, es que el
individuo requiere para su supervivencia preservar su persona, su libertad y
su propiedad, y que cada uno de estos requisitos bsicos son completamente
dependientes de los otros dos. De ah tambin se desprende que la sociedad
tiene el derecho de organizarse y crear una fuerza comn que proteja
permanentemente esos derechos. Por ello, el derecho colectivo -y su propia
legalidad- est basado en los derechos individuales. As como un individuo
no puede usar legalmente la fuerza contra la persona, libertad o propiedad
de otro individuo, la fuerza comn (la ley) no puede ser usada para destruir
la persona, libertad y propiedad de los individuos o grupos.<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Bastiat mantena que cuando la ley no se autolimita y no se confina a sus
funciones propias, se pervierte y empieza a actuar en contra de su propsito
original. Al ser manipulada para destruir su objetivo fundamental, aniquila
la justicia que se supona deba mantener y destruye los derechos que deba
respetar, ponindose al servicio de gente sin escrpulos, que prcticamente
sin riesgos explotan a la persona, libertad y propiedad de otros,
convirtiendo la expoliacin, o sea a la corrupcin, en un derecho del
gobernante y de sus allegados. Es entonces cuando la ley manejada a su
antojo por el poder poltico logra su trnsito de corrupcin. As fue como
en Mxico y en otros pases se cre una estructura legal, buscando
garantizar derechos sociales y econmicos que exceden a los fundamentales
derechos individuales, que para ser satisfechos requieren del uso compulsivo
de la ley en transferir y redistribuir la riqueza. As se dise toda esta
ingeniera de pillaje y extorsin socioeconmica de impuestos, regulaciones,
protecciones, subsidios, licencias, permisos, concesiones, transferencias,
etc., plasmada por doquier en nuestra Constitucin y leyes secundarias. Por
el contrario, debiramos entender la ley,  igual que Bastiat, como un
concepto de naturaleza negativa. Esto es, el propsito de la ley es evitar
que reine la  injusticia. La verdadera justicia slo se alcanza mediante la
erradicacin de la injusticia. Cuando la ley impone por la fuerza una
restriccin al trabajo de los individuos o transfiere riqueza sin el acuerdo
o compensacin de los afectados, est actuando positivamente y la sociedad
entonces queda en manos del poltico de turno en el poder, abrindose las
puertas de par en par a la corrupcin.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Por ello, antes de crear una nueva legislacin ineficiente, dirigida
combatir la corrupcin, hay que revisar con honestidad y con precisin
jurdica todo ese cuerpo de leyes que han creado privilegios y de hecho han
concedido licencias para expoliar y saquear a los ciudadanos, bajo un
rgimen de impunidad. Las recientes y escandalosas revelaciones de
corrupcin son emanaciones de un pantano ya bien conocido por todos. Los
polticos y empresarios que han disfrutado por dcadas los rentables frutos
del "me das, te doy", saben perfectamente cmo manejar ese sistema de
infinita complejidad en que se ha constituido la manera de hacer negocios en
Mxico.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Podrn rodar las cabezas de prominentes miembros de la lite
polticoempresarial del pas, segn la guillotina desafilada de nuestro
sistema de justicia, si as lo determinan nuestros jueces -lo que falta por
verse-, pero si no se atiende el verdadero origen del saqueo al amparo de la
ley, que permite lucrar desde los puestos pblicos mediante la manipulacin
de leyes y reglamentos, con decretos que crean regmenes de excepcin en
favor de un grupo o sector, con protecciones a la banca, industria y al
comercio, en perjuicio del libre ingreso de nuevos competidores al mercado,
la corrupcin no cesar y la misma sofisticacin de que ya goza el crimen
organizado har que retoe. Conclusin: La corrupcin, como las escaleras,
se barre de arriba hacia abajo.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Citemos finalmente a Montesquieu, quien en "El espritu de las leyes",
nos dice: "Hay dos gneros de corrupcin: una cuando el pueblo no observa
las leyes, y el otro cuando el pueblo es corrompido por las leyes, mal
incurable ya que radica en el nico remedio que el mal tendra".

<h2>
HONG KONG VERSUS BUCHANAN
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Milton Friedman*
</a>

<P>
STANFORD, CALIFORNIA (AIPE).- La experiencia de Hong Kong contradice el
falso dogma de Pat Buchanan de que el proteccionismo beneficia a los
trabajadores y promueve el crecimiento econmico.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Poco despus de la Segunda Guerra, al mismo tiempo que Gran Bretaa
instrumentaba polticas socialistas, una de sus ltimas colonias -Hong Kong-
daba un vuelco hacia el total libre mercado, iniciando un experimento
ilustrativo de los resultados opuestos producidos por el mercado libre y el
mercado controlado.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Por algn accidente de carcter oficial, la oficina colonial britnica
design a John Cowperthwaite, un escocs estudioso de Adam Smith, como
secretario financiero de Hong Kong. A las polticas de libre mercado de
Cowperthwaite se les acredita haber producido el milagro econmico que
condujo a un fenomenal crecimiento del nivel de vida promedio, a pesar de
que la poblacin se multiplic diez veces.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Es difcil concebir un reto ms severo a las polticas de libre mercado.
Hong Kong es una isla pobre en recursos naturales ms all de su gran
puerto. Cuando los comunistas se aduearon de China, olas de refugiados
llegaban huyendo slo con las posesiones que podan cargar. Ellos y los que
los siguieron produjeron un rpido incremento de la poblacin. Hong Kong
prcticamente no recibi ayuda extranjera para asimilar a estas hordas de
refugiados.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Frente a estas adversas circunstancias, la salvacin de Hong Kong han sido
sus polticas de libre comercio y libre mercado, basados en ningn arancel a
las importaciones ni ningn subsidio u otro tipo de privilegio concedido a
las exportaciones. Las muy pocas restricciones que se han impuesto, como el
acuerdo sobre textiles multifibras, se deben a presiones aplicadas por
Estados Unidos y algunos otros pases. Pero no se fijan los precios ni los
salarios; hay mnimas restricciones al inicio de actividades comerciales y
tanto los gastos del gobierno como los impuestos se han mantenido bajos. La
tasa tope del impuesto personal a las rentas es 25%, con un promedio mximo
de 15%.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Las condiciones eran ttricas al principio, pero rpidamente comenzaron a
mejorar y han seguido mejorando hasta hoy. Para 1960, el Producto Interno
Bruto per cpita (en precios de 1995) era de $2.247, o sea menos de una
tercera parte del de Gran Bretaa entonces, que era de $7.906. Para 1994 la
situacin se haba revertido. El ingreso per cpita en Hong Kong se haba
multiplicado casi por ocho, hasta alcanzar $17.832 y era ya 30% superior al
de Gran Bretaa, el cual alcanzaba $13.340. Realmente un milagro econmico.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Es irnico que la colonia floreci, a pesar de todas las circunstancias
adversas, al seguir polticas diametralmente opuestas a la de su madre
patria, mientras Inglaterra permaneca estancada. El Instituto Fraser del
Canad acaba de publicar una clasificacin, segn la libertad econmica, de
ms de cien pases en 1995. Hong Kong est en primer puesto; Estados Unidos
en el cuarto y Gran Bretaa en el sexto. Ms sorprendente an es que el
ingreso per cpita de Hong Kong es apenas 5% ms bajo que el de Estados Unidos.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Qu contraste con la experiencia de casi todas las ex colonias britnicas
que obtuvieron su libertad despus de la Segunda Guerra. Y qu estupenda
prueba de que el libre comercio y el libre mercado favorecen mucho ms a la
gente comn y corriente que el "proteccionismo" del Sr. Buchanan o el "justo
intercambio" del presidente Clinton. La "justicia comercial" depende de
quin la mire, mientras que el veredicto del libre comercio est en manos
del mercado. Por algo la palabra "libre" aparece mencionada tres veces en
nuestra Declaracin de Independencia y una vez en la primera enmienda
constitucional, al igual que la palabra "libertad". Pero la palabra "justo"
no aparece en ninguno de esos documentos redactados por nuestros prceres.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Lamentablemente, el milagro de Hong Kong va a ser seriamente daado si no
destruido cuando los comunistas le pongan la mano el ao prximo.

<H2>APRENDIENDO FUERA DE LA UNIVERSIDAD</H2>
Karl Zinsmeister*<br>
<p>
WASHINGTON (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--
Hace unos aos, el autor George Gilder escribi en el
anuario de Harvard que una vez terminados sus estudios se haba concentrado
"en un laborioso esfuerzo para redescubrir las verdades aprendidas de mi
madre mi padre y que desaprend en la universidad". De manera parecida, el
poeta Robert Frost dijo, en la conferencia dictada ante los graduados de
Dartmouth en 1955, que haba hecho un particular esfuerzo "de pasar por la
universidad mantenindome como soy para no ser cambiado completamente es
una pobre clase de persona, creo yo, la que se siente satisfecha pensando
'me han transformado en una persona que ni mi madre reconocera'".
<P>Se trata de importantes crticas a la educacin universitaria porque las
universidades no slo difunden conocimientos sino que tambin los destruyen.
Y las instituciones de altos estudios se sienten cada da con ms derecho a
borrar otros tipos de conocimiento.
<P>Alguna "deseducacin" es valiosa, especficamente aquella que destruye
falsos prejuicios. Pero gran parte de la variedad contempornea no va en
contra de falsedades sino en contra del sentido comn que ha evolucionado a
travs de la historia, lo mismo que contra nexos humanos naturales. En reas
que van desde el sexo, el lenguaje, la estructura familiar y las creencias
religiosas, muchos profesores se empean hoy en corroer las costumbres
tradicionales, rechazando juicios inmemoriales y descontando la sabidura de
los padres, extirpando las creencias fuera de moda.
<P>Dnde en el mundo acadmico de hoy se acepta la fe catlica, juda
ortodoxa, evanglica protestante? Y ni hablar de la mormona o musulmana.
Cun aceptado entre acadmicos es la creencia de la mayora de los
americanos de que hay diferencias biolgicas importantes entre el hombre y
la mujer? Cun tolerantes son las universidades de los puntos de vistas
mayoritarios en cuanto al crimen, la homosexualidad, la pena de muerte y el
servicio militar?
<P>Una reciente encuesta hecha por mi revista, The American Enterprise, mostr
que slo entre 2% y 6% de los profesores de humanidades en las mejores
universidades de Estados Unidos son republicanos. Adnde qued la amplia
gama de perspectivas y la discusin de puntos de vista antagnicos que las
universidades dicen patrocinar? Ms bien encontramos una vanidosa seguridad
y hostilidad contra las ideas "reaccionarias" que los estudiantes traen.
<P>El problema es que las universidades ejercen un monopolio en la educacin
superior y se sienten con el arrogante derecho de cancelar las verdades
intelectuales o morales aprendidas fueras de sus muros.
<P>En la universidad donde estudi, perteneciente al Ivy League (asociacin de
las ocho universidades ms antiguas y prestigiosas de Estados Unidos),
recib una menor exposicin a las obras clsicas de la literatura y la
historia de la que considero merecen recibir los estudiantes. Los temas
religiosos se ignoraban y no aprend nada til acerca de cmo crear un
matrimonio feliz, una familia y un hogar. Por el contrario, recib mucha
informacin contraproducente. Y si usted piensa que esos temas van ms all
de la esfera universitaria, recuerde que los sabios desde Platn hasta San
Agustn y Austen dedicaron el mayor inters intelectual a esos asuntos.
Lanzar a los estudiantes al mundo sin haber sido expuestos a la evolucin de
la sabidura en temas cotidianos es una grave falla educativa.
<P>No estoy predicando oscurantismo. El acceso a entrenamiento acadmico
formal es una gran cosa y obviamente es la misin principal de las
universidades. Pero debemos recordar que hay mltiples caminos hacia el
conocimiento y los profesores universitarios difcilmente tienen el
monopolio de la sabidura. Hoy los ms brillantes eruditos tienden a ser los
ms grandes crticos del mundo acadmico. El recin fallecido Allan Bloom,
traductor de Platn y de Rousseau insista que sus abuelos, quienes apenas
si saban leer y escribir, eran mucho ms sabios que sus nietos con
mltiples doctorados.
<P>Los estudiantes deben ingresar a la universidad con suspicacia en cuanto a
que las autoridades acadmicas representan la fuente final de la verdad. Y
deben balancear su educacin formal con una disciplinada educacin informal.
Si el entrenamiento personal y familiar es simplemente suplantado por la
educacin oficial, el resultado ser una comprensin deformada y falsa del
mundo, especialmente ahora que las universidades son tan "polticamente
correctas", izquierdistas y apegadas a lo que intelectualmente est de moda.
<P>Los estudiantes universitarios deben estar conscientes que en lo que tiene
que ver con muchos de los aspectos de la vida, su experiencia personal es
superior a lo que hoy ofrecen las lites letradas.

<H2>COSTA RICA: ESTAFA LEGALIZADA</H2>
Rigoberto Stewart*<br>
<p>
SAN JOSE DE COSTA RICA (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).--
La deuda pblica se ha convertido
mundialmente en un grave problema que amenaza destruir economas y los
sistemas democrticos. Sin embargo, pocos pases encaran con seriedad el
problema y Costa Rica no es uno de ellos. 
<P>El problema es que los gobiernos gastan mucho ms de lo que recaudan y
prefieren financiar el dficit con crditos y con emisiones monetarias, que
es un impuesto indirecto. As, cada administracin deja en herencia a la
siguiente una deuda mayor. Por tal razn, la deuda pblica costarricense
crece como una bola de nieve.
<P>Entre 1993 y 1996, la deuda interna en Costa Rica se triplic. En
1996 crece 26% sobre 1995 y en 1997 aumentar 27%. A finales de 1995, la
deuda pblica total -interna, externa y no documentada a algunas
instituciones pblicas, como el Seguro Social- era de $6.943 millones,
equivalente a 77% del PIB. Y en 1997 se espera que llegue a US$7.937. La
deuda total por habitante crece ms rpido que la produccin econmica
(PIB). Esto indica que el pas no se est endeudando para realizar
inversiones productivas, y que pronto un sector grande de la poblacin
trabajar slo para pagar la deuda.
<P>Es sostenible tal situacin? El ministro de Hacienda dice que no hay
parmetros internacionales que indiquen el nivel ptimo de la deuda pblica.
No obstante, el PIB es un buen indicador de la capacidad de pago. Los
estadounidenses han estado alarmados porque su deuda pblica ha oscilado
entre 24% y 42% del PIB desde 1933, y porque el pago de intereses ha
representado entre 7% y 14% del presupuesto fiscal, y entre 1,5% y 3% del
PIB. En Costa Rica, la deuda alcanzar 86% del PIB en 1997, mientras que el
pago de intereses ya representa un tercio del gasto pblico anual y ms del
5% del PIB. Adems de alarmante, esta situacin es totalmente insostenible.
Pero las autoridades, que siguen gastando a manos llenas, apenas dan
muestras de preocupacin.
<P>Aparte de otros daos, la deuda pblica frena el desarrollo. Al recurrir a
los mercados financieros en busca de recursos, el gobierno impide que muchas
empresas obtengan financiamiento, a la vez que hace subir las tasas de
inters. Esto conduce a menos inversin, menos produccin, menos empleo
productivo y menos creacin de riqueza. Y al tomar dinero de instituciones
pblicas, como  la  Caja de Seguro Social y de telecomunicaciones, deja a la
ciudadana con menos servicios pblicos.
<P>En Amrica Latina, los gobernantes suelen ejercer el poder
endeudando a la poblacin sin ningn lmite, y cuatro aos despus se van,
sin responder por sus actos. Adems, casi todo el crdito pblico va a
gastos, no a inversin, lo que implica que los gobernantes se estn comiendo
hoy la produccin de generaciones futuras. Algo realmente inmoral.  
<P>En Costa Rica, adems, la deuda pblica ha sido un instrumento de estafa.
El 58% de la deuda interna es contrada con instituciones del Estado, o sea,
el Estado se endeuda consigo mismo; pero le cobra la factura a los
contribuyentes. En realidad, esta deuda tambin representa impuestos futuros
dilapidados hoy. Por otra parte, 42% de la deuda es con el sector privado.
En este caso, el Estado le pide prestado a los ricos para concederles
privilegios, pero recurre a los pobres para cancelar la deuda. Este esquema
es un mecanismo de transferencia de pobres a ricos. Una estafa legalizada.
<P>Hoy sabemos que no hay ningn servicio que no pueda ser
brindado por una entidad diferente al Estado. De ah que, los libertarios
costarricenses han propuesto las siguientes tres acciones, para solucionar
definitivamente el problema de la deuda: Primero, vender los activos del
Estado y, con el dinero, cancelar la deuda. Para lograr el mayor precio
posible, los activos seran vendidos mediante subastas abiertas a todo el
mundo. Se ha estimado que la venta del Instituto Costarricense de
Electricidad (electricidad y telecomunicaciones) podra generar unos $1.500
millones, la mitad de la deuda externa. Segundo, retirar al Estado de todas
las actividades que no le competen. Tercero, prohibir, por medio de la
Constitucin, el endeudamiento futuro del Estado. Esto ltimo es esencial
para que la solucin del problema sea permanente.

ARGENTINA: PRIVATIZACION DEL SUBSUELO

<a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><p><br>

<h2>
ARGENTINA: PRIVATIZACION DEL SUBSUELO
</h2>
Guillermo Yeatts*
<br>
<p>
BUENOS AIRES (<a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">AIPE</a>).- El Congreso argentino est debatiendo el tema de los
hidrocarburos, con el objeto de convertir en ley el decreto presidencial de
1989 que desregul la industria petrolera, resultando en el aumento de 55%
de la produccin. Lo que se pretende evitar es que un futuro gobierno repita
lo ocurrido en 1963, cuando por decreto se cancelaron las reformas
petroleras instrumentadas por la administracin del presidente Frondizi en
1958. La historia de la actividad petrolera en la Argentina muestra
reiterados ejemplos de cmo los procesos aperturistas fueron neutralizados
por nuevas oleadas de intervencin estatal.
<p>
Lamentablemente, el nuevo proyecto de ley reafirma la propiedad del estado
sobre el subsuelo, lo cual no evitar que se repita la historia. Mientras el
estado sea propietario de lo que est debajo de terrenos privados seguir
siendo fcil regresar a la intervencin estatal y se le cierran las puertas
al desarrollo agresivo de las provincias pobres.
Por el contrario, las leyes relativas al subsuelo en Estados Unidos siguen
la tradicin inglesa: el dueo de la tierra es propietario de todo lo que
est encima o debajo. Esto significa que la riqueza encontrada en el
subsuelo le pertenece al dueo del terreno. Ello incentiva la inversin y la
innovacin tecnolgica.	
<p>
Mientras en Estados Unidos la industria petrolera ya generaba riqueza a
fines del siglo XIX, nada parecido ocurra en la Argentina, donde regiones
enteras con gran potencial petrolero quedaban en el olvido y la pobreza. 
La conexin fundamental que existe entre las instituciones y el rendimiento
econmico ha sido estudiada por el economista y premio Nobel Douglass North,
quien en 1993 escribi: "Las instituciones son las reglas del juego en una
sociedad o, ms formalmente, son las limitaciones ideadas por el hombre que
dan forma a la accin humana. Por consiguiente, estructuran incentivos en el
intercambio humano, sea poltico, social o econmico". La historia nos
ensea que cuando las instituciones crean incentivos positivos, la gente
acta de manera productiva y cuando las instituciones reprimen los
incentivos se contrae la iniciativa privada.
<p>
En el caso argentino, las instituciones heredadas de Espaa determinaron
que el subsuelo fuera propiedad del estado. Ya en el siglo XII, el rey de
Castilla se declaraba dueo de las riquezas minerales de su territorio,
tendencia que se acrecent a partir del siglo XV, con el descubrimiento de
metales preciosos en Amrica y simplemente lo que era del rey pas a ser de
la nacin. El Cdigo de Minera de 1886 reconoci la propiedad pblica del
subsuelo y la participacin del sector privado qued limitada a la forma de
concesin.
<p>
En 1865, apenas siete aos despus de que el negocio petrolero se iniciara
en Pennsylvania, en la provincia de Jujuy se gestaba el primer hallazgo de
este tipo en la Argentina. Leonardo Villa fue el empresario que intent
explotar el petrleo en forma comercial para cubrir las demandas del mercado
de kerosene para alumbrado pblico, tal cual estaba sucediendo en Estados
Unidos desde 1858. Pero la iniciativa de este pionero choc contra una
impenetrable muralla. Para comenzar la explotacin, Villa se vio obligado a
solicitar autorizacin a las autoridades de la provincia y luego al poder
legislativo nacional, lo cual, tras infinitos vaivenes, le fue denegado. El
estado, dueo del subsuelo, no permiti que el negocio se concretara. Igual
suerte corrieron otros pioneros hacia fines del siglo XIX.
<p>
Paralelamente, en Titusville, Pennsylvania, el negocio petrolero -iniciado
en 1858- haba alcanzado niveles insospechados. Contrariamente a lo sucedido
en la Argentina, el impulso de aquel grupo de visionarios que vio en el
aceite mineral una alternativa para reducir el elevado costo del alumbrado
no fue frenado por la intervencin del estado. La leyes de Estados Unidos
alentaron la inversin, la toma de riesgo y la innovacin tecnolgica.
<p>
Con el correr del tiempo, la intervencin estatal argentina se increment a
partir de la declaracin de zonas de reserva para la exploracin y
explotacin, el incremento de las regulaciones y, finalmente, la creacin de
Yacimientos Petrolferos Fiscales (YPF) en 1922. Los aos que siguieron
acrecentaron la voracidad de estado y restringieron an ms la limitada
participacin del sector privado. El nacionalismo econmico y su concepcin
del petrleo como recurso estratgico excluyeron casi completamente a los
particulares de la actividad, lo cual alcanz su punto mximo con la
nacionalizacin de los recursos energticos en la Constitucin de 1949. La
desregulacin de la actividad petrolera iniciada con los decretos de 1989,
si bien constituy un cambio radical dado que la produccin se increment de
27 millones en 1989 a 42 millones de metros cbicos en 1995, y liber el
comercio petrolero, no concret el cambio institucional de privatizar
totalmente este sector.
<p>
La mentalidad estatista conden a las regiones no agropecuarias a la
marginalidad y a la pobreza. Hoy en da, 80% del subsuelo argentino sigue
sin haber sido explorado. Lo que habra que hacer es proceder a un cambio
institucional fundamental, traspasando la propiedad del subsuelo a los
dueos de las tierras. La privatizacin del subsuelo acabara con el freno
artificial sufrido por la industria petrolera argentina por ms de 100 aos.

          prepared to give to the Senate. I believe I heard enough of the
          Senator`s remarks that, at some point, I will depart from the
          speech and answer a few of the comments made.
            I will start right off by saying that it is unfair to the senior
          citizens of the United States to talk about what might be, or how
          things ought to be, and not tell them how things are.
            The fact of the matter is that the cornerstone of hospital health
          care for our seniors - Medicare - is in big trouble.  And to make a
          speech about the seniors and scare them about the future, without
          telling them the truth, does not seem to me to be the right way to
          treat our seniors, who are filled with wisdom, understanding, and
          truly think this is a great Nation and would like very much to do
          their share to try to fix some things that are going wrong.
<P>                                                                    PAGE S10869
   <P>         So the No. 1 point is that there has been in existence a group of
          Americans who reviewed thoroughly the status, the financial status,
          and the delivery system called Medicare. Mr. President, that is not
          a Republican group.  As a matter of fact, one might call it, if you
          seek to partisanize it, a Democratic group, because three Cabinet
          members of this President and the appointee of this President who
          heads Social Security were four members of the Commission - the
          majority.  There are only two more.  And all six of them, including
          the four, wrote a report to the people of this country, the
          seniors, the President, and the Congress, and told us in no
          uncertain language that the Medicare Program was in trouble because
          it was costing too much.  I just want to read their recommendation
          so that we put everything into perspective.  Their final words of
          real recommendation were the following:
            We strongly recommend that the crisis presented by the financial
          condition of Medicare trust funds be urgently addressed on a
          comprehensive basis, including a review of the program`s financing
          methods, benefit programs, and delivery system.
            Now, Mr. President, you would not have gathered from the comments
          of the distinguished Senator from Massachusetts that anything like
          this had even happened.  Here sits a report - I wish I had a copy
          of it.  If I am going to talk about it, I should bring it around.
          When I saw it, it was a little yellow notebook with a yellow cover,
          properly styled.  I repeat, the Commissioners, four of whom work
          for this President, said the time is now - and I am going to repeat
          what they said we ought to be doing.
   <P>                                                                 PAGE S10869
      <P>      It is very, very simple.  But Members would not have heard it
          from the speech of the Senator from Massachusetts. They said, `It
          is time to review the program`s financing methods, benefit
          provisions, and delivery mechanism.`
            Now, why did they say that? Members would not have gathered this,
          either, from the remarks.  They said there will be no money in 7
          years to pay the bills.  We would not have known that, either, from
          the remarks about all the evil and bad things that will happen to
          seniors.
            The worst of all things is that there be no program, that they
          cannot pay their bills in 7 years.  That is, really, something to
          call to the attention of the senior citizens of the United States.
    <P>                                                                PAGE S10869
       <P>     Then say, `What is wrong with doing just what they said? Review
          the program`s financing methods, benefit provisions, and delivery
          mechanisms.`
            Now, Mr. President, if we look at what was proposed in the budget
          resolution for this country, it is on all fours with the
          recommendations of the commission that reports on the financial
          condition of the system.  If we take what they said and find out
          what we ought to do, we ought to save a given amount of money to
          the health care insurance over the next 7 years in order to make
          that system stay solvent and not be bankrupt.
            The budget resolution says that is what we ought to do.  Now,
          everybody ought to understand that Medicare is growing at about 10
          percent a year.  They mention that too, in the report.  It cannot
          continue to grow at that pace and there still be money in the trust
          fund in 7 years to pay the bill.
     <P>                                                               PAGE S10869
        <P>    It falls on someone to take a look at how we might do it better,
          give the seniors options, and perhaps cost the trust fund less
          money.
            Now, that is what all of this is about.  No matter how we talk
          about it, the truth of the matter is that many people in the U.S.
          Congress felt it was time to look at this and fix it.  In fixing
          it, we just might give the senior citizens a pretty good hospital
          program that will cost very little more to them, but will cost
          less, because it will be more efficient.
            We will take the fraud and waste out of the program and cause the
          delivery system to be restructured so you still have choice of your
          own doctor, but there is choice of plans, and perhaps over time we
          would save substantial amounts of money.
   <P>                                                                 PAGE S10869
      <P>      Now, Mr. President, before I read my anniversary speech on
          Medicare, I want to make one other comment.  Those who oppose
          fixing the Medicare Program now cannot miss a beat without saying
          the Republicans are going to cut the taxes for the rich, and that
          is why they are fixing Medicare.
            Now, Mr. President, and anyone listening, that is not true.
          First of all, if we take the so-called tax cuts that are proposed
          off the table - just do not do them - and the Medicare system will
          be bankrupt in 7 years.  Let me repeat: The so-called tax cuts -
          and we will talk about them in a minute - if we take them off the
          table, we would not have gathered from the remarks of the
          distinguished Senator from Massachusetts that the Medicare system
          will still be broke.  They are completely different issues.
            If we do not fix the Medicare system, it will be short of funds,
          and cutting people`s taxes has nothing to do with that unless
          Members would like to raise taxes to pay for Medicare. I have not
          heard anybody say that.  But if we want to raise taxes, then we
          could talk about the program not having to be reduced in terms of
          cost.  Mr. President, that is the fact.
         <P>                                                           PAGE S10869
           <P> In addition, in the U.S. Senate, the sense of this Senate has
          been that if we ever get tax cuts, and when we do, that 90 percent
          of the tax cuts will go to people with income under $100,000. Now,
          there is a difference of opinion in this body on how that tax
          package will look when it comes out, if it comes out.
            Essentially, to continue to try to say, `Let`s don`t fix Medicare
          so it will be available 7 years from now,` instead of dying on its
          37th anniversary, go beyond the 37th, perhaps to 40 and beyond,
          instead of addressing that issue to talk about tax cuts for the
          rich does not help the senior citizens one single bit.
            What it does help, it helps to make a political issue out of a
          situation that S 10870 need not be politicized, for we actually
          ought to be joining hands across this aisle and with the President
          in fixing Medicare. I repeat, the tax cuts that are referred to in
          the Republican budget - take them out, and we still have to fix
          Medicare, because the money will not be there in 7 years.  That is
          for certain.
        <P>                                                            PAGE S10869
           <P> Having said that, Mr. President, let me repeat, there are some
          who would insist that we are making changes to Medicare for other
          reasons.  They may say we are changing it to balance the budget, or
          changing Medicare to lessen the tax burden on families.
            Both of these claims are false.  We are making changes in
          Medicare to save the program, to strengthen it so it can survive
          into the next century, and so Senators will be here well into the
          next century, able to congratulate the program and its founders on
          its anniversaries.
            Any attempt to link that with cutting taxes is to no avail for
          the seniors of this country.  Any attempt to link the two is, plain
          and simple, smoke and mirrors, from the opponents of reform.  For
          there are still some - and I do not know, perhaps my friend from
          Massachusetts is one - who would stand and say the status quo for
          Medicare is good enough for seniors.
  <P>                                                                  PAGE S10869
     <P>       Do not worry about it, leave it alone.  Now, the President said
          that in his first budget - `Leave it alone.` However, the President
          of the United States even came around, and in a 10-year proposal
          for a balanced budget, although it did not get there, even the
          President suggested that dramatic reform had to occur in the
          Medicare Program in an effort to keep it solvent.
            This was in June when the new budget was submitted, our new
          budget proposal.  The President claimed that would save Medicare;
          that budget made a good start.  His budget would save $127 billion
          from Medicare over the next 7 years - the same length of time as
          our budget.
            Now, some are comparing the $127 billion in his budget, and
          saying we do not need the $270 billion to fix the program in our
          budget.  I submit that the facts are our way.  The experts on
          budget come down on our side.
    <P>                                                                PAGE S10869
       <P>     We would like, very much, in the month of September, as part of a
          process up here, after hearings, meetings, input from senior
          groups, we would like to try our hand at reforming this.
            Mr. President, there are still some who leave the impression with
          senior citizens that we are truly cutting the Medicare Program. Let
          me straighten that out with some real facts.  First, we are going
          to slow the rate of growth of the program.  Medicare spending will
          grow at 6.4 percent a year under our plan.  To put it another way,
          and a more understandable way, over the next 7 years Medicare
          spending is going to increase from $4,800 per person to $6,700 per
          person - not down, up.  From $4,800 to $6,700.
            I know many are very concerned about the future and what kind of
          future they are going to leave their children and grandchildren.
          And I believe, when the time comes, that when the program of reform
          is put before the American people it will be seen as an effort to
          deliver the same kind of care in different ways, to get rid of the
          fraud and abuse in the program, and ultimately to provide our
          senior citizens with far more options.  They are operating under a
          program that is essentially 30 years old, and it is also that old
          in terms of what kind of a delivery system it is.  While all kinds
          of modern ways to deliver health care, all kinds of ways of
          insuring people, permitting a variety of options of insurance
          coverage now exist, Medicare is stuck in history.  It is a
          30-year-old system.
   <P>                                                                 PAGE S10869
     <P>       We believe reform will cause seniors to get a better deal.  There
          will be incentives built in which will make it easier, rather than
          more difficult, for seniors to purchase more of what they might
          want and less of what they might not want.  Yes, there will be
          options for them to keep the very system they have and their own
          doctors.
            So I want to just close by once again stating the caliber of the
          people who recommended that we ought to do something to fix this
          program - three of this President`s Cabinet Members: then-Secretary
          Bentsen of Treasury, Secretary Shalala, and Secretary Reich. They
          are trustees of this system.  And there were two public trustees,
          and they told us that we ought to fix the system.  They told us it
          will not be around in 7 years.  It will not have any money to pay
          the bills.
            In a way, they said - and I am interpreting this - it is costing
          too much.  Will you not take a look and see if you cannot do it
          better, cheaper, and protect not only the seniors who are using it
          now but seniors for a long time to come?
     <P>                                                               PAGE S10869
        <P>    As I said, this Sunday, July 30, is the 30th anniversary of
          Medicare. For 30 years, Medicare has provided health protection to
          elderly and disabled citizens.
            Medicare has been a successful program.  Medicare has provided an
          important source of health security and needed health benefits to
          millions of Americans since its inception 30 years ago.  Today, 37
          million Americans receive the benefits and health security that
          Medicare provides.
            But Medicare has also become an expensive program, and everyone -
          including the President - agrees that the system needs fundamental
          structural reform.
  <P>                                                                  PAGE S10869
     <P>       Medicare is running out of money.  Unless we make changes now,
          Medicare will not continue to provide this same level of health
          security in the future.
            Nevertheless, this past week, the President held a rally for
          Medicare. But all he talked about was the past.  The President
          forgot the most important element of an anniversary celebration.
          He forgot to look toward the future.  If the President fights the
          reforms necessary to save Medicare`s future, then in just 7 years,
          on the 37th anniversary of Medicare, the program will be bankrupt.
            In the President`s first budget, which he sent to us in February,
          Medicare would go bankrupt in 2002. Seven more years; that`s all
          the President would give Medicare. After that, there would be no
          money to pay Medicare hospital benefits.  The President would let
          you choose your doctor, but there would be no money to pay your
          hospital bills.
    <P>                                                                PAGE S10869
       <P>     The President`s original Medicare proposal was great - for the
          next 7 years.  But the 37th anniversary of Medicare would be its
          last.  Under the President`s original plan, if you`re on Medicare,
          you better not get sick 8 years from now.
            Back in January, the President did not listen to his own Cabinet
          Secretaries. Three of his Cabinet officers - Secretary Bentsen,
          Secretary Shalala, and Secretary Reich, are trustees of the
          Medicare system.  Along with the two public trustees, they told the
          President and the Congress that the Medicare hospital insurance
          trust fund had only enough money to pay benefits for the next 7
          years.
            The President chose to ignore that.  The Republicans in Congress
          did not.  We invited the public trustees up to Capitol Hill, to
          tell us what needs to be done.  We listened carefully, and now we
          are taking their advice.
   <P>                                                                 PAGE S10869
      <P>      Let me read from the summary of the trustees` report.  The full
          board of trustees say, `The Hospital Insurance Trust Fund * * *
          will be able to pay benefits for only about 7 years and is severely
          out of financial balance in the long range.
            The two public trustees tell us that:
    <P>                                                                PAGE S10870
       <P>     The most critical issues relate to the Medicare Program. Both the
          Hospital Insurance Trust Fund and the Supplementary Medical
          Insurance Trust Fund show alarming results. . . . The Medicare
          program is clearly unsustainable in its present form. . . . We feel
          strongly that comprehensive Medicare reforms should be undertaken
          to make this program financially sound now and over the long term.
          We strongly recommend that the crisis presented by the financial
          condition of the Medicare Trust Funds be urgently addressed on a
          comprehensive basis, including a review of the program`s financing
          methods, benefit provisions, and delivery mechanisms.
            This is what the public trustees of Medicare recommend we do to
          strengthen Medicare for the future.  And this is exactly what we
          are doing now.
    <P>                                                                PAGE S10870
       <P>     There are those who claim that we are making changes to Medicare
          for other reasons.  They say we are changing Medicare to balance
          the budget, or we are changing Medicare to lessen the tax burden on
          working families.
            Both of those claims are false.  We are making changes to
          Medicare to save the program, to strengthen Medicare so it can
          survive into the next century.  Even if we were not balancing the
          budget, we would need to save Medicare. And whether or not we cut
          taxes, we still need to save Medicare. Any attempt to link the two
          is nothing more S 10871 than blue smoke and mirrors from the
          opponents of reform.
            The Republicans in Congress have chosen to look toward Medicare`s
          future.  We decided this spring that we would save Medicare from
          bankruptcy, control the growth of program costs, and ensure that
          the program would survive past its 40th anniversary.  We developed
          and passed a budget plan in June that guaranteed a strong Medicare
          into the next century.
  <P>                                                                  PAGE S10870
     <P>       Suddenly, the President decided to join us.  In June, he
          submitted a new budget proposal, one which he claimed would save
          Medicare.
            In June, the President made a good start.  His budget would save
          $127 billion from Medicare over the next 7 years.  He is now
          comparing that with our budget, which will slow the program`s rate
          of growth by $270 billion over the next 7 years.
            If I believed that we could save Medicare by doing only what the
          President wants to do, I would do so in a second.  But, after a
          long, hard look at the numbers, and after extensive discussions
          with the Congressional Budget Office, I do not think the
          President`s plan saves Medicare.
        <P>                                                            PAGE S10870
           <P> You see, the President has assumed that the costs of the program
          will not grow as fast as projected by the nonpartisan Congressional
          Budget Office.
            The President`s June budget assumes that a serious Medicare
          problem does not exist.  He says the problem is not as hard to
          solve as CBO says it is.  The President is much more optimistic in
          his assumptions than CBO.
            I wish that were true, but I am afraid it is not.  As much as the
          President wishes it would, the problem will not go away.
   <P>                                                                 PAGE S10870
      <P>      The President has come a long way since his first budget in
          January. Now all he has to do is agree to use the honest,
          objective, and nonpartisan CBO numbers, and we will have an
          excellent starting point for discussions.
            All he has to do is live up to the commitment he made in his
          first State of the Union address, his promise that he would use CBO
          numbers.
            We in Congress use CBO numbers.  The honest, responsible way to
          budget is to rely on a single source for our assumptions, and that
          is what we did both in our budget plan, and in our plan to save
          Medicare. We did not make the problem go away by wishing that it
          would.  We asked CBO and the trustees what it would take to save
          Medicare, to keep it alive for its 40th anniversary.
   <P>                                                                 PAGE S10870
      <P>      The Trustees have told us what we must do.  Now we are going to
          do it.
            We are going to slow the rate of growth of the program.  Medicare
          spending will grow 6.4 percent per year under our plan.  Over the
          next 7 years, Medicare spending is going to increase from $4,800
          per person, to $6,700 per person.
            I know that older Americans are seriously concerned about the
          future they will leave to their children and their grandchildren.
          I have found that senior citizens are extremely concerned about the
          crushing burden of the debt that our current policies will place on
          their grandchildren.
  <P>                                                                  PAGE S10870
     <P>       And I know they want a Medicare program that is fair, both for
          them, and for future generations.  I also know that a 65-year old
          couple that starts receiving Medicare this year will, over their
          lifetimes, receive $117,000 more in Medicare benefits than they
          will put into the system in payroll taxes and premiums.
            I know that this will concern many seniors, who want Medicare to
          be there in the future for them, for their kids, and for their
          grandchildren.
            We are going to spend nearly 5 percent more per year on each
          Medicare beneficiary in this budget.  So anyone who tells you that
          we are cutting Medicare is just trying to scare you.
   <P>                                                                 PAGE S10870
      <P>      What honestly should scare America`s senior and disabled citizens
          is the prospect that we will do nothing.  For if we do nothing,
          seniors will have hospital benefits for only 7 more years.
            If we do nothing, seniors will be able to keep their doctor, but
          only for the next 7 years.  After that, you will still have your
          doctor, but he will not be able to treat you in a hospital.  After
          that, the hospital insurance trust fund will run out of money, and
          Medicare will not be able to pay hospital benefits.
            I want to make sure that our seniors can keep their existing
          coverage.
        <P>                                                            PAGE S10870
           <P> I want to give them the opportunity to choose other health plans,
          just like my colleagues and I in the Senate can choose our health
          plans.
            And most important, I want to make sure that they can do all
          these things for more than just the next 7 years.
            In September, we are going to report legislation that will
          strengthen Medicare. We are going to simplify Medicare. And we are
          going to make sure that every Medicare beneficiary has the right to
          choose their health plan, just like my fellow Senators and I have.
  <P>                                                                  PAGE S10870
     <P>       We need to strengthen Medicare, and that we have to do this by
          controlling the program`s rate of growth.  The first thing we are
          doing is attacking the waste and fraud in the system.  Every senior
          currently receiving Medicare knows that the system is inefficient,
          complex, and filled with opportunities for waste and fraud.  We are
          going after that money first.
            But all the experts tell us that will not be enough.  We are
          going to do it, but then we are going to have to look at changes to
          the program, in both the short and the long run.
            In the short run, we are going to look at how much we pay doctors
          and hospitals, and the way we pay doctors and hospitals for the
          services you receive.  We are going to try to create the right
          incentives so that doctors and hospitals are smart about how they
          spend your money.
  <P>                                                                  PAGE S10870
     <P>       Most importantly, we are going to offer seniors more choices.  As
          a U.S. Senator, I have the ability to choose my health plan once a
          year.  If I want a generous program with lots of benefits and no
          deductible, I pay a bit more.  In some areas of the country,
          Medicare already allows seniors these choices.
            We are going to expand this program, and gradually change the
          system so that all seniors have choices like we have in the Senate.
            Some seniors are going to have to pay a little bit more.  There
          is no way we can get around that.  But we are going to come to the
          seniors last, after we have attacked the waste and fraud in the
          system, after we have made changes to the way we pay doctors and
          hospitals, and after we have started to phase in changes that
          provide seniors with more choices.
       <P>                                                             PAGE S10870
          <P>  Any changes we make will be phased in gradually over time.  We
          know that seniors on fixed incomes have difficulty adjusting to
          dramatic changes, and we are taking that into account.
            We also know that some seniors with higher incomes have a greater
          ability to adapt to changes than others.  We may ask those seniors
          to pay a bit more, to compensate for those who have just enough
          income to get by.
            I will not let Medicare go bankrupt.  Yes, I too celebrate the
          30th anniversary of Medicare. It has been an important program,
          critical to the health of American`s older and disabled citizens.
  <P>                                                                  PAGE S10870
     <P>       But right now, I am thinking about how we are going to make sure
          Medicare has a 40th anniversary and beyond.

<h2>
UNA AGENDA PARA DESTRUIR A VENEZUELA
</h2>     
     
     
Jorge Olavarra*
<p>

CARACAS <a href="/townhall/columnists/spanbio.html">(AIPE)</a>.- En los dos primeros aos de la segunda presidencia de
Rafael Caldera se formularon siete planes econmicos de nombres llamativos,
presentados todos con una fanfarria publicitaria que prometa corregir el
dficit fiscal, estabilizar la moneda, reducir tanto la deuda interna como
la externa y abatir la inflacin.  En cada caso, se nos dijo que tras un
sacrificio inicial, la prosperidad y la bonanza estaban a la vuelta de la
esquina.
<dd>	En dos aos, el presidente Caldera ha acumulado el mayor dficit fiscal de
la historia venezolana, aumentado la deuda y producido las mayores y ms
brutales devaluaciones. Ahora sus ministros anuncian que tendremos que
sufrir una inflacin superior al 100%; le "cambiarn el perfil" a la deuda
externa, pero la seguirn aumentando para pagar con ms deuda los "programas
sociales". En la historia mundial de la planificacin no hay absurdo
semejante y en Venezuela no hay precedente para un fracaso de esta magnitud.
Como barco a la deriva en mar tormentoso, el gobierno de Caldera pasa de un
plan a otro. Sus objetivos se anuncian en cada caso con trompetas solemnes,
pero al poco tiempo los planes y objetivos se hunden en el olvido y nadie se
molesta en recordar las promesas ni contrastarlas con los resultados. No
hubo nunca una razn, una excusa o una explicacin. Simplemente, cada  Plan
se enterr en silencio y al poco tiempo se produjo... otro plan. El ltimo
es la "Agenda Venezuela". 
<dd>No podemos olvidar que seguimos gobernados por un presidente que en 1994 se
vio enfrentado a problemas econmicos que no entenda y que hoy sigue sin
entender. Por fuerza de sus errores y omisiones, el gobierno ha sido llevado
a hacer en 1996 lo que en 1993 Rafael Caldera dijo que jams hara. Y la
actual campaa publicitaria para vender la "Agenda Venezuela" es un insulto
a la inteligencia de los venezolanos, utilizando actores de la televisin
para mentirle al pas acerca de su presente y su futuro. 
<dd>Especialmente irritante es la publicidad que empieza afirmando que un pas
con $18 mil millones en ingresos anuales no es pobre y termina diciendo que
no es cobarde el pas que libert a medio continente. Es inslito que un
gobierno que ha tenido que acudir de rodillas ante el prestamista
internacional de ltima instancia, porque no puede pagar lo que debe, alegue
por boca de un actor en un mensaje pagado que no es pobre porque recibe una
enorme renta petrolera. La verdad de la magnitud de su ingreso petrolero es
precisamente lo que incrimina al presidente Caldera como incompetente para
administrarla. Hacer una propaganda falsa para generar un optimismo
mentiroso contradice los sacrificios que sus ministros anuncian. Apelar a
una emocin patritica es comparar nuestro lamentable presente con nuestro
pasado heroico. 
<dd>Slo un gobierno encerrado en el laberinto de su soledad es capaz de hacer
una campaa publicitaria que implcitamente presenta el ltimo plan de
poltica econmica como genial correctivo de los errores del mismo gobierno. 
Si en vez de los cmicos locutores y actores contratados se hicieran
anuncios con los ex ministros y dems responsables del caos, quiz los
venezolanos empezaran a creer en la Agenda Venezuela. Pues slo la
sumatoria de tales talentos sera capaz de explicar cmo es bueno y porqu
est en buen camino un plan econmico que le exprime a una economa
deprimida los recursos que necesita para volcarlos en mantener un aparato
burocrtico parasitario, estril, inepto y corrupto. Slo ellos son capaces
de explicar la maravilla de devaluar la moneda para producir una "utilidad
cambiaria", con la cual nivelar este ao el dficit fiscal y, al mismo
tiempo, garantizar que el ao entrante se lograr acabar con la inflacin. 
Ahora bien, cuando la "Agenda Venezuela" desemboque en inevitable
catstrofe, que no  vengan a decirnos que su fracaso se debi a las voces
agoreras, a los profetas del desastre que sembraron rumores y minaron la
confianza.
<dd>El "caso Venezuela" es la madre de todas las paradojas. La ms importante es
que la economa venezolana ha logrado acopiar todos los vicios y pecados del
capitalismo sin obtener ninguna de sus ventajas, al igual que todos los
vicios y pecados del estatismo socializante sin  ninguno de sus logros. Como
lo han constatado los economistas extranjeros, las reformas tropiezan con
problemas similares a los que enfrentan los pases del ex bloque sovitico.
Aquella parte de su economa que podra llamarse "privada" o "capitalista"
tiene la moral flaca y los msculos fofos por proteccionismos, subsidios y
toda clase de malos hbitos que no la recomiendan para competir exitosamente
fuera de su invernadero, dentro del cual actan con un mercado insincero e
imperfecto que anula las ventajas del capitalismo, mientras exagera sus
defectos. La economa privada venezolana es un muestrario vivo de los peores
vicios del mercantilismo inmoral y del socialismo inepto.
Winston Churchill deca que el vicio inherente del capitalismo es el reparto
desigual de la riqueza que genera y el vicio inherente del socialismo es el
reparto igualitario de la miseria que produce. Los venezolanos hemos logrado
llevar el defecto corregible del capitalismo a extremos obscenos y el vicio
del socialismo a magnitudes monstruosas. &copy;

<center><h4>The GOP Plan to Save Medicare -- The Time Is Now</h4></center>
<hr>
The GOP Medicare Preservation Act provides that:<br>
<ul>
<li>The traditional form of fee-for-service Medicare will continue to be an option for all beneficiaries -- no senior will be forced to give up his or her current Medicare coverage.<p>
<li>Total Medicare spending will increase by 54 percent over the next seven years.  Average spending per senior will increase 40 percent from today's $4,800 to more that $6,700 in 2002.<p>
<li>Seniors will have the right to choose from several health care plans similar to those available to other Americans in the private sector.
<ul>
<P>
The GOP reforms must be enacted now.  If not, the Part A trust fund will be bankrupt in 2002--just seven years from now.<p>
The GOP has the only plan to save Medicare<p>

<P>Being Truly Compassionate requires replacing the Welfare State
with an Opportunity Society</P>

<P>The Welfare State has failed:</P>

<UL>
<LI>It is a failed model of delivering goods and services to help
people. It actually hurts the poor.
<LI>Its failure is reflected by the violence, brutality, child
abuse and drug addiction in every local TV news broadcast.
<LI>The culture of violence increasingly permeates our
entertainment and denigrates our civilization.
<LI>The non-working, non-productive part of our society is a
factor in the deficit and declining American competitiveness in
the world market.
</UL>
 

<H2>The Human Cost of the Welfare State</H2>

<P>Poor Americans are:</P>

<UL>
<LI>Trapped in unsafe housing
<LI>Maintained in unsafe neighborhoods
<LI>Saddled with rules that are anti-work, anti-family, and
anti-property
<LI>Forced to have their children attend public monopolies that
cost a lot but accomplish little
</UL>

<strong>In the name of compassion we have funded a system that is
cruel and destroys families</strong>

<H2>A Failed Welfare State</H2>
<UL>
<LI>Welfare spending now exceeds $ 305 billion per year, for a
total
of $5 trillion since 1965 - more than the cost of winning WWII.

<LI>This  $305 billion is roughly 3 times the amount needed to
raise all poor Americans above the poverty line.
<LI>Since 1970, the number of children in poverty has increased
40%.
<LI>Since 1965, the juvenile arrest rate for violent crimes has
tripled.
<LI>Since 1960, the number of unmarried pregnant teens has nearly
doubled and teen suicide has more than tripled.
</UL>

<H3>As welfare spending has grown, so has illegitimacy:</H3>

<H3>As education spending has Risen, SAT scores have fallen</H3>

<img src= "http://www.house.gov/gop/page25.gif" alt="[Chart 
Illustrating Education Spending and SAT Scores]">

<P>The failure of the welfare state strikes at the heart of the
American belief that every citizen is endowed by our Creator with
certain inalienable rights, among which are life, liberty and the
pursuit of happiness.</P>

<P>No civilization can survive with:</P>

<UL>
<LI>12-year-olds having babies, 15-year-olds killing each other,
17-year-olds dying of AIDS, and 18-year-olds receiving diplomas
they can't read
<LI>Furthermore, no civilization can survive with parents and
grandparents cheating their children by refusing to balance the
budget and live within their means
</UL>

<strong>The Welfare State cheats the poor; the unbalanced budget
cheats every child.</strong>


<H3>The legacy we're leaving to our children: Moral and Fiscal
Bankruptcy</H3>

<P>Our program for a better American future begins with replacing
the welfare state with an opportunity society.   A cheaper
welfare state is an inadequate response.</P>



<H3>Transforming the Welfare State into an Opportunity Society
for the Poor requires:</H3>

<title>Phil Gramm Floor Speech to the Senate</title>

<h2>Phil Gramm Speech to the Senate</h2><p>			
<h3>104th Congress 1st Session</h3>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Mr. GRAMM. Mr. President, this week and next week, we are going to come
down to the moment of truth on two issues. One issue has to do with putting
the Federal Government on a budget like everybody else. The other issue has
to do with fulfilling the Contract With America to let working people keep
more of what they earn. I would like to briefly address both of these subjects.<p>
In the 1994 election, in one of the most remarkable political occurrences
in the postwar period, House Republicans did something that is very unusual
in the political process and that is they set out in plain English what they
promised America they would do if the American people gave them a majority
in the House of Representatives for the first time in 40 years.<p>
I would add that while many people have forgotten it, Republican
candidates for the Senate put out a joint statement where virtually every
Republican challenger for the U.S. Senate in the country came to Washington
and released a ''Seven More In '94'' document, where we outlined seven
things we would do if the American people gave us a majority.<p>
   Two of those promised items had to do with balancing the budget and with
letting working people keep more of what they earned. The House of
Representatives has done something even more remarkable than making all these
promises-they have actually done it. The House of Representatives has adopted
the Contract With America. They have adopted 90 percent of the things they
promised to simply vote on. And at the best universities in the land, you
would grade that as an ''A.''<p>
   We are now down to the moment of truth in the U.S. Senate and that moment
of truth basically has to do with whether or not we are going to pass the
Contract With America and whether we can make the tough decisions necessary
in order to do that. To balance the Federal budget over a 7-year period and
at the same time to accommodate the tax cut contained in the Contract With
America will require us, over a 7-year period, to limit the growth in
Federal spending to approximately 3 percent a year.<p>
   Over the last 40 years, Federal spending has grown at 2-1/2 times the
growth of family budgets in America. Over the last 40 years, the Federal
Government has increased its spending 2-1/2 times as fast as the average
family in America has been able to increase its spending. Now what would
America look like if those trends had been reversed? Well, if the average
family in America had seen its budget grow as fast as the Government has
grown for the last 40 years, and the Government's budget had grown only as
fast as the family budget has grown over the last 40 years, the average
family in America today would be earning $ 128,000 a year and the Government
would be approximately one-third its current size.<p>
   I ask my colleagues, if you could choose between the America where the
governments budget grew faster or an America where the family's budget grew
faster-put me down as one who would favor having the average family in
America make $ 128,000 a year and have the Federal Government one-third its
size.<p>
   Here is our dilemma. We have some of our colleagues who say, ''I did not
sign any Contract With America. That was the House of Representatives.'' As
I am fond of saying in our private meetings, that is a subtlety that is lost
on the American people. They do not see this contract as having been a
contract between just the House and the American people. They see it as a
Republican contract. And, quite frankly, it is a Republican contract. It
embodies everything that our party claims to stand for.<p>
   But what I think is important for the Senate is not just that Republican
candidates signed the contract, not just that every House Republican
incumbent who signed the contract was reelected but I think what is
significant to us is that the American people signed that contract when they
gave us a majority in both Houses of Congress for the first time in 40 years.<p>
   The question that we are going to have to answer in the next 3 weeks is,
are we willing to limit the growth of Government spending to 2-1/2 percent a
year so that we can, over a 7-year period, balance the Federal budget and so
that we can let working families keep more of what they earn? I believe that
we can and I believe that we should. I think there are many Republicans in
the Senate who sort of have a problem, in that they have one foot firmly
implanted in the dramatic changes in Government policy that we promised the
American people in 1994, and they have the other foot firmly implanted in the
status quo. And, as those two things have moved further apart, we have had
the predictable result.<p>
   I think it is time for us to choose. I believe in the next 3 weeks we are
going to basically decide whether or not we meant it in November of 1994
when we told the American people that we were going to dramatically change
the way Government does its business. I think the American people are
convinced that we can limit the growth of Government spending to 2-1/2
percent a year so that we can let families and businesses spend more of what
they earn.<p>
   I know if the President were here, he would say this is a debate about
how much money we are spending on our children; or how much money we are
spending on education; or how much money we are spending on housing or
nutrition.<p>
   But that is not what the debate is about. Everybody in America wants to
spend money on children, housing, education, and nutrition. The debate we
are about to have is not how much money is going to be spent on those
things, but who is going to do the spending. Bill Clinton and the Democrats
want Government to go on doing the spending. They want Government spending
to continue to grow 2-1/2 times as fast as the family budget grows.<p>
   I want to put the Federal Government on a diet. I want to slow down the
rate of growth in Government spending so that we can let working families
keep more of their own money to invest in their own children, in their own
businesses, and in their own future.<p>
   This is not a debate about how much money we spend on the things that all
Americans believe we should spend money on. It is a debate about who ought
to do the spending. Bill Clinton and the Democrats want the Government to do
the spending. We want the family to do the spending. We know the Government,
and we know the family. And we know the difference.<p>
   Since we are investing in the future of America, I want to invest the
future of America in our families and not in our Government.<p>
   I know that there is a lot of anguish in the Senate, even on our side of
the aisle. But I think it is time to choose. I wanted my colleagues to know
that I am for a budget that does two things: No. 1, over a 7-year period,
limit the growth of Federal spending to about 3 percent a year so we can
balance the budget in 7 years and let our colleagues do something that no
current Member of the Senate, save two, has ever done before; that is, vote
for a real honest-to-God balanced budget. We literally have the power, by
having a 7-year binding budget, to let Members of the Senate vote to stop
talking about balancing the budget and to start doing it.<p>
   Second, in addition to the controls on spending necessary to balance the
budget, I want to limit the growth of spending not to 3 percent a year, but
to 2-1/2 percent a year so that we can let families keep more of what they
earn, so that we can cut the capital gains tax rate, so that we can
eliminate the marriage penalty, so that we can let families have a $ 500 tax
credit per child, so that, rather than having our Government spend our money
for us, we can let working people spend their own money on their own
children and on their own future.<p>
   As we look at this in perspective, let me give you three numbers. In
1950, the average family in America with two little children sent $ 1 out of
every $ 50 it earned to Washington, DC, and thought it was too much. And it
probably was. Today, that family is sending $ 1 out of every $ 4 it earns to
Washington, DC, and if the Congress did not meet again for the next 20 years
some people would applaud that prospect, but only because they do not
understand our problems. If Congress did not meet again for the next 20 years
and we did not start a single new program nor repeal any existing program, to
pay for the Government that we have already committed to is going to require
that in 20 years $ 1 out of every $ 3 earned by the average family in America
with two children come to Washington, DC, to pay for the Government.<p>
   We are going to have to institute dramatic changes in spending simply to
keep things the way they are. If we are to let working families keep more of
what they earn, we are going to have to institute a dramatic change in
Government policy. Mr. President, I am in favor of a dramatic change in
Government policy. If our Budget Committee does not offer and adopt a budget
that balances the budget and that provides for tax cuts for families and for
job creation, I intend to offer a substitute for that budget. I think we
have to stop cutting deals with America's future. I think we have to stand
up and tell the American people we meant it in November 1994 when we said
you give us a Republican majority in both Houses of Congress and we will
change the policy of American Government.<p>
I think we are now down to a moment of truth. Are we going to fulfill the
commitment we made in that election, or are we basically going to defend the
status quo? The status quo means less opportunity, future jobs, and an
America that is not the America that I want my children and my grandchildren
to have. I am ready to change the status quo. I am ready to cut the growth
in Government spending, not just to balance the budget, but to cut taxes.
And what I want my colleagues to know today is I want to work with the
Budget Committee, I want to work with our leadership. I am hopeful that we
can put together as a party position a budget that balances the budget over
a 7-year period and that mandates tax cuts contained in the contract. But,
if our leadership is not ready to bring that budget forward, if they cannot
muster the courage to control Government spending to make it possible, I
will muster that courage, and will offer a substitute and give my colleagues
the opportunity to join me, and to join America in that process.<p>
   Finally, let me say, Mr. President, I simply want to remind my colleagues
that the Contract With America was in fact signed by House Members, but
there are two additional points. First, it was not distinctly different from
the ''Seven More in '94'' contract that our candidates agreed to here on the
north front of the Capitol. Second, the important part of that contract is
not the fact that the House signed it. The important part of that contract
is that America signed it. The important part of that contract is it was the
document that defined what the 1994 election was all about.<p>
   The question now, the question that will be before us for the next 3
weeks is, Did we simply want to be for dramatic changes in Government at
election time, or are we willing to put our votes where our mouth is? Are we
really more wedded to funding for programs such as public television, or are
we more wedded to letting working people keep more of what they earn? Do we
really believe that Government knows best and that we need not only a $ 1.6
trillion Federal budget but that we need it to grow by 7.5 percent a year
while the family budget is growing at less than half that rate?<p>
   I think that is the decision. I think the answer of every Republican in
the Senate ought to be clear. And that answer ought to be we can change the
status quo, we can limit the growth of Government spending, we can terminate
programs, and we can and will not only balance the budget but let working
families keep more of what they earn to invest in their own children, in
their own businesses and their own future, and that we ought to cut taxes on
American business to provide incentives for people to work, save, and
invest. That is what I am for. I believe that is what America is for.<p>
   I thank the Chair.<p>
I yield the floor.<p>

                        THE WELFARE SYSTEM<P></CENTER>
        Mr. ASHCROFT. Mr. President, today we embark upon a most
          important responsibility, a responsibility that the people of this
          country called upon us to undertake in the elections of 1994. I
          must say that I believe the people have been yearning that Congress
          confront this challenge forthrightly and productively for years.
          But I believe that the Congress has finally gotten the message, and
          we have been working very hard to change the welfare system - to
          change it from a system for keeping the poor and maintaining the
          poor.  And, unfortunately, that is what we have done.  We have
          maintained them and kept them poor through a system that should
          have become a transitional system, a system that would help people
          move from poverty to prosperity, move from welfare to work.  And it
          is an important responsibility which we have.
            The welfare system in the United States has been a system of
          failure.  It has not been that the people have failed so much as
          the system has failed.  We started out with an aggressive program
          in the 1960`s to launch a war on poverty.  And yet, in spite of the
          great war on poverty, spending over $5 trillion, we have more
          people in poverty now than we did when we started the war on
          poverty.  We have a greater percentage of the children of America
          on poverty than we did when we started the war on poverty.
            It occurs to me that we have a great responsibility to change
          this system - to change it profoundly so that, instead of a system
          which ends up trapping people in lives of poverty, we make this a
          transitional system; that, when people really need help, we move
          them from the desperation of needing help to the opportunity of
          work and responsibility.
                          <p><center>     PAGE S13749</center><p>
            So this national system which has become a national disgrace is
          the topic now of national debate, and it should be the topic of
          action in the Senate today.
            As you and I well know, and as our colleagues here in the Senate
          well know, the House has already acted forthrightly in this
          respect.  There are differences between what the House has passed
          and what those of us in the Senate have been working on.  But we
          can find a way to reconcile our differences, and I believe we can
          give to the President of the United States, who has said that he
          wants to end welfare as we know it, a constructive bill. S 13750
            During the past several weeks we have debated this measure, and
          we have properly spent substantial time on it because this is no
          small item.  It does not just deal with the billions and billions
          of dollars.  The welfare problem, the welfare challenge, deals with
          much money.  It deals with the great set of natural and national
          resources - not just financial but human resources.
    <p><center>     PAGE S13749
  </center><p>          The fact of the matter is that the United States of America can
          ill afford to compete on the international scene, can ill afford to
          be a part of the challenge for productivity as one nation will seek
          to do and do better than another nation, if we have so many of our
          players that are not really on the field.  We would not think of
          sending our team out to play another team for a Saturday or Sunday
          afternoon football game with half of our team not taking the field,
          not being capable of participating, and being ruled out of the
          system.  Well, our team is a big team, and it is a strong team.  It
          is a capable team in the United States. But we have too many that
          have been consigned to bench duty without any possibility of making
          it to the field.  And we will not win in the competition of the
          international arena unless we find a way to bring people into
          productivity and out of poverty.
            So the real challenge we face is changing the system, and
          changing it not just by tinkering around the edges.  No
          rearrangement of the deck chairs on the welfare Titanic will get
          the job done.  We need to have the kind of profound changes that
          will move people out of despair into industry, and out of
          hopelessness into opportunity.
            So we will vote on a clear question today, and that is whether we
          will continue to fund the horror that came to define the United
          States welfare system and which came to detail the lives of
          individuals trapped in this system.  Whether we have the courage to
          change that or not will be the real vote which we make today.  I
          believe we have the courage to do that which is right, and I
          believe we will do so.  And I believe we ought to do so.
  <p><center>   PAGE S13749</center>
     <p>       I would say that this is not an ideal welfare bill.  This is not
          something that is in my judgment the best that could be done.
          There are probably changes that almost every Member of this Chamber
          would make in the bill.  I believe that the right thing to do would
          have been far broader, not just block granting AFDC with an option
          to block grant food stamps.  In my judgment we should have had
          AFDC, food stamps, Medicaid and Supplemental Security Income. The
          big four of welfare should all have been in this bill, all reformed
          at the same time for a variety of reasons, such as stopping the
          insanity of entitlement spending.  We should avoid cost shifting
          that would take people out of one program in which we removed the
          entitlement status and shove them over into another program which
          has remained as an entitlement.  That kind of cost shifting should
          not be allowed.  It should be avoided.
            I would have preferred a more comprehensive bill.  Obviously, I
          would have preferred one where the block grant for food stamps was
          mandated.  I would have preferred one where we had Supplemental
          Security Income. I would have preferred a bill that would have had
          a more significant breadth, that had Medicaid in it as well.  But
          we are making some first steps, and they are important first steps.
            One of the important first steps is the reduction in bureaucracy
          here; the reduction in the redtape, the reduction in this
          micromanagement, this intermeddling micromanagement from the
          Federal Government which makes it very difficult for the States to
          adopt policies that will really make a difference and makes it very
          expensive when you have to comply with hundreds of pages of Federal
          bureaucratic redtape.  It is expensive.  Instead of money getting
          to the truly needy, instead of the resource making it to the
          population that wants to move from welfare to work, sometimes the
          resource gets clogged in the bottleneck of the bureaucracy and the
          money is spent there instead of being spent on the poor.  We are
          going to reduce the number of regulatory impositions from
          Washington substantially.  This bill will improve our ability to
          deliver the real kind of help that people need.  That is important
          - maximum State flexibility.
    <p><center> PAGE S13749<p></center>
            Second, I believe it is important that we will end an
          entitlement.  This philosophy that we do not care how much it
          costs, that as many people as can meet certain criteria are just
          entitled to self-appropriate to themselves - that has to stop.  It
          is a major thing.  First, reduce the bureaucracy; second, end
          entitlement; third, we are going to require work far more
          pervasively than ever before.
            The American people have told us with a clarity that is
          unmistakable.  We must require work, and, of course, provide the
          flexibility so that people can do in the various States and
          communities of this country what works there, not what somebody in
          Washington wants to impose, but to do simply what works.
            This bill makes a statement that Washington does not have all the
          answers.  We are now looking to the communities and the States to
          do what works there, to tailor programs, and to be experimental
          stations to say we will try this, and, if it works here, others
          might want to try it.  But it should not be imposed on them because
          people should have an opportunity to do what works to move people
          from poverty to productivity.  Washington, it may be said, has been
          the mad scientist seeking to impose its will.  But the truth of the
          matter is we need to provide an opportunity for States to do that
          which works.
   <center><p> PAGE S13749<p></center>
            Well, this bill comes with an explicit admonition as well.  This
          bill recognizes that Government alone will not solve these
          problems.  And I think that it is important for us to express
          nationally and as a part of policy that we really expect charitable
          and nongovernmental institutions in this culture to rally to
          address this problem, and not expect the problem to be solved fully
          by Government.
            So we have in this bill a specific invitation to private
          charities, nongovernmental entities, even faith-based organizations
          to participate in the solution of this serious challenge to the
          success of this society in the next century.  And I believe that is
          a major step forward.
            We have an opportunity.  We have an opportunity to do something
          that is substantially in the best interests of the people of this
          country, something they have yearned for us to do.  That is to
          change a welfare system which is badly broken, which has been the
          keeper of the poor and has kept people poor, which has managed to
          find more people in poverty after its great effort than less people
          in poverty.
  <center><p>   PAGE S13749<p></center>
            The war on poverty has resulted in the children of America being
          taken as prisoners.  We have to do something, and we have to do it
          well.
            As I previously stated, this welfare reform bill is not perfect,
          but it does take the first steps.  The lack of perfection in this
          bill, the absence of a mandate that the Food Stamp Program be sent
          to all the States, the lack of reforms to the SSI Program in the
          bill, are some of a number of things which keep it from being
          perfect but should not keep it from being passed.
            This bill gives us the opportunity to say, `Let us pass this
          bill, but let the imperfections drive us to keep our focus and in
          the next year to continue to improve and extend it.`
      <center><p> PAGE S13749<p></center>
            There has been a lot of talk in the last few weeks during the
          welfare reform debate about money and about resources.  We know how
          desperately important it is for us to balance the budget, but the
          ultimate importance of this bill is not money.  The savings we are
          talking about are the savings in lives and opportunities and,
          through those savings, the future of America. Our task in this
          welfare reform measure is then to save the lives and opportunities
          of citizens.  To pass this welfare reform bill today would be a
          real step toward saving lives, and we must support it and must be
          driven by its imperfections to do even more when we reconvene next
          year.

<title>A Primer on Continuing Resolutions and the Ceiling on the Public Debt</title>

<h3><center> A Primer on Continuing Resolutions and the Ceiling on the Public Debt</h3><br><br>

 September 8, 1995<br><br></center><hr>

<center> INTRODUCTION</center><p>

Two-distinct and separate budgetary events that could affect government 
activities and operations face Congress and the White House this fall. 
This primer is intended to explain the basic principles surrounding these 
events, and to answer basic questions Members have raised. The two 
events discussed are the following:<p><ul>

<li><b>The Potential Need for a Continuing Resolution</b>. A continuing resolution 
would be needed to cover any appropriations bills that have not been 
signed by the President by October 1, the beginning of fiscal year 1996. 
If, in that situation, the President also refused to sign a continuing 
resolution, the result would be a "shutdown" of non-essential government 
activities in those agencies whose appropriations bills have not been 
signed. If the President were to veto all 13 appropriations bills, then the 
"shutdown" would affect all government agencies. Although such a 
shutdown would not halt "essential" activities -- those concerning public 
health and safety and the protection of property--the suspension of other 
functions could affect substantial numbers of employees in various 
agencies.<p>

<li><b>Whether to Raise the Public Debt Ceiling</b>. As the name implies, this 
ceiling limits how much the government can borrow to maintain cash 
flow and finance the deficit. The current ceiling is expected to be reached 
in mid-October, although various actions by the Treasury could delay any 
effects until mid-November. Without an increase in the debt limit at that 
point, the Federal Government will be unable to borrow the money it 
needs to meet obligations for which there is no cash on hand on any 
given day. Although the need to raise the debt ceiling has been
driven by the past pattern of deficit spending, the effect of restricting 
government borrowing authority when the current debt limit is reached 
would fall largely on government cash flow: It could complicate the 
government's ability to meet its financial obligations in a timely manner. 
Prolonging the situation could intensify the problem.<p></ul>

It is important to bear in mind that a continuing resolution and the public 
debt ceiling are <i>two distinct budgetary issues</i>. The fact that they could 
occur within weeks of each other is purely coincidence. Furthermore, the 
possible consequences of an impasse are different in each case:<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Continuing resolutions</b> concern potential lapses of authority to spend 
money for <i>discretionary</i> programs. (Discretionary programs are those 
funded annually through appropriations bills, as distinct from entitlement 
programs, which are not affected by the passage of or delay in 
appropriations bills or continuing resolutions.) As noted above, a 
deadlock over a continuing resolution could lead to a temporary 
"shutdown" of non-essential government activities.<p>

<li>The <b>debt ceiling</b> concerns cash flow and the authority to borrow and 
disperse funds in a timely manner. A stalemate over the debt limit would 
not necessarily suspend government activities -- at least not in the short 
term --but it would complicate the government's ability to meet its 
obligations in a timely manner. Taken to its extreme the situation could 
lead the government to defaulting on its obligations, although this has 
never happened.<p></ul>

Differences between Congress and the President over slowing the growth 
of spending, cutting taxes, and balancing the budget is creating what 
some call a budgetary "train wreck" over one or both of these events --
especially the first. Such rhetoric exaggerates the possible consequences. 
Still, the issues are likely to demand challenging policy choices.<p>

[Please note: The paper focuses on continuing resolutions and the debt 
ceiling because these are the two areas in which government operations 
could be affected. Government activities would not be affected if the 
President refused to sign this fall's other key legislative measure, 
<i>reconciliation</i>. Reconciliation is required to conform tax law and 
entitlement spending (such as Medicare, Medicaid, welfare, and so on) 
with the directives of the Congressional budget resolution. A failure to 
enact reconciliation legislation would create its own problems but 
funding for these programs would continue as provided under existing 
law because their appropriation is permanent. Nevertheless, a 
reconciliation bill could be used as a vehicle for debt ceiling legislation or 
even--though less likely--for appropriations legislation.]<p>

 <h4><center>I. POTENTIAL NEED FOR A CONTINUING RESOLUTION</h4></center><p>

Since 1977, there have been 56 continuing resolutions, most of them 
covering relatively short periods, such as several days or weeks. Some 
covered an entire year for certain programs (such as those usually funded 
through the Foreign Operations appropriations). Such temporary, stopgap 
legislation is required to cover any appropriations that the President 
refuses to sign by the time the fiscal year begins.<p>

<h4><center>A. Timing and Procedural Issues

</center></h4><p>
If one or more continuing resolutions are required this year, the first 
occasion for one will be Sunday, October 1, the start of the 1996 fiscal 
year. This also will be the first critical juncture of this fall's budget 
events.<p>

Under-normal circumstances, the government's discretionary (non-
entitlement) spending is subject to the passage, each year, of 13 separate 
appropriations bills. These are the spending bills that the House has been 
considering this summer. A continuing resolution is needed to fund any 
discretionary programs whose appropriations the President has refused to 
sign by the time the new fiscal year starts on October 1.<p>

<h4>Q: Why is it possible a continuing resolution will be needed this year?</h4><p><ul>

<li>Because it is unlikely that the President will have signed all the 
appropriations bills needed to fund discretionary spending for fiscal year 
1996 by the time the new fiscal year starts on October 1. The continuing 
resolution procedure is intended precisely for such situations -- to provide 
stopgap funding so that government functions can continue.<p>

<li>House and Senate leaders are striving to complete all the 1996 
appropriations bills by October 1, the beginning of the fiscal year. But the 
Administration has stated its disagreement with all of the bills --concerns 
that could lead to presidential vetoes. Should the President veto any or all 
of the appropriations, the House and Senate likely would send him a 
continuing resolution.
</ul>
 <h4>Q: Would the need for a continuing resolution be unusual?
</h4><ul><p>
<li>No. As noted above, there have been 56 continuing resolutions since 
1977, or about three a year on average. Some occurred because Congress 
did not complete appropriations actions by October 1. Others came about 
because of policy differences between Congress and the White House. 
Continuing resolutions exist  precisely so that government activities can 
continue in these situations. The table below shows the history of continuing resolutions.<p>

<h4>Q: Where do the President and Congress disagree on appropriations bills?</h4><p>
<ul>
<li>The Administration has expressed its disagreement with every 
appropriations bill under consideration by Congress. For example, the 
President has promised to veto the House-passed Labor-HHS 
appropriations bill because of cuts in the Head Start program, the 
termination of funding for Goals 2000, the elimination of the Summer 
Youth Employment program, language allowing states to restrict abortion 
funding, and language preventing organizations from using Federal funds 
for political advocacy. The Secretary of Commerce has recommended 
that the President veto the Commerce-State-Justice appropriations bill 
because of terminations of duplicative programs in his department. The 
VA-HUD bill is threatened with a veto because of legislative limitations 
on enforcement activities at the Environmental Protection Agency and 
major program funding reductions at EPA and the Department of 
Housing and Urban Development, and cuts in the Corporation for 
National and Community Service programs.</ul>

<h4>Q: What funding levels would be contained in a continuing resolution?</h4><ul>

<li>There are several alternatives. Traditionally, a continuing resolution 
assumes the lowest of the current year's level, the new House-approved 
level, or the new Senate-approved level. But Congress can specify any 
level and any mix.<p></ul>

<h4>Q: How long does a continuing resolution last?</h4><ul><p>

<li>The resolution's duration is specified in the legislation. Typically, 
continuing resolutions are drafted to cover a number of weeks, or even 
days, depending on how much time is expected to elapse before the 
President signs the regular appropriations bills. The resolution can be 
written to cover an entire fiscal year.<p></ul>

<h4>Q: If a continuing resolution is written to cover less than a full year, how 
are funding levels determined?</h4><p><ul>

<li>The resolution provides authority to spend at an annual rate. The 
President, through the Director of the Office of Management and Budget, 
"apportions" the funds to assure that agencies do not spend too rapidly.
</ul><p>
<h4>Q: What level of spending is allowed by apportionments?</h4><p><ul>

<li>Normally, the apportionments are made on a pro-rata basis. In other 
words, if the continuing resolution is effective for 12 percent of the year, 
then the apportionment is 12 percent of a program's annual appropriation. 
Different patterns of apportionments may be used where necessary. For 
example, if an agency needs to obligate more than a pro-rata amount, a 
larger apportionment can be provided by the Office of Management and 
Budget</ul><p>

<h4>Q: Can new programs be started under a continuing resolution?</h4><p><ul>

<li>No, unless funds are expressly provided in the resolution. For example, if 
an activity is included in the Senate appropriations bill, but the House-
passed appropriation is used as the basis for the continuing resolution, 
then the activity cannot be initiated under the continuing resolution. If, 
however, the continuing resolution expressly provides for the new 
activity, then the activity can be initiated. In the past, some continuing 
resolutions have contained language expressly prohibiting new projects 
or activities.</ul><p>

<h4>Q: Can existing discretionary programs be expanded?</h4><p><ul>

<li>No. Existing programs may be continued only at rates allowed under the 
continuing resolution.</ul><p>

<h4>Q: If an existing program or activity is proposed for termination, can it be 
funded under a continuing resolution?</h4><p><ul>

<li>If the program or activity is not terminated through specific language or 
implication in the continuing resolution, then it can be continued at a 
minimal level.</ul><p>

<center><h4>B. Effects of an Impasse: a Possible Government "Shutdown"</h4><p></center>

In the absence of regular appropriations or a continuing resolution, the 
government faces what is known as a "funding gap," in which the 
government lacks appropriations for discretionary programs that are 
funded annually. This condition is known as a government "shutdown," 
although the term exaggerates the extent to which government activities 
are suspended.</ul><p>

<h4>Q: When could a government shutdown occur this year?</h4><p><ul>

<li>As noted above, this would occur on October 1 if a discretionary 
"funding gap" occurred. This gap would come about if the President 
refused to sign any of the appropriations bills for fiscal year 1996 and 
also refused to sign a continuing resolution sent to him by the Congress. 
Technically, the government at that point would have no authority to 
obligate or spend funds on programs subject to annual appropriations. 
The government would have to suspend certain activities funded through 
annual appropriations, or delay payments for those that continue.</ul><p>

<h4>Q: What if some appropriations bills are signed but others are not?</h4><p><ul>

<li>The general practice has been that the continuing resolution covers the 
appropriations bills that have not been signed.</ul><p>

<h4>Q: Don't the activities of some Executive Branch agencies continue even 
during a "shutdown?"</h4><p><ul>

<li>Yes. Entitlement programs operating under permanent appropriations 
would continue, as would activities deemed by the President to be 
essential for health, safety, and the protection of property. Also, programs 
needed for the President to discharge his Constitutionally enumerated 
powers would continue.</ul><p>

<h4>Q: Which programs could continue even if they fail to receive 
appropriations?</h4><p><ul>

<li>Ultimately, it's the Administration's decision but based on criteria set out 
in the following:<p><ul>

<li><b>The Anti-Deficiency Act</b>. This 1870 law is the principal legislation 
governing this area. The act forbids any officer or employee of the United 
States to "involve the Government in any contract or other obligation, for 
the payment of money for any purpose, in advance of appropriations 
made for such purpose, unless such contract or obligation is authorized 
by law." It also prohibits the government from accepting voluntary 
services exceeding those authorized by law. (In other words, non-
essential government employees cannot "volunteer" to work without 
pay.)<p>

It should be noted that the Anti-Deficiency Act was designed to prevent 
government officials from incurring unauthorized obligations beyond 
what Congress intended to spend. Only in recent years have 
interpretations of the Act been used to address the consequences of lapses 
in spending authority.<p></ul>
<ul>
<li><b>The so-called "Civiletti Memos</b>." In 1980 and 1981, then Attorney 
General Benjamin R. Civiletti wrote two opinions in the form of 
memoranda. In the first, Civiletti set forth his interpretation of the 
AntiDeficiency Act. Before the 1980 memo, GAO had interpreted the 
AntiDeficiency Act to allow GAO's operations to continue because it was 
not "the intent of Congress that GAO close down." The 1980 Civiletti 
memo made clear that the Anti-Deficiency Act prohibited Federal 
agencies from incurring obligations prior to an appropriation.<p>

Civiletti's 1981 memo expanded on the first, elaborating on exceptions to 
the Anti-Deficiency Act. It said the exceptions would occur under the 
following circumstances: 1) for obligations that are "authorized by law," 
including mandatory programs such as Social Security; 2) for the 
discharge of the President's Constitutionally enumerated powers, such as 
his role as commander-in-chief of the armed forces, as well as his 
legislative role (signing bills sent to him by the Congress); 3) in cases of 
emergencies involving the safety of human life and the protection of 
property; and 4) when funds are necessary to bring about the orderly 
termination of an agency.<p></ul>
<ul>
<li><b>The 1990 Budget Agreement</b>. This legislation contained the following 
language: "The term 'emergencies involving the safety of human life or 
the protection of property' does not include ongoing, regular functions of 
government the suspension of which would not imminently threaten the 
safety of human life or the protection of property." This language makes 
clear that exceptions to the AntiDeficiency Act are to be narrowly 
construed.<p>

<li><b>The "Rivlin Memo</b>." On August 16, 1995, Assistant Attorney General 
Walter E. Dellinger prepared a memorandum for OMB Director Alice M. 
Rivlin regarding the permissible scope of government operations during a 
lapse in appropriations. The Rivlin memo is basically a restatement of the 
earlier Civiletti opinions. Dellinger also notes that the 1990 Budget 
Agreement was designed to provide a narrow construction of the 
"property and safety" exception to the AntiDeficiency Act. This memo is 
being used by agencies to develop their current plans in the event of a 
shutdown.</ul><p></ul>

Based on the above, the consensus is that the personnel who would 
continue to work would include the following:
<ul>
<li>Those involved with the safety of human life and the protection of
property, such as air traffic controllers, FBI, DEA, ATF, and Customs
 agents, the border patrol, personnel involved with the oversight of stock, 
commodities, and futures exchanges, and meat inspectors.<p>

<li>Those necessary to assure the continuation of mandatory programs (such 
as personnel involved with the check writing and distribution functions of 
Social Security).<p>

<li>Personnel involved with the discharge of the President's constitutional 
duties and powers. This definition has been purposely kept vague 
because, according to the 1981 Civiletti memo, its extent and limitations 
are dependent upon circumstances.<p>
</ul>
<h4><b>Q: Do "essential" personnel get paid?</h4></b><p><ul>

<li>Yes. Employees who are considered "essential" would continue to earn 
their pay during a government shutdown. Their actual paychecks might 
be delayed, however, subject to the passage of an appropriations bill or 
continuing resolution.</ul><p>

<h4><b>Q: Would a government shutdown affect activities of the armed forces?</b></h4><p><ul>

<li>For the most part, no. The armed forces probably would fall into the 
exception for health and safety and the protection of property. In 
addition, the 1861 Food and Forage Act might also be employed. The Act 
provides the Department of Defense with the authority to obtain 
"clothing, subsistence, forage, fuel, quarters, transportation, or medical 
and hospital supplies, which, however, shall not exceed the necessities of 
the current year."</ul><p>

<h4><b>Q: Would a shutdown threaten Social Security or Medicare benefits?</b></h4><p><ul>

<li>No. Social Security and Medicare Part A have permanent appropriations, 
so benefits would continue to be paid. Medicare Part B benefits also 
would continue to flow, although payments to providers would be subject 
to the availability of funds in the Medicare Part B Trust Fund.</ul><p>

<b><h4> Q: Is this also true of other entitlement programs?</h4><ul><p></b>

<li>No. Most other entitlements, such as Medicaid, Family Support Payments 
(AFDC), Supplemental Security Income, and Social Services Block 
Grants, are appropriated annually even though they are mandatory 
spending. The effect is that clients continue to earn the benefits to which 
they are entitled, but the actual checks could not be processed without an 
actual appropriation for the program.<p></ul>

<h4><b>Q: Would a shutdown cause the furlough of personnel who write checks 
for benefit programs such as Social Security and Medicare?</b><ul></h4>

<li> No. The second Civiletti opinion argued that the government would 
require employees who administer these checks to continue working.<p></ul>

<h4><b>Q: Would a government "shutdown" be unusual?</b><ul></h4>

<li> Obviously, a government shutdown is not common. Since 1980, 
however, the Federal Government has survived nine temporary 
"shutdowns" because of funding gaps. Most have lasted only a few days, 
and in several cases the effect was ameliorated because the shutdown 
occurred during a weekend (see table below). This year, October 1 falls 
on a Sunday, so if a shutdown started then it would likely run into one or 
more weekdays.</ul><p>

<h4><b> Q: How long would a shutdown last?</h4></b><ul>

<li>In theory, a shutdown could last indefinitely if the President continued 
refusing to sign appropriations bills or continuing resolutions sent to him 
by Congress.</ul><p>


<h3><center>II. THE PUBLIC DEBT CEILING</center></h3><p>

The current public debt ceiling is $4.9 trillion. This figure represents the 
total amount of debt that the government can incur to meet its obligations 
and to maintain orderly day-today cash flow.<p>

The amount of money currently owed by the Federal Government that is 
subject to limit is about $4.881 trillion and growing. If the Federal 
Government reaches its current $4.9trillion debt ceiling and the ceiling is 
not raised, the government will be unable to borrow money to meet any 
obligations for which there is no cash on hand on any given day. This 
will-not bring government activities to an immediate halt; but it could 
lead to delays in meeting government obligations.<p>

There are two kinds of extensions of the debt ceiling. A "permanent" 
extension establishes a dollar limit on the government's ability to borrow; 
it lasts until the government's actual borrowing reaches the ceiling 
(potentially forever). A temporary extension establishes either a small 
addition of borrowing authority or a fixed date for the expiration of 
authority to borrow; this is usually a short-term measure.<p>

<center><h3>A. Timing and Procedural Issues</h3></center><p>

The need to raise the ceiling has been driven principally by two 
conditions: the deficit spending that has been chronic since 1970 and the 
practice of borrowing from government trust funds. Deficit spending has 
driven up the debt held by the public to $3.6 trillion in 1995, compared 
with $710 billion in 1980. Borrowing from government trust funds adds 
$1.3 trillion to the debt, compared with $200 billion in 1980.<p>

But the need for borrowing would exist even if the budget were in 
balance because government revenues do not flow into the Treasury at 
the same rate as the demand for spending. In other words, the 
government uses a portion of its borrowing authority simply to maintain 
orderly day-to-day cash flow for approved programs and activities.<p>

<h4><b>Q: When is the current debt ceiling expected to be reached?</h4></b><ul><p>

<li>The government is expected to reach its current debt ceiling in mid-
October. But technical actions by the Department of the Treasury, as 
discussed below, will probably allow for sufficient cash flow up until 
November 15, when interest payments on Federal debt instruments will 
be due. On that day, the government will need to pay out between $22 
billion and $25 billion.<p></ul>

<h4><b>Q: Can Congress temporarily extend the ceiling?</b></h4><ul><p>

<li>Yes, through two possible methods. In one, Congress could provide a 
small amount of additional borrowing authority--say $25 billion. Another 
temporary method would be to extend borrowing authority for a fixed 
amount of time, expiring on a designated date.<p></ul>

<h4><b>Q: What options does the Treasury have when facing an interruption of 
borrowing authority?</h4></b><p>

The Treasury has typically resorted to several tactics, in sequence, in 
dealing with bumping up against the debt ceiling including the following:<p>
<ul>
<li>Suspend the sale of non-marketable debt. This includes sales of savings 
bonds and securities to state and local governments. If a temporary debt 
ceiling extension were enacted, these sales would be suspended on the 
date the extension expired.<p>

<li>Disinvest trust funds balances. Trust fund surpluses are invested in IOUs 
the Federal Government writes to itself. At the expiration of the debt 
limit, the Treasury would stop writing new IOUs, and then, in effect, 
would begin tearing up old IOUs. The Treasury actually did this in 
November of 1985 to create room under the debt ceiling to auction 
marketable securities to establish a larger cash reserve.<p>

<li>Trim or delay auction of marketable securities. At the expiration of the 
debt limit, the Treasury would suspend (or alter the normal size) of public 
debt offerings (bills, notes and bonds).<p>
</ul>
One other option that the Treasury has used previously --under a 
temporary debt ceiling extension --is beefing up sales of marketable 
securities to build cash balances prior to bumping up against the debt 
ceiling and before obligations become due.<p>

<h4>Q: Doesn't the government retire some of its debt each month even as it is 
incurring more?</h4><p><ul>

<li>Yes. As government debt instruments (bills, notes and bonds) become 
due they are redeemed or retired. But retiring debt is usually funded 
through the issuance of new and additional debt because of deficit 
financing including interest payments on the Federal debt.</ul><p>

<h3><center>B. Impact of Reaching the Debt Ceiling</center></h3><p>

The questions and answers below reflect methods that have been used or 
can be used to address a restriction on the government's ability to borrow.<p>

<h4><b> Q: Can't the government simply run on a cash-flow basis but at lower 
levels?</h4></b><p><ul>

<li>Yes, but it would be complicated, because cash receipts and outlays 
rarely coincide in timing. There are distinct peaks and valleys in the 
Treasury's need for cash associated with the seasonal and daily patterns of 
payments and receipts (see chart below).<p>

The Federal Government's cash flow needs can be compared to those of a 
business. Even if the business is not operating on a deficit basis, it still 
borrows to cover cash shortfalls brought about by making sales on credit 
while having to operate on cash. In other words, it may perform a service 
and be compensated 30 days later while at the same time having to cover 
expenses for that service before receipt of payment from its customer.<p>

The government operates in a similar manner--cash income and expenses 
are out of synch with regard to timing. Two significant drains on the 
Treasury-- benefit payments and interest payments--are especially large.<p></ul>

<h4><b> Q: What are the major cash flow drains on the Treasury?</h4></b><p><ul>

<li> Benefit payments go out between the first and third of the month. 
Interest payments to owners of Treasury notes and bonds take place on 
fixed dates. Other cash withdrawals for purposes as varied as Federal 
employees' pay, defense contracts, grants to states and localities, loans to 
foreign governments and Medicare are smaller, but nonetheless, they are 
not on an even keel with receipts. Also, unpredictable heavy outlays, such 
as natural disasters or national security emergencies.<p></ul>

<h4><b>Q: How does the flow of receipts compare with this pattern?</h4></b><p><ul>

<li>Receipts are a little more consistent, but they have some noticeable peaks 
and valleys as well. Income taxes withheld from paychecks and 
employment taxes are the backbone of the Treasury's deposits. Withheld 
taxes flow in fairly smoothly at about $3 billion a day with a little 
clustering. In contrast, corporate income taxes and nonwithheld 
individual income taxes concentrate around just a few deadline dates, 
most notably April 15. Interest payments due from loans are inconsistent 
as are other cash receipts from various activities of the government.<p></ul>

<center><img alt="Chart" src="chart2.gif"></center><p>
<h4><b>Q: What happens if the debt ceiling is reached and the Treasury's cash 
flow is insufficient to meet all obligations?<p></h4><ul></b>

<li>First, this would be unprecedented. There is no established guidance for 
the Congress, the President, or the Treasury to determine how to use 
Federal funds to meet its obligations should borrowing authority be 
limited or inadequate. Legislation has not been enacted nor has the 
Executive Branch established guidelines as to the priority of which 
obligations would be met first.<p>

<li>Currently, the Treasury must prioritize payments by timing--which came 
due first, second, and so on.<p></ul>

<h4><b>Q: If the government attempted to run solely on a cash flow basis, how 
would it determine what obligations would be paid?</h4></b><ul><p>

<li>Congress and the Administration could attempt to assign priorities to 
programs and activities to indicate who should get payments in what 
order. No comprehensive plan for such a situation ever has been drafted. 
Any plan that Congress and the Administration would adopt would have 
to be feasible for operations--in other words, it would have to be possible 
for the agencies, the Treasury, and the Federal Reserve (the Treasury's 
banker) to apply the priorities to the day-to-day decisions of which claims 
should be paid and when.<p></ul>

<title>Heritage Exclusive -- Fall Agenda of the 104th Congress</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center><h3><i>Heritage Exclusive</i> -- The Fall Agenda of the 104th Congress -- Senate</h3>
By <a href="mailto:rennej@heritage.org">Jim Renne</a><br>
Congressional Relations<br> <a href="/heritage/welcome.html">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
September 5, 1995<br>
</center>
<p>
	Hello everyone!  Welcome to the Heritage Foundation on Town Hall.  This is a first for me.  I've never "surfed the Net" before, let alone go on-line with a U.S. Senate update.  But, there's a first for everything including my Internet Inaugural Exclusive.
<P>
	The last few months of this year's Congressional session will be one of the busiest times in Congressional history.  Not only will a balanced budget be passed for the first time since Nixon's first term, but major reform legislation such as welfare and Medicare will be stacked end to end waiting for consideration on the ever-deliberative Senate floor.
<P>
	As you may be aware, the Senate, unlike the House of Representatives, has a general rule: If a Senator wants to "debate" an issue, he can debate until the cows come home.  There is no limit on the amount of time a Member of the Senate can talk once he's been recognized, except maybe the call of nature.  This can result in delays of days, weeks, even years.  This is known as a filibuster.
<P>
	I don't know how familiar you are with Parliamentary Procedure, so I thought I'd briefly explain key  parliamentary differences between the U.S. House of Representatives and Senate; and explain why it's more difficult for the Majority Party in the Senate to get things through.  
<P>
	One of the major differences is that in the House, rules governing time-limit and number of amendments on a particular bill are put up for a vote for each separate bill.  That means a simple majority of House Members can control and set limits to debate. This allows the Majority Party to dictate the timeframe and subject matter of any given issue allowing the Speaker of the House to ram through legislation.
<P>
	In the Senate, floor action is controlled by Unanimous Consent ("UC") -- meaning technically, one Senator can bring crucial legislation to a stand still at any time.  Sometimes even a threat of a filibuster is enough to kill a bill depending on whether the Majority leader can afford the time and effort required to beat one back. On the overwhelming majority of legislation, however, the majority and minority leaders agree on the terms of debate and pass a UC decree in which every Senator agrees on the terms.  
<P>
	But in the case where one Senator objects to the UC, a bill can be delayed indefinitely with a filibuster.  In this case, the only safeguard against a total shut down is a Cloture Petition.  Passing a Cloture Petition requires a vote of 3/5th of the Senate or 60 out of 100.  If Cloture is invoked, debate is automatically limited to 30 additional hours whereupon the bill will be immediately moved to a final vote. Thus, after Cloture has been invoked, a bill can pass with only 51 or a simple majority, where it took 60 to force the final vote.  Given the number of controversial bills coming before the Senate over these next few months, look for most if not all of the major issues to require 60 out of 100 votes instead of the usual simple majority of 51.  
<P>
	Having explained a little parliamentary procedure, I'll give a brief run down on what to expect in the Senate for the next few months.  
<P>
	The Senate reconvenes Tuesday, September 5, 1995, to begin the final lap of this marathon legislative session.  Look for the following issues to become prominent during the remainder of the session.<p>

<b>Welfare:</b><p>
The Senate has been the center of intrigue and Presidential politics over the last few months when it comes to welfare reform.  GOP Presidential candidates Bob Dole and Phil Gramm have been battling over whose welfare provisions will reign supreme.  Heritage's welfare expert <a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm">Robert Rector</a> has written extensively on the subject and has been called upon to provide technical assistance to a powerful group of conservative Senators seeking to turn the tepid approach coming out of the Senate Finance Committee into bold, sweeping reform.  Heritage's <a href="/heritage/library/index/i5.html">reform proposals</a> will go a long way in addressing the critical ailments of the current system.  Already, the initial Senate version of the welfare reform bill has been strengthened by the inclusion of key Heritage proposals.  Some of Heritage's key provisions include measures to strengthen work requirements for recipients, reduce and discourage <a href="/heritage/library/categories/healthwel/cbrief18.html">illegitimacy</a>, and stop welfare abuse by illegal immigrants.  Look for a welfare reform showdown between Congress' real reforms and the Clinton Administration's status-quo approach.
<p>
<b>Medicare:</b>
<P>
Medicare reform legislation is another highly contentious issue making its way through the halls of Congress.  Again, Heritage Foundation proposals to save billions of tax-payer dollars while providing fair, more efficient medical service are at the center of the debate.  Domestic Policy Studies Director <a href="/heritage/staff/butler.htm">Dr. Stuart Butler</a> and Health Care Analyst <a href="/heritage/staff/liu.htm">John Liu</a> have written several papers providing a <a href="/heritage/library/index/i2.html">blueprint</a> on how to save billions while giving recipients increased options and  more control over their benefits.  At the same time, these reforms will drastically reduce government bureaucracy.  The sweeping proposal is based on a novel idea: allowing beneficiaries to take advantage of the best health care system in the entire world -- the American private sector health industry.  Liberals are sure to shamelessly demagogue the issue, but a reform package will be passed.  The system is too close to bankruptcy to continue along its current path.
<p>
<b>Budget Reconciliation:</b>
<p>
By far the most tangible and contentious legislative confrontation to come will be the massive budget-balancing proposal known as the budget reconciliation process.  Budget reconciliation is an extremely complex process by which the House and Senate enact into law major budgetary reform legislation giving the U.S. Treasury authority to spend your tax money.  The usual formula by which Congress approves its yearly budgets includes two main components, Authorization and Appropriations.  Without both, taxpayer dollars cannot be spent.  However, when Congress finds itself deep in the red as it finds itself this year after forty years of liberal control, it must quickly and efficiently pass legislation to exact meaningful spending cuts.  The normal process is too convoluted to handle such sweeping change. Thus, Congress has created a hybrid process known as reconciliation as a way to exact savings out entitlement and other programs.  Since these programs are highly contentious and difficult for the authorizers to reconcile, Congress created a process by which the deficit hawks on the Budget Committee would provide authorizers with spending limits which can't be exceeded.  Then it's up to the numerous committees of jurisdiction to make the necessary changes to meet the numbers.  The reconciliation process also provides the added advantage of putting the budget balancing bill on a fast track for floor consideration.  This avoids potential filibuster delays and a host of other hurdles.  
<p>
This year's budget process is even more contentious than most.  Holdover liberals from the big-taxing, big-spending Congresses of old are teaming up with the decidedly leftist Clinton Administration in a bitter fight to preserve the gargantuan welfare state.  And, for the first time in decades, a newly elected conservative Congress will actually vote on a monumental bill which will wipe out the entire federal deficit by the year 2002.  Because such a goal is so novel in Congress -- an encouraging sign of the newly elected conservative majority's will to lead -- budget reconciliation is taking on a truly revolutionary aura.  Look for a major confrontation between Congress and the Clinton Administration and a temporary shut down of non-essential government services during October, maybe even lasting into November.  Also, expect to see the welfare and Medicare bills pushed into the Reconciliation process because of gridlock in the normal authorization process.
<P>
<b>Debt Limit:</b>
<P>
Probably the most crucial issue to come before the Congress prior to the end of this session will be the annual debt ceiling bill.  For decades, the liberals in Congress nonchalantly raised the credit limit on America's national credit card by billions of dollars without as much as a blink of an eye.  The debt limit is the ultimate hammer on deficit spending.  If it is not raised, all government spending is immediately halted.  This would be a calamity beyond compare for both Congress and the President.  Thus, the new conservative leadership plans to attach sweeping spending cuts to this bill in order to force the big spending Clinton Administration to change its ways and make real cuts.  Look for the White House to seek a compromise early by accepting many of the spending cuts (and trying to take credit for them, too) in exchange for a debt limit increase.
<P>
I hope this information is interesting and informative to you all.  Please <a href="mailto:rennej@heritage.org">contact me</a> if you have any questions or comments.  Enjoy the rest of this Congressional Session!!

      CONGRESSIONAL RECORD (HOUSE)<br>
     September 19, 1995<p>
                                                              PAGE H9223
       <p>IMPORTANCE OF A BALANCED BUDGET, WELFARE REFORM AND MEDICARE TO
                                        AMERICA
        <p></center>The SPEAKER pro tempore.  Under a previous order of the House,
          the gentleman from Georgia (Mr. Kingston) is recognized for 5
          minutes.
            Mr. KINGSTON. Mr. Speaker, I have just returned from 4 days in
          Georgia visiting with constituents, meeting with a few civic clubs,
          and riding in a parade or two.  In talking around the district that
          I represent, the coastal area of Georgia, Georgia`s first district,
          the three predominant things that seem to be on people`s minds are
          balancing the budget, reforming welfare, and the changes in the
          Medicare Program.
            On balancing the budget, even though the other body across the
          Hall failed to pass the balanced budget amendment, it is absolutely
          undeniable that the American people want us to balance the budget.
          As a member of the Committee on Appropriations I can say that we
          are moving in that direction.  We have 1 appropriations bill left
          out of 13. Hopefully, we will pass that this week or next week.
          When we do, we will have all of our appropriations bills passed,
          which take us to having a balanced budget by the year 2002.
    <p><center> PAGE H9223</center><p>
            The importance of this, Mr. Speaker, is that as we have these
          billion dollar deficits each year, it takes money away from other
          programs and we are unable to pay down the debt.  Now all we are
          doing is servicing the interest.  Currently, the interest on the
          national debt is the third largest item in our budget every year.
          In 2 years that interest is expected to exceed all of the military
          spending.  Once we get rid of the deficit, we can start paying off
          the principal beyond the interest of the debt.  Of course, it will
          take many, many years.  We have a $4.8 trillion debt.
            The definition, Mr. Speaker, of a trillion, to illustrate it,
          and, first of all, it is almost beyond comprehension, but if we
          spent $100,000 a minute, 24 hours a day, it would take 19 years to
          get to $1 trillion.  We currently have a debt of $4.8 trillion.  We
          simply cannot pass that on to the children of the United States of
          America.
            I think it is very important that this House is moving toward a
          balanced budget as fast as we can.  I certainly hope the folks in
          the other body feel the same way.
     <center><p>PAGE H9223 <p></center>
            We have passed welfare reform in the House. Our welfare reform
          has four significant planks to it.
            No. 1, a work requirement.  If an individual is able-bodied, in
          order to get welfare, they should have to work.
            No. 2, a mechanism to discourage illegitimate births, since that
          is one of the biggest problems in America today.
     <center><p>    PAGE H9223<p></center>
            No. 3, State flexibility.  We may do it differently in Georgia
          than the folks in New York, but let us make those decisions.
            And No. 4, no welfare benefits to illegal aliens.  We want to
          help them if they are hurt in this country, but we also want them
          to get back home if they are not American citizens, so that they
          are not coming over to America to enjoy the benefits of our
          generous public benefits system.
            The third thing people are interested in, of course, is the
          Medicare Program. The current trustees in April said that Medicare
          is going broke.  We have to move to save it.  We are trying to slow
          the growth of it, trying to make the growth of Medicare inflation
          about 6 percent, which is closer to what it is in regular medical
          inflation.  Actually, regular medical inflation was down last
          year.  It was not even inflation.  But the costs were down.
    <p><center>PAGE H9223</center><p>
            The thing we need to do on Medicare is protect and preserve it by
          simplifying it.  We want to give senior citizens a whole list of
          options: choice of doctors, choice of traditional fee-for-service
          plans, choice of traditional Medicare, and, along with that, some
          other options like Medisave accounts and so forth.
            We believe all this can be done, Mr. Speaker, and the result will
          be a better product to American seniors.  Again, we want to protect
          and preserve it.
            The big frustration that the American people seem to be having is
          while we have done a lot of things in the House, across the Hall,
          in the other body, they are taking the route of inaction.  It is
          true today they passed welfare reform, but we passed ours back in
          March. It is time to bring these issues to a question.  Will the
          other body and will the executive branch join the House, the lower
          Chamber, in making the reforms necessary to preserve our country?
  <p><center>PAGE H9223<p></center>
            I hope that they will, because we are clearly on the road to
          personal responsibility, personal discipline, balancing the budget,
          lowering taxes, decreasing Government regulation and
          micromanagement out of Washington, and, best of all and most
          importantly, increasing personal freedom.  We cannot do it alone.
          We have to have the cooperation of the full legislative branch of
          Government, which means the other body, and we have to have the
          executive branch to sign this into law.
            Mr. Speaker, if we can get the cooperation of the folks across
          the hall, I believe we will have a balanced budget, we will have
          Medicare reform, and we will have welfare reform.  This, Mr.
          Speaker, I believe, is what the American people are asking for.

<h2>Don't Underestimate Taxpayers' Intelligence </h2> 
<P>by <a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 

 
As budget negotiations near the crisis stage again next week, expect 
Democrats to demagogue on taxes as they have for the past three years. 
Although President Clinton was elected with a promise to enact a 
middle-class tax cut, he instead raised taxes in 1993. And now he and 
Democrats in Congress want Republicans to scale back the $ 245 billion 
tax cut included in their congressional budget package.
<P>
Democrats believe the key to a balanced budget is higher tax revenues, 
which they think government can magically control by manipulating tax 
rates. The theory is simple enough: Tax the rich at higher rates and 
the government will take in more revenues, which can then be used to 
pay for all those expensive government programs Democrats favor. The 
problem is, it never seems to work out  quite as intended.
<P>
A new study by Harvard Professors Martin Feldstein and Daniel Feenberg 
demonstrates why.
<P>
In 1993, the Clinton tax increase raised marginal tax rates from 31% 
to 36% on incomes between $ 140,000 and $ 250,000 and to 39.6% on 
incomes above $ 250,000. Those tax increases should have produced $ 
19.3 billion in extra revenues if the affected taxpayers had not 
changed their earnings behavior. Instead, the hefty tax hikes produced 
less than half the expected extra revenues - $ 8.4 billion.
<P>
Democrats assume taxpayers are a docile lot. Raise their taxes and 
they'll willingly fork over the extra money to the IRS. In fact, 
taxpayers - rich and not so rich - usually resist government efforts 
to take more of their money by changing their behavior. The rich, in 
particular, have lots of options to avoid  paying more to the IRS, 
including cutting back on their work effort. President Reagan was fond 
of describing his response to the confiscatory marginal tax rate of 
90% that prevailed when he was an actor. He simply quit working when 
he earned enough to put him in the highest bracket. It wasn't worth 
making that next dollar if he only got to keep 10 cents.
<P>
The study shows many wealthy Americans responded to the Clinton tax 
increases the same way. They may have worked less, taken more time 
off, bought more expensive homes with higher mortgages (shielding more 
income with higher home mortgage interest deductions), or given more 
to charity (producing higher charitable tax deductions). By whatever 
means, those in the highest brackets reduced their taxable incomes by 
an estimated 7.8%.
<P>
Some wealthy taxpayers - including Hillary Rodham Clinton - also 
avoided paying the higher 1993 taxes by shifting some of their 
expected 1993 income to 1992. Ordinary workers don't have that luxury, 
but executives, lawyers and other high-income earners sometimes do. 
They can exercise stock options or take some of their future income in 
current year bonuses if they anticipate tax increases  in future 
years. Mrs. Clinton sheltered some of her earnings by taking a year-
end bonus in 1992, thus avoiding paying the higher 1993 taxes.
<P>
It seems never to occur to Democratic politicians that many wealthy 
people got that way by being smart about money. Allow them to keep 
more of what they earn and they'll earn more, in the process creating 
jobs through their investment. But tax them excessively and they will 
figure out ways to keep Uncle Sam from getting a larger share of their 
money. Even Mrs. Clinton found a  way around the 1993 tax increase, 
temporarily putting aside Democratic ideology  when it affected her 
own pocketbook. Maybe it's time Democrats stopped underestimating the 
intelligence of U.S. taxpayers.

<center><h2>One Victim</h2>
 By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"> Kathleen Howley</a> </center>
 <P>
 <hr>
 <P>
 

  
    Julie Welch, 23, didn't know that it was the last day of her life. 
She had plans for the future. She was preparing to quit her job as a 
claims agent for the Social Security department to take a job teaching 
Spanish at a local high school. 
<P>
     She was young and attractive. And, she was in love with a 
handsome, 24-year-old second lieutenant from a nearby Air Force base 
named Eric Hilz. They had talked about marriage, but that was still in 
the future. There was plenty of time -- they thought.
<P>
     The two had met at a Catholic prayer group for young adults at 
Tinker Air Force Base, according to news wire reports.  Last fall, on 
their first date, they went to the State Fair and rode the Ferris 
wheel. 
<P>
    On their final date, the Monday night before the Oklahoma City 
bombing, they went to dinner to celebrate Eric's 24th birthday. Julie 
gave him a prayer book, and they shared a bottle of champagne. The 
last time Eric saw her, after kissing her goodnight, she seemed happy, 
he said.
<P>
      Julie attended Mass every day, and went to Confession every 
week. She had a habit of praying the Rosary each evening, before going 
to bed. On the last night of her life, she probably didn't realize the 
full meaning of the words, "Holy Mary, Mother of God, pray for us 
sinners, now and at the hour of our death."
<P>
      She hadn't always been as ardent about her faith. Her father 
said she was lonely at college, and became depressed after living 
alone for the first time. That's when she started working on her 
relationship with God, praying daily, and frequenting the Sacraments. 
After graduation, she lost 40 pounds, and told her dad that she 
finally felt not only spiritually but physically fit.
<P>
     The morning of the Oklahoma City bombing, Julie attended the 7 
a.m. Mass at St. Charles, as always, before going to work at the 
federal building. 
<P>
     By 9 a.m., she was at her desk chatting with her supervisor. At 
9:02 she put down her glasses and went into the front office to greet 
her first customer of the day -- a Hispanic man who needed a 
disability check. 
<P>
     A moment later, the Social Security office was gone, demolished 
by a madman's bomb. About half of the 38 employees made it out alive, 
but not Julie.
<P>
     "She was too young," said her supervisor, Lorri McNiven, who woke 
up in darkness 30 minutes after the blast and was able to crawl from 
the twisted rubble to safety.
<P>
     Julie's parents got a call from the Coroner's office on Saturday 
morning. Their daughter's body had been identified. The grieving 
family said they considered themselves fortunate, because at least 
they can bury their child. Authorities say that some bodies were 
obliterated in the blast, and may never be recovered.
<P>
     To the world, Julie's life was unusual. Daily Mass, the Rosary, 
and weekly Confessions. She was happy, and at peace. It's not 
something the secular press can easily explain.
<P>
     At a time when the concept of womanhood has been redefined by the 
likes of Cosmopolitan Magazine to mean self-centeredness and self-
fulfillment, Julie was a contradiction.
<P>
      She kept her life God-centered, and wrapped herself in the 
Sacraments. She had her eyes on the ultimate prize: eternal happiness 
in Heaven.
<P>
     "We know there is no doubt her soul is in great shape. I feel a 
real sense of peace. I know everything is all right," her boyfriend, 
Eric, told reporters.

<center><h2>Remembering V-J Day</center></h2>
<p>
<center>By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"> Kathleen Howley</a></center> 
<p>
<hr>
<p>
<p>
In all the controversy surrounding the 50th anniversary of the 
dropping of the atomic bomb on the weapons factories of Hiroshima and 
Nagasaki, there's been a bit of the human element that has been lost 
on one side of the debate.
<p>
No, I'm not talking about the fate of the 195,000 people who were 
killed or injured in those congested cities. Their tragic story has 
been told, as well it should. 
<p>
The world has not forgotten them.
<p>
But, what about the fate of the U.S. forces poised off the coast 
of Japan, ready to launch an invasion that was certain to produce the 
heaviest casualties of World War II?
<p>
It's easy, 50 years later, to disagree about projected fatality 
figures. Would there have been 80,000 American losses during the inch-
by-inch fighting for Japanese soil, or 180,000, or 300,000, or more? 
In recent weeks, the guests on the Sunday morning talk show seem to 
preen themselves as they dispassionately debate the issue. 
<p>
But, meanwhile, the men who were on those ships, and their 
families, have a different view of history. It's a more gripping sense 
of what might have been.
<p>
I know, because my father, Michael J. Howley, was part of that 
invasion force. He was, then, a somewhat-scrawny, 18-year-old Radarman 
First Class on the U.S.S. Akutan, an ammunition ship that was 
responsible for re-supplying the front-line battleships with shells 
and bullets. 
<p>
In the brutal, island-hopping campaigns that brought the U.S. 
forces to the shores of Japan, the Navy's job was to launch massive 
bombardments before each landing in an attempt to pave the way for the 
Marines. At the same time, the ships had to defend themselves against 
enemy fighter pilots and suicidal kamikaze attacks.
<p>
Dad enlisted in the Navy when he was 17, fresh out of Boston 
College High School. At first, his parents objected, saying he was too 
young. But, in the end, they signed the document required for under-
aged recruits, and sent their son to fight for their adopted country.
<p>
By August of 1945, he was a veteran of the Liberation of the 
Philippines, and, a more searing memory, the Battle of Okinawa, where 
the U.S. Navy experienced some of the heaviest losses of the war. 
<p>
He never had to worry about being crippled or maimed. All it took 
to incinerate an ammo ship was one well-placed bullet, or one 
successful kamikaze plane. 
<p>
In fact, in the final months of war, the U.S.S. Mt. Hood, also an 
"AE," or ammunition supplier, went down with all hands lost, with the 
exception of an officer and a squad of sailors who were on a nearby 
island. The explosion of the ship's 8,800 tons of bombs blew a 300-
foot-long crater in the ocean floor.
<p>
To acknowledge the awesome destructive power contained within the 
hulls of the AEs, the Navy named all of them, in the World War II 
years, after volcanoes.
<p>
When we were young, the only specifics Dad ever told us about the 
war were the funny stories, like the time he was on shore patrol and 
was ordered to arrest a group of sailors, who turned out to be his 
shipmates.
<p>
And, there was also the amusing detail about the "little white 
lie" he told his mother, who was home in Boston praying unending 
Rosaries for her two sons in uniform -- one, my uncle, in the Army, 
and, the other, my Dad.
<p>
"Mamie," an Irish name for "mother," spent the war years believing 
my father was on a low-level supply ship in the backwaters of the 
Pacific. To support this subterfuge, he filled his letters with 
imaginary details of how many blankets they had transported, and how 
bored he was.
<p>
"I didn't want her to worry more than she already did," he 
explained. 
<p>
Every year, at the anniversary of the bombings of Nagasaki and 
Hiroshima, the media focuses on one angle: the plight of the citizens 
of those two cities.
<p>
But the historical context, the backdrop for the decision to drop 
the bomb, seems to have been lost. 
<p>
There has been little mention of the fact that the Japanese were 
working on their own A-bomb, or that they had a habit of placing 
armament factories in residential areas, or that the citizens of 
Hiroshima and Nagasaki were warned by U.S. leaflet drops to flee their 
homes, or that our prisoners of war were starving to death as they 
waited for liberation.
<p>
Most of all, we seem to have forgotten the plight of the thousands 
of soldiers and sailors -- many of them teenagers -- who waited 
onboard the ships of the American invasion fleet.
<p>
Whether you believe the lowball figures put forth by today's 
revisionists, or the higher figures accepted as fact in 1945, the 
bottom line is: vast numbers of those young men would not have 
survived the Battle of Japan.
<p>
They would have have missed their chance to live their lives, to 
have families, and to grow old.
<p>
Surely, their stories deserve some mention.

<h2>GOP Congress: '95 Something to Crow About</h2> 
<P>by <a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 

Is the Republican revolution about to fizzle barely one year 
after it began? 
<P>
The Congress has produced no significant legislation. Extremists 
dominate the freshman class in the House. Republicans want to put poor 
children out on the streets and deprive elderly sick people of medical 
care in order to give tax breaks to the rich. The magnificent 
machinery of government has ground to a halt, not once but twice in as 
many months, causing chaos for millions of Americans. And the public 
has had enough. At least that's what the Clinton administration wants 
you to think - and the media has obligingly conveyed the message.
<P>
But before the Clintons order their favorite Arkansas champagne for 
the 1997 inaugural and House Democratic Leader Dick Gephardt picks out 
new drapes for the Speaker's office, perhaps it's time to take a 
closer look at just what did happen in 1995.
<P>
The Congress of the United States actually produced a 3,000-page, 
detailed bill that will balance the budget in seven years.
<P>
Sure, the president vetoed it, but the feat is historic nonetheless. 
The Democrats couldn't come close to offering a balanced budget in 
their years at the helm - even when they controlled both the 
legislative and executive branches, as they did in the Clinton 
administration's first two years.
<P>
Republicans have taken on the first major entitlement programs - 
Medicare and Medicaid - putting principle before politics. For years, 
Republicans have been going after the small potatoes entitlements, 
such as AFDC and food stamps. These programs, while unpopular, make up 
only a small fraction of the federal budget, roughly 3%.
<P>
The really big money entitlements are Social Security and Medicare, 
which go mostly to the middle class, and Medicaid, which goes to the 
poor. These items account for more than one third of the entire 
federal budget.
<P>
Democrats have never been willing to even try to rein in these 
entitlements. But this year Republicans have risked their own re-
election in order to stop burying future generations in debt. For this 
Republicans - and especially the 73 House freshmen - have been labeled 
"extremists," not only by the president but by much of the media.
<P>
Republicans have permanently altered the terms of the debate on 
welfare. Even Democrats sound hardline about ending welfare dependency 
these days. No one argues for welfare rights' or defends welfare 
recipients who stay on the rolls year after year. And virtually 
everyone now agrees that the War on Poverty failed, not for lack of 
funds after more than $ 5 trillion spent in three decades, but because 
the programs themselves were misguided.
<P>
Democrats still cling to the demonstrably erroneous notion that 
expensive government training programs are necessary to get recipients 
off welfare and into jobs.      But when the president finally signs 
welfare reform legislation - as he must soon or face the consequences 
at the polls next year - it will bear a decidedly Republican stamp, 
devolving responsibility back to the states and giving states more 
leeway to limit dependency and discourage illegitimacy.
<P>
Republicans forced Congress to live by the same rules it cavalierly 
mandated for others and to stop accepting gifts and entertainment from 
lobbyists.
<P>
For years when Democrats controlled both Houses, Congress exempted 
itself from laws it insisted other employers obey: civil rights laws, 
health and safety laws, labor relations laws. In recent years, 
Republicans began drawing attention to this Democrat hypocrisy by 
offering amendments to make Congress subject to the same laws it 
applied to others - to no avail.
<P>
Republicans won their battle only when they won control of Congress. 
Suddenly even Democrats decided maybe no one should be above the law - 
not even Congress, now that they no longer controlled it.
<P>
The same thing happened with lobby reform. Democrats had no interest 
in lobby reform when they occupied the powerful committee 
chairmanships. But once they became backbenchers they were more than 
happy to jump on the Republican freshmen's lobby reform bandwagon.      
These Republicans accomplishments may not yet constitute a revolution. 
But they add up to the most significant legislative reforms in a 
decade - not bad for one year's effort.  
<P>

<h2>
Prospecting the Federal Government: How Buchanan Found Gold In Alaska
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Pete du Pont 
</a>
<p>

Pat Buchanan is running hard and strong, perplexing all the pundits in 
the process.  His issues, mostly trade, immigration and abortion, 
appear to be resonating with a sizable block of voters.  But, there's 
a broader message here - Pat is tapping into a rich vein of distrust 
and disgust with the national government. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Consider the first caucus he won, in what would have seemed the 
unlikely jurisdiction of Alaska.  Unlikely, that is, until we consider 
Alaska's treatment at the hands of the federal government during its 
almost four decades of statehood.  It's a treatment that makes the 
state fertile ground for a candidate seeking to harvest people's 
growing frustrations with the intrusiveness of Washington. 
 <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In 1958, the citizens of the Alaskan territory voted by a margin of 
more than 5 to 1 to accept Washington's offer of statehood. The 
proclamation signed by President Eisenhower on January 3, 1959 made 
Alaska our 49th state, guaranteeing it "equal footing" with the other 
48 states. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
But, that's not the way it turned out.  Instead, Alaskans have 
witnessed one attempt after another - some successful, some not - on 
the part of the federal government to change elements of the original 
statehood "contract." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
As part of Alaska's statehood, it was agreed that the federal 
government would be entitled to 10% of any oil revenues arising from 
federal lands.  Yet, in 1964, the federal government unsuccessfully 
tried to increase its share to 75% of oil revenues from the Kenai 
Peninsula. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
While it was always expected that the federal government would own and 
manage vast acreage within their state, many Alaskans no doubt felt 
shocked and betrayed in 1980, when President Carter signed the Alaska 
National Interest Lands Act.  The Act gave to the federal government 
much of the state's most valuable acreage, or acreage that blocked 
usage of valuable acreage in private and state hands. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Commonwealth North, a group of prominent Alaskans, notes the federal 
intrusiveness that arises from the large size and unfortunate (from 
Alaska's viewpoint) placement of federal land ownership within Alaska, 
noting there are actually 54 different ruling "governors" that have a 
say over land usage.  These include park superintendents, wildlife 
refuge superintendents, etc. that rule over different federal land 
units within Alaska.  Sadly for Alaska's citizens, these authorities 
are appointed in Washington, and have no reason to answer to the 
people of Alaska.  Predictably, their rule can be capricious and 
inconsistent. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
The prohibitions against developing some federal land, or even using 
it to get from private or state-owned land to deep water ports and 
other elements of business infrastructure, make it impossible to 
accomplish much economic development.  This especially hurts Alaska's 
attempts to shift its economy away from its dependence on oil. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
But, even when Alaskans can work with the land, their hands are often 
tied.  For example, the natural markets for oil extracted from 
Alaska's North Slope would be nations on the Pacific Rim, including 
Japan.  Yet, until very recently, federal law prohibited Alaska from 
exporting this oil to Japan, which resulted in Alaskan oil passing 
through the Panama Canal on the way to a Gulf port, while oil from 
Mexico headed in the other direction on its way to the Pacific Rim. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Washington's attempts at environmental micro-management  have also 
severely impacted Alaska.  74% of Alaska's non-mountainous land area 
falls under the definition of wetlands, and so is managed in 
Washington.  So are fisheries and timber.  Alaska's everyday life is a 
series of David and Goliath-like clashes with a distant national 
government. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Our federal government seems to have broken its promises to Alaska - 
to have told its biggest lies to our biggest state.  Since statehood, 
Alaska has suffered from laws that were passed and administered by 
people sitting in Washington, people who were either unaware, or 
didn't care, how those laws would affect the people in Alaska.  And, 
this has been done with the usual Washington arrogance that it knows 
better than the people of Alaska what is good for them and their 
state.   
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
No wonder Pat Buchanan won the Alaska caucuses.  And, while it remains 
to be seen if his win was the first step toward the presidential 
nomination, or just the start of a good month that ended after New 
Hampshire, there is one real concern that we should address.  If 
Washington treats Alaska, a state that sits 5000 miles away and is 
primarily wilderness, so shabbily, just think what it's doing to the 
rest of us.

<h2>'Dynamic' Newest Banned Word</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 
 

Bethesda, Md. - Warning: Radical feminists have added a new word to 
their lexicon of forbidden terms. "Dynamic" now joins "seminal," 
"mankind" and "hysterical" among other "sexist" expressions that 
feminists want to expunge from our vocabularies.
<P>
This most recent skirmish in the feminist language war erupted at 
Chico State University in California, where the philosophy department 
recently advertised for "a dynamic classroom teacher and program 
builder" to teach the "philosophy of feminism." The ad drew fire from 
a feminist English professor and the university's affirmative action 
director, who charged that the word "dynamic" described a "kinetic, 
dramatic style" most often associated with white males. University 
administrators, not wanting to offend, rewrote the ad, substituting 
"excellent" for "dynamic," but the controversy didn't end there. The 
local newspaper put the story on Page One, and even the usually 
liberal San Francisco Chronicle editorialized against adding "dynamic" 
to "the growing list of socially unacceptable words."
<P>
The whole episode might be amusing if it weren't part of a serious - 
and successful - propaganda campaign to change not only the way we 
talk but also the way we thingk. As George Orwell noted 50 years ago 
in his famous essay "Politics and the English Language". "If thought 
corrupts language, language can also corrupt thought." And corrupting 
thought is what radical feminism is all about.
<P>
Feminists fully understand their mission. "The political implications 
of language have made linguistic study imperative for feminists," 
intones the Women's Study Encyclopedia in an essay on "Feminism and 
Semiological Theory." For those uninitiated in contemporary academic 
jargon, semiotics is a theory of language that asserts that words are 
symbols representing not only the things they describe but, more 
importantly, the values of the dominant class within a culture. If you 
wnat to change the values of a culture, you must change its language. 
And feminists have been trying to change ours for a generation.
<P>
We've all but abandoned sex-specific terms in public usage. Firemen 
and policemen have disappeared, even though they account for 98% of 
fire department personnel and 84% of those in police departments. Miss 
and Mrs. have given way to the nondescript and dissonant Ms. Official 
Washington has banished its chairmen and spokesmen. And most editors 
would rather break grammar rules than offend feminists, substituting 
"they" for the generic "he" when a third person singular pronoun is 
required. (One copy editor actually suggested that I use the pronoun 
"it" when referring to a non-specific child.) Even "mother" and 
"father" are becomng endangered terms, replaced by the less 
descriptive "parent."
<P>
Sex itself is being quickly supplanted by "gender" - which in 
feministspeak refers to an arbitrary social construct. As the Women's 
Study Encyclopedia puts it: "To many, gender continues to be read as 
synonymous with sex." But not to radical feminists, for whom "the 
relation between sex and gender has becmoe the central question for 
contemporary feminist theory as a whole." The idea is to abolish 
differences between men and wom,en, even those rooted in nature. And 
the first step is to break down distinctions in language - to 
"deconstruct" language, in another favorite phrase from the jargon of 
the academic left.
<P>
Author and philosophy professor Christina Hoff Sommers, whose book 
"Who Stole Feminism?" is a biting critique of radical feminists on 
campus, makes the distinction between what she calls "gender 
feminists" and "equity feminists." The former see themselves as 
victims of a culture totally dominated by men, and their objective is 
to transform that culture, using language as a tool to reconstruct 
society in their image.
<P>
"Equity feminists," on the other hand, simply want women to have equal 
legal rights with men and the same opportunities as men to make the 
most of their own individual talents. Unfortunately, the gender 
feminists have the upper hand in universities across the country, and 
their influence spills over into the broader culture day by day.

The attempt to neuter language, or to put certain words off limits 
because they ostensibly represent masculine traits, is an exercise in 
thought control. Totalitarianism didn't disappear with the collapse of 
the Soviet Union. It's alive and well on many American college 
campuses today.

<h2> 
Hollywood Misses American Reality 
</h2> 
 
 
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html"> 
Linda Chavez 
</a> 
 
<P>   
BETHESDA, Md. -- Sex sells. Hollywood is simply giving Americans what  
they want. That's the explanation entertainment executives and media 
critics have been giving for years to explain why sex saturates movies 
and TV. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But a new public opinion survey by U.S. News & World Report suggests 
they're wrong. Americans are fed up with the smutty fare the networks 
dish out. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
The magazine surveyed a random sample of 1,000 adults in March and 
reported the results in the April 15 issue. Overwhelmingly, 
respondents reported that they disapproved of what they see on TV. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
More than 80% expressed concern about verbal references to sex, 
nudity, and premarital and extramarital sex on TV. And 75% were 
worried about portrayals of homosexual activity. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
And huge majorities said they believe that television portrayals of 
sex or sexual references actually affect behavior: 84% said such 
portrayals contributed to extramarital sex, 83% to casual sex, 90% to 
young people having sex, and 94% to violence against women. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Are Americans overreacting? Or is TV really raunchier these days? 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
The magazine actually surveyed prime-time shows on the four major 
broadcast networks for one week. It found that half of all shows 
contained sexual acts or references to sex. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Another, more comprehensive study by media analysts Robert and Linda 
Lichter found a sex act or reference occurs once every four minutes on 
prime-time shows. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
And the sexual depictions are anything but responsible. Casual sex is 
the basic plot line of NBC's top-rated sitcom Friends, about a group 
of libidinous twentysomethings always on the make. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Recent episodes have depicted one-night stands, lesbian moms, 
homosexual marriage (with House Speaker Newt Gingrich's openly gay 
sister performing the ceremony) and intergenerational romance. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
The latter plot involving the show's ingenue Monica (Courtny Cox) and 
Richard (played by Tom Selleck -- who ironically has been active in 
the traditional values movement) made much of Richard's quaint lack of 
sexual experience. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
As a divorced man in his 40s, Richard admits he's slept with only two 
women, his wife and Monica. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
While that makes him practically a freak as a TV character, it 
probably puts him in the same category as about two-thirds of men his 
age. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
According to the most comprehensive study of Americans' sexual 
behavior ever done, the National Health and Social Life Survey 
conducted in the early '90s, 67% of men Richard's age actually married 
their first sexual partner, and more than 65% of males remain faithful 
to their spouses while they are married. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
But TV reflects neither reality nor viewers' preferences. What it does 
reflect is the values of its creators. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Although U.S. News didn't conduct a scientific survey of entertainment 
executives, it did mail out a questionnaire to more than 6,000 
Hollywood leaders, about 10% of whom responded. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
And the gap in attitudes between the TV executives and the public was 
huge. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
In virtually every category, only a minority of the Hollywood elite 
who responded showed concern about actual sexual activities on TV. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Less than one-third expressed concern about homosexual activity, 
compared with three-quarters of the public, for example, and half as 
many industry executives as the general public were upset by TV nudity 
or seminudity. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Since these executives took the time to respond to the survey in the 
first place, their responses may actually overstate general Hollywood 
concerns about sex on TV. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
After all, those who don't think there's a problem would be least 
likely to fill out the survey. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
So why not just turn off the TV set or change the channel? More and 
more Americans may be doing just that, which partially explains why 
the networks are losing audience share. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
But that's not the total answer. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Hollywood isn't a society unto itself, and the values it helps create 
shape the world in which all of us live. It's hard to imagine even 
Hollywood executives wanting their own children to behave as 
promiscuously as the characters they create in prime time.

<h2> 
Clinton Welfare Flip: At Least He Landed in Right Spot
</h2>     
     
     
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">     
Linda Chavez     
</a>     
<p>
BETHESDA, Md. -- He may not look like an Olympic gymnast, but Bill 
Clinton has proved he's a real master of the triple somersault with 
his latest move on welfare reform. The man who campaigned on the 
promise of ending welfare as we know it -- and then vetoed two 
welfare-reform bills which did just that -- has once again reversed 
himself.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On Saturday, the president announced he'll support a Wisconsin plan to 
abolish Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and replace it 
with a mandatory work program.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yet just months ago, the president and other administration officials 
excoriated Republicans in Congress as "radical" and "extremist" for 
proposing welfare reforms far more modest than Wisconsin's plan.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Under Republican Gov. Tommy Thompson's welfare reform, Wisconsin will 
eliminate traditional welfare and replace it with work. Women who 
apply for assistance in Wisconsin will receive job counseling and be 
expected to work in a regular job or in one subsidized by the state.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For those who have few skills or little work experience, the state 
will provide community-service jobs or places in "sheltered workshops" 
which will provide work activities consistent with recipients' 
abilities.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
These changes in state law require the administration's approval 
before they can take effect, however, which is why the president's 
endorsement is so crucial. And requiring welfare mothers to work is 
still controversial in some circles -- especially among Democrats.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Welfare-rights activists who oppose the Wisconsin reforms argue that 
children will suffer if their mothers are forced off welfare and into 
jobs unless the state provides a myriad of expensive services, 
including job training and child care.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And President Clinton cited the lack of sufficient money for training 
and child care in the congressional welfare-reform proposals when he 
vetoed them last winter.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But working mothers who have never been on welfare receive little, if 
any, help with subsidized day care for their children, much less 
government-financed employment training.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Does it really make sense to provide greater benefits to those who 
have shown less initiative and responsibility than we do to women who 
struggle to balance work and family duties?
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But some welfare advocates argue that mothers of young children 
shouldn't be forced to work at all. This argument might actually have 
carried some weight when most women stayed home to raise their 
children. Indeed, AFDC began in 1935 as a program to help women whose 
husbands had died or abandoned them, at a time when only about 8% of 
married women with children were in the labor force.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Today, however, 76% of married women with school-age children work, as 
do 62% of those with children under 6 years.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The great irony is that a larger percentage of married than single 
moms work. Only 57% of single mothers are in the workforce, including 
only 52% of those with children under 6. For nonworking single moms, 
Uncle Sam is the main provider. And women who bear children out of 
wedlock are far more likely than divorced mothers to end up on welfare 
and to stay there for long periods, sometimes indefinitely.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Clearly, something has gone wrong with a system that makes it easier 
for a woman to stay home to raise her children if she doesn't marry 
the father than if she does.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At least in Wisconsin that may no longer be the case.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It takes an election to get Bill Clinton to do the right thing. But 
for now, his latest welfare back flips have landed him in the right 
spot -- and he's likely to remain there at least for the rest of the 
campaign.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The trick for Republicans will be to use Clinton's Wisconsin decision 
to force his hand on a federal bill that puts in place some of the 
same reforms before the election.
<BR>

<title>The Peanut Shell Game</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<h2>The Peanut Shell Game</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<b> By:  Thomas A. Schatz: President, Citizens Against Government Waste</b>
<p>   
Since the days of the Great Depression, American farming communities have lived under the umbrella of government subsidies.  These assistance measures, initiated because of unstable market conditions, create strong dependency as farmers cling to the benefits of government intervention.     
<p>  
As a result of these programs, the American farmer is enriched and capitalizes on his position, while substantially distorting the agricultural market.  Through quotas and government handouts, farmers receive above-market prices, crop failure relief, and engage in a feudalistic method of production.  For the taxpayer and consumer,   
agricultural subsidy programs increase prices and waste tax dollars through needless expenditures.   
<p>
Established in 1933 as part of the Agricultural Adjustment Act, the peanut subsidy program stabilized agricultural income through price supports and production control.  Subsidies were welcome because one-fourth of the U.S. population resided in rural areas and farm earnings were well below national average income statistics, constituting a mere 53 percent of a nonfarm family's salary.  In 1933, the Chairman   
of the House Agriculture Committee, Representative Marvin Jones (D-Texas), believed in the necessity of the bill, but noted that the President "would surrender such programs when the emergency (was) past."  In 1934, FDR's Secretary of Agriculture, Henry Wallace, said, "The present program for readjusting productive acreage to market requirements is admittedly but a temporary method of dealing with an emergency.  It could not be relied upon as a permanent means of keeping farm production in line with market requirements."   
<p>
The emergency is over and the dynamics of farming have changed.  The number of farms have decreased by 69 percent, from 6.8 million farms in 1935  to 2 million farms today.  More importantly, the average income of a farm family now exceeds $39,000, higher than a nonfarm family's average income.  With the number of farms decreasing and the stabilization of agricultural income, programs such as peanut   
subsidies are relics of a bygone era.    
<p>
Peanuts are an important political and financial cash crop in the South.  The "Peanut Belt" stretches from Tidewater, Virginia to the New Mexican plateau and produces 5 billion pounds of peanuts, with an estimated value of $1.4 billion.  The political consequences outweigh the financial when it comes to eradicating the peanut program.   
<p>
Administered through the USDA's Agricultural Stabilization and Conservation Service, the peanut program consists of two mandates. First, the program controls the domestic supply of peanuts through a  poundage quota system.  This Soviet-style regulatory approach sets limits on production and allocates who should produce the specified amount.  Second, by restraining the domestic supply through the quota   
system, the government sets a minimum selling price for all domestic sales.  With a domestic support price of $714 per ton compared to a  world price of $494 per ton, domestic prices are 44.5 percent higher than the average world market price.  Domestic buyers must pay this higher price.  Subsidies are in direct contrast to the American ideal of free trade, which embraces the lowest cost and most efficient   
producer.   
<p>
The federal government is merely evoking a feudalistic system that benefits a few large farms while suppressing the rest.  Although anyone can grow peanuts, only those who have quota land can grow peanuts for domestic, price-supported use.  Thus, non-quota owners must either rent land that is part of the quota system, or settle for   exportation at the world market price.  Seventy percent of quota  
holders rent their land to peanut farmers, making $208 million a year in rental fees without growing one single peanut.  Contrary to popular political folklore, small farmers are not benefiting from the peanut program.  Currently, 80 percent of the quotas to grow domestic peanuts are owned by 20 percent of peanut farmers.   
<p>
To arrive at the appropriate price support amount, the government uses  the national average production cost.  Based on increases in the prices paid by producers for commodities and services, interest, taxes, and wage rates, the government then deciphers an increased fair price without considering the costs of producing peanuts.  In an  absurd twist of fate, if peanut production costs drop, the fixedsupport price still might rise, based on the entire U.S. average of  production costs.  Historically, the gap between quota support prices and costs has increased every year.   
<p>
Government control does not stop at the quotas and price supports. The USDA uses these two prescriptions for further market interruptions.  First, under law, peanut farmers may sell their peanuts directly to the government instead of market buyers.    
Regardless of crop conditions, peanut farmers have a guaranteed buyer-- the federal government -- at or above the inflated domestic price.  If the government cannot sell all of the collected peanuts to the public sector, then the rest will be sold for oil or meal at substantially lower prices.  In the end, the government picks up the price difference between the high price support and the market price.   
<p> 
Money spent by both the consumer and the government is not worth these results.  Every American farmer deserves a free market in which to develop efficiency and gain market share through his own right, not a government-given quota.  According to the General Accounting Office, consumers spend an additional $513 million a year for peanut products such as Peanut Butter and Kung Pao Chicken, excessive profits   
transferred to the peanut producers.  In the long run, these high   prices will hurt the peanut industry as consumers look to other lower-priced products.  In 1990, there was a 10 percent drop in the food industry's demand for peanuts.    
<p>
The $119 million spent by the federal government on the peanut program annually doesn't even take into account the administrative fees. The  price tag for the peanut program exceeds $200 million when administrative costs are calculated.     
<p>
This subsidy must end.  Consumers and taxpayers must not foot the bill   for this absurd manipulation of our strong hallowed market economy. This shell game of peanut subsidies must be cracked wide open and stopped.

<h2>V-E Day Reflections
 </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>










 <P>
 





Omaha Beach Cemetery, V-E Day - Beneath a clear blue sky and endless 
rows of white marble crosses lie ten thousand of the boys who set out 
to win the war. 
 <P>
They fought their way onto the continent on D-Day, and then across it 
to the Rhine and victory.  They secured the beaches and the peace for 
us, giving up their chance to live life into their old age.  On V-E 
Day, 1945, a million cheering Brits gave thanks for their bravery, 
joining  hands to sing God Save the Queen to Winston Churchill and 
Queen Elizabeth, who stood on the balcony of Buckingham Palace. 
 <P>
For millions of people, though, V-E Day was not the end of anything.  
For Poles and Czechs and Eastern Europeans, it was neither the end, 
nor even the beginning of the end, of tyranny.  It was only the 
beginning of Stalin's occupation now that Hitler's was finished.  And 
this more brutal oppression would last 44 years instead of six. 
 <P>
Oscar Lindner, an Estonian refugee, survived both.  "The only 
difference between the Germans and the Russians," he explains, "was 
that Nazis come for people during the day; Communists deport people in 
the middle of the night." 
 <P>
How ironic it is that President Clinton was neither in England nor 
France on V-E Day, but in Moscow.  The Russians, of course, have much 
to celebrate 50 years after the end of their Great Patriotic War, from 
survival of the 900 day siege of Leningrad, to the hand-to-hand battle 
in the factories and sewers of Stalingrad, which won the war and saved 
the Motherland.  But they have just as much to atone for:  the 
massacre at Katyn of the Polish officer corps, the enslavement of half 
of Europe and the crushing of freedom in Hungary in 1956 and 
Czechoslovakia in 1968. 
 <P>
So V-E Day was not the end of the anguish.  The horror of Auschwitz 
was yet to be comprehended and some 40 years of communist oppression 
lay ahead. 
 <P>
But the end of European combat began to lift an enormous weight from 
minds and hearts of Americans.  Even for those too young to fight (I 
was 10 on V-E Day), the relief was real, for the war had been with us 
for most of our young lives.   
 <P>
War bulletins, ration coupons and black-out curtains had punctuated 
our days.  Around our supper table we learned about Pearl Harbor, U-
boats, D-Day and the Seigfreid Line.  My uncle, a private in 
Eisenhower's army, was somewhere in Europe.  But where?  Near a place 
called Bastogne, it turned out, where he grabbed a butcher's cleaver 
(which he fortunately never had to use) as he turned out to meet the 
Germans pouring through the Bulge. 
 <P>
Our understanding was sharpened by the media as well, by the movies, 
newsreels, and radio.  Ingrid Bergman in the swirling mists of 
Casablanca taught us devotion to a cause; so did John Wayne in fighter 
planes and foxholes.  The endless parade of Nazi officers assuring us 
they had ways of making us talk impressed our young minds with the 
terror of the police state, while Pathe News showed us Kamikaze 
fanaticism.  Over the BBC, Winston Churchill and the Battle of Britain 
inspired us:  "never have so many owed so much to so few...this was 
their finest hour!"  Vera Lynn's haunting "I'll be seeing you..." 
reminded us that sometimes the ending would not be happy, and The Best 
Years of Our Lives brought home all the tragedies of war.  
 <P>
World War II had taught us two lasting lessons:  through effort, good 
could triumph over evil, and that our entire nation could unite to 
meet a challenge.  We shared a common determination -- "the war 
effort" --  and a clear understanding of what evil was. 
 <P>
The final lesson is how quickly that clarity faded.  The further the 
war slips from memory, the more blurred our distinction between good 
and evil has become.  In 1945, no one was for the Nazis.  By 1950,  
lots of people questioned whether South Korea even mattered.  And by 
the time of Vietnam, Jane Fonda, our universities, and our media were 
on the other side.  The tyranny of the left became acceptable only 
twenty years after we had fought a great war to destroy tyrannies of 
the right. 
 <P>
The boys buried above the cliffs of Omaha Beach would never have 
understood that.  Their cause was to free the world from the evil of 
oppression.  Its clarity is engraved in the stone of their Memorial 
Chapel:   "Remember the glory of their spirit." 
 <P>
Remember, too, that in their glory they each gave up the chance to be 
what we are today. 
 
<P>

<h2>Public School Choice and Racial Balance</h2> 
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html">Pete du Pont</a>
</center> <P>
 <hr><p>
If you thought the Congressional elections of 1994 marked the end of 
liberalism and a new era of conservative government, look at what the 
education establishment is doing to school choice back home.  A 
current example comes from Delaware, where the State Board of 
Education has blunted a new public school choice law by insisting it 
comply with racial quotas.   
 <p>
In Delaware, all the traditional school improvements advocated by the 
education establishment and the teachers unions have been tried:  
smaller classes, higher teachers salaries, earlier education and, of 
course, spending more money.  Meanwhile, SAT scores have dropped 19 
points in 10 years, the National Assessment of Educational Progress 
test scores for math showed Delaware students 28th in the nation, and 
the state now has the highest percentage in the nation (20%) of 
students attending private schools. 
 <p>
But suddenly last summer two events created a surge of hope for 
Delaware parents.  Governor Thomas R. Carper signed a public school 
choice bill in July and a few weeks later Federal District Court Judge 
Sue L. Robinson lifted the controversial busing order that for 17 
years had decreed that a school's racial balance was more important 
than excellence, student achievement, or the individual needs of a 
child. 
 <p>
Now parents would be able to choose the public school (space 
permitting) their children would attend in September, 1996.  Freedom, 
opportunity and optimism were in the summer air. 
 <p>
But it was a false dawn.  On October 19th, just 66 days after Judge 
Robinson lifted the busing order, the empire struck back.  The State 
Board of Education and its top management strongly endorsed local 
school district policies subjugating school choice to racial quotas. 
 <p>
The "new freedom and opportunity" provided by choice, said State Board 
President Paul R. Fine, "must not be at the cost of diversity in our 
public schools."  Read that again, slowly.  Individual freedom and 
educational opportunity are subservient to something called 
"diversity," as defined by state government. 
 <p>
Such policies are the core of welfare state liberalism:  the 
government will decide just how much freedom and opportunity your 
children will be allowed, but in no case will it be so much as to 
upset the policies of the state.  A federal court ends busing to 
achieve racial balance in our schools?  Not to worry, it will be 
reinstated by order of the educational bureaucracy.  For above all, in 
Mr. Fine's words, "schools...must mirror the public they serve." 
 <p>
So much for scholarship.  So much for individual freedom.  And so much 
for the Constitution, which uses the word diversity not at all but 
speaks volumes about liberty and the unalienable right to pursue 
opportunity. 
 <p>
Several  school districts, including the state's largest, have already 
adopted policies that will deny a student's choice of school if it 
would upset the racial balance of the school.  So a de facto quota is 
now in place:  no whites may transfer into school A; or no more than a 
certain number of blacks will be allowed into school B.  Delaware's 
school assignment policies have regressed a full century, once again 
allocating students based upon the color of their skin. 
 <p>
Most disturbing, though, is the reasoning of the State Board.  The 
1977 District Court busing order, as mistaken as it was, prohibited 
the state from assigning pupils to schools in racially disparate 
numbers.  The Delaware State Board's policy forbids children from 
choosing to attend schools in a way that will result in racial 
disparity within them. 
 <p>
Over the years, the U.S. Supreme Court has held that the assignment of 
children to school by race was first permitted (Plessy v. Ferguson, 
1896); then forbidden (Brown v. Board of Education , 1954); and now 
constitutionally required (Swann v. Charlotte-Mecklenberg, 1971).  But 
these decisions all addressed the question of government assignment of 
children to schools.  The Delaware Board of Education has carried the 
policy a step further.  Now individuals may not choose to act in a way 
that does not "mirror" society. 
 <p>
It is not a new idea, of course. Soviet Russia and Communist China 
governed societies based upon the principle that the individual was 
subservient to the state. 
 <p>
But it is an interesting idea, particularly viewed in juxtaposition 
with Thomas Jefferson's view that "all men are created equal" and 
"endowed by their creator" (not the government) "with certain 
unalienable rights" (that is, unalienable by the government),  
"including the right to life, liberty and the pursuit of happiness."  
If memory serves, our Constitution was based upon Mr. Jefferson's 
vision.   
 <p>
Nevertheless, the educational bureaucracy grinds on, limiting 
students' pursuit of opportunity just when it should be adopting a 
more enlightened policy. 
 <p>
Why should government recoil from a straightforward policy with which 
every parent agrees:   no child will be denied admission to the school 
of their choice because of the color of their skin?

<h2>   
The Forbes Legacy   
 </h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Pete du Pont 
</a>
<p>


One great strength of the American political system - and one that no   
doubt baffles foreigners - is the way it brings people who are enemies   
one day  together as allies the next.  Just recently we saw Phil   
Gramm,  Lamar Alexander and Steve Forbes attacking Bob Dole in  Iowa   
and New Hampshire. But just a  few weeks later, Gramm, Alexander and   
Forbes all dropped out of the race and endorsed him.   
   <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

The flip side of this phenomenon is that Dole has suddenly  found   
merit in ideas put forward by his previous opponents.  Just a few   
short weeks ago, on March 4, Dole had  nothing good to say about the   
Forbes flat tax.  While campaigning in New York in advance of that   
state's primary, Dole strenuously  attacked the flat tax for   
eliminating deductions for mortgage  interest and charitable   
deductions, and for increasing the deficit. But now, Dole has   
apparently decided that the flat tax is not  a bad idea after all.  As   
the New York Times put it, "Mr. Dole is  now talking about a flat tax   
proposal of his own, something his  aides hint he would have announced   
sooner if Mr. Forbes had not  grabbed the issue first."   
   <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

While to some, such behavior may prove the fecklessness of American   
politicians, in truth it is an essential strength of  our system.    
Good ideas are not banished from the political  process just because   
they had the bad luck to be promoted by a  losing candidate.  On the   
contrary, like flowers in the desert, they bloom again and again.  In   
fact, competition for ideas  generally works the same way as   
competition for goods in the  marketplace.  The best tend to prevail   
despite adversity.   
   <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

The fact is that ideas often win by losing. Norman Thomas, the   
Socialist candidate for  president in the 1930s, was one of the most   
unsuccessful  candidates in history, yet virtually all of his   
proposals - higher taxes, old age pensions, public power and flood   
control, and unemployment insurance - were ultimately adopted by the   
Democratic Party and enacted into law.   On the conservative side,   
Barry Goldwater's losing campaign in  1964 was equally "successful",   
although not until his ideas were adopted after the election of    
Ronald Reagan 16 years later.      
   <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

My own experience in the 1988 campaign proves the point.  My proposal   
for school choice, opposed by Bush, Dole, Kemp and, of course, all the   
Democrats, is now Republican policy, and is even being enacted in some   
communities and states across the country.  Similarly, a market-based   
alternative to Social Security, ridiculed as a "nutty" idea, has,   
thanks to Steve Forbes, become a mainstream economic issue.   
   <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

Steve Forbes will find similar vindication.  Although widely dismissed   
as an iconoclastic, unimportant candidate, many of his ideas - like   
the  flat tax that Bob Dole is already moving toward endorsing - will   
be around for a long time to come   
  <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
 
Although the flat tax was Forbes' most visible idea, it was  not his   
only idea.  He also spoke eloquently about the need to make the dollar   
as good as gold,  about ending political careerism with term limits,   
and about  privatizing Social Security.  Indeed, the very fact that he   
was not vilified for suggesting the latter idea, as Barry Goldwater    
was, may be the most important development of the 1996 campaign.  As   
Sherlock Holmes once observed, the significant event was the dog that   
didn't bark.   
   <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

Social Security has long been known as the "third rail" of  American   
politics because every politician who ever suggested  privatization   
suffered the same fate as those who touch the  electrified third rail   
of a subway.  But times are changing.  Because of demographics there   
are fewer people every year who get a good deal out of Social Security   
and more  who have little expectation of receiving anything.  As a   
result,  even the American Association of Retired Persons is said to   
be  sympathetic to some option that would allow younger workers to set   
aside some of their payroll taxes in a private savings account.  The   
Social Security Advisory Council is expected to make a similar   
recommendation in a few weeks.   
   <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

Steve Forbes may never run for president again and his run  this year   
may never warrant more than a footnote in history, but if Bob Dole -   
or even Bill Clinton - proposes a flat tax next year, or if  Congress   
moves toward some kind of private alternative to Social  Security,   
Forbes will deserve some of the credit.  For if nothing  else, his was   
a campaign about ideas.     
   <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

And as Ronald Reagan reminded us, ideas have consequences.     
 <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<h2>As In Israel, We Need to Tone Down Rhetoric</h2> 
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 


The murder of Israeli Prime Minister Yitzhak Rabin by an extreme 
Israeli nationalist should be a warning to all political groups that 
words have consequences. Since the signing of the first peace accord 
with the Palestinians in 1993, some opponents of the agreement have 
attacked Rabin in the most vicious and personal terms. Rabin was 
depicted as a traitor to his country, a murderer, even a Nazi SS 
officer.
<p>
Vilifying political opponents isn't unique to Israeli politics, nor 
are the dangers that go with such angry rhetoric. In recent months 
Democrats in Congress have called Republicans "worse than Hitler" and 
accused them of "practicing genocide with a smile." Meanwhile, 
Republicans have called Democrats "the enemy  of normal Americans," 
and the right-leaning National Rifle Association has portrayed federal 
law enforcement agents as jack-booted storm troopers.
<p>
The First Amendment gives us the right to call each other Nazis or 
enemies, but constitutional protection doesn't make it right. 
Responsible leaders have an obligation to refrain from engaging in 
such tactics and to discourage the behavior among their supporters. 
That doesn't mean we have to stifle political debate. The danger on 
any issue comes when the focus of criticism shifts from disparaging 
the policy to demonizing the policymakers. That dangerous game can 
have deadly consequences.
<p>
There seems to be a growing tendency to portray our political 
opponents not only as wrong but evil. When Democrats attack 
Republicans, they portray them as  callous and greedy, wanting to take 
food from the mouths of poor children to give money to the rich. 
Republicans engage in similar demonization, calling Democrats un-
American and immoral.
<p>
Politicians poison public debate when they turn policy differences 
into attacks on their opponents' character, ethics, patriotism and 
morality. What's more, they make legitimate compromise more difficult 
-- and public cynicism inevitable.
<p>
What will happen when the Democrats and Republicans agree on a budget 
-- as they must eventually? What will happen when the Congress reverts 
to Democratic control -- or a Republican occupies the White House? 
Will any of these events portend national disaster? Do they justify a 
revolution?
<p>
One of the saving graces of American politics has been its centrist 
nature. The ideological difference between Republicans and Democrats 
has never been as great as between the Conservative and Labor parties 
in England, not to mention as wide as the chasm that separates neo-
fascist and pro-communist groups in other European democracies.
<p>
Following Rabin's assassination, Benjamin Netanyahu, the leader of the 
opposition Likud Party in Israel and a critic of Rabin's peace plan, 
said the most important thing Israelis could do was to pull together 
as a nation and a people.
<p>
Americans face no crisis comparable to the Israelis' at the moment, 
but Netanyahu's advice could serve us well nonetheless. We've had our 
share of extremist individuals - on both the right and the left - who 
have engaged not only in assassinations but domestic terrorism.
<p>
Politicians in Israel, especially on the right, will be soul-searching 
to determine whether their words might have incited extremists in 
their midst to violence. We could do with some similar examination of 
conscience here at home.

<P>     
   
BETHESDA, Md. -- Has America embraced a "culture of death" as Pope   
John Paul II warned on a visit here in 1993?   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
A recent USA TODAY/CNN/GALLUP poll showing some 75% of Americans   
support so-called assisted suicide suggests the pope may be right.   
Most Americans who support "the right to die" -- including the   
ghoulish Dr. Jack Kevorkian, acquitted Tuesday of two counts of   
assisted suicide, and the judges in two recent appeals court cases in   
Washington and New York -- claim to be motivated by compassion. After   
all, they are only supporting people who want to end their own lives.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
But before the courts and the public get too enamored of this   
incipient movement, perhaps they ought to take a close look at what's   
happened in the Netherlands, the only Western nation that formally   
endorses the idea of physicians helping patients kill themselves.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
The Dutch have nearly a quarter century of experience with physician-  
assisted suicide and euthanasia. In 1990 a Dutch government commission   
conducted a survey, which showed that euthanasia is far more widely   
practiced in the Netherlands than officials had believed and that it   
is most frequently administered without patients' consent.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
According to the report of the Dutch commission, 11,800 patients were   
euthanized in 1990 through active measures, most often by   
administering lethal drugs, and 5,941 of these were performed without   
the patient's consent. Only 400 patients opted for assisted suicide.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
The commission also reported an additional 13,506 patients were denied   
"nonfutile medical treatment with intention to terminate life," a   
practice the Dutch call "euthanasia by omission" because it denies   
lifesaving treatment. And the great majority of these cases, 64%,   
involved persons who had given no prior consent to such a fate through   
a living will or other document.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
The Netherlands is a tiny country, with a population of only about 15   
million. To put these euthanasia figures in some perspective, a   
comparable euthanasia rate in the United States would result in nearly   
200,000 deaths from active measures and another 225,000 from   
euthanasia by omission.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
Once embarked down the path of doctor-assisted suicide, that may be   
where we are headed.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
The Dutch didn't start out to practice euthanasia so widely, but once   
doctors started killing patients rather than treating them, the slide   
into mass murder was relatively easy. A recent article by a Dutch   
physician, Richard Fenigsen, in the journal Issues in Law and Medicine   
explains why "Euthanasia is not just changing medicine; it is   
replacing medicine. This suppression of traditional medical thinking,   
medical working habits, and the medical way of reacting to events has   
an impact on both the emergency care and the long-term care of   
patients," he writes.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
Fenigsen describes several case studies. In one teaching hospital,   
anesthetists stopped providing anesthesia for cardiac surgery   
involving Down's syndrome patients. In other cases, hospitals and   
doctors refused to apply simple, lifesaving measures to patients whose   
lives they determined were "unlivable."   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
In one case, a physician did not administer insulin to a 6-year-old,   
mildly retarded boy who developed juvenile diabetes, thereby causing   
his death. In another, a doctor persuaded an elderly woman to stop   
taking medicine needed to treat an enlarged heart because she was   
living a "limited life" -- she depended on several medications, needed   
help cleaning her house, and could walk only a few blocks at a time.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
In all, 65% of Dutch doctors believe that physicians may propose   
active euthanasia to patients who do not ask for it themselves,   
according to Dutch surveys.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
"Euthanasia has perceptibly affected the position of the individual in   
relation to society, society's very nature and purpose, the law, the   
government, the judicial system, the family, the expectations of older   
persons and the prospects of newborn infants, the practice of   
medicine, and the care of persons with disabilities," Fenigsen writes.   
<BR>    
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;   
What has happened in the Netherlands could easily happen here if we   
allow it.

<html><head><title>du Pont: The Failure of Protectionism -- 4/04/96
 </title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><i>Thursday, April 4, 1996 </i><h2> The Failure of Protectionism 
</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html">Pete du Pont </a><P>

 

 
The Great Wall of China dates from the Ming dynasty (1368-
1644), but successive invasions from the North proved that 
it had no more military utility than the "impregnable" 
Maginot Line did for the French in 1940.  Gunpowder and 
artillery long ago had rendered castle walls useless too.   
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The failure of walls to provide military security has not 
discouraged a tough-talking Pat Buchanan from centering his 
presidential campaign around trade walls to enhance our 
economic security.  Unfortunately, economic walls make no 
more sense in the modern world than do castle walls for 
military protection.   
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Logic rejects protectionism, for a wider choice of goods at 
varying  prices benefits consumers.  Experience has backed 
up the logic.  The 1930s, of course, are exhibit A.  To save 
jobs, two Republicans, Representative Willis C. Hawley of 
Oregon and Senator Reed Smoot of Utah, crafted a bill to 
raise a massive tax wall around the U.S. economy.  Signed 
into law in 1930 by another Republican, President Herbert C. 
Hoover, foreign trade plummeted, handsomely aided by the 
retaliatory tax burdens erected by other governments.  The 
ensuing mass unemployment and desperation throughout the 
industrial world led to dictators and semi-dictators, who, 
in turn, took the steps from trade war to actual war.  
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Learning this lesson, 1945's victorious allies were 
determined to work to reduce tariffs and eliminate other 
barriers to international cooperation.  The much-denounced 
GATT, or General Agreement on Trade and Tariffs, was the 
primary means chosen to promote open international trade.  
To be sure, multilateral agreements have blemishes and raise 
sovereignty issues, but there is no gain saying that GATT has 
worked.  World trade has been kept relatively open and now 
tops $4 trillion per year in merchandise alone, not to 
mention an enormous daily volume in services, investments 
and financial transactions across national borders.   
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Not that economic logic and facts are likely to deter a 
bellicose Pat Buchanan.  It is easy to arouse tribal 
resentment, but a wall around U.S. business is the last way 
in the world to appease Americans' longing for a better 
life.  Protecting companies from competition will not make 
us rich.  On the contrary, open trading, both foreign and 
domestic, is the key to wealth.  We should make trade 
easier, not harder.   
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Protection may work in a distorted way in the short run, 
holding a few visible jobs in companies that would otherwise 
"rightsize" or disappear.  But it cannot work in the long 
run to boost jobs and wages.  Protectionism rewards the 
inefficient and penalizes the efficient.  As economist 
Ludwig von Mises put it, "The history of mankind is a long 
record of obstacles placed in the way of the more efficient 
for the benefit of the less efficient."  A few politically 
visible jobs are protected by interference at the cost of 
many better-paying jobs destroyed elsewhere. 
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Over the longer run, government protection fails to create 
jobs and prosperity in the most protected industries.  Take 
the maritime industry, for example.  Once a great seafaring 
nation, the United States became much less competitive 
during the 20th century.  Heavily subsidized and unionized, 
our domestic maritime trade is completely reserved to 
American-built, American-owned and American-crewed vessels.  
The consequence has been high-priced monopoly service 
between U.S. ports, costing consumers higher prices for 
goods and, yes, costing U.S. sailors their jobs. 
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
How has the maritime industry fared under its 75-year 
protected monopoly created by the Jones Act of 1920?   In 
1950, the U.S. flag fleet consisted of a thousand ships; a 
half-century of subsidy later, there are less than 200.  In 
1950, U.S. flag vessels carried 43% of America's foreign 
trade; today they carry less than 4%.  In 1950, 57,000 
Americans had jobs in our merchant fleet; today less than 
9,000 go  to sea in U.S. flag ships.   
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A 1991 International Trade Commission study put the 
inefficiency costs of the Jones Act at $3.6 billion to $9.8 
billion annually. 
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Protectionism simply cannot work.  Technologies and 
industries rise and fall, expand and contract, come and go.  
The reasons are diverse but foreign competition is  one of 
the minor factors in our huge, global-size economy.  
Economic change is an asset, not a liability, as new 
technologies and cost reductions bring wider consumer 
choice.  We have nothing to fear from better or cheaper 
foreign products.    
 <BR> &#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
 Centuries ago, the English King Canute stood at the water's 
edge and forbade the tide to come in.  He was no more 
successful than America can be in trying to keep out foreign 
goods and services in the age of the Internet and global 
economics.  The daily ebb and flow of the tides is central 
to global ecology, just as trade is to a global economy.

DENVER INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT:  WHAT WENT WRONG 
 By: Thomas Schatz, President, Citizens Against Government Waste 
 

This past March, the Council for Citizens Against Government Waste 
(CCAGW) held a regional taxpayers' conference in Denver.  It's ironic 
that the leading group fighting waste had to fly into a prime example 
of why America is currently strangled by a $4.8 trillion national debt 
-- the new Denver International Airport (DIA).  Assessing what went 
wrong with the Denver Airport is critically important.    

According to the House Appropriations Subcommittee on Transportation 
and the General Accounting Office (GAO), $685 million will be spent by 
the federal government on the Denver Airport through fiscal year (FY) 
2001.  Every single dollar of this $685 million will be wasted.   This 
is not an overstatement because this airport was not needed.  Plain 
and simple.  Stapleton Airport could have been upgraded to accommodate 
any larger planes that might land in Denver in the future.  Extending 
runways at Stapleton would have been inexpensive and quick.  But 
because this country has an edifice complex, a new structure had to be 
built.  When a family has a tight budget, they don't go to the opera 
or drive an expensive car.  The federal government has to realize that 
we cannot afford luxuries, especially when there isn't a need for such 
a luxury. 
 
Just as the federal government has become adept at deficits, so will 
DIA.  The GAO projected a cumulative operating deficit of  $230 
million by its February opening.  
 
The DIA is government waste -- at its worst.  DIA is not an example of 
pork-barrel waste.  The kind of government waste that occurred in 
Denver is more insidious.  The back-room politicking and the 
misinformation that occurred is an embarrassment to the federal 
government as well as the local government.   

The new 53-square-mile airport is larger than the District of 
Columbia.  The airport is 25 miles from downtown.  A cab ride will 
increase from $7 to Stapleton to $50 to DIA.  There is currently no 
supporting infrastructure to serve the new airport.  Access to rental 
cars and hotels is extremely difficult.  These are the general 
problems.  Here are the specific problems with DIA.   

The public was shut out of the process, and no user or public needs 
were defined or documented.  The politicians limited the vote to the 
core city, or about 10 percent of airport users.  Denver is a 
relatively small city of 460,000, down six percent in population in 
the 1980's.  Denver is not among the top 400 cities worldwide, yet the 
city set out to build the "World's Largest Airport."  Only about 70 
gates out of 200 are actually in operation at DIA.  A dozen or so 
gates are not in operation because of a lack of covered jetways.  Thus 
incoming flights are delayed.  
 
The Denver Airport has come to symbolize the reckless manner in which 
federal construction is carried out in America.  Because the airport 
is eligible for formula grants, money is not awarded based on merit.  
If this were a project that was being funded by a private financial 
institution, more scrutiny would have gone into the planning, 
implementation and construction of this airport.  The federal 
government should not be providing an open checkbook for construction 
based on the fact that it creates jobs.   The $685 million that the 
federal government will spend through 2001 could mean $1,489 in tax 
relief for every resident of Denver. 

There was no need for a new airport in Denver.  During the 1986-1989 
planning period, Denver's share of the U.S. air travel market dropped 
53 percent -- from 3.8 percent in 1986 to 2.57 percent in 1990 (1994 
is estimated at 2.6 percent).  However, during those years, the 
Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) and Denver forecast that DIA 
would be the fastest-growing airport in the U.S., with 50 million 
passengers by 1995, and the second-busiest by 2000.  According to the 
Air Transportation Association (ATA), Denver also dropped from 8th to 
19th in U.S air cargo tonnage during the past five years.  The ATA has 
never included Denver in the "Table of Top 30 U.S. Domestic Air Travel 
Markets."  Top listings are high population cities and vacation 
centers.  Denver is neither. 
 
According to Mayor Pea in Volume I of the 1987 Airport Report, 
"Stapleton had the best history of low delays.  Stapleton was ranked 
number five in traffic and number nine in delays."  The Pea 
administration in 1988 decided to trash Stapleton, then one of the 
best airports in the world, to build a totally new airport for $1.5 
billion.  Mr. Pea's 1989 Airport Report claimed "Stapleton was grid 
locking the nation," and by 1996 "is expected to lead the delay list 
with 158,000 hours annually."   Federal funding for DIA was to be $500 
million, and the "Stapleton site would be disposed of over several 
years to raise more than a half-billion dollars."   The projected cost 
is now more than $4.9 billion.   

The bottom line is:  DIA is expensive and unnecessary.  The new Denver 
Airport should not have been built.  The way that it was built is an 
embarrassment to representative government at all levels.   
 
What will the real losses be at DIA?  How soon will the losses eat up 
the reserves set aside to pay the bondholders?  Who will pay for the 
bailout -- the city and county of Denver, Colorado's taxpayers, or the 
federal government?  Who will be left holding the bag when this 
airport fails?  The American taxpayer will be left in the lurch again.

<h2>Walt Disney Co. - Porn pushers</h2>


By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"> Kathleen Howley</a>
</center><p>
<hr>
<p>
Wall Street was dazzled by the recent $19 billion merger of Walt 
Disney Company and Capital Cities/ABC -- the second-largest take-over 
in history. 
<p>
Pundits said it was a good deal for the American entertainment 
industry. But, something tells me that 'ol Walt is rolling over in his 
grave.  
<p>
Not because ABC has a reputation for in-your-face bad taste. Yes, 
these are the people who gave us the jaw-dropping venom of Roseanne, 
and the steaming story lines of NYPD Blue, billed as television's 
first R-rated series. 
<p>
And, you'll notice that through it all, ABC continues to bill 
themselves as the "family station." 
<p>
But, the problem isn't with ABC. It's with Disney. 
<p>
When it comes to down-and-dirty porn pushers, you won't find many who 
have stooped as low as the Walt Disney Company has over the past year. 
<p>
No, I'm not talking about the R-rated anti-Catholic movie "Priest," 
described in one magazine as having "the best gay sex scenes in a non-
pornographic film."  
<p>
It's much worse than that. It's a movie called "Kids," recently 
released by Disney's wholly-owned subsidiary, Miramax -- the same 
people who gave us "Priest." 
<p>
It details the sexual experiences of 13- to 16-year-old New York 
teenagers. And, it's not a pretty picture.  
<p>
According to Reuters and the Associated Press, even a few hard-to-faze 
movie reviewers looked a bit taken aback as they left a pre-release 
showing at the Cannes film festival several months ago.  
<p>
One critic branded it "kiddie porn." The board who rates Hollywood 
movies agreed with him. 
<p>
They gave it an NC-17 rating, the new category that means not quite an 
X-rated movie, but almost. Miramax, fearing the stigma of an NC-17 
rating, chose to release the film unrated, which means it won't be 
running in as many theaters, but will still make the full rounds of 
video stores in its afterlife. 
<p>
The film opens with the main character, a promiscuous skateboarding 
teen named Telly, having sex with a 14-year-old girl. Later, he 
relates the entire scene in vulgar details to his buddy. As it turns 
out, seducing virgins is Telly's idea of "safe sex." 
<p>
It gets worse. Reviewers report that during a party sequence filled 
with explicit sex, a teenage girl passes out, high on drugs, and is 
raped by one of Telly's friends. 
<p>
Yes, that's right. This is the Walt Disney Company we're talking about 
-- the same people who created "101 Dalmations."  
<p>
Now, they've joined the lowest segment of the America media, intent on 
warping the minds of teenagers by linking sex with violence. 
<p>
"Kids" is showing in major cities across the country. And, it's a 
qualified hit. When it premiered, it broke the house records for 
weekend box office grosses at two New York City theaters.  
<p>
There have been a few naysayers, but most reviewers have been positive 
-- probably the same ones who praised "Priest."  
<p>
First-time director Larry Clark, 53, is getting plenty of media 
attention for "Kids." A July 26 profile in the New York Times 
reported: "The success of the film is allowing Mr. Clark to plan 
future movies."  
<p>
The profile doesn't mention Clark's well-documented background as a 
kiddie porn photographer. You have to read a publication such as the 
July issue of the "American Family Association Journal" to get the 
revolting details on that. (P.O. Drawer 2440, Tupelo, MS 38803) 
<p>
Clark is already talking about beginning his next film, which will 
focus on kids, sex, and suicide -- a theme that reoccurs in many of 
his porn photographs. He says he sees the new film as part two of a 
trilogy. 
<p>
So, why is Disney giving a platform to a psychopath? Because Clark's 
film is going to make money. That's why Disney dropped its standards 
almost a decade ago and began making R-rated films, hiding behind 
subsidiary companies. The long list of Disney-funded R-rated films 
seems tame, now, compared to their new ventures. 
<p>
Money. That's all that interests Disney chairman Michael Eisner, 
described by the New York Times as "one of the most ferociously 
ambitious people in Hollywood." 
<p>
Money enough to buy a television network, and create a media empire. 
Money enough to earn Eisner more than $10 million in salary and 
bonuses last year. 
<p>
Poor Mickey. Once, he was the most respectable mouse in the world. 
Now, he works for a porn pusher.

<title>Chavez: Culture Fails a Child -- And A Teacher 
 -- 03/27/96

<h2> 
Culture Fails A Child -- and A Teacher 
</h2> 
 
 
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html"> 
Linda Chavez 
</a> 
 
<P>   

BETHESDA, Md. -- She was a 45-year-old special education teacher, a   
wife and the mother of a 6-year-old boy. He was a troubled teen-ager   
who desperately wanted a gold Toyota Camry for his 17th birthday.   
Their paths crossed at a shopping center in Toms River, N.J., where   
the teacher drove her 1995 gold Camry to buy a sandwich on her way to   
a college exam.  
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
That chance encounter ended both their lives. The teacher was buried   
last week. The boy sits in jail, awaiting trial for murder and   
carjacking. As tragic as this incident was, it wouldn't have attracted   
much attention were it not for one difference. The teacher, Kathleen   
Weinstein, surreptitiously recorded the last half-hour of her life,   
which she spent counseling, cajoling and pleading with the teen-ager.   
The recording led police to the boy, Michael LaSane.  
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Unlike the 35,000 attempted or completed carjackings that take place   
each year, this one became a national story when bits of the   
transcript were printed in newspapers across the nation.  
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Most of the attention has focused on Weinstein, a remarkable woman   
right down to her last minutes on Earth. But it's her alleged   
assailant -- and the thousands like him -- we must begin to focus on.   
What is it that motivates a teen-ager to kill an innocent stranger?   
What can we do to prevent such horrors? Sure, we need tougher laws,   
more policemen and more prisons. But we also need to admit that   
something has gone very wrong with our culture when so many young   
people have no regard for human life and do not seem even to   
understand the difference between right and wrong.  
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Weinstein's alleged assailant doesn't quite fit our image of a killer.   
Yes, like 70% of young men who commit violent crimes, he comes from a   
single-parent household, and he lives in public housing, where crime   
is all too common. But his mother works in law enforcement, and his   
family is described by friends as God-fearing churchgoers. And while   
Michael had been in trouble with the police before, nothing about his   
record indicates he was capable of such cold-blooded violence.  
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
What is known about Michael is that he was obsessed with owning a   
shiny new car. He talked about it incessantly to his friends,   
describing how he was saving to buy his dream. It is a fantasy that   
consumes most teen-agers, reinforced dozens of times a day by TV ads   
that equate owning a new car with success, physical attractiveness and   
even intelligence.  
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And it's not just cars; it's all manner of material things we're told   
we can't live without. The young are especially susceptible to such   
messages, particularly since so many young people have nothing -- no   
one -- countering such influences in their lives. Increasing numbers   
of fathers are missing altogether from their children's lives, and   
mothers are spending less and less time caring for their children.  
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One-third of American children are now born to single mothers, and   
half of all children will spend part of their childhoods without   
fathers. About 70% of mothers of young children now work outside the   
home and often are so tired when they come home there's no energy left   
over to provide the consistent discipline and moral education children   
need.  
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Schools no longer teach right from wrong, either. For decades,   
intellectuals have claimed there are no absolutes - everything is   
relative, governed by the circumstances.  
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In one young man's case, the situation was clear. He had to have a   
gold Camry. He bragged he was getting it for his birthday. In her last   
few minutes, Mrs. Weinstein couldn't teach lessons the whole culture   
had failed to teach this boy in a lifetime.

HEADLINE: Minimum wage: Bad idea GOP fears to fight 
 
BETHESDA, Md. -- Republicans may as well run a white flag up the 
Capitol flagpole if the current debate over a minimum-wage hike is any 
indication of their resolve to retain congressional power this fall. 
The Republican leadership seems to have given up even trying to make 
the case against raising the minimum wage. The leaders know the 
Democrats' proposal to increase the federal minimum wage 20% over two 
years, to $ 5.15 per hour, is bad policy, but they're scared to death 
of the politics of the issue. 
 <BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
That's why 24 moderate Republicans have already broken ranks with the 
leadership and offered their own -- higher -- minimum-wage bill. 
 <BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
But sacrificing policy to politics is usually a bad bargain, even in 
an election year. 
 <BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
There's no question that raising the minimum wage is popular. Recent 
polls show that about 8 in 10 voters favor the proposed increase. Most 
people can't imagine living on the current $ 4.25 an hour minimum, 
much less supporting a family on such low wages. 
 <BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
And rightfully so, since so few workers actually do support themselves 
or families at minimum-wage jobs. 
 <BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Of the approximately 2 million workers -- out of a national workforce 
of nearly 140 million -- who earn $ 4.25 or less an hour, 53% are 
younger than 25 years of age. Most minimum-wage workers today are 
secondary earners who come from middle-class families, often students 
who work part time. 
 <BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Almost as many current minimum-wage workers live in families earning 
more than $ 50,000 a year as live in poor households. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Of course, increasing the minimum by 90 cents an hour will enlarge the 
universe of minimum-wage workers, covering an additional 8 million 
workers who earn up to $ 5.15 an hour, many of whom are older and more 
likely to support families. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
But it won't necessarily improve their economic opportunities. Most 
economists agree that raising the minimum wage will cost jobs; the 
only real question is how many. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Secretary of Labor Robert Reich has been touting a couple of studies 
that dispute decades of research in this area, most notably a study 
involving fast-food restaurants in New Jersey and California by 
Princeton economists David Card and Alan Krueger (who served for a 
while as Reich's chief economist). The Card/Krueger study purported to 
show that New Jersey's state minimum-wage hike to $ 5.05 per hour, one 
of the highest in the nation, did not lead to job losses. But the 
study now has been largely discounted by everyone but its authors and 
Reich. 
 <BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The New Jersey findings were based on data obtained from carelessly 
worded telephone surveys and were subsequently disproved by other 
economists who examined actual payroll records in the state. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Nonetheless, most Republicans have been intimidated into silence. The 
best the leadership now hopes for is to attach the proposal to 
legislation Republicans want and Democrats don't, thereby either 
sinking the bill or exacting a price for its passage. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Perhaps the most cynical political move of all, however, came from the 
24 maverick House Republicans who last week announced their own bill 
to increase the federal minimum wage to $ 5.25 an hour. Most of them 
come from high-wage states in the Northeast with tight labor markets 
where it is almost impossible to hire someone at the minimum wage. 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
These states have been losing jobs to lower-wage states in the South 
and West for years. 
 But if Congress increases the minimum wage nationally, these states 
won't be at such a competitive disadvantage. What these Republican 
legislators seem to be saying (if not in so many words) is that if 
their districts must lose jobs, why not share the pain? 
<BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Republicans have nothing to gain by backing a minimum-wage increase -- 
and a lot to lose. 
 <BR>  
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
If the Republicans cave on this issue, it will cost jobs -- including, 
no doubt, those of some Republican members of Congress who will have shown they lack the courage of their own convictions.

<h2>The 1996 Election:  A Choice of Visions</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>  
 <p>

The football season and the State of the Union message are behind us.  
In another few weeks the election of 1996 will be upon us.  In these 
few days of calm before the Iowa caucus, we need to reflect upon the 
social and political transitions of our times and how they impact the 
November elections. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;We live in a society that is being transformed by forces largely 
outside of our control.  We are caught in a transition from the old 
industrial, hierarchical, mass production society to the individualism 
of an Information Age. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of course, it is not our nation's first transition.  Historians tell 
us that there have been three American Republics.  The first stretched 
from the adoption of the Constitution in 1789 to the Civil War.  We 
might call that the Age of Federalism, a time of decentralized 
government power with a strong emphasis on individual responsibility. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Second Republic lasted until the Great Depression of the 1930s.  
It was a time of growing federal power and involvement in our lives.  
We might call it the Age of Government Expansion.  
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Third Republic was the political, governmental and social 
transformation created by the New Deal.  This one's easy to tag:  it 
was the Age of the Welfare State. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The beginning of the end of the New Deal era came with the election of 
Ronald Reagan in 1980.  But the actual end of liberalism came 14 years 
later -- after the collapse of communism as an organizing principle of 
society - when control of the U.S. House of Representatives passed 
into conservative hands. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the words of MIT professor Rudi Dornbusch:  "Statism has had its 
time on the stage.  Pervasive regulation, public-sector enterprises, a 
bloated welfare state with crushing tax burdens of those who work - 
and absurd levels of subsidies for those who don't - have failed as 
effective alternatives to decentralized decision-making...." 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So the election of 1996 is not about Bob Dole or Bill Clinton, the 
elimination of the Commerce Department, or Haiti, Hooters or hand-gun 
control.  The election of 1996 is about a choice of visions to guide 
us in the Fourth Republic. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;First is the choice between collective and individual decision-making.  
Will the government make decisions for you, or will you make your own 
decisions?  The resolution of this conflict will determine whether you 
or the government will invest your retirement savings, whether you or 
the  
government will decide which school your child attends, whether you or 
the government will decide which doctor you see. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The welfare statist says it is better that government make these 
decisions for us; the advocates of liberty believe we are capable of 
making them for ourselves. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second choice is whether equality or freedom will be the core of 
our vision.  The liberal vision worries that if people are allowed to 
be free, they will become unequal, and that will be unfair.  So 
government must count outcomes by race, hue, gender, age, sexual 
preference, etc., and then enforce remedial policies to make sure that 
no group gains relative to any other. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The conservative vision, by contrast, recognizes that whenever 
equality has been the driving force, freedom has been the first 
casualty.  The advocates of liberty believe the individual should be 
free to go as far as his or her efforts, talents and energy will 
allow, regardless of race, color or creed. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Finally, there is the choice of whether the state or the individual 
should be held responsible for moral conduct and the spiritual 
dimension of our lives.  The liberal vision sees the state as the 
repository of virtue and therefore responsible for morality.  When 
something goes wrong it is the fault of the state, not the individual, 
so the state must act.  Conversely, the conservative vision sees the 
individual as responsible for his or her own actions, and the sum of 
these actions sets society's moral course. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In any transition the challenge for political leaders is not to stop 
it - they cannot - but to advance a vision for that transformation 
compatible with our constitutional traditions of liberty, justice, and 
limited government. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;President Clinton's vision reflects the faith in government of the 
Third Republic.  His veto pen has struck down a balanced budget and a 
reform of welfare as we know it.  His top domestic priority is to 
ensure that the government is "never, ever" shut down again. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But by its very nature an accelerating flow of information is 
decentralizing, increasing individual power and choices.  It will 
transform not only our lives, but our government as well.  The 
conservative vision, anchored in the liberty established by the 
Founding Fathers in the First Republic, is the only one compatible 
with the individualism demanded by an information society. 
 
<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Choosing between these competing visions for the Fourth Republic is 
what the 1996 election is all about.

<title>du Pont: Reviving The Growth Agenda -- 3/28/96</title>

<h2>
Reviving The Growth Agenda
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Pete du Pont 
</a>

<P>
The campaigns of Steve Forbes and Pat Buchanan resonated with voters 
this primary season  because they were the only two candidates running 
who directly addressed the problem of economic growth.  Inside the 
Beltway everything seems fine - and why not?  Bill Clinton has created 
lots of employment for policy wonks, with his everchanging agenda of 
plans to nationalize health care, raise taxes, and pay people to 
become "volunteers."  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But out in the real world things are not so rosy. The latest 
government data confirm what voters see: the economy is flat;  there 
is little economic growth.  In the fourth quarter, real GDP grew less 
than 1 percent.  In all of 1995 the economy only grew about 2 percent 
- down sharply from the 3.5 percent rate registered in 1994.  In fact, 
during the three years of Clinton's presidency, growth has only 
averaged about 2.6 percent per year.  The Clinton Administration would 
have us believe that two and a half percent annual growth is fine, 
maybe the best we can do.  In fact, the administration warns against 
efforts to raise the growth rate because it would be inflationary.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But not so long ago we did a lot better.  Real  growth averaged 3.4 
percent per year for eight years of the Reagan administration - 
including the effects of a deep recession.  If we leave out the 
recession and look only at the last six years of the Reagan 
Administration, real GDP growth averaged 4.5 percent per year.  And 
this was accomplished while inflation fell from 12.5 percent in 1980 
to just 1.1 percent in 1986.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
So the lesson of the 1980s is that it is possible to have faster 
growth - well above the two and a half percent rate that Clinton's 
economists tell us is the best we can do - without inflation.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
How did Reagan do it?  He did it by reducing the burden of government.  
Taxes were cut, the growth of spending was scaled back, and the burden 
of regulation was slashed.  Taxes fell from 19.6 percent of GDP in 
1980 to 18.9 percent in 1988.  Outlays fell from 22.3 percent to 22.1 
percent over the same period.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But perhaps even more important was Reagan's assault on federal 
regulation.  According to Professor Thomas Hopkins of the Rochester 
Institute of Technology, the cost of federal regulation fell from 11.3 
percent of GDP in 1980 to 8.1 percent in 1988.  In other words, the 
reduction in the burden of regulation during the Reagan years was far 
greater than the reduction in the fiscal burden.  Since 1988, 
unfortunately, the burden of regulation has risen again and is now 
back to 9 percent of GDP, according to Prof. Hopkins.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
So why are Republicans so reluctant to defend the overwhelming 
economic success of the Reagan years?  Many have bought the liberal 
line that growth was bought "on credit" with higher deficits, and that 
Reagan's tax cuts were a giveaway to the rich that only increased 
income inequality.  This started with President Bush, who always 
seemed somewhat embarrassed by Reagan - it is hard to know how else to 
interpret the "kinder and gentler" line in his inaugural address. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The consequence is, as economist Paul Craig Roberts points out, that 
Republicans have handicapped themselves in addressing the growth issue 
because they neither understand the Reagan record nor are willing to 
defend it with enthusiasm.  Moderate Republicans have become so 
obsessed with the budget deficit that they are incapable of looking at 
tax cuts except as a loss of revenue. In spite of the Reagan growth 
record, lower taxes only  equal higher deficits in their limited, 
accountant's mentality.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To be sure, the House and Senate have voted to cut the capital gains 
tax and scale back regulation.  But at the first sign of resistance 
from the Clinton Administration, Republicans  backed off.  Apparently, 
in their heart of hearts, many agree that cutting the capital gains 
tax only enriches the rich, and that more government regulation is 
necessary to protect the environment, schools, and various economic 
constituencies.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Into this self-created Republican vacuum stepped Pat Buchanan and 
Steve Forbes.  Buchanan's message of isolation and trade protection  
is a false vision, and a counterproductive approach to economic 
malaise.  But Pat offered solutions, and  it is a political fact of 
life that even bad ideas will beat no ideas every time.  Steve's ideas 
of hope, growth, and opportunity were much stronger, and offer a way 
out of the current Republican malaise.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Growing the economy - creating jobs, new businesses and opportunities 
- is neither impossible nor dangerous.  President Kennedy did it with 
tax cuts.  President Reagan did it with tax cuts, slower spending 
growth, and deregulation.   It worked twice and it will work again - 
if Republicans will just do it.

An Insight Look
 By Thomas A. Schatz


The Oklahoma City tragedy was felt by every American.  Sympathy for 
the victims, particularly the innocent children, has hit hard.  The 
outpouring of emotion has been and will continue to be overwhelming, 
because Americans care and will do anything and give everything they 
can to help the victims and their families.

All indications are that some members of right-wing militias were 
involved.  Yet, even before all the victims were accounted for and 
properly mourned, some Americans began the "guilt-by-association" 
game.  First, all members of right-wing militia groups were at fault.  
Then, conservative groups of any kind were at fault.  The president 
implicated the radio talk show hosts and called for an end to "reckless 
speech" and  "loud and angry voices," asking Americans to speak out 
against "purveyors of hatred and division."  Then, heated anti-
government rhetoric was to blame for driving the fragile and twisted 
psyches of Timothy McVeigh and his cohorts over the edge.  Carl Rowan 
blamed Senate Majority Leader Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich.  
Radio talk shows and conservative politicians lashed back, accusing 
liberals of using the tragedy for their own political ends.  And the Bureau 
of Alcohol, Tobacco and Firearms and the Federal Bureau of 
Investigation are said to share complicity because of the shootout with 
Randy Weaver and the Waco tragedy.  If anything, this display of 
shameful rhetoric and finger-pointing illustrates America's inability to 
deal with the issue of accountability.

In the wake of such sadness and grief, it is unseemly, grotesque even, for 
politicians and other public figures to make themselves the central figures 
in this tragedy.  And we should know from experience that blaming 
people simply because they hold similar views to those espoused by the 
alleged perpetrators is problematic.

Those who marched or otherwise protested against the war in Vietnam in 
an exercise of their First Amendment rights (including Bill Clinton) 
watched in horror when four students were killed at Kent State.  They 
shivered after learning of the Weather Underground campus bombings.  
After decades of oppression and discrimination, the Black Panthers 
became more militant and armed themselves.  Individuals from many of 
these movements committed crimes.  But in both of these cases, and 
many others throughout history, Americans didn't allow the misguided 
actions of a few extremists to annul or strip away the legitimate aims of 
the many.  

If one wants to make a connection between taxpayers, members of 
conservative organizations, radio talk show hosts, and the nuts that blew 
up the federal building in Oklahoma City, one must also make that same 
connection between taxpayers, members of liberal organizations, militant 
environmentalists, and the unabomber who struck again in California last 
week; or taxpayers, members of Christian fundamentalist churches, 
militant anti-abortionists, and the individual who shot the doctor in 
Pensacola, Florida.  The only real link in all of these examples is among 
the extremes on all sides and their willingness, for whatever twisted 
reasons, to resort to violence and murder.

The Oklahoma City bombing should neither be used as an excuse to 
attack the motivation of groups that seek less intrusive and more efficient 
government, nor as an excuse to perpetuate government programs which 
have simply become useless.  The budget debate, to take place 
imminently in the House and Senate, must go on.  In fact, if anything, 
that debate should be even more focused now on the proper role of 
government and the priorities that must be established for the future.

It's time to mourn, but it's also time to make decisions that will affect the 
standard of living for our children and grandchildren. 

Blunt talk, even when it seems harsh, has always been an element of 
American political discourse.  Tough action on the deficit must be taken 
on Capitol Hill.  Deliberating the merits of where and how to balance the 
budget will naturally evoke emotions on both sides of the aisle, especially 
now.  Eliminating obsolete programs, closing down entire departments, 
and reducing the massive increases in federal spending scheduled to take 
effect over the next several years is essential to the health and welfare of 
the American people and should not be inferred as a blanket abhorrence 
of all government, and certainly not the people that work within the 
system.

CAGW's Prime Cuts contains 651 recommendations to save $1.45 trillion 
over the next five years, including many that go back to the Grace 
Commission.  More than half come right from Congress' own 
Congressional Budget Office, and have been ignored.  President Clinton 
is right to call for increased law enforcement personnel and concentrated 
efforts to prevent domestic and international terrorism; that's an 
expenditure that CAGW can certainly support.  In fact, it's the sort of 
priority and choice that must be made on a much broader scale -- for 
every federal department, agency, and individual program.  That's what 
taxpayers are asking, and that's the task that must be carried out.

<h2>Murders Show Evil Can Exist Anywhere</h2> 
<P>by <a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 
 
  
Just last week in Illinois, Jacqueline Williams was accused of ripping 
an unborn baby from his murdered mother's womb.
<p>
Barely had the gruesome details faded from the headlines when two more 
ghastly stories appeared in which women were suspects in the horrific 
murders of their own children.
<p>
In Olathe, Kan., a 44-year-old doctor, Debora Green, was charged with 
setting fire to her own home and killing two of her three children. 
Green also is suspected of attempting to poison her estranged husband 
earlier this year, although charges have yet to be filed.
<p>
In New York, a 29-year-old woman, Awilda Lopez, was arrested for 
killing her  6-year-old daughter by hitting her in the head with a 
blunt object. Police who investigated the crime said the child bore 
numerous scars from cigarette burns and bruises over her whole body.
<p>
Who are these monster-women?
<p>
House Speaker Newt Gingrich blamed the Illinois murders, which 
included not only the dead mother but also two of her other children, 
on the welfare state.
<p>
Welfare policy has created "a drug-addicted underclass with no sense 
of humanity, no sense of civilization and no sense of the rules of 
life," Gingrich  told a Republican governors meeting shortly after the 
bizarre murders and kidnapping were reported.
<p>
If only it were as simple as that.
<p>
Yes, welfare policy has led to growing social pathology in this 
society. Welfare rewards people for not working, frees men from the 
financial responsibility for their children and encourages women to 
remain unwed if they become pregnant.
<p>
And certainly both the Illinois and New York murders took place in an 
underclass environment.
<p>
Although not all the details are yet known in the Williams case, drugs 
probably played some role. And Awilda Lopez, who was indicted Tuesday, 
was clearly involved in drugs: Her daughter was born addicted to crack 
cocaine.
<p>
Women who commit crimes are even more likely than men to be regular 
drug users: 65% of female prison inmates compared with 62% of males 
are regular drug  users, and 36% of women vs. 31% of men were using 
drugs when they committed the  crimes for which they are incarcerated.
<p>
But the problems go far deeper than drugs, welfare and the underclass.
<p>
Dr. Green is a wealthy, well-educated woman living in small-town 
America. Susan Smith, who was convicted earlier this year of drowning 
her two sons after  claiming they'd been kidnapped, also came from a 
respected, middle-class family.
<p>
What is so horrifyingly inexplicable about the murders of the Green 
and Smith children is that they don't seem to have been committed by 
women driven crazy by drugs or poverty.
<p>
These were coldblooded, calculated murders by women who seemed to lead 
ordinary, even privileged, lives. It's the very familiarity of these 
women's experiences that makes so chilling the evil they perpetrated.
<p>
Stories of women who murder their own children have shocked and 
fascinated us for thousands of years. No figure in Greek mythology 
invokes more dread or loathing than Medea, who killed her own children 
to punish their father, Jason,  for his infidelity.
<p>
In Euripedes' play of the same name, Medea is described by Jason as a 
"hateful thing, you woman most utterly loathed by the gods and me and 
all the race of mankind."
<p>
Last year 538 children in the United States were killed by their 
parents (compared with 308 parents killed by their own children).
<p>
The Justice Department doesn't publish statistics showing how many 
mothers vs. fathers killed their children, although it is difficult to 
imagine that murders by mothers constituted more than a small fraction 
of the total. Difficult to imagine because there is no more horrible 
or unnatural crime than a mother taking the life of her own child.
<p>
Sometimes no amount of analysis or explanation or blame shifting will 
allow us to avoid looking evil straight in the face - even when it 
belongs to a mother.
<p>
What is truly frightening about these recent murders is that they 
demonstrate that evil can exist anywhere, including where it seems 
most unlikely. And it is  more difficult to root out evil than to 
change public policy.

<h2>When It Comes To School, Mother Knows Best </h2>
</center>
<hr>
<b>By Kathleen Howley</b>
<p>
I visited a friend recently, and was a bit surprised to see her nine- year-old son, Anthony, with his nose buried in a thick volume of Shakespeare's complete works.  
<p> 
"He's re-writing Hamlet in simpler language, and he's going to direct the play, with his sister and his cousins playing most of the parts," my friend explained.   
 <p>
Anthony looked up, for a moment, from his work.  
 <p>
"I'm going to be Hamlet," he said, with excitement.  
 <p>
But, of course. How silly of me to be even a bit surprised that a young boy's imagination would be captivated by the image of Hamlet -- the sword-wielding Prince of Denmark.  
 <p>
But, Shakespeare at nine? Or, even more astounding, a boy who voluntarily reads Shakespeare during his summer vacation?  
 <p>
My friend, who home schools both of her children, said Anthony was exposed to a bit of the classics as part of his English curriculum, and went galloping after the Bard on his own initiative during the school year.  
<p>
"It's nice that he has the freedom to really explore a subject that catches his interests," she said.  
 <p>
Other home schooling mothers have told me that their kids begin reading at an earlier age, and have a chance to learn in ways that fit their personalities. And, parents can choose a curriculum that gives their kids an education that emphasizes the basics, rather than the flavor-of-the-month approach to teaching.  
 <p>
Speaking as one who was interminably bored with the slow pace of the various public and Catholic schools I attended, I'm a bit jealous.  
 <p>
Home schooling is beginning to come of age. The U.S. Department of Education estimates that about 500,000 children -- more than one percent of all school-age children -- are schooled at home. Advocates place the figure at twice that. And, research shows that home schoolers are growing by as much as 40 percent a year -- fueled by the crumbing public school system, high tuition for private schools, and  
the increasing number of liberal Catholic schools that teach dissent to their young charges.  
<p>
Even the media is beginning to come around. Last October, Time Magazine ran a cover story that described the home schooling trend, albeit with a back-hand slap at Christians:  
<p>
"A movement once reserved largely for misanthropes, missionaries and religious fundamentalists now embraces such a range of families that it has become a mainstream alternative to regular public or private education," it stated.  
<p>
High profile examples, such as the Colfax family of Boonville, California, have helped to change the image of home schoolers. In 1987 Grant Colfax was accepted to Harvard University after being home schooled for his entire life. He graduated magna cum laude, became a Fulbright scholar, and graduated from Harvard Medical School. One-by-one, his home-schooled siblings followed in his footsteps to Harvard.   
 <p>
Advocates point to the fact that almost all of our early national leaders were home schooled. They'll tell you the kids get plenty of socialization, ranging from play groups where younger students mingle with other home-schooled children, to sports and theater groups for the older kids.  
<p>
What's more, in an age when family connections have never been weaker, they say that the one-on-one teaching inevitably strengthens the parent/child bond, and, as a result, imbues their kids with self-confidence and maturity.  
<p>
There is no doubt that home-schooled children have an academic  advantage over their group-schooled peers. In several studies over the last decade they score in the 65th to 80th percentile on standardized test. The national average is the 50th percentile.  
<p>
On the other hand, opponents such as the left-leaning National Education
Association, the union representing 2.2 million public school teachers, decry home schooling, saying it provides an "inadequate educational experience."  
<p>
In other words, no chance to tell the kids about condoms. No opportunity to show the students graphic pictures in their state-approved quest to promote sexual activity. No way to get the nihilistic message across that kids have no control over themselves.   
<p>
And, no opportunity to instill their version of values, meaning "yes" to recycling, and "no" to chastity, prudence, temperance, and faith.  
<p>
Do home-schooled kids miss out on something essential? Naw. I'd say it's the other way around.   
 <p>
It's the public school kids, who only get to be part of a family for the few hours between dinner and bedtime, who are missing out.

Keeping Congress on the Cutting Edge  
 By Thomas A. Schatz  
  
 
As the budget debate heats up on Capitol Hill, it is clear that  
sustaining the momentum of the first 100 days will be tough sledding  
for Republican leaders.  The rhetoric from the opponents of change has  
been and will continue to be harsh, unfounded, and misleading.  Inside  
the halls of Congress, the hand-wringing and whining at the undoing of  
years of wasteful and ineffective programs would make one believe the  
country will go down the drain in the near future.  
 
But taxpayers still want the revolution which began on November 8th of  
1994 with the election of a Republican Congress to be sustained.   
Outside the Washington beltway, support for reform remains strong.  
 
The truth is, without the changes being wrought in the new Congress,  
we will hit rock bottom and devastate the standard of living for  
future generations.  
 
The interest on the national debt is now almost twice as large as the  
budget deficit.  The president's budget projects a deficit of $192  
billion in fiscal year 1995 and an interest payment of $334 billion.   
In other words, without the interest on the national debt, there would  
be a surplus of $142 billion!  Over the next ten years, we could run a  
surplus every year if we did not have to pay the interest -- which  
will range from $330 billion to more than $500 billion -- and reduce  
the debt by $1,355 billion.  That, of course, is assuming that  
interest rates remain as projected.  If they go higher (remember a  
prime rate of nearly 21 percent in late 1980?), the results could be a  
Mexico-type disaster, where other countries will have to bail out the  
United States.  
 
But the forces of the status quo are doing everything in their power  
to fight the knights in shining armor -- both Republicans and  
Democrats -- who are rescuing the future of our nation.  
 
Here's how the truth is being twisted:  
 
During the debate on the balanced budget amendment (BBA), the  
naysayers claimed that Social Security must be exempt.  The real  
threat to Social Security, as expressed by Sen. John Breaux, a  
Democrat from Louisiana, is if it is not exempt.  Keeping the program  
out of the BBA would give Congress the opportunity to add any program  
it wanted to "Social Security," which would undermine the basic old  
age, survivors and disability payments now provided to beneficiaries.   
For example, Congress could set up a special fund for student aid  
under Social Security, or for farmers, or veterans.  Already, Social  
Security disability funds are being used for cash payments to drug  
addicts and alcoholics, a well-publicized abuse of our tax dollars.   
Do we really want to leave that program untouchable under a balanced  
budget amendment?  And if a program is included in the exemption under  
Social Security, it is likely to expand dramatically as has been the  
practice in Washington.  The red herring of Social Security in the  
debate over the BBA was the first major volley in the battle to turn  
around the effort to eliminate the waste and the deficit.  
 
Social Security doesn't have to be involved at all in the budget  
debate: Representatives Jerry Solomon (R-N.Y.) and Mark Neumann (R- 
Wisc.) have proposed a budget that would truly remove Social Security  
from the furor of how to rein in federal spending.  Their plan would  
not only balance the budget in five years by freezing all spending at  
current levels, it would eliminate the debt in thirty years by  
increasing spending by one percent less than revenues through the year  
2025 in their budget proposal.  Their list of options includes $70  
billion more than is necessary to balance the budget within five  
years.  
 
According to opponents, the provisions of the House welfare bill will  
result in millions of children being left in the streets, and massive  
homelessness and starvation.  But these alarmists failed to note that  
spending more than $5 trillion since 1965 in the war against poverty  
has not solved the problem.  The House bill moves in a new direction,  
which is apparently too much for the defenders of the status quo to  
handle.  
 
Spending on welfare will increase by only $60 billion less than  
projected in President Clinton's FY 1996 budget.  The school lunch  
program will increase by four percent per year instead of six percent  
per year over the next five years.  This is fiscal restraint, not  
heartlessness.  Claiming that children will be starving on the streets  
is just a little too melodramatic to hold water.  
 
The truth will win out, and the waste will be cut.  But the job is far  
from over.  We must preserve the future for our children and  
grandchildren.

<h2>Hillary Furor: Greed, Not Deception, At Issue</h2> 
<P>by <a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> Linda  Chavez



 
 
The entire Washington press corps and scores of politicians 
seem obsessed the last few weeks with finding out whether Hillary 
Clinton is telling the truth. But deception isn't the heart of 
the scandals and controversies swirling around the first lady - 
greed is. The Clintons' greed, as well as that of their friends, 
is the root of the problems afflicting the first couple, from 
Whitewater, to Hillary's dubious commodity trades, to the firing 
of White House travel office personnel. This an old-fashioned 
story about graft and corruption - the kind that has been the 
undoing of many a politician. 
 <P>
The trouble began in 1978, when Bill Clinton was the poorly 
paid, young attorney general of Arkansas and Hillary was not yet 
the $ 125-an-hour partner in the successful Rose Law Firm. James 
McDougal, an Arkansas businessman with more chutzpah than 
scruples, approached the couple with an offer they couldn't 
refuse: Become business partners in a potentially lucrative land 
deal, and he'd make them rich. 
 <P>
The Clintons had no real money to invest - they didn't even 
own a home - but that didn't matter. McDougal was willing to give 
them a 50% share of 230 acres on the White River, to be purchased 
entirely with borrowed money from a bank willing to accept the 
partners' signatures as collateral for a $ 203,000 loan. (Try 
that with your local bank the next time you see property you'd 
like to own but can't afford.) 
 <P>
Although both Bill and Hillary graduated with honors from Yale 
Law School, they seem not to have questioned the legality, much 
less propriety, of accepting something for nothing. Nor did the 
Clintons trouble themselves about ethics as the land deal went 
sour, requiring more shady borrowing, and their business partner 
McDougal became enmeshed in the savings and loan scandal that 
cost taxpayers billions. 
 <P>
Although Whitewater itself never produced the profits McDougal 
promised, it gave the Clintons some hefty tax write-offs as their 
incomes increased with Hillary's growing law practice. And 
McDougal even threw Hillary some legal business as well, a 
$2,000-per-month retainer he says the then-governor personally 
solicited (though Bill Clinton denies it). 
 <P>
And while Whitewater didn't become a cash cow, Hillary made a 
bundle in another bovine adventure: the cattle futures commodity 
market. The Clintons reaped a $ 100,000 profit on a $ 1,000 
investment, again with help from an Arkansas businessman, James 
Blair. As general counsel of Tyson's Foods, one of Arkansas' 
biggest employers and an industry regulated by the state, Blair 
did plenty of business with the state while he was fattening the 
Clintons' bank account. Neither the governor nor his 
attorney-wife questioned the lawfulness of letting Blair place 
trades on Hillary's behalf or pocketing the proceeds. 
 <P>
Even Travelgate boils down to greed - on the part of Clinton 
chums, if not the president and his wife. Although most of the 
attention has focused on whether Hillary Clinton ordered the 
firing of the White House travel office staff, there's much more 
to the story. An article by Byron York in the Jan. 22 issue of 
The Weekly Standard documents the attempt by a Clinton friend and 
his business associate to take over all of the federal 
government's non-military aircraft business, not just the 
chartered press travel run out of the White House. Had the flap 
not developed when the White House firings took place, this plan 
would have gone forward, netting millions of dollars in profits 
to Clinton's friends. 
 <P>
The Clintons may have railed against the Republicans' "decade 
of greed," but all the while they were trying to line their own - 
and their friends' - pockets.

<h2>  
All Hail Shift From Racial Numbers Game  
</h2>


<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">  
Linda Chavez  
</a>  
  
<P>    
 
BETHESDA, Md. -- Proponents of affirmative action and forced busing  
are complaining of an ominous shift away from support for civil  
rights. They point to recent court rulings and state and national  
efforts to bar preferences for minorities as proof the mood has turned  
ugly. A recent cover of Time even warned the country is headed "Back  
to segregation" on the eve of the 100th anniversary of Plessy vs.  
Ferguson, the Supreme Court's infamous 1896 "separate but equal"  
ruling.  
<BR>   
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
What's really going on is the repudiation of the racial numbers game  
invoked to end discrimination. Americans overwhelmingly support the  
right of minorities to attend the same schools and compete for the  
same jobs as whites. The National Opinion Research Center, which has  
been monitoring opinion on racial issues for more than 50 years,  
reports that 90% of Americans favor such rights.  
<BR>   
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
That doesn't mean they're willing to go along with schemes to bus  
schoolchildren or give hiring preferences to minorities to maintain  
some ideal "racial balance." Debates in Massachusetts and California  
illustrate the current mood.  
<BR>   
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
For years, Massachusetts has been trying to enforce racial balance in  
the public schools. A 22-year-old state law declares any school with a  
minority enrollment that exceeds 50% is out of balance. Under the law,  
districts that "voluntarily" balance their schools' racial composition  
through busing or other methods receive a huge financial bonus. The  
state covers 90% of the cost of school construction for districts that  
comply, an incentive critics have called a virtual bribe.  
<BR>   
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Now, however, the state board of education is considering repealing  
the law. And the most vociferous proponent of repeal is Abigail  
Thernstrom, a soft-spoken political scientist with impeccable civil  
rights credentials.  
<BR>   
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
California, too, has been in the forefront of the racial numbers game,  
especially in higher education. A University of California medical  
school was the focus of the Supreme Court's famous 1978 Bakke  
decision, which barred outright admissions quotas by race but allowed  
schools to "take race into account" in order to promote "diversity."  
Last summer, however, the university's regents voted to prohibit any  
racial or ethnic preferences in admissions or hiring. And leading the  
charge was Ward Connerly, a black businessman who now heads the effort  
to enact a ban on all state preferences.  
<BR>   
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Neither move indicates the clock is being turned back on civil rights  
enforcement. What they do signify is an end to a fixation with racial  
balance as an end in itself. That obsession did little to improve the  
quality of education for black or white children or to improve the  
skills of minority workers.  
<BR>   
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
In his book Forced Justice, David Armor points out that the gap  
between white and black educational achievement has been closing over  
the past few decades, but it has little to do with school  
desegregation. According to Armor's assessment of national data,  
"Gains for segregated black students are as large or larger than for  
desegregated blacks, and . . . blacks in disadvantaged urban  
communities gain as much as blacks in nondisadvantaged communities."  
Armor maintains that black students' achievement has much more to do  
with their parents' economic status than their classmates' color, just  
like whites.  
<BR>   
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Simply trying to balance numbers by race and ethnicity won't improve  
the quality of schools children attend or help them gain the skills  
necessary to compete later in life. But a shift away from numbers  
might actually force policymakers to deal with the true impediments to  
minority progress.  
<BR>

<html><head><title>Chavez: The Coming Battle on Social Security
</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>

<h2>The Coming Battle on Social Security</h2> 
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P>
The continuing conflict over Medicare reform may be just a warm-up to 
the coming battle on Social Security.  Though few politicians want to 
talk about it, the Social Security system is anything but secure.  And 
if current demographic trends continue, those persons who are 25-50 
years-old today can forget about recouping their contributions into 
the system when they turn 65.
<P>
Social Security is one of the biggest give-away programs in the 
federal budget, yet the program remains almost universally popular and 
untouchable when it comes to budget-cutting.  Why?  Because most 
people -- both the elderly and younger workers -- have been sold a 
bill of goods.
<P>
Myth # 1. Social Security recipients are simply getting back in 
benefits what they and their employers put into the system in payroll 
taxes during their working lives.  
<p>
Actually, the average person retiring today will get back what he and 
his employers paid into the system within the first 4.5 years after 
retirement.  Since the average man will live 7.3  years after 
retirement age and the average woman 14 years, most beneficiaries will 
receive nearly 1.5 to 3 times what they contributed.
<p>
Myth # 2.  The Social Security Trust Fund operates like any other 
pension system, the money is put aside and invested to pay for future 
benefits.
<p>
Wrong.  In most private pension plans, the employer/employee 
contributions are saved and invested to provide  the actual benefits 
workers will receive from the plan.  But Social Security benefits are 
financed differently, on a pay-as-you-go system.  Benefits don't come 
from retirees' own contributions, but rather from the contributions of 
those who are still working.  
<p>
The so-called Trust Fund isn't really a separate fund at all, but a 
bookkeeping device.  And the money supposedly "in" the fund isn't 
invested but used by the government to pay for other government 
programs.  The fund supposedly "receives" long-term Treasury bonds in 
return for this "investment."  
<p>
In essence, the government borrows from itself and promises to pay it 
back at some later time.  But what that really means is that the 
government borrows from taxpayers, in this case future taxpayers, and 
most likely will pay it back by raising taxes down the line.
<p>
Myth # 3 Even if Social Security is a pay-as-you-go system, the next 
generation will be willing to pay for the program that, after all, 
takes care of its own parents.
<p>
The problem is the next generation of retirees had fewer children than 
previous generations.  The current system depends on a pyramid 
financing scheme.  In order to pay for the present level of benefits, 
3 workers contribute payroll taxes to pay for 1 retiree's benefits.  
But the ratio of workers to retirees is actually shrinking slightly.  
When the baby-boomers retire, there will be only 2 workers per retiree 
available to pay taxes for the same benefits.  Something will have to 
give: either benefits will significantly drop or taxes will rise 
dramatically.
<p>
Myth # 4.  The elderly are the most vulnerable and poorest members of 
society who can least afford to have their government benefits 
trimmed.
<p>
Certainly there are many poor elderly people in the U.S.  But the 
economic condition of the elderly has actually improved dramatically 
over the last few decades, while that of children has declined at the 
same time.  There has been a large shift in wealth in recent years 
from the young and working aged to the elderly, and government 
programs have been chiefly responsible.  
<p>
Although those aged 65 or older are only 12.5% of the population, they 
receive more than one-third of all federal dollars in benefits, 
regardless of actual need.  Americans rail against welfare programs 
for poor women and their children -- especially Aid to Families with 
Dependent Children, which accounts for only about 1% of federal 
spending -- but never imagine that both Social Security and Medicare 
are really welfare programs for the elderly, including those who are 
wealthy and have no need of subsidies.
<p>
It's time Americans of all ages face up to the fact that current 
elderly programs will bankrupt America. Radically reforming Social 
Security is not only necessary, but just and fair.

<h2>Washington's New 
Math
 </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>
<p>







A decade ago as Governor of Delaware, I was trying to persuade the legislature to enact a bill granting lower tax rates to banks that moved business operations into our state.  Some liberal legislators objected to the tax incentive, arguing that the state would be taxing banks too little and the bankers would be making too much.<p> 
 "Look," I said, "today we get zero taxes from a bank that isn't here.  If one comes, we get the taxes and all the jobs it creates.  The banks will benefit and so will the state."<p>
 A similar argument currently rages in Washington about lowering capital gains tax rates.  Cut the tax rate, the liberals argue, and the government will tax too little and the wealthy will benefit too 
much.<p>
 Remember that capital gains - the increase in value of stocks or other assets - are only taxed if the asset is sold.  Obviously, affluent people have more assets than nonaffluent people.  But like the bank 
that isn't here, if they don't sell the asset, the government doesn't realize any tax revenue.  But if the prospective tax on the capital gain is lowered, some people who otherwise would have held onto their 
asset will decide to sell it.  The seller will reap his reward and capital gains tax revenue will increase.  So both the seller and the government will benefit.<p>
 Or so you might think.  But in the make-believe world of Washington arithmetic, the government will be scored as losing money.  The reason is that Washington's revenue estimators - the "scorekeepers" you read about - use what amounts to two sets of books.  On the one hand, they agree that the government will get a certain amount of additional revenue in the short run.  But the way they calculate the amount of gain would tax anyone's patience.  If someone doesn't sell an asset because they would have had to pay $10,000 in taxes, but does sell it when the tax is reduced to $7,000, the revenue estimators consider it a $3,000 revenue loss rather than a $7,000 revenue gain.  So a tax rate reduction that results in more dollars flowing to the Treasury is said to be a revenue loss - or, as the scorekeepers put it, a "tax benefit" to the seller.  Truth is indeed stranger than fiction. <p>
 Following this line of reasoning, if a retail store with goods that cost $500,000 and were priced at $1 million sold them for $750,000, the result would be not a $250,000 profit but a $250,000 loss.  And by 
Washington arithmetic, the sale would be unfair because it benefited the customers. <p>
 That's what the liberals argue in denouncing the tax cuts enacted by the House of Representatives - they are unfair because they benefit the wealthy.  As Bruce Bartlett, the former Treasury Department 
official who is now a Senior Fellow with the NCPA, has noted, things are not quite what they seem here.  The wealthy do hold more assets - or they wouldn't be wealthy - but 74% of the taxpayers who benefit from a capital gains tax cut have incomes of less than $75,000.  Indeed, when all the tax cut provisions of the House bill have taken effect, 65% of the benefits will go to taxpayers with incomes below $75,000, even though they pay only 49% of all federal taxes.  A bonanza for the wealthy?  Not exactly.<p>
Consider another example, the "draconian budget cuts" the liberals charge the Republicans are going to make in Medicare.  Under both the House and Senate versions of the budget, Medicare spending is 
scheduled to increase - by an average of 7% in each of the next five years. <p>
So how can an increase be a drastic cut?  By the same "Washington arithmetic" that makes tax revenue increases net losses to the Treasury.<p>
 Washington arithmetic uses a strange accounting system called "current services baseline budgets."  A current services baseline budget assumes that you will keep doing everything you do now exactly the same next year, and that in addition because of inflation and increased use of Medicare, next year's costs will rise as much as this year's.  That amount then becomes the "baseline" and any spending less than the baseline is a "cut" in the budget.  So a 7% increase in Medicare spending, compared to a 12% baseline budget, comes out as a 5% spending cut. What keeps all this from being hilarious is that the people who think this way have control of huge amounts of real money - our  money.  The truth is Washington arithmetic is designed to ensure that taxes are never cut and spending is never lowered. No wonder so much of the public lacks faith in the Congress.<p>
 Even the Delaware liberals who argued against the bank bill in the 1980s now admit it was a good thing.  Bank franchise taxes yielded $3 million in revenue the year before the bill was passed.  Last year, because a great many new businesses had moved to Delaware, revenues approached $100 million. <p>
Not bad.  Of course by Washington arithmetic, Delaware suffered a $97 million loss. <p>

<h2>Black Racism Goes Largely Unchallenged </h2> 
<P>by <a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 



 
"The problem of the twentieth century is the problem of the color 
line," W.E.B. Du Bois predicted in 1900. Unfortunately, his words 
still ring true in 1996 but with a bitter irony. In 1900 blacks stood 
on one side of the color line as victims of racism. Today, increasing 
numbers of blacks have crossed over the line to become perpetrators of 
racism as well. And while we have become far more courageous in 
condemning and punishing racism when it is practiced by whites, black 
racism goes largely unchallenged. Witness the reactions to two 
murderous attacks by racists last month.
<p>
In the first incident, two white soldiers are accused of viciously 
murdering a black couple in Fayetteville, N.C., because the men hated 
blacks. The murder was front-page news across the country and led the 
evening network broadcasts. The Army, concerned the suspects might be 
part of an organized network of white supremacists, launched a full-
scale investigation to weed out any racist fringe groups.
<p>
The second incident took place just one day after the racially 
motivated murder of the black couple in North Carolina. A black man 
entered a white-owned store in Harlem, warning blacks to leave, before 
he opened fire on the mostly Hispanic and white employees and 
customers and then set the store ablaze. When the conflagration ended, 
eight people, including the gunman, were dead. The story generated 
only moderate news attention outside New York and little national 
soul-searching about the causes or prevalence of black racism. Only a 
small handful of national columnists deemed the racial aspects of the 
homicidal rampage worthy of specific condemnation, and most of these 
were black journalists.
<p>
If the Harlem murders were an isolated event, the reluctance of so 
many white opinion leaders to confront black racism might be 
understandable. But black-on-white hate crimes have increased 
dramatically. In one study by Klanwatch, a liberal civil rights group 
that monitors racist incidents, nearly half the racially motivated 
murders over three years were committed by blacks, who are only 12% of 
the population.
<p>
Media reticence to condemn black racism reflects an insidious double 
standard. White racism is rightly viewed as a moral failing of the 
individual and as a threat to both the peace and justice of society. 
But many in the media seem reluctant to gauge black racism in the same 
way.
<p>
For weeks before the attack on the white-owned Harlem store, 
demonstrators marched in front of the building, shouting racist and 
anti-Semitic remarks. According to the testimony of the Jewish store 
owner, who sought a restraining order against the demonstrators prior 
to the murders, protesters "made motions of striking a match and 
throwing it on the outside clothing displays or into the doorway of 
the store." Days before the actual arson, he warned prophetically: "At 
some point real matches will be thrown at me and my store. This is not 
an idle fear on my part."<p>     But in the heart of the media capital of 
the world - New York City - this story of vicious hate-mongering went 
unreported until after the fire. Is it imaginable that a similar story 
of white protesters making such threatening gestures outside a black-
owned establishment would be ignored by the media?
<p>
In some circles, blacks are presumed incapable of racism because they 
lack power. But racism is about hate, not power. It takes hate, not 
power, to shoot an innocent couple on a deserted street or set fire to 
a store full of frightened people.
<p>
And it takes considerable cowardice not to recognize hate comes in all 
colors. 
<P>

The Long Hot Summer Ahead   
 Thomas A. Schatz 
 Citizens Against Government Waste
 May 18, 1995 
 

 Outsiders usually aren't surprised -- and often think it appropriate  
-- when they learn that much of Washington was built on a swamp.  
While that fact only partially accounts for the hot gases that tend to 
swirl here, this summer promises to be stickier than most, with 
rhetorical fireworks flying that could dwarf the pyrotechnics on the 
4th of July.    

 Freon will be in short supply as the battle of the budget burns 
through the summer and into September.  The deficit hawks, promising a 
balanced budget by 2002, will square off against the special interests 
and sentinels of the status quo, who, as one Republican leader has 
said, have nothing to offer but fear itself.  At stake are the hearts 
and minds of everyday Americans and the political high ground as we 
move into an election year.   

 While every battle seems decisive from the perspective of the 
interlocked combatants, this time it's no exaggeration.  The outcome 
will determine whether future Americans are born debt-free, whether 
the growth of government can be reversed, whether the will of average 
taxpayers can prevail over the more focused energies of special 
interests, and whether Americans are still capable of sacrificing in 
the short term to safeguard the future.   

 The balanced budget proposals recently put forward -- reductions in 
spending of $1.4 trillion in the House and $961 billion in the Senate 
over seven years -- provide a game plan only, establishing broad 
budgetary parameters.  The specific cuts and final shape of the 
package will be hashed out during the summer.  Which components live 
or die will be determined in part by the war of words, by the ebb and 
flow of public opinion.     

 Even if every cut or reduction in growth being proposed survives, 
government spending will still grow from $1.53 trillion this year to 
$1.8 trillion in 2002.  Social Security spending, the "third rail" of 
American politics, is off the table.  Medicare (which will be bankrupt 
by 2002 without reform) will grow as well, but at a more manageable 
rate than 10 percent a year, its current pace.  At least one and 
perhaps as many as three federal departments could be eliminated 
altogether.  Hundreds of anachronistic agencies and programs will fall 
by the wayside.  These, in short, are some of the most dramatic 
changes in the size and scope of government since the heady days of 
the Great Society.  Only this time, contraction is the goal, rather 
than expansion.   

 What avenues will be taken to arrive at a smaller, more affordable 
government?  The first is privatization -- as first proposed by the 
Grace Commission more than a decade ago.  As the late J. Peter Grace 
recognized, there are many public entities that could stand alone as 
private, profit-making ventures.  Capitol Hill budget cutters are 
looking to privatize the Federal Aviation Administration, the Naval 
and Strategic Petroleum Reserves, and the National Helium Reserves.  
Also likely to be sold off are the nation's five Power Marketing 
Administrations, which sell power generated by federally-built 
hydroelectric facilities.  To this list, Citizens Against Government 
Waste would add the Tennessee Valley Authority, the National Weather 
Service, the space shuttle program, and the military commissary 
system.   

 Next is consolidation --  putting the government's self-duplicating 
and redundant functions under a single roof and reversing the 
politically-driven proliferation of cabinet-level agencies.  Should we 
do away with the Department of Energy, created in response to the 
energy crisis of the 1970's, its responsibility for nuclear weapons 
labs and facilities could easily be subsumed by the Department of 
Defense.  The Federal Highway Administration and the National Highway 
Safety Administration should be merged.  The military's four, separate 
health-care bureaucracies should be placed under single management.  
And there's much more consolidation that could be done.   

 When all else fails, there's always termination.  It's been said that 
there's nothing in the world more permanent than a temporary federal 
program.  The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) is a prime 
example.  Thirty years after being launched as a component of Lyndon 
Johnson's Great Society, the ARC serves today as little more than a 
pork-barrel for opportunistic politicians.  Three-quarters of a 
million dollars in ARC "anti-poverty" funds will be spent this year 
helping to build a practice facility for the NFL Carolina Panthers at 
a private college in Spartanburg, South Carolina, one of the most 
affluent counties in that state.  The Economic Development 
Administration, another anachronistic agency that should be 
terminated, has chipped in $500,000 more for the stadium.  The 
Interstate Commerce Commission, the bureaucracy that wouldn't die and 
occupies itself today publishing pamphlets about how to start a small 
railroad, also begs for a wooden stake through the heart.  There are 
many others that need to be added to the Endangered Bureaucracies 
List.   

 Another concept gaining popularity in Washington is "devolution," 
which is short-hand for returning power, money, and responsibility for 
administering certain programs back to the states.  The states, each 
working as individual laboratories, or incubators for innovation, will 
manage these programs more efficiently.  If all goes according to 
plan, Medicaid will be delivered to the states as a block grant, 
letting them dispense it as they see fit, as will food stamps.  Other 
welfare reform measures will also be downloaded to the state level.   

 Finally, even if the size of the federal government is reduced, much 
more can be done to make it run more like a business.  While not very 
"sexy," financial management reform is essential if we want the most 
efficient government for the money.  Unless there is full 
implementation of the Chief Financial Officers Act, and the 
bureaucracy is compelled to deliver timely, trustworthy financial 
reports, the ship of state sails in a fog and our leaders have no way 
to know which reforms are working and which aren't.   

 The road to a balanced budget won't be without its potholes: the 
whole effort may succumb to politics as usual and break down before it 
even gets going.  To succeed, many sacred cows will have to be put out 
to pasture.  Many old ways of thinking about government will have to 
be discarded.  We'll have to forge ahead even when the Chicken Littles 
and special interests say that the sky is falling.  After decades of 
saying "Yes," Washington's political class will have to bring itself 
to say "No."  In turn, voters will have to reward those who have the 
courage to say "No," holding up fiscal prudence rather than 
piggishness as a virtue, and learn to stop turning to the federal 
government for the solution to every imaginable problem.  An America 
increasingly fractured into adversarial special interests, each 
fighting for a piece of the pie, will have to find a way to coalesce 
around a new set of affordable national priorities.   

 In short, the era of governmental limits and fiscal responsibility 
won't be born without a long, painful, and noisy labor.

<h2>One Jobs Program That Works</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>  
 <p>

Last week's District of Columbia appropriations bill contained a 
startling education innovation.  It mandates the establishment of a 
nonprofit corporation governed by the private sector to train and 
place non-college-bound students in jobs. 
<p> 
If, as President Reagan said, "The best social program devised is a 
job,"  then those without jobs or who lack skills that employers want 
need some help to acquire those skills to connect them to the 
workplace. 
 <p>
Both the House and the Senate have recently passed bills resulting in 
a sweeping reform of the federal job training system.  Between 80 and 
125 programs will be consolidated, depending on the final conference 
actions, and overall funding cuts will be between 15% and 25%.    
 <p>
If the conservative revolution in Washington is to succeed, no one 
must be left behind.  One low-cost, high-return way to accomplish this 
is to implement well constructed, economical training in communities 
where jobs are available.  That is the thrust of the two bills in 
Congress - devolving authority, flexibility, and decisions to the 
state and local level - and requiring important private-sector 
involvement in how the funds should be spent. 
 <p>
But the innovation in the District of Columbia may turn out to be the 
most significant step of all. 
 <p>
It is of particular interest to me, because it is based upon an idea I 
developed in my prior life as a governor.  I used the powers states 
had then to devise a better way to train young people for work in the 
real world.  Our idea worked then, and it can be a model for what will 
work now. 
 <p>
"Jobs for Delaware Graduates" (JDG) was created in 1978 as a non-
profit partnership to prepare, counsel, and place high school seniors 
in career jobs.  I committed myself to serve as chair, and challenged 
some of the state's most important business, government, education, 
community and labor leaders to join me in taking personal 
responsibility for the program.  In turn, we hired a staff that would 
each be held personally accountable for helping a group of 35 to 40 of 
our state's most at-risk young people move successfully from school to 
work. 
 <p>
In the very first year, truly impressive results were achieved in the 
test high schools.  Costs were less than one-third that of similar 
programs - including the provision of  nine months' assistance after 
students left school to assure successful placement and performance in 
the private sector. 
 <p>
It was so successful that a number of foundations and government 
agencies helped test the program in four other states.  "Jobs for 
America's Graduates" (JAG) was then created to help bring Delaware's 
success story throughout the country. 
 <p>
Today, I am pleased to report that a majority of states now have the 
JAG program - the largest organization of its kind. 
 <p>
What makes it work?  Why do 90% of these at-risk young people graduate 
from school?  Why is it that within nine months 80% are either on the 
job, in the military, or enrolled in post-secondary education or 
training?  Why is it that JAG shows a 30% improvement in employment?  
Why is it so cost-effective - at $1,200 per participant, less than 
one-third the cost of the national average of similar programs? 
 <p>
Because there is private sector oversight and responsibility, real 
accountability of people to achieve results, and the fact that young 
people themselves must meet the employability requirements of 
businesses and take responsibility for themselves and their lives.  
Governors like Chuck Robb (VA), Kit Bond (MO), and Lamar Alexander 
(TN) joined me in testing and leading the organization.  To date, the 
JAG organization has helped 175,000 young people. 
 <p>
JAG can demonstrate that young people more than repay the cost of 
their participation in the program in taxes paid alone.  Heaven only 
knows how much they would have cost if they hadn't completed school, 
hadn't gotten a job, had gotten on welfare or into trouble with the 
law -- or worse. 
 <p>
Training, counseling, and job placement services can work, if they are 
run by the private sector, involve communities, and demand results.  
 <p>
That is why Speaker Gingrich is so enthusiastic about the value of 
training as part of the welfare reform bill the House has passed.  
That is why so many of us conservatives have found ourselves 
supporting bottomline, low-cost ways to make sure that we don't leave 
any of our young people behind - each gets a decent chance to complete 
school and get a good job upon graduating.  And that is why the 
Speaker and Labor Secretary Robert Reich will keynote the 
organization's 14th anniversary celebration this month. 
 <p>
Supporting America's young people, conserving the cost of social 
programs and protecting the base of our taxpayers in the future are 
good, sound, conservative principles.  In "Jobs for America's 
Graduates," they work in practice.

<title>The End of Quotas Just in Time</title>

<h2>The End of Quotas Just in Time
 </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>










<p>

President Clinton's  "full-throated" (Washington Post) and "near- evangelical" (New York Times) endorsement of affirmative action has set liberal hearts a flutter.
<p>
The University of California's Regents' vote to end race-based admission, hiring, and contracting set Rev. Jesse Jackson ablaze.
<p>
Over at the Judicial branch of government, cooler heads are prevailing. The U.S. Supreme Court has applied the brakes to affirmative action, questioning the constitutional validity of programs that guarantee jobs or contracts on the basis of race.  "Equal protection of the law is a personal right, not a group right," wrote Justice O'Connor.
<p>
Just in time, too, because for two decades government quotameisters have been cutting a broad swath through individual rights.
<p>
For example, the Pentagon sent out word that "special permission will be required for the promotion of all white men without disabilities."  The U.S. Forest Service, desperate to meet its goals for minority firefighters, earlier this year said in a job posting that it would only consider applicants "who do not meet standards."
<p>
Navy Secretary John Dalton has issued a policy that henceforth Naval officers will be commissioned "in a percentage approximately equal to the racial make-up of the populace."  Navy flight standards also seem to have been bent to meet quotas for women fighter pilots.
<p>
Nondiscrimination in hiring, promoting and in awarding government contracts is both right and a right.  But in practice, the Civil Rights Act of 1964 has been turned on its head by those charged with enforcing it.  Instead of trying to wipe out discrimination, they have mandated it.  The legislation that Senator Hubert Humphrey assured us could never be used to impose quotas has become a quota statute.
<p>
Affirmative action has become a zero-sum game in which gains for one group can only be made at the expense of other groups.  Setting aside a construction contract for one minority group takes opportunity away from others.  When the University of California at Berkeley sets different admission standards for Asian-American students (the policy the Regents just voted down) because too large a percentage of them would be admitted if only grades and test scores were used, Asians are disadvantaged and blacks gain.
<p>
Quotas also undermine the very minorities they are supposed to help.  In a recent issue of The New Democrat, Carol M. Swain, a black professor of politics and public policy at Princeton University, blamed affirmative action for promoting a "helpless victim" mentality that undermines self- respect and initiative.  She wrote:  "It says in effect that you, as a woman or minority, are less capable than a white male and will need special preference in order to compete successfully in a world dominated by white males."
<p>
As a result, a black or Hispanic or woman who is hired or is promoted to a position of responsibility has to overcome the suspicion on the part of others that he or she wouldn't be there except for a quota.  The resulting self-doubt can become an additional handicap in achieving success.
<p>
Justice Clarence Thomas, addressing school busing in the Kansas City desegregation case, was blunt:  "It never ceases to amaze me that the courts are so willing to assume that anything that is predominantly black must be inferior.  This position [that racial imbalances are unconstitutional] appears to rest upon the idea that any school that is black is inferior, and that blacks cannot succeed without the benefit of the company of whites."
<p>
Quotas are also an easy way out.  Quotameisters just calculate that the local population is 12% black, 7% Hispanic and 1% Asian-American, and demand that the makeup of everybody's workforce reflect those percentages.  Then businesses don't have to worry about searching for talented people, or recruiting them, or looking for human potential and helping to develop it.  That takes work.  It's much easier just to hire by the numbers.
<p>
Thus we have incidents like the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission's Chicago office spending seven years unsuccessfully  suing a Korean-owned janitorial service because more than 5% of its workforce was Korean and 95% of the Chicago labor pool was not.
<p>
Trying to end racial or sexual discrimination by giving preferences to one group at the expense of another is like trying to level a table.  If you cut too much off one leg, you have to cut off the others to even things out. And if you make a mistake, you can always trim a little more here or there.  But soon the table is useless.
<p>
So far, there is no indication that the government is going after National Basketball Association teams because they have such a high percentage of black (or tall) players.  Nor does anyone seem to be investigating why seven of the ten best lifetime batting averages of all time belong to left- handed hitters.  Maybe Justice O'Connor spoke just in time.

<title>Chavez: Surprise: Punishment Actually Cuts Crime  -- 2/1/96</title>

<h2>
Surprise: Punishment Actually Cuts Crime 
</h2>
<p><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">
Linda  Chavez 
</a>

<P>  
The murder rate is dropping dramatically in cities across the country, 
but analysts disagree why. In New York, the murder rate dropped by 32% 
last year; Washington, D.C., experienced a 10% decline for the second 
year in a row. The pattern is repeating itself in cities large and 
small, and murder isn't the only serious crime that's down. Of the 
Justice Department's index of serious crimes, only larceny theft was 
up slightly (3%) in the first six months of 1995. A new study by the 
National Center for Policy Analysis in Dallas suggests that putting 
more criminals behind bars at least partly explains why crime is 
finally going down - at least in Texas.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Overall, crime in Texas is now at its lowest point since 1973, and the 
murder rate is lower than at any time since 1966. Crime is falling 
most in big cities:  down 35% in Dallas and 29% in Houston between 
1991 and 1994, and the decline is  even greater for murder and motor 
vehicle theft - crimes that are almost always  reported and therefore 
most statistically reliable.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The precipitous drop is no great mystery to Morgan O. Reynolds, author 
of the study and a Texas A&M professor of economics. "Punishment 
works. Incarceration works. It's that simple," he says. Reynolds 
points to a "prison-building binge"  that tripled the state's capacity 
over five years. Texas now has more prisoners  per capita than any 
state in the country. And while many liberals would rate this a 
dubious distinction, more prisoners means fewer criminals out 
terrorizing their fellow citizens. Reynolds estimates that the lower 
crime rate means 1,140  fewer Texans will be murdered this year than 
in 1991 and 450,000 fewer crimes committed against persons and 
property.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The major problem in the exploding violent crime rate in recent years 
has been the inability of law enforcement to ensure that convicted 
criminals remain behind bars for a significant length of time. Prison 
became a revolving door through which violent felons passed repeatedly 
in and out, with stays so short it sometimes seemed convicts were 
being given a respite from their life on the streets rather than 
punishment. Parole was used by many prison officials throughout the 
country as a means to reduce prison overcrowding, not because 
convicts' crimes or their behavior in prison justified early release.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Texas was no exception. In 1990, Texas prison officials approved 79% 
of all prisoners considered for parole, in large part because of a 
federal court order  to reduce crowding in state prisons (a fate 
shared by more than 40 other states). With a threefold increase in 
prison cells since then, however, Texas' parole approval rate fell to 
22% in 1994. And there is good reason to believe that longer prison 
terms reduce crime, not only by removing perpetrators temporarily from 
society but also by deterring others who are considering committing 
crimes.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
As Reynolds notes, committing a crime is often a rational decision. 
Arrest rates are down in Texas, as in most other states, over the past 
three decades. The probability of being arrested for committing murder 
is down 21%, and down 22% for committing rape. With little chance of 
getting caught, criminals find the benefits of crime outweigh the 
costs, he says. Nonetheless, this calculus changes if the punishment 
increases dramatically - as it has in Texas. Expected prison time for 
convicted murderers is up 274% over the past three years, and up 152% 
for rape and 246% for aggravated assault.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Perhaps the most effective way to prevent crime is to make the 
punishment so  harsh and so certain that would-be criminals decide the 
risk isn't worth taking. Let the experts argue - Texas legislated 
those policies, and crime fell.

<title>du Pont--  A Christmas Carol

<h2>
A Christmas Carol
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>  
 <p>
It's not long until Christmas, a very special time for all families.  
In Washington, Christmas is a very special time, too.  The president 
has lit the national Christmas tree.  And lobbyists are beginning to 
think about what kinds of presents they would like to receive this 
year. 
 <P>
I've been rattling some of the packages under the national Christmas 
tree trying to guess what some companies and organizations could be 
getting. 
 <P>
Here's a nice present.  Let's see - it's from the Department of 
Agriculture's Market Promotion Program.  You know, a recent study from 
the Cato Institute pointed out that this department of the government 
spends $110 million a year underwriting the cost of promoting American 
products abroad. 
<P>
Let's see what's inside.  Well, there's $2.9 million to Pillsbury to 
advertise its muffins and pies in foreign countries.  Here's another 
$10 million to promote Sunkist oranges.  And look - $465,000 to 
advertise McDonald's Chicken McNuggets abroad.  That's so thoughtful.  
One of the great things about Christmas is the ability to help someone 
in need.  Without government help, how would McDonald's ever find 
half-a-million dollars to advertise its McNuggets?  
<P> 
The Cato Institute study also points out that:  "Martin Marietta 
Corporation charged the Pentagon $263,000 for a Smokey Robinson 
concert, $20,000 for the purchase of golf balls and $7,500 for a 1993 
office Christmas party.  Ecology and Environment, Inc., of Lancaster, 
New York, spent $243,000 of funds designated for environmental clean-
up on 'employee morale' and $37,000 on tennis lessons, bike races, 
golf tournaments and other entertainment."  As they say in Hollywood:  
That's entertainment! 
 <P>
The Cato Institute estimates that there are more than 125 government 
programs that subsidize private business.  In fiscal year 1995, more 
than $85 billion of taxpayers' money was spent on these programs.  
Now, let's see what else is here.  Oh, here's a big one.  The card 
says this one goes to the sugar industry.  Now isn't that nice:  $1.4 
billion in price supports.  I know the sugar industry will appreciate 
Congress' thoughtfulness--especially the 33 largest cane plantations 
which will receive more than $1 million each. 
 <P>
Of course, there are the gifts that keep on giving, too:  dairy price 
supports, which keep the price of milk much higher than it otherwise 
would be so that the dairy industry will profit.  Then there are gifts 
called "marketing orders" - regulations that govern how many oranges, 
almonds and other products can be grown. 
 <P>
Then there's President Clinton's Christmas shopping list--a few items 
he put in his latest budget.  For example, $333 million for the New 
Generation of Vehicles program, or the "Clean Car Initiative," which 
the White House says will "ensure the global competitiveness of the 
U.S. automobile industry."  That would be GM, Ford, and Chrysler, who 
collectively made nearly $10 billion in profits last year.  I guess a 
gift from the government of another $333 million would still be 
appreciated. 
 <P>
Of course, the suggestion of eliminating or even just slowing this 
government spending spree can result in people calling you a modern 
day Scrooge.  That association obviously misses two important points:  
First, nobody wants to hurt the Tiny Tims of this country; just the 
opposite.  Those who are trying to cut all of these presents to 
wealthy corporations are doing so precisely because they want to make 
sure there is enough for the Tiny Tims. 
 <P>
Second, associating budget-cutting with Scrooge implies that the 
federal government - like Scrooge - has a lot of money that it 
selfishly doesn't want to part with.  But the federal government 
doesn't have a surplus of money lying around.  That debt is the Ghost 
of Christmas Past.  Congress has often been generous in the past, so 
lobbyists continue to press for more presents.  And because we are 
moving into an election year, the congressional spirit of generosity 
towards big businesses can be stronger than usual. 
 <P>
For most of us, Christmas is about sharing, especially with those who 
have the least.  For Washington, Christmas can also be about sharing - 
sharing our tax dollars with those who have the most.  Of course, it's 
easy to be generous with other people's money - especially when its 
the next generation's.  And that's where the Ghost of Christmas Future 
comes in.  No nation will long prosper by stealing from its children.  
If the Congress is serious about cutting the growth in federal 
spending so that we don't leave future generations of American 
overwhelmed with debt, it must cut back on its corporate Yule Tide 
generosity. 
<P> 
Otherwise, how in the "Dickens" are we going to get federal spending 
under control?

<title>du Pont--HELPING THE POOR:  WASHINGTON WELFARE FOR PRIVATE CHARITIES </title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<center><i>October 26, 1995</i><hr>
<h2>Helping the Poor:  Washington Welfare for Private Charities</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>  
   
  
What would you think of a doctor who prescribed the same treatment to  
every sick person he treated, whether the patient had a cold or lung  
cancer?  Yet, isn't that the way we handle welfare today?  The fourth- 
generation welfare mother, the educated person temporarily on hard  
times, the drug addict, the man who is simply incapable of holding a  
job - they're all treated pretty much the same by federal welfare  
policy. 
<p> 
But they aren't the same.  They're more than case numbers; they are  
people,  individuals.  Not surprisingly, a comprehensive study by Mary  
Jo Bane and David Ellwood of Harvard University found that poor people  
are just as diverse as nonpoor people.  They have diverse reasons for  
being poor and respond to diverse incentives. 
 <p>
So just as in medicine, the better the provider knows the recipient,  
the more likely that welfare funds will be spent in a way that  
benefits both the individual and the community.  Giving block grants  
to the states to handle their own welfare programs is a step in the  
right direction, but it only transfers welfare responsibility from a  
federal bureaucrat to a state bureaucrat.  A much more fundamental  
change is needed.  We must break free of the idea that only government  
- at whatever level, federal, state or local - holds the answer to  
social problems.  Generally it's not so.  It certainly isn't so in the  
case of welfare. 
 <p>
Thirty years of experience and scholarly studies confirm that the  
current welfare system discourages work and encourages dependency,  
single motherhood and the breakup of families.  People may complain  
about the monetary cost, but the real cost is the social and   
psychological cost in lives damaged or destroyed, children deprived of  
opportunity, increased crime and violence, and the creation of a  
permanent underclass of people with no hope.   
 <p>
Where welfare is concerned, there is already a better answer than  
government programs.  There is mounting evidence that private  
charities do a better job of getting aid to those who need it most,  
encouraging self-sufficiency and self-reliance, strengthening the  
family unit, and using resources efficiently. 
 <p>
Private charitable efforts are not insignificant:   In 1991, private  
charities provided more than $100 billion in cash and $76 billion in  
volunteered time for health, education, and welfare.   
 <p>
The best private charities believe that most people can and should  
support themselves and their families.  They tailor aid accordingly.   
They get aid to those who need it most and provide help without  
encouraging dependency.  They encourage or require aid recipients to  
contribute labor to the charity itself.  One might say private  
charities take just the opposite approach from government welfare:   
whereas it often takes a long time to get on government welfare rolls,  
it is easy to stay on.  Conversely, it is easy to get aid from a  
private charity, but hard to keep getting it. 
 <p>
Government programs spent about $350 billion on means-tested welfare  
programs last year - the federal share being about $240 billion.   
Instead of talking about reducing welfare spending, why not channel  
these funds to the private charities or local government programs that  
do the best job of helping the poor?  Instead of sending these  
billions to Washington, let each taxpayer decide which anti-poverty  
effort to support.  Here's one way this could work: 
 <p>
Create a dollar-for-dollar tax credit for individual contributions to  
anti-poverty programs operated either by state or local governments or  
by private sector charities.  That is, for every dollar individuals  
give to such programs, up to say $3,000 - which is about what the  
median household now pays in federal income taxes - they could take a  
dollar off their tax bills.  One estimate is that this could move a  
large portion of the $240 billion the federal government is spending  
now to private charities and state and local governments. 
 <p>
Only one person in three believes they get good value for tax dollars  
spent on social welfare programs.  But three out of four contributors  
to private charities feel their contributions are put to good use.   
So, almost everybody who pays income tax would actively think about  
the best way to provide charitable services to needy people, and would  
be likely to pay close attention to how the private charity - or the  
local or state government if that's what that taxpayer chose - is  
using the money.  After all, the poverty programs would now be run by  
people in your own home town. 
 <p>
It was early in this century when doctors first understood enough  
about medicine to begin customizing medical treatment to fit the  
patient's needs.  It would be fitting if we could end the century with  
the same kind of progress in welfare for the poor.

<h2>Republican Bad News Bears Are On The Prowl </h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>

My grandmother told me that bad news comes in threes.  Over a 
lifetime, I've concluded that she was right.  This especially came to 
mind last week, as I read in the papers three pieces of bad news that 
could torpedo the Gingrich Republican revolution of 1994. 
                       <P>
First item - Senator Trent Lott (R-Miss.) seems to have slipped a new 
subsidy for the maritime industry into an appropriations bill.  It's 
only $46 million - what difference can that make to a $1.58 trillion 
government?  But it continues one of those catastrophic subsidy 
concepts that has so characterized liberal thinking for the last 50 
years. 
             <P>
The idea that the government can somehow hold back the tide of 
competition in international shipping has been liberal dogma for 
decades.  There is the Jones Act, for example, which according to our 
International Trade Commission, costs the taxpayers $10 billion a 
year.  The Maritime Operating Differential Subsidy, according to the 
General Accounting Office, costs hundreds of millions more.  And all 
the while America's merchant fleet is dwindling, priced out of the 
market by the very subsidies that are supposed to be rescuing it. 
                                                                                   <P>
Even President Clinton once proposed that the subsidies  be ended.  So 
did Vice President Gore, in a study that said their elimination could 
"spur the country's economic growth by $3 billion annually." 
                                                                         <P>
Well, they may have been kidding.  But we didn't think the 
conservative Republicans were.  
                                                             <P>
Second, I'm struck by the similarity of another Republican effort - 
this time led by the senior governor in America, Republican Terry 
Branstad of Iowa.  Using the wiles and power of the Republican 
constituency of farm belt America, Governor Branstad evidently 
persuaded the leaders of the smaller government revolution to 
reinstate a $1.8 billion (over seven years) subsidy to the ethanol 
industry. 
                                                 <P>
The House Ways and Means Committee had proposed reducing the ethanol 
tax exemption from 54 cents a gallon to (gasp!) 51 cents.  Governor 
Branstad proclaimed Iowa's future imperiled!  The ethanol industry 
will be destroyed, said the lobbyists. 
                                      <P>
I saw how smoothly Governor Branstad sweet-talked the Congresspeople, 
and how quickly they bought the argument that a 6% decrease in a 
single subsidy could destroy the nation's 28th largest state with a 
$56 billion economy.  Then the alacrity with which the Republican 
leadership caved on the issue made me wonder whether the Republican 
Revolution of 1994 could ever succeed. 
                       <P>
If America's third party -- the Gingrich conservatives elected in the 
sweep of 1994 -- as contrasted with the Senate Republicans and the 
liberal Democrats -- was in favor of this enormous and unnecessary 
subsidy, who would ever be for eliminating it?    
       <P>
Then, as if to round out my grandmother's truism, there was an article 
that a group of  Republicans on the Senate Finance Committee were 
turning into marshmallows on the subject of tax cuts.  The word is 
that they want to cut taxes a lot less than $245 billion over seven 
years because they have lost their nerve about the spending cuts that 
would be needed to balance the budget.  Never mind that the Senate had 
negotiated the House down from $345 billion in tax cuts and then 
agreed to the $245 number.  These Republican Senators now wanted to 
renege. 
      <P>
The backsliders - John Chafee of Rhode Island, Orrin Hatch of Utah, 
Alan Simpson of Wyoming, Larry Pressler of South Dakota and Alfonse 
D'Amato of New York - prowled the Senate like Republican bad news 
bears.  They appear to have been seized by Beltway madness,  the 
insidious affliction that has driven federal spending up more than 31% 
in real terms since 1981.  These Senators have evidently decided that 
it's politically easier for them to let the government keep on 
spending than it is to let Americans keep their own money.  The 
liberal Democrats seem to have found some unexpected allies. 
                                               <P>
For the moment, House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Senate Majority Leader 
Bob Dole seem to have threatened the recalcitrant six into line - a 
line that will probably hold through Senate Finance Committee votes.  
But many opportunities to undermine the tax cuts of 1995 remain - in 
floor amendments, the conference with the House, and final passage 
under threat of a Clinton veto. 
                               <P>
I should be optimistic, but I can't shake my grandmother's wisdom:  
bad things do come in threes.  First, more maritime subsidies.  Then 
more ethanol subsidies.  And, finally, the same old "keep on spending, 
business as usual" syndrome.  And all approved by the very 
conservatives we put into power to clean up the mess. 
<P> 
If, as some polls suggest, the new Congress is slipping from favor 
with the general public, could it be because the general public sees 
too much of the old business as usual in the Capitol? 
           <P>

<h2>The "Stern-ing" of America?</h2> 
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 

What does it say about the state of our popular culture that radio 
shock-jock Howard Stern can replace Colin Powell as the best-selling 
author in America?
<p>
Stern's book, Miss America, went to the top of the charts last week, 
selling more than nine copies for every one copy of the next best-
selling book on the list.
<p>
Stern's specialty is trash talk, and apparently there are thousands of 
garbage collectors out there who will pay $ 27.50 to wallow in the 
muck.
<p>
I ran into several hundred of them last week in Manhattan as they 
lined up in front of a bookstore to get autographed copies of Stern's 
rubbish. I must admit I was intrigued, even a little amused (Howard 
Stern fans can read?) - from a distance.
<p>
The taxi driver warned me when I gave him the address of my 
appointment that it was just down the street from Stern's book signing 
and traffic would be more than usually snarled. He suggested dropping 
me short of my destination since I'd have better luck walking the last 
block and a half.
<p>
The sight of police barricades on the sidewalk and a dozen or more 
blue uniforms persuaded me he was right. Besides, I was curious to see 
just who would stand in line for several hours in 30-degree weather to 
get Stern's autograph. The mostly male, youngish crowd - late teens to 
mid-30s - weren't content to wait quietly for their chance to meet 
their idol, who had promised to appear dressed in the same 
transvestite outfit that adorns the book's cover. Several shouted 
insults and obscenities at cars, pedestrians, police, anyone and 
anything in hearing distance. I suppose I shouldn't have been 
surprised, but the voices bellowing curses felt like a slap in the 
face. I can turn the dial when I hear Stern's foul mouth on the public 
airwaves. But for the few minutes I stood waiting to cross the street 
in front of Stern's fans I couldn't escape his cheap imitators.
<p>
Stern likes to fashion himself a libertarian (he ran, briefly, as the 
Libertarian Party candidate for governor of New York in 1994) pushing 
the envelope of free speech on the radio. He even manages to sneak in 
a few lines of "social commentary" in his 482-page book, striking a 
blow for morality by inveighing against Woody Allen's "low-life, 
amoral habits" and the hypocrisy of those parents who sent their 
prepubescent sons to spend the weekend with Michael Jackson, no 
questions asked.
<p>
And Stern proudly touts his 20-year marriage, describing himself as "a 
devoted husband and father." It's enough to make you wonder if his 
whole bit isn't a put-on.
<p>
But Stern is no satirist, a latter-day Jonathan Swift making "a modest 
proposal." He incites nastiness, crudity and effrontery. And his fans 
revel in outdoing their mentor. In his book, Stern describes one 
particularly vulgar protege who specializes in Stern's trademark prank 
phone calls. This social misfit delights in tormenting TV call-in show 
hosts, especially Mother Angelica, a Roman Catholic nun whose program 
appears on a religious cable station. Stern reproduces the transcript 
of two of these creepy calls in his book under the subheading "Jesus 
died for you," in bold print.
<p>
Stern has made millions with this trash. And the sales of his book 
suggest he'll make millions more. And it's not just Stern who's 
getting rich, but also the publishers and radio stations that give him 
access to his audience.
<p>
Infinity Broadcasting, which produces his radio show, has paid $ 1.7 
million in fines to the Federal Communications Commission for some of 
Stern's on-air antics, which violated FCC rules. They're not laying 
out that kind of money just because they believe in the First 
Amendment. The response to Stern needn't be censorship. Mother 
Angelica had the best answer. "You really need to examine your 
conscience," Stern quotes her saying to a Stern-inspired prank caller.
<p>
There's not much hope Stern or his fans will take Mother Angelica's 
advice. But maybe the rest of us can shame the media executives who 
give Stern a platform into examining theirs.
<p>

<title>du Pont:   Maintaining the Value of the Dollar -- 12/22/95
</title>

</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>



<center><i>December 20, 1995</i><hr>

<h2>
Maintaining the Value of the Dollar
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>  
 <p>
Article I, Section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress the power "to 
coin money [and] regulate the value thereof." 
 <P>
Nowhere does the Constitution tell Congress how much money to coin, 
how it should be valued, or how the government should regulate these 
matters.  In 1913, the Congress gave the power to decide those issues 
to the Federal Reserve, which quickly became - and still remains - the 
most powerful economic institution in the nation. 
 <P>
As our nation's central bank, the Fed decides how much money will be 
available in our banking system to make loans.  So in addition to 
controlling the money supply, it largely controls short-term interest 
rates.  With control over the money supply and interest rates, the Fed 
then has enormous influence over real economic growth, unemployment, 
and inflation in our economy.    
 <P>
Most people know little - and care less - about monetary aggregates, 
discount rates, and other technical Fed issues.  But every American 
understands that a primary responsibility of the government is to 
maintain the value of our money.  A government that intentionally (or 
even unintentionally) erodes the value of earnings and savings is 
undermining current prosperity and the future prospects of its 
citizens.  Along with establishing justice, ensuring domestic 
tranquillity and providing for the common defense - to quote the 
preamble to the Constitution - sound money,  a dollar "as good as 
gold," is the ranking economic priority of the nation. 
 <P>
The trouble is, that's not what the law says.  The Employment Act of 
1946, as amended by the Humphrey-Hawkins Act of 1978, legally sets 
"full employment" as the primary goal of Federal Reserve policy.  This 
law requires the Fed to stimulate the economy with lower interest 
rates and the coining of more money whenever the unemployment rate 
rises.   
 <P>
Of course these two actions can quickly lead to higher inflation,  
which devalues our money.  Nevertheless,  whenever unemployment rises, 
even when inflation is already too high, the Fed is legally required 
to stimulate the economy.  So inflation ratchets higher and higher, 
until a recession occurs and moderates the inflation.  
 <P>
Such economic cycles roll through our economy much as weather fronts 
roll across the country.  But unlike storms, economic cycles build 
upon each other.  History has often seen that both at the trough of 
each new recession and at the peak of each cycle of expansion, 
inflation and unemployment were higher than they had been the time 
before.   
 <P>
So there is a "catch 22" in which higher inflation leads to higher 
unemployment.  Then under the Humphrey-Hawkins rule, the higher 
unemployment requires additional Fed stimulus, which in turn leads to 
even higher inflation.  These kind of cycles and pressures hinder the 
Fed's long run ability to maintain the value of our money.  As long as 
the Humphrey-Hawkins law remains unchanged, the value of our savings 
remains at risk. 
 <P>
Right now inflation is under control, and unemployment is low, so the 
Fed faces no dilemma.  But sooner or later the Fed will again face 
that hard choice of whether to obey the law and temporarily reduce 
unemployment at the cost of higher inflation, or violate the law and 
stick with price stability.  The Fed should not have to face such a 
choice.   
 <P>
Senator Connie Mack (R-FL) and Congressman Jim Saxton (R-NJ), who co-
chair Congress's Joint Economic Committee, have introduced legislation 
to end the Feds dilemma of choosing between full employment and low 
inflation. They would do so by repealing the Humphrey-Hawkins Act and 
replacing it with the Economic Growth and Price Stability Act. 
 <P>
This new legislation would change the Fed's policy mandate by 
establishing price stability as its primary mission.  It would no 
longer be required to stimulate the economy to create full employment, 
and could concentrate all its efforts on maintaining the value of the 
dollar by controlling inflation. 
 <P>
Mack and Saxton believe that in the long run, maintaining price 
stability is the best thing the Fed can do to keep unemployment down 
and encourage real growth in the economy, which in turn will create 
more jobs.  Thus, ironically, getting rid of the full employment 
Humphrey-Hawkins requirement is actually the best way to achieve full 
employment. 
 <P>
 
Maintaining the value of our money must be the Fed's first 
responsibility, and Congress should say so by law.

<title>Crimson Tide and SDI</title>

<h2>Crimson Tide and SDI
 </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>









 <P>
 






Crimson Tide is a sizzling movie, two hours of high tech, high tension 
confrontation wrapped around a post-Cold War terrorist scenario.  The 
film's tension is created by the need to fire a pre-emptive strike 
from a U. S. submarine in time to destroy rogue Russian missiles being 
fueled for an imminent launch.  But the real drama lies in the issues 
raised about America's security in the post-Cold War era.  
 
The film is fiction, so it doesn't bother to tell us that destruction 
on the launch pad is the only way to kill the Russian nukes.  But in 
the real world it's true:  once a missile is launched, the United 
States is unable to shoot it down.  We can pray for our family or 
friends who in a few minutes will be incinerated.  But we must suffer 
the missile's impact on Washington, Los Angeles, or wherever, because 
we have not built a missile defense system to protect us against 
incoming ICBMs. 
 <P>
We have the technology to build one.  A decade of Strategic Defense 
Initiative (SDI) research has developed the Patriot anti-missile 
missile, for example.  As we saw in the Middle East, the Patriot gives 
us the ability to protect small regions of civilians and soldiers from 
missile attack.  Further, our shipboard AEGIS missile system is a 
workable defender of our naval fleet. 
 <P>
What we lack is the will.  For years, the Congress has gutted funding 
for SDI research and national missile defense, until today's funding 
levels are less than one-third of a decade ago.  Now the Clinton 
administration is negotiating with the shadow of the former Soviet 
Union to be sure we never build a national missile defense. 
 <P>
So we sleep defenseless against a single terrorist missile.  Think for 
a moment about a rogue band of international terrorists operating in 
some remote corner of  Iran -- or Iraq, or in the mountains of North 
Korea, or in the Crimson Tide scenario in rebel Russia on the 
Kamchatka Peninsula.  How does the United States respond if such a 
group were to launch a missile towards our country?  We could, of 
course, retaliate and obliterate their nation, killing millions of 
innocent people.  But what do terrorists care about that?  How much of 
a deterrent would that be to a band of kamikaze extremists willing to 
destroy an American city? 
 <P>
Over a decade ago, when the idea of SDI was first proposed by the 
Reagan Administration, it was derided by liberals as a science fiction 
fantasy, an expensive and impractical dream.  Democratic Congresses 
and weak Presidents bought that argument, so today we have no missile 
defense. 
 <P>
Indeed, our nation has no better means of protecting its people today 
than it did back in the fifties and sixties, the days when American 
school children practiced hiding under their desks during air raid 
drills.  That is inexcusable.  The only reason there is not more of an 
outcry demanding construction of an anti-missile defense shield is 
because many people think it already exists.  In a survey conducted by 
the Coalition to Defend America, almost 60% of the respondents thought 
the "U.S. could destroy a ballistic missile" before it "could hit and 
do damage."  When the respondents were told no such capability exists, 
over 75% said they thought deployment of such a capability should be a 
priority for our nation. 
 <P>
It would not be an expensive priority.  A recent study conducted for 
the Heritage Foundation by former civilian and government military 
experts concluded that for just $2-3 billion over the next five years, 
our nation could adapt existing AEGIS technology to provide an 
effective missile defense for our nation. 
 <P>
As former President Ronald Reagan said in 1993, ten years after he 
launched our nation's SDI effort, "now more than ever, it is vital 
that the United States not back down from its efforts to develop and 
deploy strategic defenses.  It is technologically feasible, 
strategically necessary and morally imperative."  Frank Gaffney, Jr., 
the former Assistant Secretary of Defense in the Reagan Administration 
and currently head of The Center for Security Policy, notes the lack 
of such defenses is "our people's most serious strategic 
vulnerability." 
 <P>
For those who have not yet seen Crimson Tide, I won't give away the 
ending.  But, if  we ever do find a half-a-dozen ICBMs streaking 
towards America, we know our nation would be defenseless against them.  
That's a sad ending.  And Hollywood wouldn't even be around to film 
the sequel. 
 <P>

<title>Pope John Paul II Come to America -- Howley</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<h2>Pope John Paul II Comes to America </h2><p>
By<br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"> Kathleen Howley</a>
</center><hr><p> 
 

The arrival of Pope John Paul II makes me think, with a chuckle, about 
the last time his plane, nicknamed "Shepherd One," touched down on 
American soil. <p>

It was at Stapleton International Airport, in Denver, for the 
celebration of the 1993 World Youth Day. Then, as now, President Bill 
Clinton waited to greet the pontiff, arriving via Air Force One less 
than an hour before the pope. <p>

I was in the area reserved for the pack of journalists covering the 
event. As we waited for the arrival of the pope's plane, I discussed 
the story with a reporter from a Boston television station.  <p>

She told me, in a confidential tone, "He's not going to discuss 
abortion. I have it from a very good source."  <p>

I knew her source. No need to even say it. It was our own Raymond 
Flynn, hizzhonor, "Raybo," the former mayor of Boston. Despite his 
assignment to Rome, as the Clinton-appointed U.S. ambassador to the 
Vatican, Flynn and his staff still kept up connections with the Boston 
press corps. <p>

Boston journalists fondly refer to the former mayor as "Raybo," 
referring to the time, while mayor, when he ran -- Rambo-like -- into 
a burning building and carried out an elderly woman. The joke at the 
time was: Boston politicians will do anything to ensure another vote. <p>

Most Boston journalists tended to like the mayor, then and now, 
because he had all the trappings of a Irish Catholic politicians, with 
none of the baggage. Meaning, he used his religion to wring every last 
vote out of the predominantly Catholic populace, in true James Michael 
Curley fashion, but, he didn't support Church teaching with his vote, 
in true Kennedy fashion. <p>

Hizzhonor claimed to be personally opposed to abortion, yet he did 
everything in his power to elect our pro-abortion President Bill 
Clinton, who couldn't have won the White House without the Catholic 
vote. Flynn criss-crossed the country for months before the election, 
tirelessly campaigning for Clinton. <p>

And, in his own backyard, Flynn did nothing -- zero -- during his 
lengthy tenure as Boston's mayor to stop the hundreds of abortions 
going on in Boston City Hospital, which was under his control.  <p>

I shook my head, doubtfully.  <p>

"Naw, I think he's going to mention abortion," I said. "I think Raybo 
may be engaging in a bit of wishful thinking, on that one." <p>

My fellow journalist was confident.  <p>

"Nope. It's not going to come up, at least in public. I'd bet my last 
dollar on that," she said. <p>

Well, you know the outcome. It took the Holy Father all of three 
minutes to bring up the subject. In his arrival speech, on the airport 
tarmac, he exhorted Americans to "Defend life!"  <p>

Flynn, who on that occasion was holding the umbrella to shield Bill 
Clinton from the rain, looked more and more downcast, as the speech 
wore on. <p>

"All the great causes that are yours today will have meaning only to 
the extent that you guarantee the right to life and protect the human 
person," the Holy Father said, emphatically. <p>

At the time, I actually felt a bit sorry for our ambassador to the 
Vatican, as he stood in the rain with a dejected look on his face. It 
seems he tried to work some behind-the-scene angle that didn't, in the 
end, prove to be fruitful. <p>

You'd think the American media would be used to it by now, and expect 
John Paul to speak strongly about the issues that threaten modern 
society. After all, the Holy Father has often used his speeches to 
label abortion as "murder." <p>

Shocking, isn't it? In the stultifying atmosphere of today's American 
culture, everyone is supposed to toe the line. Even the Conservatives 
aren't willing to take a risk by accurately describing what happens 
during an abortion, or by verbalizing the forces that lie at the root 
of our anti-life society. <p>

Those who try to defend the modern status quo have worked to convince 
Americans that "words kill" -- particularly when referring to 
abortion. Of course, America is built on the premise that only free 
and robust debate will ensure our liberty. But, in large part, the 
other side has convinced most citizens that speaking too strongly on 
any issue is somehow a danger to us all. <p>

Ironically, the opposite is true. In truth, silence kills. 
Historically, we've seen what happens, again and again, when good 
people stay quiet.  <p>

We can all take a lesson from the Holy Father, who during all of his 
previous 67 trips outside the Vatican has never hesitated to speak the 
truth, with love. <p>

He doesn't flinch when condemning such things as chemical 
contraception, sterilization, en-vitro fertilization, feminist 
extremism, and sex outside of marriage, to name but a few hot button 
issues.  <p>

When was the last time an American leader had the guts to lay it on 
the line, like that? <p>

<center><h2>You Must Learn To Forgive You</h2><p>
 By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"> Kathleen Howley</a>
</center><hr><p> 
 

Only in this day and age could a magazine devote an entire, 2,600-word 
article to the subject of confession, and not once mention the word 
"God." <p>

Cosmopolitan did it, in their August issue. The gist of the story was: 
the highest aim in life is to obtain self-forgiveness. <p>

That's right. YOU must learn to forgive YOU. Confess your sins to 
yourself, or to a pal. No need to submit yourself to divine authority. 
Learn how to erase your guilt. Just get rid of it.  <p>

Silly you for feeling guilty in the first place.<p>  

Don't change your habits. Don't even consider the possibility that 
there is such a thing as absolute, immutable truth, or that some 
actions are intrinsically wrong -- or that feelings of actual guilt, 
as opposed to imagined or neurotic guilt, exist for a good reason. <p>

Don't ponder the idea that Hell could, indeed, be real, whether you 
believe in it or not. <p>

Just get to a good therapist, and work through your feelings.<p> 

I suppose that's a much easier route than asking for God's 
forgiveness, which requires an acknowledgment of His authority, true 
repentance, and an earnest resolution to try to sin no more. <p>

That would be life-changing. Earthshaking, in fact.  <p>

I'd wager a guess that the average Cosmo subscriber is nowhere near 
taking that first step. But, without God's absolution, they're just 
changing seats on the Titanic.<p> 

Forgiving yourself may, in fact, give temporary relief. But, until God 
forgives you, your deeds will always exist, if only in the deepest 
recesses of your mind, and, certainly, in your soul. <p>

Without His supernatural grace, dispensed through the Sacrament of 
Penance, they can never be cast "as far as the east is from the west." <p>

Sin, or "guilt," as Cosmo phrased it, "can torment you, make you sick 
-- even weaken your body's immune system." <p>

The article, titled "Are Guilty Secrets Haunting Your Life?" goes on: 
"People often become immobilized, whether they know it or not, unable 
to get on with their lives until they tell the truth." <p>

Ahh, is that all it takes? Having an honest chat with a friend, or 
spending $100 an hour for a therapist? Following Cosmo's logic, 
America should be the healthiest, happiest county in the world.  <p>

After all, is there any self-help route we haven't tried? Is there a 
new therapy technique we've passed up? <p>

Have we left anything unsaid? Is there any topic -- any? -- that 
hasn't been discussed in full detail on Oprah or other TV shows? <p>

And yet, America seems, on the whole, to be much more depressed, 
guilt-ridden, and lonely -- compared to, say, a time when we were a 
God-fearing country.<p> 

No. There's a lot more to healing the deadly effects of sin than just 
telling someone about it.<p>  

There's nothing wrong with therapy, or talking with friends. But 
neither will set us free.<p> 

Perhaps an easier way to explain this complex theological fact is with 
a simple story.<p>  

A man, troubled by his failings, confessed his sins to a Catholic 
priest, and received Sacramental absolution. Later, he spent time in 
prayer with God, and brought up the subject of his already-confessed 
sins.<p>  

The answer from God -- who, although all-knowing, may have been trying 
to make a point -- was, "I don't remember."<p> 

And, this gentle reminder was enough to give the penitent the feeling 
of elation that comes with true freedom. <p> 

I've felt that feeling too, as I've left a confessional. <p>

As Jesus told the Apostles: "Whose sins you shall forgive, they are 
forgiven them; and whose sins you shall retain, they are retained." 
(John 20:23) <p>

About six years ago, after I converted from being an atheist and a 
lapsed Catholic, I spent some time with a college friend who was not a 
believer.<p> 

She was quick to say that I seemed much happier since re-embracing the 
faith. But, she also said that she could never go back to being a 
Catholic because she couldn't stand living with "all that guilt." <p>

"Do I seem guilt-ridden?" I asked her. <p>

"No," she said.<p> 

"That's because the whole point is that Jesus died for our sins, in 
place of us. So, we get off scot-free. No guilt. All I have to do is 
try to live as He wants, and when I fail, I go to Confession, ask for 
His forgiveness, and I leave with a clean slate," I said.<p> 

"A clean slate..." she said, thoughtfully. "That sounds kinda nice." <p>

<title>du Pont: The Republican Dilemma: Growth Or Green Eye Shades?

<h2>The Republican Dilemma: Growth Or Green Eye Shades?
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/

Pete du Pont
</a>

<P>  
Sixteen months into the conservative revolution that swept the field 
in the 1994 elections, the liberals are winning the war. They lost the 
battle at the polls but they are winning the war in the trenches of 
the Congress and the sound bites of the evening news. 


<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The reason is that the argument in Washington - and thus on the 
television - has been about the deficit and the cruel spending cuts 
the Republicans have enacted to reduce it.  When the Republicans 
propose reducing the rate of increase in spending for program A from 
9% per year to 7% (when the annual inflation rate is less than 3%), 
President Clinton brands them harsh and heartless. In due course 
people across America begin to believe it, and then such a modest 
reduction in future growth is thought to be "extreme," and "going too 
far too fast." 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160 
Republicans shouldn't be surprised, for it comes with the territory. 
Being portrayed as mean spirited is the price to be paid for becoming 
the Green Eyeshade political party - that is, paying more attention to 
bookkeeping than to vision. When balancing the budget becomes your 
goal, and budget scoring becomes your god, you lose. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160
Once upon a time the Republicans were the party of growth.  Ronald 
Reagan ran and won on a program of 30% income tax rate cuts. It 
worked.  Eighteen million net new jobs were added to the economy, 
economic growth rates averaged nearly 4% per year after the tax rates 
kicked in, and federal tax revenues rose by 26% during President 
Reagan's two terms. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160
A growth policy would work again.  There is no way to reduce the 
deficit more efficiently and more painlessly than with a higher rate 
of economic growth.  And there is no way of reducing the need for 
welfare spending more rapidly and more permanently than by achieving 
higher incomes for everyone. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160
A successful fiscal policy must include two vital elements.  Slowing 
the growth of government spending is one.  But encouraging economic 
growth is a higher priority, for it also creates jobs and increases 
take home pay, as well as reducing the deficit through greater tax 
receipts. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160
Such a policy should begin with enactment of the core pro-growth tax 
reduction programs of the Contract With America. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160
Cutting and indexing the capital gains tax would quickly stimulate 
growth by unlocking billions of dollars of assets. Expanding the use 
of Individual Retirement Accounts (IRAs), and repealing the Social 
Security benefits tax would increase growth, too.  Raising the amount 
that retirees can earn without loss of benefits would expand the 
supply of elderly workers, help employers meet their demands for 
skilled labor over the next decade and increase federal revenue. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160
Second, instead of pursuing deficit reduction as the primary goal of 
economic policy, Republicans should advocate a policy of aggressive 
deregulation to encourage economic growth.  Free farmers from acreage 
restrictions so they can grow more crops while phasing out subsidies, 
thus reducing spending. Deregulate communications to unleash high-tech 
growth.  Replace welfare programs with work to increase labor output 
at the lower end of the economic scale.  Allow parents to choose the 
best schools for their children to spur long range economic growth by 
improving the skills of the workforce.  Begin the transfer of 
retirement saving from the Social Security system to individually 
owned marketplace IRAs. They would grow both the retirement income of 
older Americans and the savings pool of the nation to fuel even more 
prosperity. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160 
Finally, pick up on the growth ideas of the Tax Reform Commission: 
repeal the existing tax code and replace it with a single-rate, 
progressive flat tax. The resulting  explosion of growth would create 
millions of new jobs and billions of dollars in increased personal 
income.  The Hall-Rabuska flat tax proposal was estimated to increase 
economic growth a full percentage point per year. Although that 
increase may seem small, a percentage point increase in the growth of 
the economy translates into six million jobs and two trillion dollars 
in real economic productivity over eight years.  It would also 
increase government tax revenue by nearly $700 billion, allowing 
Republicans spooked by the deficit to reduce it. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160 
That is an economic program worth expending political blood and 
treasure to enact.   
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160
Let the liberals take the other side - that the tax reductions are 
growing the economy too fast, creating too many jobs, and giving 
people too much freedom and too much money. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160 
Republicans can reply that Democratic proposals to reduce the economic 
growth rate from 4% to 3.5% are cruel and heartless. The evening news 
will be filled with shots of disappointed men and women who had been 
counting on putting a new roof on the house or their daughter through 
college. Congressional Budget Office scorers could be furloughed as 
non-essential employees.  And the deficit would go down.  And who 
knows, even the Green Eyeshade Republicans might be happy.

<title>du Pont: A New Medicare: A Better Deal for the Elderly -- 4/28/96</title>

<h2>A New Medicare: <br>A Better Deal for the Elderly
 </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>








<P>

<P>




<P>
Medicare, the government health care program for older 
Americans, currently serves 32 million people and costs about $180 
billion a year.  Medicare recipients pay $19 billion in premiums and the 
rest comes from a federal payroll tax.
<P>
Often the health care provided isn't very good. One reason is that 
the government pays doctors and hospitals providing the care only about 
70% of its cost, so doctors don't want to serve Medicare patients. As a 
result, there are longer waits for care, and sometimes a lack of care. So 
health care is being rationed to some of the elderly.
<P>
The quality of care may be lower, too, since hospitals and doctors 
are paid the same fee regardless of the quality of care provided.  For 
example, if a doctor is paid a fixed amount to implant a pacemaker, why 
not implant the cheapest one available and pocket the difference?
<P> 
 Finally, new medical technology is slow to be approved by the 
Medicare bureaucracy, so the elderly often get "old medicine."
<P>
 Even with all these efforts to limit costs, Medicare is proving to 
be very, very expensive.  According to the Clinton administration and 
Medicare Trustees, Medicare as it now operates will run out of money in 
less than seven years.
<P>
  By 2000, under current budget projections, Medicare will spend 
almost $250 billion, about 13% of the entire federal budget.  The deficit 
in Medicare Part A (hospital insurance) and the general revenue 
contribution to Medicare Part B (insurance for physicians' fees and other 
expenses) will be adding almost $150 billion to the total federal deficit.  
<P>
 Financial problems will quickly grow worse after that.  By the 
time those entering the workforce today retire, the Medicare payroll tax 
will need to be three to seven times higher than now.  The annual 
premiums paid by the elderly will be about $4,400 to $8,600 per couple 
instead of today's $1,000.
<P>	
 It doesn't have to be that way.  One simple and popular reform 
proposal offers a solution:  allowing the elderly the choice of substituting 
a Medical Savings Account and private insurance for their current 
Medicare coverage.
<P>
 Under one version of this proposal, Medicare beneficiaries 
would have the right to receive 95% of average Medicare spending per 
beneficiary and put it into a Medical Savings Account (MSA).  Retirees 
could also contribute the funds they must currently pay for Medicare 
premiums, supplemental Medigap insurance, and out-of-pocket health 
expenses.
<P>
  For the average retiree, these would total close to $9,000 next 
year.  The retiree would use part of these funds to purchase catastrophic 
insurance covering all expenses over a high deductible (say $2,000 or 
$3,000).  The retiree would have at least $2,000-$3,000 remaining in the 
account, which would then be used to pay expenses below the deductible, 
including HMO or other private health care insurance coverage if they 
prefer.  Any unspent MSA funds could then be withdrawn at the end of 
the year for any purpose, or saved for future medical expenses.
<P>
 With MSAs, the quality of elderly health care would quickly 
begin to improve.   Patients would be free to choose the doctors and 
hospitals that would provide the quality health care they prefer.  The 
elderly who exercised the MSAs would also have complete catastrophic 
coverage, which Medicare does not provide.  Medicare coverage runs out 
after a certain number of days of hospital care, and other benefits are 
similarly limited.  But with an MSA, the elderly can buy a catastrophic 
policy that pays all costs over their chosen deductible.
<P>
 Most important, since people would effectively be spending 
their own funds out of the MSAs for non-catastrophic health care, they 
would have excellent incentives to eliminate waste and inefficiency and 
control their own costs.  Since doctors and hospitals would be receiving 
100% payment for their services instead of 70% under today's Medicare, 
they in turn would compete to reduce costs to attract elderly patients 
trying to conserve their MSA funds.  The result would be lower costs for 
Medicare.
<P>
 Several private sector employers have already adopted MSAs 
for their workers and achieved dramatic cost savings of 30%-40% and 
more as a result.  To the extent Medicare beneficiaries chose MSAs, 
much of this cost savings would likely be achieved for Medicare as well.  
This would greatly help to reduce the burden of Medicare on the federal 
budget and its contribution to the overall deficit.  It would also help to 
solve the long term Medicare financing crisis. And since the individual 
gets 95% of average Medicare spending, the government saves an 
additional 5%, or more than $5 billion per year.	
<P>
  This proposal provides overwhelming benefits to the elderly, 
and would be enormously popular.  Yet, all of this can be achieved while 
actually saving the government substantial funds, and helping to solve the 
program's long term financing crisis.  Such a combination of advantages 
should be irresistible to policymakers.

<h2> Bringing Medical Advances to Patients Sooner 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>  
 <p>
Some 70 Americans will die today because the Food and Drug 
Administration doesn't allow existing medical technology to be used to 
save their lives. 
 <p>
If the FDA approves a product that eventually causes a problem in the 
marketplace, it gets into trouble.  But if the product isn't available 
in the United States and isn't generally known to exist, the FDA 
doesn't get into trouble even if thousands of people die for lack of 
it. 
 <p>
Thus there was no outcry even though 119,000 people died of 
hypertension or heart disease during an eight-year wait for beta 
blockers to be approved.  Or when more than 2,000 died from heart 
disease during three years of waiting for Mevacor.  Or when 3,500 died 
of kidney cancer during the three-year wait for Interleukin-2. 
 <p>
The procedures for bringing new products to use in the United States 
are among the slowest and most expensive in the developed world.  In 
the 1960s it took six years for the FDA to approve a new drug.  Now it 
takes almost 16 years, even with the recently heralded reduction in 
the time required for final review to just over a year and a half. 
 <p>
It's time to help the elderly and the ill by bringing drugs and 
medical devices to market more quickly.  The Progress & Freedom 
Foundation has a proposal to do it.  It would separate the development 
and product review process from the FDA's role of enforcing mandated 
safety and effectiveness standards. 
 <p>
The FDA would license private entities called Drug or Device 
Certifying Bodies (DCBs), which drug or device manufacturers would 
retain to oversee their product's development.  Since manufacturers 
could choose among DCBs, they could compete to produce a lower-cost, 
faster, and higher quality process for drug and device development and 
review. 
 <p>
More important, the FDA would have 90 days to approve a positive 
recommendation by a DCB.  If it did not act, the use of the drug or 
device would be allowed.  This would be far different from now, when 
the FDA raises hurdle after hurdle, requires more and more tests, 
never saying yes, but rarely daring to just say no.  The current 
bureaucratic gridlock would be broken, so that more effective 
treatments can get to the ill. 
 <p>
There's no reason private entities should not be used to review a drug 
application.  Private entities already perform all functions involved 
in this process except the final approval step.  Currently, the FDA 
requires sponsors of new drugs to obtain approval to begin clinical 
trials, and then continues to oversee the sponsor's clinical program 
through regular reports and other mechanisms.  After the clinical 
studies are completed, sponsors apply for FDA approval.  The FDA does 
no testing, but only reviews the data collected through clinical 
trials. The FDA would review the DCB's analysis of the data, and could 
veto approval if it found the new drug unsafe or ineffective. 
 <p>
The approval process for medical devices needs to be changed, too.  
Currently, if a device is not substantially equivalent to one already 
on the market, it must go through a complex clinical trial process 
even if it's a simple device that carries little or no risk.  The 
breast examination pad, for example, is two pieces of plastic with a 
layer of silicone in between.  It has no moving parts, is non-toxic, 
and in use does not invade the body.  But it is illegal in the United 
States because there is no analogous product on the market.  So years 
of testing loom while women whose lives could be saved by it are 
forbidden to use it. 
 <p>
Finally, there is the question of liability.  Where the treatment of 
patients with serious medical problems is involved, there are going to 
be adverse outcomes from the use of drugs and even death on occasion, 
no matter how responsible the manufacturer and how strict the 
regulation.  U.S. companies are not permitted to defend themselves 
from lawsuits simply by pleading that they have complied with 
regulations.  As a result, manufacturers of some pharmaceuticals have 
simply quit making them.  Here, we might look to Europe, where 
regulatory standards protect the patient, but a company is free of 
tort liability if it can show that the state of scientific and 
technical knowledge when the product went into circulation was not 
such as to enable the existence of the defect to be discovered. 
 <p>
The FDA was designed for the 1930s and is bureaucratically incapable 
of handling the exploding technological advances of medicine in the 
1990s.  We must change the current system for bringing medical 
products to the marketplace so that our citizens will receive the full 
benefits of the dramatic scientific discoveries and medical 
breakthroughs our nation's vast research establishment is producing. 
 
And they need those benefits while they are still alive.

<title>du Pont--  Should Prisoners be Allowed to Work? 
</title>

<h2> Should Prisoners be Allowed to Work? 
</h2>



<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>

</center><hr>  

 <p>
 
Most people would agree that if prisoners learned a skill while they 
were in jail they could more easily get a job when they got out, and 
that an ex-prisoner with a job is less likely to commit another crime.  
Since nearly one-half of people released from prison return to prison 
within three years, job skills could mean a significant decline in the 
crime rate. 
 <P>
The problem is that most productive prison work - other than food or 
laundry work within the prison itself - is against the law. 
 <P>
In 1936, Congress banned convict labor on federal contracts exceeding 
$10,000 in value.  In 1940 the Ashurst-Sumners Act made it a federal 
crime to transport convict-made goods in interstate commerce.  And 
many state legislatures have enacted laws to prohibit the sale of 
convict-made goods within their borders.  States like New York 
compromised and adopted the "state-use" system, which permitted 
convicts to manufacture goods for sale to governmental agencies only, 
which provides a very limited market for the fruits of convict labor. 
 <P>
These statutes were a form of protectionism - to protect providers of 
goods and services in the free market from having to compete with 
convict labor.  Small businesses and labor unions view such 
competition as unfair, and have successfully prevented relaxation of 
the statutes.  When Congress tried to change the laws in 1979, the 
best it could do was allow prisoner work if they are paid the 
prevailing wage, labor union officials approve, local labor is 
unaffected, and no local unemployment is produced.  These criteria are 
nearly impossible to meet, so a mere 1,660 prisoners, out of one 
million, were working under these waivers in 1994.  
 <P>
It was not always this way.  In the last century, prisons earned a 
major part of their daily cost by leasing convict labor to private 
employers.  In 1885, three-fourths of prison inmates were involved in 
productive labor, the majority working for private employers under 
contract and leasing arrangements.  By the 1930s only 44% worked, and 
nearly all worked for state industries rather than for private 
employers.  A 1990 Census found that only 11% of prisoners worked in 
prison manufacturing or farming, down from 16% in 1984.  If part-time 
work in laundry and food services is included, only about half of 
prisoners work. <P>
 
Many prisoners are eager to work, if only to relieve the tedium of 
prison life.  But more important is that the work is good for society 
in the long run because it reduces crime.  A 1983-87 Federal Post-
Release Employment Project study confirmed that employed prisoners do 
better than others without jobs.  Prisoners who work have fewer 
disciplinary problems in prison and lower rates of re-arrest; they are 
more likely to get a full-time job; more likely to quit their job in 
favor of a better-paying job; and less likely to have their 
supervision revoked for a parole violation or new crime.  In the words 
of Thomas Townsend, president of the Corrections Industry Association, 
"It's a matter of public safety:  inmates who have worked in prison, 
and gained new skills have a significantly better chance of not 
returning to crime and prison...." <P>
 
The only disadvantages of more work opportunities for prisoners are 
the feared competitive effects on local labor markets.  But the 
government's first responsibility is to citizens, not to narrow 
interest groups.  New production benefits all Americans.  It raises 
the demand for their services and creates new goods for purchase.  
Competition is the strength of our economic system,  not a wrong to be 
righted, so our policies should be breaking down, not erecting, 
barriers to work - especially when the work will make the streets 
safer for the rest of us. 
 <P>
Allowing prisoners to work makes sense.  Begin by repealing state and 
federal limitations on inmate pay.  Let responsible private businesses 
competitively bid for the use of prison labor.  Let prisons "profit" 
from accepting these contracts.  Provide monetary incentives to 
prisons and their wardens for leading their institutions to self-
sufficiency. <P>
 
It won't be easy for the private-sector bidders, because prison labor 
is not easy to use.  Difficulties include security problems, lack of 
skills and good work habits, remote prison locations, and poor worker 
productivity.  At least at the beginning, the market value of prisoner 
labor will be very low and the quality of their work poor.  But both 
will improve as skills improve. 
 <P>
Across the country a million prisoners are serving time in jail.  Each 
month, 40,000 of them are released under mandatory supervision, on 
parole, or at the conclusion of their sentences.  Our streets would be 
safer and the crime rate lower if these men had a skill, a job, and 
the beginning of a future.

<h2>
Castro Acts, Clinton Crumbles  
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">
Linda Chavez
</a>

<P>
President should call for full sanctions and threaten a military 
blockade and retaliatory strikes if necessary.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
President Clinton faces a touch test of his foreign policy as he 
fashions a response to the downing Saturday of two U.S. civilian 
aircraft in international waters near Cuba. And, so far, he's in 
danger of flunking.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When Haitian or Bosnian lives were at stake over the past three years, 
Clinton didn't hesitate to threaten and ultimately to use force, 
sending thousands of troops to defend dubious U.S. interests. But the 
brutal attack on unarmed Americans (three of four fliers were U.S. 
citizens) last weekend elicited no such reolve.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The best the president could muster in the hours after the attack was 
to send the Coast Guard to try to recover the bodies. And his 
announcement Monday that he would reinstate a ban on charter flights 
to Cuba doesn't go nearly far enough.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The administration's policy toward Cuba has been muddled from the 
beginning.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The president would clearly like to normalize relations with Cuba and 
has been steadily moving in that direction since he took office. But 
Fidel Castro keeps throwing monkey wrenches in the deal. The attack on 
two U.S. planes is only the most recent - and most surprising - of his 
actions.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Castro consistently has thumbed his nose at Clinton. In August 1994, 
Castro embarrassed the United States by allowing 30,000 Cubans to flee 
the island on rickety boats headed for the U.S. The president handled 
the crisis by detaining most of the refugees in camps outside the U.S. 
and repatriating those who would agree to return to Cuba. To do so, 
the president had to reverse the U.S. policy granting Cuban refugees 
automatic asylum that had been on the books for 30 years.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Last fall, in the hopes of improved relations with Cuba, the 
administration lifted some restrictions on air flights and on goods 
and dollars that could be sent to the island by Americans. And, for 
the time being, money from relatives will continue to flow.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Most observers believed that the administration was moving toward 
lifting the 34-year-old U.S. embargo against Cuba and would - in a 
second term - grant formal recognition to Cuba, which the United 
States has withheld for more than 35 years.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But Castro has rewarded the Clinton administration's overtures with 
increased belligerence.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Castro continues to rule Cuba with an iron fist, tolerating no open 
dissent and inflicting terrible deprivation on his own citizens in 
order to maintain a powerful military, even as the economy of the 
island crumbles. In recent weeks, he has resorted to rounding up 
dissidents and human rights activists.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the past two weeks alone, Cuban state secret police have arrested, 
detained or searched the homes of 50 dissidents.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Perhaps the downing of the two U.S. civilian planes will finally 
convince the president that he's headed down the wrong path.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Castro understands only one thing: power. Castro will escalate his 
violence if he thinks he can literally get away with murder, including 
killing Americans.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The administration ought to use this incident to totally revise its 
Cuba policy.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Sanctions against Cuba ought to be fully reinstated and vigorously 
enforced. The president should warn Cuba in no uncertain terms that 
any repeat of the refugee blackmail Castro initiated in 1994 and 1980 
(when more than 100,000 Cuban refugees fled by boat to the U.S.) will 
be met with a military blockade. And any further military attacks on 
Americans will be dealt with in kind by retaliatory strikes by U.S. 
forces.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The president shouldn't expect much support from the international 
community on such a  course of action. It took hours of debate to get 
even a mild U.N. Security Council statement deploring Cuba's attack on 
the two planes. But Cuba is in America's back yard and Fidel Castro 
remains a threat, not only to his own people but also to ours. The 
next time Clinton thinks about deploying U.S. troops, maybe he should 
consider defending U.S. interests a little closer to home.

<title>Politics Makes Strange Bedfellow</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<hr>
<center><h3>Politics Makes Strange Bedfellows</h3><br>
By<br><a href="townhall/columnists/howley.html"> Kathleen Howley</a><p>
<hr></center> 
<P>
 
The fat lady has yet to sing. With Democrats continuing to desert 
their party in droves, especially on the state level, the political 
drubbing that began with the November elections is going into extra 
innings. 
<P>
Almost every week, the newspapers carry stories of Democrats who have 
decided either to switch, or to quit. 
<P>
The political concept of Liberalism -- spelled with a capital "L" -- 
is dead, at least for this millennium. No longer will government 
simply give handouts as the solution to every problem. No longer can 
the media merrily assume to represent the views of all Americans when 
they postulate that freedom in America equals life without values. 
<P>
But, before Republican leaders get too euphoric about the all-out 
rout, it would be wise to remember that politics makes strange 
bedfellows.  
<P>
Some of their staunchest supports today are people who don't really 
fit into the Republican party, or the Democratic party. They are 
called: Catholic voters. 
<P>
 Of the 250 million people in America, 95 million, or two out of every 
five, are Roman Catholic. Sure, some of them have fallen away from the 
faith, for now -- after all, the Church has not been immune from the 
devastating effects of the "Just-Me" philosophy that hit society in 
the 1960s.  
<P>
 But, despite the biased polls you'll occasionally see in the 
newspapers, most remain firm supporters of Catholic teachings 
regarding the value of life and the family. 
<P>
 At the moment, the Republicans are best representing their views. 
Forty years ago, it was the Democrats. The mass of Catholic voters 
switched once. They can switch again. 
<P>
 Probably, that doesn't make too many Republicans quake in their 
boots. Of the two parties, they are the most pro-life, they'll tell 
you. They have the best ideas for restoring the strength of the 
family. They have a common-sense and value-based approach to 
education.  
<P>
 But, every once in a while, an issue comes along that makes the 
typical Catholic voter extremely ill-at-ease with the standard 
Republican party line. 
<P>
Immigration is one -- in a big way. Most Catholic voters are 
descendants of turn-of-the-century immigrants. True, it makes good 
sense to secure our borders and to crack down on illegal immigration -
- as long as that doesn't mean punishing the innocent children of 
illegals. 
<P>
 However, many Catholics will tell you that America must never close 
her doors to legal immigration, or develop a stingy attitude toward 
it, lest we lose our vigor and make a lie of the Statue of Liberty: 
"Give me your tired, your poor, your huddled masses yearning to breath 
free." 
<P>
 And, here's another issue: immoral labor practices. 
<P>
 No, I'm not going to hop on the media bandwagon and tell you that the 
big, bad Republicans only care about making a buck. I'm not going to 
even mention country clubs.  
<P>
 But, the fact is, the Republican party seems ever-ready to put the 
laborer at the mercy of the corporate decision-makers. If they want to 
hold on to their Catholic supporters, they are going to have to knock 
it off. 
<P>
  During recent months, the National Labor Committee in New York has 
sponsored a cross-country tour for two teenagers to tell the world of 
their experiences in the garment sweatshops of Honduras and El 
Savador, assembling high-priced clothes for The Gap, Banana Republic, 
Eddie Bauer, Sears, and Gitano, a subsidiary of Fruit of the Loom. 
<P>
  In these tax-free factories, built specifically to produce goods for 
the U.S. and Canadian markets, children and young women work shifts 
that sometimes exceed18 hours, for below-subsistence wages. The abuses 
they recount are mind-numbing. 
<P>
 Of course, the corporate bigwigs deny all of it. But, if you ask me 
who I'm going to believe -- Donald Fisher, who was paid more than $2 
million last year to run the Gap empire, or Judith Viera, an 18-year-
old who made 56 cents an hour and was limited to two bathroom trips a 
shift --- hummm....who would you believe? 
<P>
Judith, by the way, was fired when she tried to help organize a union. 
For good measure, the big boss also threw out her three sisters, just 
because they were related. 
<P>
 On her last 18-hour shift on the production line, Judith said they 
were sewing Eddie Bauer T-shirts. The crew included two workers who 
were only 15 years old. 
<P>
 Earlier this year, the House's Trade Subcommitee approved a bill 
introduced by Republican Phillip Crane to increase the tariff breaks 
for products entering the U.S. from sweatshops in the Central American 
and the Caribbean by $240 million.  
<P>
 Remember the giant sucking sound? H.R. 553 means it will only get 
louder, with more American companies being wooed by the prospects of 
33-cents-an-hour wages and laborers who are vulnerable to 
exploitation. 
<P>
 Currently, the bill has been set aside. But, seeing as Fruit of the 
Loom is a six-figure contributor to the RNC, and The Gap lags not far 
behind with a hefty five-figure donation, H.R. 553 may not be dead for 
long. 
<P>
 Yes, politics does make strange bedfellows, indeed. 
 <P>

<h2>   
The Popcorn Follies   
 </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/
dupont
.html">
Pete du Pont 
</a>
<p>
Popcorn is not a trivial matter.  I am reminded of that at the movies 
where buttered buckets of the stuff are consumed and the surplus 
spread on the floor under my seat. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
But I did not realize the popcorn problem is so severe that a deficit-
bedeviled federal government must shoulder yet another burden to 
protect its citizens.  On April 4th, when President Clinton signed the 
"Freedom to Farm Act," it became the legal responsibility of our 
national government "to ensure the benefits of popcorn are available 
to the people of the United States" by "strengthen[ing] the position 
of the popcorn industry in the marketplace."  Awesome. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
And all this in a bill heralded as a revolutionary step towards the 
deregulation of agriculture, the ending of farm subsidies, and "the 
most sweeping change in agricultural policy in the last 60 years." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
A more appropriate title for this bill might be "The Slightly More 
Flexible Reform Act."  Its reforms are more illusory than real, and 
less permanent than might be expected.  And popcorn is the least of 
its follies. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
What changes under the new farm law?  Most notably, for the first time 
there will be a cap on farm spending.  The law replaces traditional 
subsidy payments with a fixed but declining level of transition 
payments to farmers ($36 billion over seven years).  It also ends 
federal authority to hold farm land out of production.  However, at 
the end of seven years, unless Congress acts, the old farm policies 
(subsidy payments and land set-asides) automatically come back into 
effect. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
What of the so-called "freedom" under the reform bill?  The act was 
promoted as allowing farmers the freedom to plant whatever crop was 
most likely to produce the highest profit.  This would seem to mean 
that, if world market prices for wheat were low but prices for 
tomatoes were high, then wheat farmers might switch to producing 
tomatoes.  Not so.  A farmer now growing subsidized crops can only 
switch to another subsidized crop - essentially other grains, cotton 
or rice. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
What doesn't change under the new farm bill?  A lot.  American 
consumers will continue to pay higher prices than the rest of the 
world's citizens for sugar, peanuts, and most dairy products, because 
these crops will continue to get subsidies amounting to more then $2 
billion a year.  Soybean subsidies will actually increase.  Americans 
will also continue to foot the bill for the Market Promotion Program, 
which helps promote U.S. agricultural products overseas - including, 
henceforth, popcorn.  Landowners don't get those regulatory exemptions 
promised for temporary wetlands under one acre in size.  Farmers and 
ranchers will continue to have to bear the entire financial burden of 
the general public's desire for no net loss of mud puddles. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
The farm bill is also surprising because of the new bureaucracies that 
it creates.  There's a new "National Natural Resources Conservation 
Foundation" to promote the conservation of natural resources on 
private lands, in part through education grants to nonprofit 
organizations.  The nation's top 10 environmental organizations 
already receive more than $500 million a year in grants and donations, 
so they are more than capable of promoting their viewpoint without any 
help from taxpayers. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
Also, a new food safety panel is created, adding one more layer of 
bureaucracy to the Department of Agriculture.  Both consumer groups 
and members of the meat and poultry industries have criticized this 
program.  Following tried and true Washington logic, if neither 
industry nor consumers like a program, it must be good. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
These new programs might surprise people who thought the Republican 
promises to "get government off the backs of people" and presidential 
statements that the "era of big government is over" would mean a 
reduction in the number of federal programs and bureaucracies, not the 
creation of new ones. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
The most perverse part of the new farm bill calls for spending $300 
million to acquire about 100,000 acres of the Florida Everglades.  
Protecting the Everglades may be in the public interest, but the 
simplest way of conserving the Everglades would be to end the sugar 
subsidy that allows inefficient sugar producers to continue to operate 
in the fragile Everglades ecosystem.  Then we could save the money and 
the Everglades.  But sugar subsidies do not seem to be a part of the 
era of big government that President Clinton assures us is over. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
Like the monsters in Hollywood movies, big government just keeps 
coming back.  So on Saturday night, enjoy "Braveheart's" anguished cry 
for freedom, knowing that Washington now has its hand in your bag of 
popcorn.   
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

 
Or if that strikes you as sensible, turn to Section 551 of the Freedom 
to Farm Act.  It creates the "National Kiwifruit Research, Promotion, 
and Consumer Information Act."

<h2>
Self-Esteem's Dark Side Emerges 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">
Linda Chavez
</a>

<P>
As we squander money building students' egos, we feed crime. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
We've heard it so often, none of us questions whether it's actually 
true: you've got to feel good about yourself in order to succeed. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The crusade to improve self-esteem has invaded every sector of life -- 
public and private -- but nowhere more pervasively than education. 
School reformers have spent millions of dollars in the past two 
decades trying to raise the self-esteem of poor achievers. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But researchers now are questioning whether this money has been a good 
investment, since increases in self-esteem show little -- if any -- 
effect on actual achievement. And now a new study, published in the 
journal of the American Psychological Association, suggests raising 
self-esteem may actually be dangerous, especially among individuals 
whose inflated sense of self-worth does not comport with reality. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For at least a generation, it has been an axiom of U.S. education that 
children must have high self-esteem in order to perform well 
academically.<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
And U.S. students today measure higher than those from any other 
country on questions of self-esteem. Unfortunately, they don't do 
nearly as well on math or science or reading, lagging g far behind 
much of the industrial world in actual performance in these areas. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For critics of the self-esteem movement, such evidence suggests 
American schools have wasted a lot of money and effort that could have 
been spent more productively on basic skills and more rigorous 
academic content. But the increased emphasis on self-esteem that has 
permeated American education may be even more pernicious than most 
critics assumed. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
According to three research psychologists who evaluated dozens of 
studies of violent behavior, high self-esteem is more often associated 
with violence than low self-esteem. The authors -- Roy F. Baumeister 
of Case Western Reserve University and Joseph M. Boden and Laura Smart 
of the University of Virginia -- acknowledge that their conclusions 
run counter to conventional wisdom that low self-esteem is the source 
of most anti-social behavior. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But their evidence for "the dark side of high self-esteem" is 
persuasive. The authors claim that "people turn aggressive when they 
receive feedback that contradicts their favorable views (of 
themselves). More to the point, it is mainly the people who refuse to 
lower their self-appraisals who become violent." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A teen who feels he hasn't received the respect he deserves -- in 
other words, he's been dissed -- is more likely to strike out than one 
who genuinely believes himself unworthy -- a sign of low self-esteem. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Baumeister and his co-authors cite dozens of studies of murder, rape, 
domestic abuse and even terrorism that show that violence occurs more 
often when a perpetrator with a high -- often inflated -- opinion of 
himself is challenged by someone he considers inferior. One study of 
more than 100 rapists, for example, confirms that rapists sometimes 
choose a particular victim in order "to disabuse her of her sense of 
superiority. That is, the woman gave the man the impression she 
thought she was better than he was and so he raped her as a way of 
proving her wrong." 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Perhaps the most interesting example given of the correlation between 
high self-esteem and violent behavior involves racist violence. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nazism involved a whole ideology of racial superiority that justified 
violence against those deemed weak or inferior. Similarly, the Ku Klux 
Klan during its heyday was often most violent against two groups who 
challenged the notion of white supremacy: upwardly mobile blacks, and 
whites who helped blacks or treated them as equals. The authors note 
that one study of whites belonging to hate groups demonstrated that 
those who engaged in violent behavior actually were better educated 
and had higher career aspirations than non-violent members of such 
groups. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Baumeister and his colleagues suggest that efforts to raise self-
esteem actually may be making the problems of violence worse: "The 
societal pursuit of high self-esteem for everyone may literally end up 
doing considerable harm." Their conclusion should give all of us -- 
especially educators -- pause. 
 <BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
All those inflated teen-age egos may be contributing to an explosion 
in youth violence that has only begun.

<title>The Medicare Reform Plan: A Good Deal For The Elderly -- du Pont</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<h2>The Medicare Reform Plan: A Good Deal For The Elderly </h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>
 

 
The House Republicans have proposed a major revision to Medicare that, if enacted, will provide greatly improved health care for America's senior citizens.   <p>
 
The proposal accomplishes this by shifting power and control over Medicare and its funds away from the government, the hospitals, and the doctors to the elderly themselves.  As a result of this power to the people approach, the elderly will now enjoy the same freedom others have to choose a broad range of private health care plans instead of being forced to participate in the government Medicare system.    <p>
 
Under the House Republicans' plan, the elderly would each have the freedom to take their share of funds out of Medicare and use it to buy any of the full range of private alternatives for their health coverage.  HMOs or managed care will be one option; others  include Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs), traditional fee-for-service insurers, preferred provider networks, provider service networks (where doctors and hospitals in an area organize to provide health coverage directly), and plans offered by associations such as AARP, or unions, or employers.  The elderly would each be perfectly free to stay in the current Medicare system if they prefer, foregoing the private options entirely. <p>
 
The amounts that can be withdrawn from Medicare for these private 
options would average about $5,000 per year to start and would be 
allowed to grow no faster than specified in the federal budget.  <p>
 
Both experience and actuarial studies show that for these amounts many 
plans can provide better benefits than Medicare.  For example, 
Milliman & Robertson, the nation's top actuarial firm, recently 
completed a study for the National Center for Policy Analysis in 
Dallas showing that with these funds retirees could buy an MSA with 
full fee-for-service insurance covering all expenses over $3,000 per 
year, with $1,500 left in the MSA to pay for expenses below the 
deductible.  Or they could buy an MSA that provides managed care for 
all expenses over $3,000, with $2,100 left in the MSA. <p>
 
Such MSA plans would provide better benefits than Medicare in at least 
five ways: <p>
 
First, the MSA provides complete catastrophic coverage for all 
expenses over $3,000, while Medicare does not.  Medicare coverage runs 
out after various caps and limitations. <p>
 
Second, the fee-for-service MSA provides a cap on out-of-pocket 
spending for covered medical expenses of $1,500 per year (the 
difference between the $3,000 deductible and the $1,500 in the MSA) or 
$900 if the managed care option is chosen.  Medicare has no cap on 
out-of-pocket expenses; the elderly can be liable for  thousands of 
dollars in medical expenses. That is why 70% of the elderly will pay 
almost $1,200 next year on average for private insurance to supplement 
Medicare.  With the MSA, the elderly can keep that $1,200 per year or 
use it to reduce out-of-pocket medical expenses. <p>
 
Third, the funds in the MSA can be used for health care expenses not 
covered by Medicare, such as prescription drugs or eyeglasses. <p>
 
Fourth, unspent funds in the MSA at the end of the year would belong 
to the retiree, and could be saved for future expenses, or withdrawn 
for any purpose, subject to certain minimum balance requirements in 
the House Republicans' bill.  This allows the elderly to share 
directly in the reward for controlling health costs. <p>
 
Finally, MSAs would not be subject to the payment and reimbursement 
limitations of Medicare, or the outdated limitations on what new 
services and treatments the program covers.  These limitations and 
controls are reducing access to care and quality of care under 
Medicare, effectively rationing health care for the elderly. <p>
 
HMOs and other managed care options will be able to provide better 
benefits than Medicare as well.  They will likely add catastrophic 
coverage and prescription drugs to the package offered to the elderly 
for the funds they can withdraw from Medicare each year. <p>
 
Furthermore, the House Republicans' proposal does not increase costs 
appreciably for most older Americans.  There is no increase in 
Medicare deductibles and co-payments, and Medicare premiums (except 
for the very wealthiest Americans) would actually remain at their 
current level of about 31% of the costs of Part B. <p>
 
Best of all, the House Republicans' reform plan actually increases the 
freedom of the elderly to choose their own doctors.  Since private 
plan doctors would not be subject to the Medicare payment limitations, 
doctors  would not be discouraged from providing services to the 
elderly, and so there would be a wider choice of physicians.  <p>
 
Millions of elderly Americans are worried about the future of 
Medicare.  This new approach not only lays those fears to rest, it 
opens vast new health care options for all senior citizens.<p>

<h2>Call it A Miracle </h2> 
<P>by <a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 

Call it a miracle - or perhaps just the triumph of tolerance and 
common sense - but there seems to be far less controversy over 
religious displays on public property this holiday season than in 
recent years. Both creches and menorahs are on display - albeit with 
some restrictions - despite the hostility of the ACLU and other groups 
opposed to such exhibits. 
 <P>
In a computer database search of newspaper articles from around the 
country, I found only 59 stories appearing since Dec. 1 that even 
mentioned Nativity displays, and most of these were announcements of 
holiday celebrations and events. 
 <P>
Admittedly, the ACLU did try to silence "Silent Night" and recordings 
of other Christian hymns piped into a government building in Chicago 
this year. But a federal court decided last week that the group was 
off base (as usual) in claiming  a few carols played over a 
government-owned loudspeaker system were an "establishment of 
religion" forbidden by the First Amendment. 
 <P>
Since 1984, when the Supreme Court handed down its first decision 
involving the display of religious symbols on public property, cities 
and towns have been debating just how far they can go in allowing 
Nativity scenes, menorahs, crosses and other symbols depicting 
important religious events. The court's rules - which seem to change 
each season - now permit religious symbols as part of state-sponsored 
displays so long as secular symbols are also included. And last June, 
the court expanded its interpretation, in effect saying jurisdictions 
couldn't interfere with the right of religious groups to put up 
whatever symbols they chose if the jurisdiction gave non-religious 
groups the right to erect secular, political or other non-religious 
displays on public property. Cities and towns now have the choice of 
saying no to everyone or no one. 
 <P>
Sometimes it's hard to remember that the holidays weren't always so 
complicated. Like most Americans over 40, I can remember when religion 
was at the heart of civic celebrations during Christmas. Denver, where 
I grew up, was well known for its wonderful public and private 
Christmas displays. My father always arranged a special family outing 
for the occasion. He piled everyone into the car for an excursion that 
took us throughout the city. First, we headed downtown to 16th Street, 
where the streets and stores were decked out in ornaments and tinsel, 
then to the Civic Center, where the exhibit proclaiming "Joy to the 
World" and "Peace on Earth" lit up the December sky and filled the air 
with music. We usually ended our tour in the east Denver neighborhoods 
best known for their elaborately decorated homes, many with mangers 
and Wise Men adorning the front lawns. 
 <P>
It was on this part of the trip that I first learned about Hanukkah. 
Through some windows, I could see what appeared to be candelabra with 
only a few candles asymmetrically lit. I thought perhaps they were 
special Christmas lights, like the "luminarias" that decorated my 
native New Mexico. But my father explained to me that these were 
Jewish homes celebrating a different holiday altogether - Hanukkah. 
Later I learned that the holiday commemorates the rededication of the 
Temple in Jerusalem in 165 B.C. after the Maccabees' victory over the 
Syrians. 
 <P>
Today children in many cities can learn about the Hanukkah traditions 
in public displays. Members of the Lubavitch community of Hasidic Jews 
erect large outdoor menorahs in parks and other public places across 
the country. 
 <P>
Americans are among the most religious people in the world. The 
radical separationists - who believe the First Amendment requires that 
religion be driven from civic life - are fighting a losing battle. 
America was founded on the freedom of, not from, religion. And there 
is no better way to celebrate that freedom than to welcome all 
religions back into the public square this holiday season.

<h2>Children Do Suffer Most From a Divorce </h2> 
<P> <a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a>
<br><p> 


As unusual as Michael Jackson's marriage to Lisa Marie Presley seemed 
in 1994, their impending divorce, announced last week, is all too 
commonplace. The superstar duo have become just one more statistic 
among the 1.2 million American couples who divorce each year.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With no little Jacksons to suffer the consequence of their breakup and 
a prenuptual agreement to protect each party's property, the couple's 
split is hardly cause for any public concern.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately, the same can't be said for the approximately 700,000 
marriages involving children that dissolve every year.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These divorces are more than personal tragedies. They are a social 
problem with significant societal costs.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More than one in two marriages in the United States now end in divorce 
- the highest rate in the world. And a majority of these divorces - 
about 60% - are among couples with children.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For years while the divorce rate was skyrocketing, social scientists 
argued that children were largely unaffected by divorce.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many even argued that children were better off being raised by a 
single parent than they were watching parents quarrel or remain in a 
loveless marriage.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But evidence to the contrary has mounted over the past two decades. 
Now there is little doubt - based on overwhelming research results - 
that, on average, children of divorce are worse off than those who 
grow up in intact families.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Children of divorce are more likely to be truant, to do poorly in 
school and to get in trouble with the law than children who grow up 
with both parents.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The "California Children of Divorce Study," one of the most 
comprehensive of its kind to date, found that more than a third of 
children from divorced families experienced moderate or severe 
depression even five years after divorce.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Among adolescent women in the study, "almost all confronted issues of 
love, commitment, and marriage with anxiety, sometimes with very great 
concern about betrayal, abandonment, and not being loved," according 
to Judith Wallerstein, who analyzed the results of the study in her 
book Second Chances: Men, Women, and Children a Decade After Divorce.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many of these young women, she reports, resorted to short-term sexual 
relationships in response to their fears and anxieties.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Barring physical or severe mental abuse, it is nearly always better 
for children in a family if their parents stay together.  

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Until relatively recently, parents understood this and considered it 
an obligation on their part to remain together - at least until their 
children were grown.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1960, 91% of children lived with two parents. No more. A whole 
ethos of self-fulfillment and personal happiness has replaced the 
ethic of self-sacrifice and concern for the best interests of one's 
children.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Too many divorcing parents put their own desires and needs ahead of 
their children's and then rationalize their actions by claiming their 
children will be better off if their parents are happy.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For once it would be refreshing if those who do selfish things would 
simply own up to their behavior.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Marriage is never an easy proposition. I have never known a successful 
marriage that did not, at some point, experience severe stress that 
could tear the marriage apart if the parties allowed it.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The difference between couples who remain married and those who 
divorce is not more love or fewer difficulties, but greater 
commitment.  

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Those who stay married often face identical problems with those who 
split up, but the former ride out the difficulties.

In many countries, divorce laws encourage couples in this process by 
placing lengthy waiting periods before a marriage can be dissolved 
unless special grounds exist, such as adultery or abuse.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most nations in western Europe, including most of the socially liberal 
countries in Scandinavia, require a minimum of a one-year wait before 
uncontested divorces are granted.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A number of states are considering stricter divorce legislation this 
year, including Iowa and Michigan.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After years of ignoring the devastating impact divorce has on 
children, it's time public policy took account of what's good for 
children, not just what's convenient for their parents.

<BR>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Divorce still hitting a million kids every year Divorces affect fewer 
children now than in 1980, but far more than in 1970:  <p>

<p>
BETHESDA, Md. -- Remember when there were two political parties in the 
U.S.? One party favored big government, the other wanted to cut it. 
One party talked about social justice, the other party demanded law 
and order. One party defended the right to do your own thing, the 
other encouraged traditional values. No more. At least when it comes 
to political rhetoric, the era of liberalism is over.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's no accident that today's Democrats -- most notably Bill Clinton -
- sound a lot like staunch Republicans. The country has shifted to the 
right over the last four presidential elections and Democrats have had 
to move, too, at least rhetorically.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A recent Gallup poll shows Americans overwhelmingly support a 
conservative political agenda. Over 80% favor a balanced budget 
amendment, oppose racial preferences in schools and jobs, and endorse 
English as the official language. More than 70% support congressional 
term limits, sanction a constitutional amendment allowing school 
prayer and want to cut off welfare after two years unless recipients 
work. Similarly large majorities oppose legalizing homosexual 
marriages, favor school choice and want to ban partial-birth 
abortions.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Given these numbers, no candidate in his or her right mind would 
publicly endorse deficit spending, racial quotas, or expanding 
welfare. When it comes to driving the political agenda Republicans win 
hands down -- which is why President Clinton is spending his time 
honing a conservative image.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The same man who pushed gays in the military now says he'll happily 
sign federal legislation to ban gay marriages.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The president who ignored welfare reform for his first two years in 
office, and then twice vetoed Republican welfare bills, now brags he's 
helped states to reform welfare on their own.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The president who appointed dozens of federal judges with a history of 
allowing criminals back on the streets never misses a photo 
opportunity to surround himself with police officers who put those 
criminals behind bars in the first place.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Clinton, ersatz conservative, hopes voters will forget his deeds and 
remember only his rhetoric. So far, the polls indicate his plan is 
working=2E Bill Clinton has never been so popular.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Will this strategy carry him through the election? And will Clinton's 
latest tilt to the right convince Americans the Democratic Party 
represents the new conservatism? Not likely.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Most voters haven't even begun to concentrate on the election in the 
fall. They're too busy planning their kids' graduations and family 
vacations to focus on November.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
When voters do start to focus in earnest -- probably not until the 
party conventions -- Democrats will have a hard time sustaining their 
new-found conservatism. Public employees, who make up the biggest 
block of delegates, will hardly turn the Democrat convention into a 
cut-government-spending rally.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The National Education Association won't countenance discussion of 
school choice. And Jesse Jackson would never permit his party to roll 
back racial preferences.
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Forget Democratic support for making English the official language. As 
for endorsing a balanced budget amendment to the Constitution, how 
would that make the 162 congressional Democrats who voted against it 
look?
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The fact is, Democrats can't make good on Republican issues even when 
it's in their interest to do so. When it comes to acting, not talking, 
1996 won't be any different. Come November voters will choose 
Republican action over Democratic words.
<BR>

<h2>Immigrants Make Gains in California</h2> 
<P><a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">Linda Chavez</a></center>
<p><hr><P> 
 
 
Californians still have earthquakes, mudslides and fires to worry 
about, but they can breathe a little easier when it comes to another 
perennial source of anxiety: the state's 6 million immigrants.
<p>
A new study by the University of Southern California shows that the 
region's immigrants are rapidly moving into the social and economic 
mainstream despite fears they would be a huge burden.
<p>
The study, by USC's School of Urban and Regional Planning, details 
impressive gains in income, status and English proficiency among the 
largest immigrant groups, including Asians and Latinos who arrived in 
the 1970s.
<p>
Using census data from 1980 and 1990, the USC researchers found that 
Asian immigrants in Southern California who were between 25 to 34 
years old in 1980 had more than doubled their average income by 1990.
<p>
Nearly 70 percent became U.S. citizens in the same period. And more 
than half spoke English very well.
<p>
Immigrants of the same age from Europe and the Middle East made 
similar gains in income and even more spectacular gains in English 
proficiency, though only 51 percent became citizens.
<p>
Even Latino immigrants had made significant progress, improving their 
earnings by 27 percent.
<p>
Although relatively few Latinos who came to the U.S. as adults spoke 
English  very well (only 21 percent of those who were 25 to 34 in 
1980), 70 percent of those who immigrated as children were fully 
proficient in English by 1990.
<p>
But if California immigrants are doing so well, why have their fellow 
state residents turned sour on immigration?
<p>
 Nearly half of registered voters in the state - including 28 percent 
of Hispanic voters - believe there is no benefit whatsoever from 
immigration, according to a recent Los Angeles Times poll.
<p>
And Californians aren't alone in their hostility to immigrants. Nearly 
two out of three Americans say immigrants are "a bad thing for this 
country" and will never assimilate.
<p>
The problem may have to do with more than simple prejudice.
<p>
With so many new immigrants coming to the United States now - about 
800,000 were admitted last year - it's difficult to measure their 
progress.
<p>
Simply comparing how all immigrants measure up on education, language, 
earnings and the like from 1980 to 1990 tells almost nothing about 
those immigrants who actually lived in the U.S. for that entire 10-
year period.
<p>
Why? Because the group measured in 1990 isn't composed of the same 
people as  the one measured in 1980.
<p>
The newer immigrants - by definition - haven't lived in the U.S. as 
long and  won't have had as much time to improve their status.
<p>
The USC researchers got around this problem by analyzing census data 
differently.
<p>
Instead of looking at all immigrants in 1980 and 1990, they broke up 
immigrants into groups based on their ethnic background, age and time 
of arrival.
<p>
The USC researchers then tracked these "cohorts" in the census of both 
1980 and 1990.
<p>
This allowed researchers to compare the same group 10 years apart.
<p>
The more accurate analysis can demonstrate what improvements similar 
groups of immigrants make in learning English, becoming citizens and 
increasing their incomes.
<p>
Too bad the USC study won't be widely read by those in or out of 
California.  It could be an important antidote to the anti-immigrant 
sentiment sweeping the country.
<p>
The USC data dispel many of the myths about immigrants: that they're 
stuck on the bottom rung of the economic ladder, that they can't or 
won't assimilate and that they'll never become Americans.
<p>
At the very least, the study should be required reading for members of 
Congress, who will soon vote on major legislation that could 
dramatically reduce immigration.

</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">
Linda  Chavez </a>
<P>
 
Ever wonder why so many Americans are turned off by politics, 
politicians, journalists and nearly everything having to do with 
Washington? (Except maybe its monuments and museums?)

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Maybe all the fuss generated by "Primary Colors" -- the new, 
anonymously written novel about the 1992 Clinton campaign -- provides 
a clue.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It's the ultimate insider's tale about a world that few on the outside 
know or care about, and it's preoccupying a good deal of the nation's 
capital. The novel itself and the controversy it has generated are 
testaments to all that is petty, insular and creepy about political 
Washington.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Using the techniques of a roman a clef (which means literally "novel 
with a key"), the story reads like a political edition of the game 
Trivial Pursuit.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The story involves a young, ambitious governor of a small Southern 
state whose presidential campaign is plagued by scandals.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If you don't know who Mandy Grunwald, Betsy Wright and Stanley 
Greenberg are (they're actual Clinton operatives), you'll probably get 
lost trying to decipher the book's elaborate cast of characters. Which 
seems to be the author's aim: Create cardboard-cutout characters 
immediately recognizable to Washington sophisticates but of little 
interest to the rest of the world, then hope the pundits create a 
large enough buzz to sell lots of books.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The plan seems to be working. "Primary Colors" hits No. 1 this week on 
USA TODAY's best-seller list.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All of this might be harmless enough were it not for two insidious 
aspects of the book.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was written either by someone inside the Clinton operation or a 
reporter with access to intimate details of the campaign, and it 
contains every vicious, undubstantiated rumor ever circulated about 
Bill or Hillary Clinton.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Washington officials, pundits and the press corps are too busy trying 
to guess who wrote the novel to waste much indignation on the ethics, 
much less propriety, of the venture. But surely there is something 
wrong when either a former campaign worker or a journalist can make 
money anonymously peddling smarmy gossip about the president of the 
United States and his wife.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Staff loyalty is a virtue that has long since disappeared in 
Washington. Presidential aides no longer wait until their boss is out 
of office (much less dead) to write intimate tell-alls -- and 
Republican presidents fare no better than Democrates. But "Primary 
Colors" breaks new ground in the kiss-and-tell genre. By remaining 
anonymous, the author keeps his or her reputation intact -- at least 
temporarily -- while ravaging others'.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The most disturbing possibility is that the book was written not by 
someone inside the campaign but by a journalist. The novel reeks of a 
strange, hybrid bias -- it exudes both admiration and contempt for the 
Clintons.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whoever wrote the book is a fan of the Clintons' politics but clearly 
not of their moral character. Journalists are entitled to their biases 
and opinions -- so long as they're stated up front. That's why 
newspapers have editorial and opinion pages. But journalists are not 
free to weave their prejudices into their reporting.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor should they be free to slander public figures through thinly 
veiled fiction while keeping their own identities secret.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;I'm no fan of the Clintons, but they deserve better than this.

<title>SCHOOL REFORM: WILL NEW JERSEY EVER LEARN?</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<h2>School Reform: Will New Jersey Ever Learn?
 </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>










<p>
<p>
For the third time in half a dozen years, the state of New Jersey has 
seized control of a local school district.  This time the victims are 
the 48,000 students of the Newark school system, who are about to 
receive a civics lesson they will likely never forget.  They are going 
to learn what it's like to be dumped out of the frying pan of one 
failed education bureaucracy, only to fall into the fire of another. 
<p> 
There is no question that the Newark school system deserves a failing 
grade.  Only one-fourth of its students were able to pass the 1993 
high school proficiency test on their first try.  The district's 
classrooms had fallen into disrepair.  Student attendance was poor.  A 
1994 report, prepared by the state, blasted Newark school officials 
for "dereliction of duty."  The highly critical report spoke of 
students in rat-infested schools, while administrators sat in 
"comfortable offices" and had "important-sounding titles."   
<p> 
Change was obviously needed, but why do New Jersey officials believe 
that shifting control to a larger, more distant state bureaucracy is 
the right kind of change?  They have it exactly the wrong way around:  
effective school reform involves moving decisions about educating 
students closer to the classroom, not further away.  Replacing one 
bureaucracy with another will not work. 
<p> 
New Jersey officials do not have to look very far to see that this is 
so.  In the last six years, New Jersey state education officials have 
also taken control of the schools in Jersey City and Paterson.  When 
Bret Schundler became Jersey City's Mayor in 1992, its schools had 
been under state control for three years, and they continue under 
state control today.  Mayor Schundler states he is "convinced the 
takeovers are doomed to failure and can actually make matters worse."  
He notes "there has been no innovation in Paterson, no innovation in 
Jersey City, and there will probably be none in Newark." 
 <p>
A study of the Jersey City schools, conducted last year, concluded 
that the "district remains below standard in four out of five high 
schools in writing and mathematics."  Results in the district's 
elementary schools for reading and mathematics were also 
"unacceptable."  In certain areas, performance actually deteriorated 
under state control. 
 <p>
So, if state control does not work, what does?  The answer is to give 
control to teachers and parents, so teachers can teach and parents can 
choose the teachers they want for their children. 
<p> 
Suppose that six years ago, instead of commandeering their school 
system, New Jersey had allowed the parents of Jersey City to send 
their children to the school of their choice - public or private, near 
or far?  Parents could have chosen the school best suited to each of 
their children.  Newly formed charter schools might have sprung up; 
private schools might have expanded their enrollment.  Existing public 
schools would have improved to attract more students. 
 <p>
Most important, the children of Jersey City would have immediately 
begun receiving a better education.  As it worked out, Jersey City's 
30,000 students are not receiving an education today any better than 
the one the state replaced six years ago. 
 <p>
Choice and charter schools are no longer new ideas.  They are being 
tried and evaluated across the country.  In New York, East Harlem 
District No. 4 is legendary for the significant student improvement 
that occurred when teachers and parents were empowered to design and 
choose the education approach they wanted. 
 <p>
In Milwaukee, Wisconsin, an increasing number of low-income children 
are in the fifth year of a school choice program, and test scores are 
rising, although so far only slightly.  More importantly, student 
satisfaction has improved, as has parental satisfaction and 
involvement, and not surprisingly, student attendance and discipline.  
These all contribute to a learning-friendly environment that is bound 
to increase test scores even more in the future. 
 <p>
The truth is that education bureaucracies, whether the Newark school 
board, the New Jersey Department of Education, or the U. S. Department 
of Education, are simply not customer-focused.  They act like the 
monopolies they are, focusing on what is best for them. 
 <p>
The failure of these bureaucracies should be obvious to all.  SAT 
scores have fallen precipitously over the last two decades, and the 
number of students scoring 600 and above on the Verbal SATs has 
dropped 35%.  American students rank 13th in the world on math and 
science tests.  Only 26% of the fourth graders in America can actually 
read at the fourth grade level. 
 <p>
What the education bureaucrats in New Jersey and thousands of 
education departments across the country have yet to learn is that 
time and technology have passed them by.  They are industrial-age 
dinosaurs in an information-driven society, attempting to deliver 
mass-produced education to children who need individualized attention. 
 <p>
Their educational model must be replaced with the energy and 
initiative of schools free to innovate and parents empowered to do 
what is best for each of their children. 
 <p>
The National Center for Policy Analysis is a public policy research 
institute founded in 1983 and internationally known for its studies on 
public policy issues.  The NCPA is headquartered in Dallas, Texas, 
with an office in Washington, D.C.

<h2>Ross Perot's Medicare Rx </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>
 

Ross Perot has a knack for identifying those issues that are important 
to voters.  Just a week after congressional leaders said that Medicare 
reform would be the biggest policy issue this fall, his book on 
Medicare hit the stands.  Intensive Care is a book about the crisis 
facing Medicare and Medicaid, the federal and federal/state health 
insurance programs for the elderly and poor.   <p>
 
 Medicare and Medicaid have evolved into enormous, wasteful and 
inefficient government programs that must be reformed before they 
financially break the country.   How big is the problem?  Mr. Perot 
points out that Medicare and Medicaid will take up 17.4 percent of the 
federal budget in 1995, or about 35 percent of all entitlement 
spending.  According to Medicare's board of trustees, without 
fundamental change the program will go bankrupt by 2002.   <p>
 
Something has to be done, and it has to be done soon.  But as Mr. 
Perot points out, historically Congress has been reluctant to resolve 
the federal government's penchant for excessive spending.  "Our 
elected leaders have ignored the clear signals that the greatest 
nation in the history of man has been spending itself toward 
bankruptcy."  <p>
 
Medicare is probably the only large health insurance plan in the 
country that has not undergone fundamental change over the past 
decade.  Many employers have increased deductibles and copayments - 
requiring employees to manage more of their own health care dollars.  
More frequently, employers have begun directing their employees to 
lower-cost doctors and actively managing health care costs.   <p>
 
Medicare has moved in the opposite direction.  In recent years the 
deductible for Part A (hospital insurance) has not changed in real 
terms, and the deductible for Part B (other medical expenses) has 
actually decreased in real terms.  While there has been some 
experimentation with managed care, in most places Medicare is still a 
wide-open, fee-for-service plan in which patients can see almost any 
doctor for any service.   
 
Reforming Medicare and Medicaid and balancing the federal budget will 
force us to make some tough choices, and when there are tough choices 
to be made Ross Perot hears his entry cue.  He believes that "we 
should view the coming debate over Medicare and Medicaid as an 
opportunity rather than a dilemma."  It's an "opportunity for creative 
minds to update old systems that have served their purpose, but are 
now in need of an overhaul to function properly in the next century." <p>
 
What direction should reform take?  "A properly designed system based 
on market principles will do more to initiate positive change than any 
government rules and regulations that attempt to monitor the profits 
of the health care industry," Mr. Perot tells us.  <p>
 
As mentioned earlier, many employers are actively managing their 
employees' health care costs or are moving them into managed care 
plans.  Mr. Perot discusses this solution and points out that Congress 
is already moving in this direction for Medicare.  Current law allows 
some Medicare beneficiaries to withdraw from Medicare and join a 
health maintenance organization (HMO) instead.  While seniors should 
be free to remain in Medicare, we should build on this precedent and 
allow Medicare beneficiaries to withdraw from Medicare Parts A and B 
and choose any alternative private plan.   <p>
 
Perhaps a more attractive option than managed care is also discussed 
by Mr. Perot:  Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs). This option would 
permit Medicare recipients to use their Medicare funds to purchase a 
catastrophic policy coupled with a Medical Savings Account.  For 
example, private insurance might cover all health expenses over a 
$3,000 deductible, and place any premium savings in an MSA.  MSA funds 
would then be used to pay for expenses below $3,000.  In case a gap 
remained between the MSA deposit and the catastrophic deductible, 
retirees could top up their MSA by contributing amounts they otherwise 
would have used to purchase private, Medigap insurance or pay out-of-
pocket expenses.  <p>
 
Of course, to hear Democrats and liberals complain about MSAs, you'd 
think it was positively un-American to let people keep some of the 
money they are now giving to insurance companies.  It's that same 
mentality we've seen from Washington for years: "Heaven help us if we 
let taxpayers keep some of their own money.  They might not spend it 
like we bureaucrats would like." <p>
 
Ross Perot has always believed in the ability of the American people 
to respond properly when adequately informed - and that's what this 
book is meant to do.   While his book will not be the last word on 
Medicare, Intensive Care has succeeded as a sound analytical 
beginning. <p>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">    
Linda Chavez     
</a>     
     
<P>       
 If Americans want big, fancy cars, they have to pay the price.     
 <p> 
BETHESDA, Md. -- Looking for someone to blame for today's high gas     
prices? Chances are the culprits aren't some oil executives in Houston     
or sheiks in Riyadh, but a lot closer to home.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
Try looking in your own garage or your neighbor's. Minivans, sport     
utility vehicles and pickup trucks are fast replacing compacts as     
Americans' favorite vehicles. These bigger cars, plus higher speed     
limits, have driven down fuel efficiency and driven up demand.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
So, too, did last winter's bitter cold, which kept consumers burning     
more heating oil in their furnaces. Just last week, snow once again     
hit the Rocky Mountains and the Midwest, creating more home heating     
oil demand long past the usual season. And unless supply can keep pace     
with demand -- which is difficult in the short run for a product like     
gasoline -- the price goes up. It's as close to a fixed law of     
economics as there is.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
But politicians can't very well blame their own constituents or Mother     
Nature for rising prices at the pumps, so they're playing politics --     
on both sides of the aisle. The Clinton administration announced plans     
to sell off part of the Strategic Petroleum Reserve. This move is     
probably harmless, if ineffectual, since it will add a mere trickle     
into the consumers' supply, about 12 million barrels or less than two     
days' worth of gas for the nation's drivers.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
But the administration didn't stop there. The Justice Department also     
announced it will investigate the oil companies for collusion and     
price-fixing. This is nothing more than a cynical attempt to win votes     
by peddling paranoia.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
Meanwhile, the Republicans have been exploiting the gasoline pricing     
issue for their own purposes. They're using recent price hikes to     
justify repealing a tax they've been opposed to from its inception:     
the Clinton administration's 4.3-cent-per-gallon gas tax. Cutting     
taxes is a good thing, but no one should be under any illusion that     
repealing the gas tax will have any permanent effect on the price of     
gasoline.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
One of the biggest dangers in this political posturing is that it     
feeds the all-too-common misconception that government intervention in     
the economy can work to benefit consumers. It never happens that way.     
Even if the president or Congress could wave a magic wand and cut     
prices, government price controls lead to supply shortages. Would     
Americans really rather line up for hours at filling stations than pay     
a few cents more per gallon?     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
In fact, although prices have risen steeply recently -- 13% in three     
months -- gasoline is still a great bargain in the United States.     
Europeans and Asians pay four times as much for their gas as we do,     
which is why they drive smaller, more fuel-efficient cars. And the     
American Petroleum Institute says we are actually paying the lowest     
price per gallon, in constant dollars, since World War I.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
But although we're paying less, we're using more gasoline than ever.     
We now live farther from work and shopping than we once did. And wives     
as well as husbands commute to work, often in separate cars from their     
spouses. All that adds up to more miles on the road.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
Dr. Lee Shipper, a researcher at Lawrence Berkeley Laboratory in     
California, estimated in The New York Times recently that U.S.     
vehicles traveled 7,900 miles per person in 1994, compared with 5,350     
in 1973. More fuel-efficient cars in recent years helped reduce the     
impact of these longer distances. But in 1994, bigger vehicles brought     
fuel efficiency down once again to 19.3 miles per gallon from a high     
of 20.2 in 1985.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
Prices will probably decline somewhat in the weeks and months ahead as     
supply catches up with demand -- especially if Iraq re-enters the     
market, as it is expected to if Saddam Hussein agrees to terms imposed     
by the U=2EN. with U.S. backing.     
<BR>      
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;     
But so long as Americans want the freedom to drive our own big, fancy     
vehicles long distances for work and play, we're going to have to pay     
the price.     
<BR>

<h2>
Welfare Reform: Bill, Shame On You 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/chavez.html">
Linda Chavez
</a>
<p>
<i>Political ad promoting president as great reformer is just a fraud. </i>
<P>
BETHESDA, Md. -- The biggest case of welfare fraud in U.S. history is 
taking place right now -- and the perpetrator is Bill Clinton.

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Harsh words? Yes, but the president and the Democratic National 
Committee deserve it for the dishonest political commercials they're 
now airing trumpeting Bill Clinton as the Great Welfare Reformer.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The ads appear in 13 Midwestern and Western bellwether states where 
conservative Democrats traditionally determine presidential election 
outcomes. I saw them just last week in New Mexico, where they were 
showing several times a day.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"Families destroyed. Children's dreams lost. The legacy of our present 
welfare system," intones the narrator over depressing pictures of 
poverty.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
"The president's plan: Increase child support enforcement, reduce teen 
pregnancy. Work requirements for welfare recipients, strict time 
limits on welfare benefits. Teach values in our schools. No work, no 
welfare -- rescue children from the destructive welfare system," 
bellows the unseen narrator as the pictures change.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
A worker punches a time clock, kids say the Pledge of Allegiance -- 
images of patriotism and bedrock family values flash across the 
screen.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The ad ends with Clinton's last State of the Union address: "We can 
make real welfare reform a reality in the lives of the American 
people," he tells Congress.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What the ad doesn't say is that Clinton has already vetoed two 
welfare-reform packages that would have accomplished everything the 
commercial claims the president wants.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In December, Congress passed both a comprehensive welfare bill and an 
even more ambitious welfare-reform package in the budget 
reconciliation bill. The first would have saved more than $ 58 billion 
over seven years, the second more than $ 81.5 billion during the same 
period. The president vetoed both, even though he offered no serious 
alternative himself.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Among the bills' provisions were tough work requirements. Adults on 
welfare would have to begin working within two years and would face a 
five-year lifetime limit on their welfare benefits.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In the area of child-support enforcement, the bills created a central 
registry to track deadbeat parents nationwide and required states to 
suspend driver's licenses for those who failed to pay support.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
To deter teen pregnancy, the bills allowed states to deny teen-agers 
welfare payments unless the young mothers agreed to supervised living 
arrangements.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bills also did some things not mentioned in the Clinton ads.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The legislation proposed cutting off aid to drug users and alcoholics 
who now qualify for disability payments under the Supplemental 
Security Income program.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bills also proposed limiting aid available to new immigrants, a 
provision that simply puts teeth in existing immigration law, which 
requires that sponsors of immigrants bear financial responsibility for 
their charges for the first five years they live in the U.S.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Americans want welfare reform, and Clinton knows it. In 1992, he 
managed to hoodwink a plurality of the electorate into thinking he 
would "end welfare as we know it." Clinton's use of the welfare issue 
was calculated to win back voters the Democratic Party has been losing 
to Republicans over the last two decades. The campaign successfully 
targeted key states with high percentages of "Reagan Democrats" and 
ran ads very similar to those the DNC is pushing this year.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
But the moment he was inaugurated, President Clinton quickly put 
welfare reform on the back burner while he attended to more pressing 
issues like gays in the military.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It wasn't until 1994 that the president even bothered to send up a 
welfare-reform package.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
For Clinton now to try to regain the mantle of welfare reformer shows 
more than the usual political chutzpah. He's trying to defraud the 
American people in an election year.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
If the DNC's welfare-reform ad promoted a commercial product rather 
than the president of the United States, the Federal Trade Commission 
would yank it from the airwaves.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At the very least, the ad ought to bear the warning: Voters beware.

<h2>A Program in Need of a Crisis
 </h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>










<p>
<p>
When the politicians in Washington suddenly discover a new issue, do you ever wonder about the facts?  You should, because sometimes the facts contradict what the politicians are saying.
<p>
Remember "Alar"?  It turned out there was no apple pesticide problem - the politicians made up the scare.
<p>
Likewise, the Congress mandated $4 billion a year in acid rain mitigation, even though the most comprehensive environmental study in history concluded there was "no evidence of a general or unusual decline of forest in the United States or Canada due to acid rain." And the problem of global warming, according to the Washington Post, "appears to be heading toward solution before [researchers] can find any solid evidence that serious harm was or is being done."
<p>
This summer saw another example of the facts contradicting the politicians:  children's vaccinations.
<p>
In 1993, right in the middle of the great health care debate when President Clinton was trying to scare everyone (with some success) into believing the country's health care system had imploded, the president proposed and the Congress passed a costly new program that would  create an elaborate new distribution system to provide vaccines free of  charge to poor children, the Vaccines for Children Program (VFC).
<p>
Never mind that about half of all childhood vaccines were already being provided free through public health clinics.  The Clintons - and I use the plural intentionally - needed to persuade people that a health care crisis had arisen.  The president pointed to a measles epidemic between 1989 and 1991 that took the lives of more than 100 children in the United States.  And he argued that the reason many children weren't vaccinated was the cost - drug companies were pursuing "profits at the expense of our children."
<p>
But the facts tell a very different story.  In May 1994, for example, the Journal of the American Medical Association (JAMA) published a study of measles immunization of 2-year-olds in Mississippi during the time of the outbreak.
<p>
What did the researchers find out about this rural southern state with a large black population and below-average incomes?  First, that the statewide measles immunization rate of 2-year-olds was 87% (ranging from 79% to 97% according to the geographical district).  While 87% isn't perfect, it's far from being a crisis justifying a $500 million federal vaccination program.
<p>
Moreover, immunization rates were "similar for white and black children in each health district and for the state as a whole."  So there is no racial discrimination problem.
<p>
But what about the poor, rural population? They're the ones who have to drive the farthest to get the immunizations, so doesn't a large rural population point to the need for the president's new distribution scheme? No, because "the level of vaccine coverage was significantly higher in districts with lower population densities (i.e., rural) and those with higher per capita incomes," according to the report.
<p>
So who's left?  Lower-income people living in urban areas - those most likely to have access to public clinics where free vaccines have always been available.
<p>
But the most significant finding of the JAMA study is this:  half of those measles cases contracted during the outbreak in Mississippi "occurred in unimmunized children too young to receive the MMR (measles, mumps, rubella) vaccine."  (Emphasis added)  It's pretty difficult to blame those "greedy" drug companies for the fact that many children were too young to get the vaccine.
<p>
Now, two years after the VFC's inception, comes a General Accounting Office (GAO) report finding that the VFC's newly created distribution scheme, meant to make the vaccines more accessible to poor children, is not working.   For example, 14 states were prohibited by state law from distributing free vaccines to private physicians, the software needed to process orders was defective, and the Centers for Disease Control could not ensure that the program would serve only entitled children.  Of seven  major implementation tasks considered by the GAO, six  "remained incomplete and problematic."
<p>
Most significant, the GAO found the cost of vaccines had never been a major barrier to immunizations.  A different 1994 JAMA study, done prior to the GAO report, had come to a similar conclusion.  It found that the "provision of free vaccine alone will not guarantee adequate immunization of poor urban children."
<p>
The truth is that the administration created and promoted the VFC program from political necessity rather than medical necessity.  As with his grander attempt to restructure the entire health care system, President Clinton needed to impart a crisis atmosphere, and he succeeded -- for a time, anyway.  Now that the crisis mentality and his health care plan have died, so should the VFC program.

<h2>Opus Dei</h2>
</center>
<hr>
<b>By Kathleen Howley </b>
<p> 
<p>
It has always puzzled me that Catholics who believe and accept the 
full teachings of the Catholic Church are labeled "Conservative" or 
"orthodox," while dissenting members who support, say, only two out of 
every 10 teachings -- on a good day -- are just called plain, old 
"Catholic." 
<p>
If anyone deserves an adjective, shouldn't it be those who reject the 
Christ-given Magisterial teaching authority of the Holy See? Shouldn't 
it be the ones who proudly declare their opposition to the Chair of 
Peter? 
<p>
Well, that's not the way it works in the 1990s. If all you do is 
support the basic teachings of the ancient faith -- not one iota more, 
nor one jot less -- sooner or later, you're gonna get a negative 
label.  
<p>
Thus, it's no surprise that the Chicago archdiocese announced in May 
that it would refuse to sell an unused college seminary to Opus Dei 
for a reported $8.75 million.  
<p>
Opus Dei, a canonically-approved Personal Prelature of the Church 
established by -- and widely praised by -- John Paul II, wanted to use 
the facility as the new site of Northridge Preparatory School, an all-
boys high school. 
<p>
Several archdiocesan groups voted to reject the sale because, in their 
words, Opus Dei is an elitist, secretive organization that has too 
much power in Rome -- you know, all the things that people used to say 
about the Jesuits.  
<p>
Months later, there are no other interested buyers. Like many disused 
Catholic facilities, the seminary may eventually be sold to an Eastern 
sect, or a New Age group. Or, perhaps it will be sub-divided as 
condos, with the chapel that was once used for the Holy Sacrifice of 
the Mass turned into a club house. Just as long as Opus Dei doesn't 
get it. 
<p>
Admittedly, Opus Dei has an image problem. Secular newspapers 
regularly run negative stories about it. Liberals in the Catholic 
Church disdain the world-wide group, founded almost 70 years ago by a 
Spanish priest beautified in 1992.  
<p>
Why? In part, because Opus Dei doesn't preach dissent, or New Age 
theology, or goddess worship. All it does is urge its mostly-lay 
members to grow in personal holiness, and to serve the Catholic Church 
as it wishes to be served. 
<p>
It's a novel concept, isn't it? Rather than following the current 
fashion of insisting upon serving Our Lord according to our own whims, 
they want to do things His way. 
<p>
Opus Dei, Latin for the "Work of God," shares some similarities with 
the much older, but lesser-known, Congregation of the Oratory, founded 
in the sixteenth century by St. Philip Neri. 
<p>
Both stick to the basics of the faith. Both are unwaveringly in their 
fidelity to the Roman Pontiff. And, both focus on giving the working 
man and woman the spiritual food they need to bring the light of 
Christ into the world -- namely, the Sacraments of the Catholic 
Church. 
<p>
And, in modern times, both have been persecuted, because of it. 
<p>
If you're looking for an example, read "The Last Roman Catholic?" by 
James Demers. He recounts the smear campaign that led up to the 1989 
expulsion of the Oratorians from the archdiocese of Ottawa, in Canada. 
<p>
The congregation was asked by Archbishop Joseph Plourde to take over a 
crumbling church in the poorest section of Ottawa. They started 
rebuilding the church, beginning with the Mass. No more ad-libbed 
Consecrations -- just the liturgy of the Roman Rite of the Catholic 
Church.  
<p>
Within six months, the pews of the church were filled with Catholics 
who traveled great distances to experience the reverence and piety of 
the Mass. A local choir was trained in the singing of Gregorian Chant 
and polyphony. Several doctrine classes began meeting regularly, and 
an architectural restoration project was underway. 
<p>
As you might imagine, the liberals who dominated the archdiocese were 
inflamed. They had been slogging away, day in and day out, with their 
faddish twists to the Mass and their voguish theology. But, the pews 
of their churches, and their parish collection boxes, were slowly 
emptying out. 
<p>
The Oratorians were labeled "ultra-conservative" -- even though their 
only crime was to preach the full wealth of the Catholic faith. They 
were called "divisive" -- despite the fact that their only concern was 
their Father's business -- hearing Confessions, celebrating Mass, and 
instructing their parishioners in the basics of the faith. 
<p>
Eventually, the church was taken away from them, and their 
parishioners set adrift. 
<p>
It's too bad that Catholic liberals are so intolerant. But, they are 
correct to fear both the Oratorians and Opus Dei. Any group that helps 
Catholic laypeople lead lives of old-fashioned sanctity ought to be 
dreaded by the church-busters on the left. 
<p>
For, such is the stuff that builds faith, and spawns strong Catholic 
families, with offspring who have sound vocations and deeply held 
convictions -- just the attributes that it will take to restore the 
Catholic Church in America and defeat the apostles of Modernism.

<title>Did My Parents Want Me</title>

<h2>Did My Parents WANT Me?</h2>
By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html">Kathleen Howley</a>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
A woman, in her mid-40s, recently told me that she grew up with the 
feeling that her parents didn't want her.<p>  
She said she overheard, one night, a comment made by her mother, who 
didn't realize that little ears were listening. It referred to the 
conception of her daughter as being the result of "one drink too 
many." <p> 
It was meant as a joke. And, my friend reports that all the adults who 
heard it laughed. But she wasn't laughing.  <p>
In fact, that one comment, with perhaps, the subtle reinforcement of 
other stray remarks, haunted her for years. <p>
Oh, sure, her parents fed her and clothed her and sent her to school, 
and even went to "parent/teacher" nights -- the things that to all the 
world make people look like loving and caring parents. <p>
And, for all I know, they could have been exactly that. My friend 
wouldn't have disputed that possibility.  <p>
But, she wasn't talking about the love that almost any normal adult 
can learn to feel about a cute and cuddly baby.  <p>
She was talking about the deep-down questions that all children ponder 
as they learn about the world they live in:  <p>
When I was called into being, when I was created, did my parents WANT 
me? When I was thrust into this strange, new world, was there someone 
yearning for my arrival?  <p>
Somehow, if the answer to that question is , "Yes," it makes 
everything else easier. It covers a multitude of later lapses and 
human failings.  <p>
I suppose that it's much like arriving at the door of an important 
party knowing that you are an invited guest, as compared to walking 
toward the front steps without an invitation.  <p>
Of course, we all know that the most important Being of all, the 
Creator of the Universe, wanted each and every one of us to be born.  <p>
In fact, it's more than that. The Father not only loved us and called 
us into being. He also gave each of us a crucial job to do during our 
lifetime on earth -- a job that, whether great or small, is infinitely 
important in His plan. <p>
In adult life, that fact can be a great comfort. But, it seems that 
children need more.  <p>
Today, we live in a world that is ruled with a contraceptive 
mentality. It's a stingy philosophy that says, yes, children are a 
good thing, but only give me, at most, two of them. Any more than 
that, and they become a bad thing. <p>
How, I wonder, do today's children feel, growing up in a family with 
the knowledge that they barely made it under the wire. Just two. No 
more. We have no more love to give. <p>
Even if you're number one or two, you know that the love you receive 
from your parents is conditional. "We love you, because you happen to 
arrive when you did." <p>
Someone was ranting to me, recently, that people shouldn't have more 
than two children. <p>
I asked her: <p>
"Where do you fall in the birth order of your family?" <p>
She answered: <p>
"I'm the fourth child." <p>
Good thing her parents didn't agree with her ideas. Else, she never 
would have existed. <p>
I'm the second child in my family. Lucky me. I would have been born, 
even if my parents subscribed to a contraceptive mentality. Although, 
my little sisters would have been left out in the cold. <p>
Fortunately, I have the great gift of knowing that my parents wanted 
as many children as God would give them. That gave us Howley kids a 
jump start in life. We were wanted, yearned for, rejoiced over. Every 
one of us. <p>
But what about today's children, who live in families that have a 
stingy attitude toward life? Maybe God wanted more. Maybe He intended 
that third kid to be one who introduced the first kid to the woman he 
would marry, or got a job for kid number two when he got out of 
college. Or, maybe it was that fifth kid who was going to care for the 
parents when they were elderly. <p>
The fact is, it's not unconditional love for a couple to use chemicals 
to ensure that only one or two children are born. You can argue that 
it shows greater love to have just two children, and be able to 
provide them with every material asset. The best kindergarten, the 
best college.  <p>
Problem is, maybe they won't want to go to college. Maybe they'd 
prefer to have a brother, rather than a new car for their high school 
graduation. <p>
Mother Theresa said it best. In news accounts, she was quoted as 
saying, "In America, children have every material thing, but they are 
very lonely, because they don't have brothers or sisters to play 
with." <p>
So, when you have that third child, or fourth, or more, and people 
start raising eyebrows, asking, "How MANY are you going to have?" -- 
just answer, " I don't know, you'll have to ask God. He has a plan." <p>

<title>du Pont: Even Unions Want This Free Market Idea  -- 2/8/96</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>

<h2>
Even Unions Want This Free Market Idea 
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
dupont
.html">
Pete du Pont 
</a>
<p>
<i>Congress may soon make Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs) the law of the 
land.  And even labor unions like the idea.   </i>
 

<P>
Medical Savings Accounts give people the opportunity to move from a 
conventional, low-deductible health insurance plan to one with a high 
deductible (say $2,000 to $3,000) and to put the premium savings in a 
medical  savings account.  Employees and their families pay all 
medical bills up to the deductible from their MSAs and out-of-pocket.  
Insurance then covers 100% of everything else. 

<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The political battle for MSAs has been long and hard, but even when 
the political battle is over, the fighting will continue.  That's 
because the real issue behind the MSA debate is who will control our 
health care dollars.  MSA supporters want individuals to control more 
of their health care dollars;  MSA opponents want someone other than 
the patient - a manager, "gatekeeper" or bureaucrat - to control those 
dollars. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
It is becoming the ultimate in populist vs. elitist battles, and 
nowhere is that more evident than in Bucks County, Pennsylvania, a 
suburb of Philadelphia. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
During 1995 contract negotiations between teachers at the Bucks County 
Technical School and officials of the Bucks County School Board, the 
issue of the high cost of health care became a topic for discussion.  
Members of the Bucks County Technical School  teachers union  had 
recently heard of Medical Savings Accounts and thought that by 
shifting to an MSA plan, both the teachers and the administration 
could benefit.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
They learned that some 3,000 businesses have adopted some form of MSA 
plan.  The apparently universal experience is that MSA plans reduce 
employers' health insurance expenditures over time and permit 
employees to benefit financially by managing their health care dollars 
wisely.  A win-win situation for everyone involved. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Ed Moffit, who teaches air-conditioning and refrigeration technology 
for the school and is president of the teachers' union, optimistically 
presented the idea to the Board.  After all, the money employees spend 
for health insurance ultimately belongs to the employee.  He thought 
the Board would be delighted that a union was proposing a free-market 
solution to their health care dilemma.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
He was wrong. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Board's solution to restraining health care spending was to move 
the teachers out of their fee-for-service policy and into a managed 
care plan, lowering the Board's cost and pocketing the difference.  
Unwilling to let a managed care plan make choices for them, union 
members opposed the school's solution. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The battle thickened.  Moffit and the union publicly asked the school 
Board to release information about the union members' health care 
costs.  Finally it did, and now pressure is building for MSAs. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
What the Bucks County Technical School Education Association has 
learned is what union members and employees across the country are 
learning - MSAs make sense.  For example:  
<BR> 
*&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1994, the United Mine Workers adopted an MSA-type proposal by 
providing members with a $1,000 deductible policy and writing them a 
check for $1,000 at the beginning of the year. 
<br>
*&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;City employees in  Jersey City, New Jersey, get an $1,800 MSA 
contribution to a family plan and a $2,000 deductible - and the 
average MSA refund was about $1,000 at the end of the first year. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Union members often have the most comprehensive health insurance plans 
in the country, often costing well above the national average of about 
$5,000 for a family plan.  As a result, union members who choose a 
less expensive catastrophic plan can have a significant amount of 
money left over to deposit in their MSA, and most would have a nice 
bonus waiting for them at the end of the year. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
But as the Bucks County experience makes clear, management often 
mistakenly  thinks it knows best.   
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
For example, in recent testimony before Congress, John N. Sturdivant, 
president of the American Federation of Government Employees, AFL-CIO, 
which represents 700,000 federal and District of Columbia employees, 
declared that "people are willing to accept limitations on their 
choice of providers in exchange for more comprehensive benefits and 
lower out-of-pocket costs."  Translation: Mr. Sturdivant wants your 
choices limited if it will save a little money. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
And, he added, "Under MSAs . . .consumers would delay treatment until 
it was absolutely necessary."  Translation: You can't be trusted with 
the money because you're too stupid to make good health care decisions 
for yourself.  
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;  
Condescension, whether practiced by management or union leaders, is a 
poor substitute for individual empowerment.  There is no reason to 
think that the Bucks County School Board or John Sturdivant or anyone 
else besides you and your physician should make decisions about your 
health care.  Medical Savings Accounts will give you that opportunity.

<title>UN World Conference on Women</title>

<center><h2>U.N. World Conference on Women</h2>
<p>
By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"> Kathleen Howley</a>
</center><hr>
<p>
<p>
Do you know the five genders? It's a widely-held tenet among 
radical feminists in America that there are at least five, if not 
more. And, they say, it's perfectly normal to flit between several of 
them during a course of a lifetime.
<p>
Typically, they are classified as: lesbian, male homosexual, 
transgender, and, for the less enlightened among us, male and female.
<p>
Geraldine Ferraro, the one-time Democratic vice-presidential 
candidate, is an ardent feminist and a radical pro-abort, yet she 
claims to have never heard about the new gender-speak -- despite the 
fact that it's standard fare in any run-of-the-mill college or 
university Women's Studies department.
<p>
Ferraro led the American delegation at the recent meeting to 
finalize the platform for the U.N.'s World Conference on Women in 
September -- where the definition of gender is guaranteed to be a 
ticking time bomb.
<p>
"I'm nearly 60 years old, and I don't know what the five genders 
are," said Ferraro, trying to deflect criticism about the feminist 
manipulation of the conference's lengthy draft statement.
<p>
In the official document, the word "gender" is mentioned more than 
200 times, often in a convoluted fashion, in sentences that beg for 
the use of the words "male and female." 
<p>
In fact, if you read the document, available on the Internet at 
the U.N. web site, it may raise the same suspicions that bothered 
delegates from Honduras, Guatemala and the Sudan. They were the first 
to object to the repetitive and somewhat odd use of the term, but 
later agreed to drop the issue until the main conference meets in 
Beijing.
<p>
You won't find the words "motherhood," "wife," or "family" 
mentioned in the official document, except for a handful of occasions, 
when they are referenced in a negative context as a means of 
oppressing women. 
<p>
Or, they've been put in brackets, which means that delegates 
objected to their use, and plan to remove them during the final 
revisions in Beijing.
<p>
The anti-fertility forces have had a spree during the drafting of 
the document. Abortion and the wide-spread use of dangerous chemical 
contraceptives, as well as sterilization, are held up, repeatedly, as 
among the most precious "rights" of women. 
<p>
Perhaps some day it will dawn on these meddlesome, middle-class, 
First World do-gooders that women from developing countries actually 
LIKE babies. I saw it with my own eyes, when I spent a year in West 
Africa.
<p>
They value new life. Not because it's another set of hands in the 
fields. But, because they believe that life is a precious gift -- and 
they don't have too many other bright spots in their difficult lives. 
<p>
I know such life-loving ideas are difficult for some First World 
brains to comprehend. We're always trying to think of new ways to 
relieve those poor women of the burden of motherhood. We, the minority 
of the world's population, believe that we know what's best for those 
underprivileged people who form the majority of the world's population 
-- in brief, we still believe in Colonialism.
<p>
But, they don't want our abortion clinics and our contraceptives. 
They want safe drinking water, simple drugs to help their children 
when they fall ill, and some economic opportunities for their 
families. 
<p>
And, there are many people in America who sympathize with them -- 
in fact, the majority. Sadly, the women from developing countries may 
never know this. 
<p>
Beverly LaHaye, president of Concerned Women for America, a 
conservative women's organization that is four times larger than the 
National Organization for Women, railed against the false image 
presented by the Clinton Administration's decision to send ultra-left 
Old Guard feminist extremists to Beijing..
<p>
"This conference is completely dominated by radical feminists. In 
the name of 'Equality, Development, and Peace,' this Beijing 
conference will be a taxpayer-funded promotion of abortion, 
lesbianism, and other left-wing crusades, such as disarmament, radical 
environmentalism, and socialism, that have nothing to do with helping 
women," she said.
<p>
We all know it's a travesty to hold a women's conference in a 
country that routinely practices forced abortions, mandatory 
sterilization of women, and female infanticide. It's a scandal to be 
the guest of a government that has a long record of imprisoning men 
and women in slave labor camps without trial, forcing them to make 
goods for export.
<p>
It's a joke to discuss the dignity of human beings in a country 
where possessing a Bible is a crime against the state, and where 
hundreds of Catholics priests have been imprisoned and tortured -- 
including three Catholic bishops who are still in prison, and three 
Catholic bishops who were tortured and beaten to death in 1991 and 
1992.
<p>
Yes, we know it's a travesty. But, the average woman in developing 
countries may not realize that the left-wing U.S. delegates do not 
speak for us. 
<p>
She'll be left to wonder about a world that sends her planeloads 
of contraceptives, but leaves her without access to simple anti-
malarial drugs.

<center><h2>Fetal Tissue Consumption/Research</h2>
 By<br><a href="/townhall/columnists/howley.html"> Kathleen Howley </a></center>

 <P>
 

     News from the world of medicine: Chinese doctors think they have 
discovered something that cures asthma, restores health, and, at the 
same time, makes skin look years younger. 
<P>
     And, there's an abundant supply, which keeps the price down.
<P>
     Sounds too good to be true? Wait 'till you hear the rest. 
<P>
     The Eastern Express, an English-language newspaper in Hong Kong, 
broke the story on April 12, with details of the burgeoning practice 
of selling the bodies of aborted children, to be used as health food. 
Since then, the story has been picked up by the Wall Street Journal, 
the Washington Times, United Press International, and it's been shown 
on CNN. 
<P>
     Now, Republicans are demanding that the Clinton administration 
investigate, and they're planning to hold hearings in the House of 
Representatives.
<P>
     Rep. Frank R. Wolf, a Republican from Virginia, said the new 
allegations could result in a Congressional call for the United States 
to revoke "Most Favored Nation" trade status for China -- a privilege 
granted by President Clinton despite the manifold allegations of human 
rights abuses in China.
<P>
     This is a nauseating topic -- true. But it's a story that needs 
to be told, just as the shocking crimes of the Holocaust needed to be 
laid bare for the world to see.
<P>
     Zou Qin, 32, a doctor at the Luo Hu abortuary in Shenzhen, China, 
told the Eastern Express reporter that she has eaten more than 100 
fetuses in the past six months, and described them as "highly 
nutritious." The story included a picture of her holding a jar 
containing the tiny body of an aborted child.
<P>
     The doctor said: 
<P>
     "They are wasted if we don't eat them. The women who receive 
abortions here don't want the fetuses. Also, the fetuses are already 
dead (when we eat them). We don't carry out abortions just to eat the 
fetuses."
<P>
     Sound familiar? That's the same argument used by Sen. Ted 
Kennedy, Rep. Joseph Kennedy, and cohorts, to justify fetal research 
in America. 
<P>
     So, before you allow the shock to settle in, ask yourself: what's 
the difference? The Chinese are eating unborn children as health food. 
We're cannibalizing their body parts in the name of "science." 
<P>
     And, during the presidential campaign, Clinton used the same 
logic as Dr. Zou Qin, almost verbatim, when he was asked whether he 
supported experimenting on aborted humans. 
<P>
     They'd only go to waste, Clinton said. Fetal research is going to 
help people and relieve their suffering, he said. No one bothered to 
ask him: at what cost?
<P>
     In fact, one of Clinton's first acts after being sworn in as 
president was to revoke the ban on using tax dollars to fund fetal 
research. That's right: your hard-earned money is being used, right 
now, to pay for it.
<P>
     But, when fetal research is reported on the network news in 
America, it's with a positive spin. The film footage typically shows 
sufferers who allegedly have been restored to health after undergoing 
treatment that involved the injection of fetal brain cells into their 
damaged brains. 
<P>
     Not one word about the tiny human beings who were used, without 
their consent, as donors.
<P>
     Like the Chinese, scientists in America prefer older, more 
developed fetuses. The Eastern Express story reported that full-term 
fetuses were more desirable and more expensive in China -- because 
they were considered more nutritious.  
<P>
     In the world of Western medical research, mature fetuses are more 
desirable, too, because the organs are more developed. 
<P>
     There's one difference, though. The Chinese use dead babies. In 
America, some of the experimentation involves removing parts from live 
babies, before killing and aborting them. 
<P>
     If you have a hard time believing that, read the scientific 
papers that describe the procedures. Or, just ask yourself: would any 
doctor inject dead fetal brain cells into the brain of a Parkinson's 
sufferer? No. The brain cells have to be living, or they're no good.
<P>
     Could any dead fetal organs be used in medical experiments that 
involve transplantation into living adults? No. 
<P>
     Or, ask yourself: would any fetal body parts be usable after 
being subjected to a standard abortion procedure? Once again, the 
answer is, no.
<P>
     So, before we get on our high horse and start pointing at the 
Chinese in disgust, let's remember what we tolerate in America.
<P>
     In the end, the blame doesn't rest solely with the American 
researchers who do the grisly deeds. It also rests on the people who 
allow it to happen, by looking the other way.
<P>
     If you're inflamed by what's going on in China, take some of that 
indignation and use it to combat cannibalism on our own soil. Speak 
for those who have no voice.
<P>

<title>du Pont:   Shakespeare and Medical Savings Accounts  -- 1/16/96
</title>

<h2>
Shakespeare and Medical Savings Accounts 
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>  
 <p>
"Fair is foul, and foul is fair." 
<P> 
Thus incant the three "weird sisters" usually referred to as witches - 
at the outset of Shakespeare's "MacBeth", as they set forth the 
proposition that what is good will be made bad and what is bad will be 
made good. 
 <P>
In like manner, three nationally syndicated columnists - Joan Beck, 
Molly Ivins and Jane Bryant Quinn - have recently stirred the pot, 
proclaiming a fair health care reform proposal foul and a foul one 
fair. 
 <P>
All three columnists attack the idea of Medical Savings Accounts 
(MSAs), particularly the Republican proposal to provide Medicare 
beneficiaries with an MSA option. 
 <P>
Currently, most people get their health insurance either through their 
employer, or from the federal government through Medicare and 
Medicaid.  In the past, most employers offered a health insurance 
policy with a deductible up front, and then people had to pay, say, 
20% of their medical bills up to a maximum amount. Increasingly, 
companies are moving to health maintenance organizations (HMOs) or 
other types of managed care. 
 <P>
An MSA permits a third option.  A person may take the same money that 
is currently spent on that low-deductible policy or HMO and purchase a 
less-expensive, high-deductible health insurance policy, say, with a 
$3,000 deductible.  The money that is saved by purchasing that less 
expensive policy is then deposited by the employer in a Medical 
Savings Account and can be used during the year to pay smaller health 
care bills. Any unspent money in the account at the end of the year 
can be withdrawn or rolled over and grow with interest to be used for 
health care in the future. 
 <P>
In attacking MSAs, the three columnists quickly assert that fair is 
foul.  Joan Beck claims that "the idea of Medical Savings Accounts is 
largely an untried idea." 
 <P>
Not true.  Congressman Matt Salmon (R-AZ), testifying recently before 
the House Subcommittee on Civil Service, said that there are some 
3,000 U.S. businesses that have adopted some form of MSA.  Abroad, in 
1984 the country of Singapore adopted a "Medisave" program  
as the primary means of paying for health care. Today, Singaporeans 
have access to the same technology as most European countries, with 
hospital stays equaling those of aggressive managed care firms in the 
U.S., but they are only spending 3.1% of their GDP (compared to about 
14% in the U.S.). 
 <P>
Jane Bryant Quinn thinks that only healthy and wealthy people would 
want an MSA, but   during the same congressional hearing, everyone 
testifying -- some of whom had implemented MSA plans for their own 
employees -- found that both the healthy and sick benefited 
financially from the plans.  The healthy benefited because they got to 
keep the unspent MSA balance at the end of the year, and the sick 
because they spent less money out of pocket, since their exposure was 
limited to the MSA amount.  Insurance paid 100% of the rest.  
 <P>
Molly Ivins thinks that Republican support of MSAs is the result of 
recent lobbying by special interest insurance companies looking to 
make money off selling the MSA plans.  But the MSA idea goes back to 
the mid-1980s; several think tanks and congressmen -- including those 
now in the Republican leadership -- have supported the idea for years.  
Further, most large insurance companies have opposed all MSA 
legislation for the very reason that it would encourage individuals to 
retain some of the money they had been giving to the insurance 
companies.  (As in "MacBeth", you know the world is topsy-turvy when 
Molly Ivins would rather people give their money to insurance 
companies than keep it themselves.) 
 <P>
All of the above columnists also think that foul is fair -- that MSAs 
would undermine the Medicare system.  Surely a system that is by 
everyone's count going bankrupt in seven years is already undermined.  
Medicare has been plagued with exploding costs and suffocating 
regulations for years. 
 <P>
MSAs are simply not a radical idea.  Indeed, most self-employed 
individuals who purchase a health insurance policy on their own -- and 
thus don't perceive the employer or government as providing a health 
insurance policy free -- usually choose a high-deductible policy and 
pay for smaller medical expenditures out of pocket.  All an MSA does 
is provide individuals or their employers with the opportunity -- not 
a requirement -- to put a limited amount of tax-free money in an 
account to pay those smaller medical bills. 
 <P>
Congressional Republicans are trying to fix and preserve Medicare by 
providing senior citizens with private sector options such as MSAs.  
By contrast, these columnists criticize the plan as threatening to an 
already bankrupt system.   
 <P>
Their solution is to stir the pot and chant:  "Double double toil and 
trouble; Fire burn and cauldron bubble."  It may be good theater, and 
even good liberal politics, but it won't help Americans get better 
health care.

<html><head><title>du Pont:   Time For A New Tax System  -- 1/18/96</title></head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>

<h2>Time For A New Tax System</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>  
 <p>
The objective of the Tax Reform Commission appointed by Speaker 
Gingrich and Majority Leader Dole was, in the words of its chairman, 
Jack Kemp, "to tear apart the whole tax code...and draft...a dramatic 
reform." 
 <P>
As a member of the Commission, I believe the report we issued on 
January 17th completed this mission. 
 <P>
The tax code as it exists today is unjust and unfair. Its definitions 
are complex, its regulations often incomprehensible, and its 
enforcement ranges from lax to nasty.  It is a politicized method of 
unequally extracting income from people who have earned it and 
transferring it to people who haven't, but who the politicians in 
Congress think have a superior claim to it.  Sugar and ethanol 
producers, drug addicts who need federal dollars to support their 
habits, and pornographic arts programs come to mind. Congress simply 
uses the code to reward its friends, punish its enemies, and - of 
course - to get itself re-elected. 
 <P>
The income tax takes as much as 40% of what we earn each year, and 
half of anything left over when we die - the family farm, the small 
business we have built, or the savings we have worked so hard to 
accumulate.  Compliance takes 5.4 billion hours of our time, and if we 
disagree with the IRS, the burden of proof is on us - we are guilty 
until we prove ourselves innocent.  The IRS can search our property 
without a warrant and seize our assets without a trial. 
 <P>
One of the brutal byproducts of the tax code is stagnating incomes for 
individuals but galloping revenues for government.  Between 1973 and 
1993 annual income growth for middle class and low-income wage earners 
has remained flat.  In roughly the same period (1973-1995) government 
"take home pay" has increased 58% in real terms.  Family earnings have 
not risen, while the government's have increased 58%.  There's 
fairness for you. 
 <P>
The members of the Tax Reform Commission believe it is time to repeal 
this whole sorry mess and begin again.  A new tax system proposed by 
the Commission would be based upon three principles. 
 <P>
First, a generous personal exemption.  The Commission did not set a 
number, but for discussion  let's use $7,500 ($30,000 for a family of 
four) on which no income tax at all would be due. 
 <P>
Second, earnings above that amount would be taxed at a uniform, low 
rate, say, 19%.  (again, my hypothetical rate, not the Commission's.)  
All taxpayers would pay the same rate of tax, which is not only fair 
but presumably what the Constitution means by "equal protection of the 
laws."  The rate could only be increased by a two-thirds supermajority 
vote of each House of Congress. 
 <P>
Such a tax system would be progressive.  As the table shows, with a 
19% rate, the wealthy family of four would pay a higher percentage of 
its income in taxes than a middle-income family. 
 <P>
<pre>
	Income        	Taxable Income     Tax Due      Tax As a % of Income 
	$ 30,000           	$0               			0                   		0 
	45,000            	15,000        			2,850                 6.3% 
	60,000            	30,000        			5,700                 9.5% 
	120,000            	90,000       			17,100                14.3% 
 </pre>

<P>
The Commission's third principle is that income should be taxed only 
once.  This would make the employee's half of Social Security taxes 
deductible and eliminate the double taxation of investment income.  It 
would also eliminate death taxes and the alternative minimum tax. 
 <P>
The adoption of such a progressive, uniform tax rate system would 
cause an explosion of growth in the American economy, creating 
millions of new jobs and billions of dollars of take-home pay.  The 
Hall-Rabushka flat-tax proposal was estimated to increase economic 
growth a full percentage point per year.  Although that increase may 
seem small, a percentage point increase in the growth of the economy 
translates into 6 million jobs and two trillion dollars in real 
economic productivity over 8 years.  It would also increase government 
tax revenue by nearly $700 billion. 
 <P>
By discouraging investment, innovation, and the taking of risk, the 
current tax code is restraining the U.S. economy's growth rate to 
about 2.5% per year.  With a progressive flat tax, the economy could 
be growing 4%, or perhaps more, which would bring real increases in 
their quality of life to tens of millions of American families. 
 <P>
That is the goal of the Tax Reform Commission's proposal:  to increase 
jobs, growth, income, and the quality of life.  With our current tax 
code, these things are impossible.  With a progressive flat tax, they 
can be achieved.

<title>du Pont--  The Great Flat Tax Debate 
</title>

</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">



<center><i>December 6, 1995</i><hr>

<h2>The Great Flat Tax Debate 
</h2>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/dupont.html"><i>Pete du Pont</i> </a>
</center><hr>  
 <p>Should America replace its current income tax with a flat tax, a 
single, low-rate tax - say 19% - applied to ALL income above a 
personal exemption of, say, $36,000 for a family of four? 
 <P>
Yes, said the conservative team led by William F. Buckley, Jr. and 
former Democratic Governor Jerry Brown of California in a two-hour 
Firing Line debate taped at Texas Christian University.  Absolutely 
not, replied the liberals, captained by former U. S. Senator George 
McGovern and MIT economist Lester Thurow.  (Before reading on, you 
should know that I was a member of the conservative team.) The debate 
will be aired on PBS the week of December 18th. 
 <P>
The case for the flat tax is based upon three ideas:  it is fairer for 
all to pay the same rate; it will spur growth to create millions of 
jobs and billions of dollars in personal income, and the current 
income tax is grossly unfair, riddled with loopholes and preferences. 
 <P>
A flat tax will be fairer because everyone will pay it.  It will be 
progressive but not penalize effort, and all the special loopholes 
will be gone.  It will be simple enough for most people to fill out on 
a postcard. 
 <P>
As for growth, the National Center for Policy Analysis calculated that 
the flat tax proposed by Governor Brown in 1992 would create 2 million 
new jobs in two years and increase the Gross National Product by 10% 
by the year 2000. 
 <P>
Finally, few will disagree that our current tax system is 
fundamentally flawed and grossly unfair.  The government takes one-
third of what the average person earns each year (more if you are 
successful) and confiscates one-half of whatever is left when we die - 
the family farm, the small business we have built, or the savings we 
have worked so hard to accumulate. 
 <P>
Worse, the Congress opens and closes loopholes every year to reward 
its friends, punish its enemies, and, most important of all, to make 
sure its members are re-elected.  There have been 4,000 changes to the 
tax code since the last "reform" was enacted in 1986.  Our politicized 
tax code takes varying amounts of money from people who have earned 
it, and transfers it to people who haven't, but who the Congress 
thinks have a superior claim to it. 
<P> 
So who is for replacing this mess with a flat tax?  Well, the 
Washington Post:  "the ideal income tax is a flat percentage of all 
income above a threshold of $10,000."  President Clinton's chief of 
staff, Leon Panetta, introduced a flat tax bill as a member of 
Congress in 1982.  And 57% of the TCU students who expressed an 
opinion in a poll conducted prior to the debate favored a flat tax. 
 <P>
And who is against it?  Presumably Republican President Teddy 
Roosevelt, who helped enact the progressive income tax in 1913.  And 
Karl Marx, who initially popularized "a heavy graduated income tax" to 
redistribute income. 
 <P>
But most passionately, Lester Thurow, who confessed in a defining 
moment in the debate that if HE were writing the tax code it would 
contain a progressive consumption tax with top rates "way over 100%" 
so that the wealthy  would find it prohibitively expensive to buy the 
things they buy. "You couldn't have," he said, turning to Bill 
Buckley, "your boat."  
 <P>
Professor Thurow chose an interesting example, for the luxury tax on 
yachts - a mere 10%, not the 100%-plus he proposed - enacted by the 
liberals in 1990 to punish the rich nearly destroyed the U.S. boat-
building industry.  Those punished by the luxury tax (which also 
applied to aircraft and jewelry) turned out to be not the wealthy, but 
the thousands of working people thrown out of work and the taxpayers 
forced to pay $24 million in unemployment benefits to them.  And the 
luxury tax only collected $17 million.  So much for the Thurow theory 
of economics. 
 <P>
But the debate was more than sound and fury.  Senator McGovern came 
around to the view that the double taxation of company earnings was 
wrong.  And liberal economics writer Robert Kuttner conceded under 
fire that if a tax system raised the incomes of all but the wealthiest 
taxpayers 10%, and the wealthiest by 20%, it would still be a good 
thing.  Of course, he denied it could ever happen. 
 <P>
But no one on the left could satisfactorily answer Bill Buckley's 
opening question:  Why should a cab driver working 60 hours a week be 
punished for his extra effort by paying a higher tax rate than his 
neighbor who drove his hack only 40 hours?   
 <P>
Nor could they explain how the current tax system differed from what 
the American patriots listed in the Declaration of Independence as one 
of their grievances against the British King:   He has "sent hither 
swarms of officers to harass our people and eat out their substance." 
 <P>
That sounds an awful lot like the IRS.

<P>
What would you say if your city's housing code dwelled at great length 
on the sturdiness and structure of thatched roofs? What if vehicle 
regulations required blinders on your automobile so that it doesn't 
shy when an emergency vehicle passes by?
<p>
If you like those ideas, you'd love the federal Delaney Clause.
<p>
The Delaney Clause prohibits any measurable residue (from, say, 
pesticides) that has been found to cause cancer in either animals or 
man, in any processed food. Back in 1958, when it was passed as part 
of the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act, it seemed to make sense. 
But just as "Married with Children" humor has replaced that of "Leave 
it to Beaver" (sigh), science has long since passed by Delaney.
<p>
That's in part because back when Delaney was passed, residues could 
only be measured in parts per thousand. Now they can be measured in 
parts per trillion and sometimes even in parts per quintillion. Let's 
say you detect a part per quadrillion in a plum product. That's the 
equivalent of one plum in 73,511,000 tons.
<p>
Delaney is also outdated because it greatly preceded the use of 
maximum tolerated dose testing in laboratory animals which didn't get 
going in earnest until the late 1960s. Under such testing, about half 
of all chemicals--both natural and synthetic--have caused tumors, 
which makes them verboten under Delaney.
<p>
Critics say this makes such testing useless, because it can't possibly 
be that half of everything is carcinogenic.
<p>
The fact that the natural world is full of rodent carcinogens makes 
Delaney "absurd," says pre-eminent Berkeley biologist Bruce Ames.
<p>
"There are a thousand chemicals in a cup of coffee. Twenty-six have 
been tested and 19 have already proven positive, leaving about a 
thousand left to test," Ames told me. "The FDA would be laughed at if 
it tried to keep coffee from being added to ice cream. But there's no 
reason to think it's really a hazard."
<p>
In any case, decades after Delaney was passed, this rodent testing 
became its backbone.
<p>
Congress in 1958 could no more have predicted these new developments 
than the Continental Congress could have predicted the advent of 
warplanes, yet nobody claims we need to be restricted by language in 
the Constitution which only allows funding for an Army and a Navy. 
<p>
In addition to allowing natural rodent carcinogens while banning 
synthetic ones, Delaney encompasses another double standard.
<p>
First, more recent legislation does allow rodent carcinogens in 
unprocessed food, so long as the level is low enough under a certain 
formula to qualify as a "negligible risk." A fresh fruit could have a 
10 parts per billion of a pesticide and be allowed but if it's turned 
into a sauce or juice it might have only 1 part per billion and be 
banned.
<p>
But, some might argue, if Delaney has worked to date, why fix it if it 
ain't broke? In fact, it's always been broken but ignored. Because of 
the outrageousness of actually applying it, the EPA has simply chosen 
not to. But that's about to change because of a lawsuit the Natural 
Resources Defense Council won against the Agency, forcing strict 
compliance with the legislation.
<p>
Now, like it or not, the EPA has no choice but to ban 85 uses of 38 
different pesticide active ingredients. According to the Washington, 
D.C.-based non-profit research group National Center for Food and 
Agricultural Policy (NCFAP), this could result in increased production 
costs of $175 million over the next year and $212 million per year 
after that. The crops most affected would be potatoes, apples, and 
sugarcane, which account for 55% of the total potential costs. Look 
for your grocery bill to go up accordingly.
<p>
Said NCFAP Senior Research Associate Leonard P. Gianessi, ". . . the 
risks of the Delaney-listed pesticide uses are negligible, while the 
economic benefits that they provide are estimated to be $400 million 
per year."
<p>
The Delaney Clause was always too simplistic for its own good. 
Explains environmentalist and University of California biologist 
Garret Hardin, "The Delaney Act was passed because congressmen are old 
men. They are afraid of cancer. Because they're scared, they wanted 
zero tolerance. They did not get any scientific advice.  
Environmentalists who are scientists would never support a zero 
tolerance level for anything."
<p>
That's why even such ardent cheerleaders for pesticide regulation as 
regulation as New York Mt. Sinai pediatrician Dr. Phillip Landrigan 
and Senator Edward M. Kennedy (D-Mass.) have called for its 
replacement by something more workable.
<p>
Sen. Richard Lugar (R-Indiana) has introduced a bill which would 
implement recommendations by the National Research Council, including 
a "negligible risk" standard for both processed and raw foods. This 
determination would be made by the EPA Administrator, assisted by a 
newly-created science review panel.
<p>
Current EPA Administrator Carol Browner has already agreed in 
principle to such a scheme.
<p>
Make no mistake. Nostalgia is a great thing within limits, and here's 
to bringing back "Leave it to Beaver"-type shows in prime time while 
pulling the handle on the toilet in which "Married with Children" 
swims. But when the health and safety of people are concerned, our 
regulations need to reflect present the latest scientific evidence, 
not the state of the art from 1958.

<title>FARM SUBSIDIES SUBSIDIZE WETLANDS DESTRUCTION</title>

<h2>Farm Subsidies Subsidize Wetlands Destruction</h2><br>
By <br><a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html">Michael Fumento</a>
</center>
<hr>
<br>
Pesticides, those much maligned chemicals, can be wonderful things. 
Likewise for fertilizer, when it's not being used to blow up federal 
buildings.  They are both important tools in making the U.S. the best-
fed nation in the world, and in feeding tens of millions of citizens 
of other nations.<p>
But, as they say, you can have too much of a good thing. Agricultural 
run-off from these products are the biggest cause of waterway 
pollution in this country. Pesticides, which are primarily herbicides, 
can kill plants downstream.  Fertilizer run-off makes other plants 
grow at extraordinary rates. Together, fertilizers and pesticides can 
be a one-two punch against eco-systems.<p>
The single best example of such destruction is the nation's largest 
wetlands, the Everglades. Phosphorous fertilizer run-off from sugar 
cane has set off  a chain reaction, stimulating growth among bacteria 
and algae and alsofosters the growth of cattails which choke off the 
marshes, ruining nesting places and destroying animal food supplies. 
Thousands of acres have been overrun by these super cattails.<p>   
Because of such problems, pesticides and fertilizers are heavily 
targeted by government regulators. And it's seems only right that the 
government be involved because, you see, it's the government that's 
responsible for much of the problem.<p>
That's the conclusion of a new study from the Competitive Enterprise 
Institute (CEI) in Washington, D.C. <p>
The study analyzed data from six major farms states, and found that 
eliminating farm subsidies could reduce chemical use per acre by as 
much as 35%.<p>
This is because under the federal price support program, which applies 
to many types of crops, the government pays the farmer a guaranteed 
price for his yield. If, come harvest time, the crops don't bring in 
that minimum price the government pays the farmer the difference, 
called a deficiency payment.<p>
Naturally, this short-circuits the market. Farmers grow extra crops 
not because there are waiting mouths out there but because the 
government is paying a bounty. Extra crops require extra pesticides 
and fertilizer.<p>
But it gets worse. In order to try to limit these extra crops, the 
government encourages farmers--through additional payments--to keep 
part of their land idle. But farmers are terrific businessmen, and a 
heck of a lot smarter than your average bureaucrat. So the farmer goes 
to extraordinary lengths to get as many crops as he can out of the 
acreage still in use. This includes pouring on all the more fertilizer 
and pesticides.<p>
U.S. consumption of plant fertilizer is now close to an all-time high, 
while pesticide use per acre is at its highest point ever.<p>
Now we have too much fertilizer and pesticide in use and too much 
food. This surplus food practically guarantees that commodity prices 
will be low again next year and the cycle starts all over again. It's 
so ridiculous you'd think it was directed by Kevin Costner, except 
that this overblown budget is on a government scale. That puts farm 
subsidy prices at about $10 billion per year.<p>
Myself, I have better uses for my tax dollars than destroying precious 
wetlands. I also didn't give up the benefit of phosphorous detergent 
just to subsidize its use by farmers, who were always the greatest 
source of phosphorous pollution in any case.<p>
In the case of the Everglades, no deficiency payments are made. So the 
sugar lobby wants you to think it's not costing you anything. But 
instead of direct payments, the government has established a quota-
based tariff on sugar imports. In all, the sugar program is estimated 
to cost consumers $1.4 billion a year and, again, encourages excess 
crop growing.<p>
But if you, me, and the alligators and egrets don't care much for this 
whole business, you won't hear the bureaucrats complaining. Indeed, 
this is a jobs program for them.<p>
As study author Jonathon Tolman put it to me, "On one hand you have 
EPA doing everything it can to reduce pesticide use by any means 
possible, costing taxpayers a fortune.  And on the other hand you have 
the USDA using taxpayer money to get more of it." It's bizarre, which 
is to say business as usual for the feds.<p>
While CEI is often at odds with environmentalists, on this they have 
the full backing of the Wilderness Society.  "We think [the study] is 
indisputable," General Counsel Jim Webb told me. The nation is 
"investing a lot of national capital, in both dollars and critters, in 
keeping this subsidy going." <p>
Any one study needs to be seen as just that--one study. But other 
studies support  Tolman's findings.  One conducted on the North 
Carolina coastal plain, for example, found that elimination of farm 
programs would have reduced nitrogen leaching from fertilizer use by 
46%. And data from the 1991 and 1992 Cropping Practices Surveys shows 
that corn producers who participated in the USDA feedgrain program 
used nitrogen, herbicides and insecticides at greater rates than those 
who didn't participate.<p>
There is relief from all this in the former of legislation introduced 
by Democratic Rep. Charles E. Schumer (N.Y.) and Republican Rep. Dick 
Zimmer (N.J.) that would phase out most deficiency payments over the 
next six years (giving farmers a chance to adjust) and make other 
major cuts in federal farm subsidies. Other legislation before 
Congress would begin removing those sweet special privileges the sugar 
lobby receives.<p>
If alligators and egrets could lobby their congressmen--and why not, 
if dead people in Chicago can vote?--they'd surely be lobbying to get 
rid of farm supports.<p>

<title>Buckley: Oh No! Running for President? -- 2/16/96</title>

<h2>
Oh No! Running for President?
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
buckley
.html">
William F. Buckley Jr.
</a>

<P>
Mr. Yeltsin has announced that he will run for re-election as 
President of Russia. It is his duty to "consolidate all healthy forces 
and prevent shocks that could lead to a civil war." That is quite a 
threat to toss about, something no candidate in New Hampshire has got 
around to. In the past few months Mr. Yeltsin has got rid of those of 
his lieutenants identified with the reform movement. This greatly 
surprised those members of our State Department who rued the long 
interval back in 1991 during which Gorbachev was falling apart and 
U.S. policy refused to recognize the importance of Yeltsin. We did so 
only after that dramatic day in Red Square when Yeltsin defied the 
revolutionists and soon after was elected president.
 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It was demoralizing to read the assessment of Yeltsin by Vyacheslav 
Kostikov, Yeltsin's former press secretary. "Power is his ideology," 
he said, "his concubine if you want, his lover -- and his passion. 
Everything that is beyond the fight for power concerns him much less." 
When that remark about Yeltsin was aired, Kostikov was instantly fired 
(he had been ambassador to the Vatican). Fifty years earlier he'd have 
been instantly executed. Even ten years ago he would have suffered 
something more resonant than dismissal from a diplomatic post.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
There are many contenders for the presidency of Russia, but the 
thinking in some quarters is that there will be a run-off between the 
two lead candidates, and that they will be Yeltsin and Gennadi 
Zyuganov. Now Mr. Zyuganov, formerly a provincial teacher, is running 
on the Communist Party ticket and is thought the probable victor.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It staggers the mind. Suppose that in Germany a politician were to run 
on the National Socialist Party ticket. He might say, "Let's see if 
this time around we can do it without killing the Jews, or invading 
France." Zyuganov being a very acute politician, it can't be said of 
him that he got tripped up into running as a Communist. As with 
Yeltsin, one can't know what this politician's internal designs or 
attachments or loyalties are. But Zyuganov proclaims his attachment to 
Communism, intending to persuade the Russians that much of the pain 
they now experience -- en route to a free society and a free market -- 
they didn't experience back then under Stalin and Brezhnev, when no 
one was ever fired from his job, prices were stable, and crime was at 
low tide. In December's parliamentary race Zyuganov faced a liberal 
challenger. At one of their encounters, posters were flaunted: 
"50,000,000 VICTIMS OF CIVIL WAR, COLLECTIVIZATION AND REPRESSION 
WOULD NOT VOTE FOR ZYUGANOV." He won handily.
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The great revisionism is underway. It begins by closing the memory. 
Four years ago, 84 per cent of high-school students tested knew what 
the Gulag was. Today, only 34 per cent can tell you that the Gulag was 
that great charnel, the archipelago in which twenty million Russians 
were killed, either by execution squads, or starvation, or exposure. 
Such historical tablelands, when brought to the attention of the 
Communist candidate for President, are shrugged off as incidents of 
yesteryear. "We can't answer for the mistakes of the past."
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
What is lost sight of is the primary finding of history in the matter 
of the Communist approach to government. It is that the cruelty, the 
repression, the economic sclerosis are an organic part of the whole. 
When Gorbachev authorized glasnost his critics proved absolutely 
correct, that glasnost would need to be repealed, or else that it 
would bring on the dissolution of the Communist enterprise, because 
free speech and Communism are irreconcilable. Yeltsin is already 
moving toward economic interventionism, and in his pursuit of power 
will almost certainly go further. The Communists in China are 
experimenting with economic freedom carefully sequestered, but their 
fear of its leverage on civil rights brings them to furious 
exhibitions of power and threat; because experience teaches that 
economic freedom requires a measure of personal freedom. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
So, after all of this, the next President of Russia might be a 
Communist. What will be his attitude toward the liberated republics? 
We know what the position is of Zhirinovsky, the hero of the super 
nationalists: bring them all back. If that were accomplished, we would 
be facing a Communist leader of a new Soviet Union and wondering, 
quite reasonably, whether it would be thought new for so very long.

<i>NEW YORK, JANUARY 12</i>
<hr>
<h2>This 'Liar' Business </h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
<P>





I want in on the Hillary business, for reasons natural (that's where 
the action is) and unnatural (I am among those who think it important 
what language you use). The water she lives in had been getting hotter 
and hotter, and then a few days ago columnist William Safire of the 
New York Times ran his diagnostic fingers over the accumulation and 
concluded that Hillary Clinton is "a congenital liar." 
<p>
One winces a little on seeing the charge against her expressed in 
exactly that language. To begin with, we don't know -- do we? -- 
whether when she emerged from the womb shouting Beeeh! she knew very 
well that the situation called for her to shout Baaah! but as a 
congenital liar she could not avoid dissimulation. A liar being 
someone who somewhere along the line took to telling untruths, a 
congenital liar is someone who tells untruths because the truth simply 
won't come out of his lips. In the feud a few years ago between 
Lillian Hellman and Mary McCarthy, kindled by Miss McCarthy's saying 
nobody could believe anything Miss Hellman said, Lillian complained, 
and Mary reiterated that everything Lillian writes is a lie, including 
"and" and "the." 
<p>
At that level, of course, charges and countercharges become polemical 
flourishes intended to titillate onlookers. They are no longer 
clinical distinctions between the truth and the non-truth. So by 
adding the qualifier "congenital," Mr. Safire gave away too much 
ground, and soon the whole country was seeing a smiling President 
telling a crowded press conference that, as President of the United 
States, he suffered under certain "constraints" which prevented him 
from dealing with Mr. Safire as he'd have done in private life. For 
those whose imagination wasn't keen enough to know just what that was, 
the White House press secretary Mike McCurry had given a hint. Citizen 
Bill Clinton would have poked Citizen Bill Safire in the nose. 
<p>
Now what seeps through all that stuff is, actually, some idea of what 
remains of the House of Chivalry. Not much. When that house was 
intact, you would never see a man seated in a bus while a woman was 
left standing. Any man who threatened publicly to poke another man in 
the nose wouldn't be noticed nowadays, on the grounds that that threat  was probably made in a crowded bar, where nobody heard or cared, or 
else it was made in a press conference announcing what the intention 
was of Mike Tyson to do to the challenger sometime in the future in 
Las Vegas. It is really surprising that the women's lobby didn't 
resent the language used by Mr. Clinton against Mr. Safire on the 
grounds that manifestly, it was sexist-talk. He wouldn't have said it 
if Mr. Safire's quarry had been a male. 
<p>
And so we arrive at the piquancy in this situation. Mrs. Clinton said 
a half-dozen things that weren't correct, most conspicuously that she 
hadn't personally insisted on firing the seven-man White House Travel 
staff. In fact, according to her ex-employee and Clinton pal Mr. 
Watkins, she did want them fired. 
<p>
But what fascinates is that this episode and a few others having to do 
with the nature of her relationship with the Madison Guaranty outfit 
invite the formal scrutiny of investigating panels and, theoretically, 
the courts themselves, because perjury is contingently involved. 
<p>
But the man who, if he weren't President, would poke Bill Safire in 
the nose, "lies," if that is the word for it, quite consistently. 
Anyone who has watched the tube over the past couple of months will 
have lost count of the frequency of Mr. Clinton's telling the people 
that the objective of the Republican Party's budget drive is to hurt 
the old, the homeless, the sick, the lame, the children, and the 
environment. If something is not true, and it is nonetheless affirmed, 
that gives us a lie, and the generator of that lie, is -- a liar? 
Forget the "congenital" business -- about which most of us don't know 
very much, since our memory reaches back only to when Mr. Clinton in 
the Sixties took marijuana but didn't inhale. How is it that 
politicians are shielded as they are? To get to the White House one 
promises one thing, does another. Or else reaffirms on Monday what one 
repudiates on Tuesday? Some would go so far as to guess that if he 
were simply "Mr." Clinton even then he wouldn't actually go to Mr. 
Safire's office and poke him in the nose. Clinton reserves such 
activity for larger bodies, like the Republican Party, or Congress, or 
the voters who vote for the wrong people. The voters who were lied to.

Implant Tests Cashing in on Junk Science 
</h2>

<P>
"Government Warns on Breast Implants," ran the title of a recent AP 
story. The title was misleading. The issue wasn't breast implants but 
tests claiming to show that such implants may have caused harm. And 
this is a real shame because behind that false headline lies a story 
about one of the greatest health hoaxes of the decade and of how junk 
science permeates the courtroom. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The brief article itself was accurate as far as it went. It informed 
readers that the Food and Drug Administration has warned doctors 
against using unapproved tests to detect antibodies to silicone 
leaking into the body from ruptured breast implants or to detect 
illness that silicone may have caused. Antibodies are a defense 
response the body produces to the introduction of a foreign substance. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The article failed to point out that these very tests have played a 
key role in trials against silicone implant manufacturers which 
sometimes return verdicts measured in millions of dollars. Their 
existence no doubt played a part in the manufacturers' consenting to a 
$4.2 billion dollar settlement, the largest personal injury settlement 
in history. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The article also didn't say that these tests are essentially a scam--
worthless except that, yes, they can pull in verdicts of millions of 
dollars. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The tests generally claim to work by one of three methods: detecting 
chemicals given off by the silicone implant; finding antibodies 
created by the body in reaction to the silicone; or detecting 
antibodies created in reaction to the body's own proteins that have 
been somehow modified by the implant. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Part of the problem with any silicone-detecting test is that we're all 
continually exposed to silicone from a number of sources, including 
puddings, cake mixes, antacids, and lipstick. Diabetics are exposed to 
relatively high levels of silicone as well, through repeated 
injections. Indeed, the very pouch that contains the silicone gel of a 
breast implant is itself made of a form of silicone. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Because of this, the British Department of Health stated in a 1995 
report: "The fact that anti-silicone antibodies have been detected 
both in silicone implant recipients and, at a lower titre [level], in 
people who had not received medical silicones, raises doubts about 
their significance." The report went on to exonerate silicone implants 
of the charges against them: 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Yet, the scam-artist inventors of these tests have enjoyed great 
success pushing their traveling medicine show. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Consider the case of Dr. Nir Kossovsky of the UCLA, an inventor of one 
of the types of tests the FDA warned against. Kossovsky is one of the 
best-known critics of silicone implants, has testified at the FDA 
hearings that resulted in the essential ban on silicone breast 
implants, and is a regular expert witness for plaintiffs in implant-
related trials. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Kossovsky developed what he called Detecsil, for "detect silicone." 
"The Detecsil test confirms whether or not an individual has developed 
an immune response to silicone-associated proteins," declared an 
advertisement. As such, it could be useful in showing whether women 
with autoimmune disease (in which the body's immune system turns on 
itself) got that illness from silicone. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In legal depositions supporting his expert witness testimony, 
Kossovsky cited tests from the famed Scripps Clinic and Research 
Foundation in La Jolla, California as corroborating his own.  In fact, 
Scripps researchers found the antibodies of autoimmune disease victims 
were the same regardless of whether they had silicone implants or not. 
All the test found was that there was a higher level of antibodies in 
anybody with autoimmune disease, exactly what one would expect. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Scripps has repeatedly to disavowed Kossovsky's statements. Indeed, a 
Scripps researcher was on record as saying, "To my knowledge, there is 
no test that can predict or indicate any specific immune response to 
silicone," which is what the test must do to prove adverse health 
effects. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Even before this latest public FDA warning, Kossovsky had been warned 
by the Agency to quit using his test. But the damage has been done. 
The test has played a crucial role in numerous implant trials, 
including ones with verdicts of $7 million, $25 million, and an 
incredible $40 million. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Then consider the case of another company making claims for a test 
able to detect silicone antibodies in women with autoimmune disease. 
It was developed by Emerald Biomedical Services of Woodlands, Texas. 
Dr. Noel Rose of Johns Hopkins University in Baltimore, one of the 
most prominent researchers in the field, contacted Emerald to see if 
he could confirm their findings. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Originally he did, but later he found the same positive reactions in 
women without silicone implants. He informed Emerald the test appeared 
useless, and Emerald sent Rose a letter telling him in politest terms 
to go play in the traffic. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Nonetheless Emerald persisted in sending out information packets to 
potential clients boasting that Rose had validated their study--until 
being warned to desist by Johns Hopkins lawyers. In that same packet, 
Emerald offered their services as an expert plaintiffs' witness and 
bragged about the large settlements their test and testimony had 
helped win. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
At last Kossovsky and Emerald have been put in their place. But not 
before their tests terrified countless numbers of women and wreaked 
havoc in a major sector of American industry. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
It's always been a false cliche that crime doesn't pay. It does, and 
so does its close relative, junk science.

<P> 


You've probably never heard the term "nocebo" before, but you've 
almost certainly suffered from it.  More than that, the nocebo effect 
is a major player in some of today's biggest health scares.
<P>
A nocebo is a negative placebo. That is, while a placebo pill makes 
you feel better though unbeknownst to you it's only made of sugar,  a 
nocebo makes you feel bad though physiologically speaking it shouldn't 
be able to.
<P>
For example, if someone in your office is suffering from a cold you, 
too, may feel your throat tightening, your bones aching a bit, your 
head hurting perhaps.  Sound familiar? It's happened to all of us.
<P>
When a newspaper at which I worked moved to a new building somebody 
told the librarian that there was formaldehyde in her new library 
bookshelves.  Formaldehyde is a suspected human carcinogen and the 
librarian knew this.  Soon she was suffering from a headache, aching 
joints, and labored breathing--all classic psychosomatic symptoms.
<P>
But then she heard there was no formaldehyde in the shelves. Suddenly 
the symptoms disappeared.  Apparently the final word on the shelves 
was that they did contain formaldehyde but the librarian remained 
blissfully ignorant of this and hence symptom free.
<P>
Nocebos don't get talked about much, which is why the American Health 
Foundation (AHF) recently called together a number of experts for a 
conference on the subject. For nocebos aren't just minor curiosities, 
but are wreaking havoc in America today.
<P>
"We think nocebo has a powerful effect," says AHF President Ernst 
Wynder,  "particularly if the suggestion is made by your doctor and 
then your lawyer and then the newspapers."
<P>
Examples?  Consider Gulf War Syndrome. Tens of thousands of Gulf War 
vets are now claiming that something they were exposed to in the Gulf 
is making them ill. Their list of symptoms totals more than 75, with 
the most common being the classic psychosomatic symptoms such as the 
librarian suffered. Yet study after study, including one just released 
from the National Academy of Science's Institute of Medicine, have 
showed that Gulf War vets have no more discernible illness than one 
would expect in a group of that size and age category.
<P>
Curiously, virtually none of the sick soldiers complained for the 
first couple of years after the war. Then reservists began to say they 
were sick but the active duty soldiers still had no complaints. That's 
when it hit the newspapers and television, with every news report 
stating emphatically that the syndrome was real. Suddenly the active 
duty soldiers were falling ill, too.
<P>
Yet for the longest time the mysterious ailment remained confined to 
the United States.  Why?  Because other nation's media weren't 
covering the topic.  When the British press started writing about Gulf 
War Syndrome, suddenly British soldiers began falling ill.
<P>
Another example? Try silicone breast implants.
<P>
"For 30 years women were satisfied with implants," Emory University 
gynecology and obstetrics professor Dr. Elizabeth Connell told me.  
Connell headed the FDA panel that investigated the implants.  "Lot of 
studies at the [FDA] hearings and since then showed a very high level 
of pleasure and acceptance and gratitude."
<P>
But then the media and the lawyers got in the act.  Newspapers and 
magazines ran stories with titles like "Ticking Time Bombs,"  "Toxic 
Breasts," and "After Implants, Horror Began."  Suddenly women with 
implants were suffering all sorts of strange illnesses and "realizing" 
that illnesses they already had must be related to their implants.
<P>
"When you have women being told they have ticking timebombs in their 
breasts, what are they to think?" said Connell.
<P>
As with Gulf War Syndrome, the breast implant scare  appears to be 
confined to U.S. shores. Yes, strangely enough, silicone only makes 
American women sick.
<P>
Media reports have also kicked off other famous incidents of hysteria, 
such as a rash of illness at New York's Love Canal after the local 
newspaper informed the citizens they were living on top of a toxic 
waste dump.
<P>
Sometimes there's more to this than blind panic.  There's what 
Columbia University psychologist Dr. Herbert Spiegel, who spoke at the 
AHF conference, calls "secondary gain."
<P>
What this means is that the nocebo effect can be greatly exaggerated 
when the sufferer finds out there's something to be obtained through 
the suffering. Sometimes it's just sympathy. Other times its being 
taken off a job one doesn't like. And sometimes it's big bucks, which 
is where lawyers come in.
<P>
Spiegel is convinced that secondary gain is behind many of the breast 
implant claims, what with some law firms advertising "$100,000 OR MORE 
MAY BE OWED TO YOU!" if you have silicone breast implants.
<P>
"I have no doubt at all that many, " he told me, "of those women . . . 
have an eye on the deep pockets" implant manufacturers.
<P>
Likewise for Gulf War Syndrome, from which many soldiers hope to gain 
lifetime disability pay and others have joined a class action suit 
against numerous chemical companies. "Gulf War Syndrome is a wonderful 
illustration of what I'm talking about," says Dr. Spiegel.
<P>
Can the nocebo effect be cured? Sure. The media, the courts, and the 
general public need to take a healthy dose of skepticism. This won't 
be a popular remedy; it's not as emotionally gratifying as blaming bad 
guys (corporations, government) or as financially rewarding as suing 
them. But then, the best medicine seldom tastes good. It's just good 
for us.

<i>NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 17</i>
<hr>
<h2>25 Hours at Sea</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>

<P>
Countdown time. In little more than a week, the government of the 
United States is scheduled to close down, there having been an impasse 
between the Executive Branch of government and the Legislative Branch. 
An esteemed world leader is assassinated, resulting in an Air Force 
One flight to Israel. Lo and behold, in the very same airplane are: 
the leader of the Executive Branch and the two leaders of the 
Legislative Branch. 
<P>
They will be 25 hours in the same airplane! Could it be that the God 
Jehovah planned it that way? The golden opportunity to come together, 
35,000 feet up in the air, a thousand miles away from the nearest air 
field, and spend some time discussing the future of the Republic? 
<P>
But protocol reigns, and the airplane belongs, so to speak, to the 
leader of the Executive Branch; the two leaders of the Legislature are 
on board as guests. The initiative, therefore, has to come from the 
host.
<P>
But he doesn't approach them. Why? Well, we are told, he was grieving 
the loss of the slain world leader. The President of the United States 
could not drive from his mind his concern for intra-Israeli 
reconciliation. During the 12 hours heading east all he could think of 
was -- Hebron. To that problem, and the surrounding problem of the 
West Bank, he bent his mighty political powers -- that, and his 
concern for the grieving widow and children. 
<P>
On the journey back, the doctor told the President he simply had to 
make an effort -- as a sacrifice for his country -- to distract 
himself from his preoccupation with Israeli fratricide. He needed 
therapy. And, since Bill Clinton is a soldier, even if he never went 
through formal basic training, he consented to make the effort, but 
stipulated that the only game he would consent to play was Hearts, 
which reminded him of the valentines he used to exchange with the 
slain prime minister. 
<P>
Meanwhile, at the other end of the plane the two legislative leaders 
fidgeted, wondering when the President would come in, or else summon 
them to his quarters, to put it all out on the table. There isn't that 
much time left! is what was going through their minds. They looked out 
the window and saw Ireland go by, no summons. A couple of hours later 
they spotted Gander. Then Nova Scotia. Then Long Island. They 
permitted themselves to wonder whether a deal could be made between 
Long Island and Andrews Air Force Base, which after all was 90 minutes 
away, time enough to come up with something that would put off the 
crisis for a couple of weeks, maybe. 
<P>
At that point Senator Dole is said to have turned to Newt and 
suggested that maybe the President could be persuaded to meet with 
them in Dayton to discuss the problem. But Newt was getting a little 
fed up and said there wouldn't be any rooms available in Dayton, not 
till all those Serbs and Croats and Muslims were out of there. Dole 
nodded and was about to suggest an alternative meeting place when an 
aide appeared, with the landing instructions. 
<P>
They couldn't believe it! It was stipulated that the two leaders of 
the Legislature should disembark from the rear of the airplane. At 
first they reasoned that the purpose for this was to avoid any body 
contact with the President that might result in impetuous bargaining 
over what to do about the close of government at midnight. But no, Bob 
Dole said, there's no realistic fear of that happening, since there 
will be too much hustle and bustle getting out of the plane. There has 
to be some other motive. After all, in Israel we all disembarked up 
front. To change that plan now suggests a motive. 
<P>
Newt looked up. He had got the idea! He was a historian, he told Bob, 
and he knew something about affronts on a major scale, and this was 
one of them. It hasn't absolutely been established, but there are 
revisionists out there who are convinced that Brutus acted as he did 
because of the inferior box Julius Caesar had stuck him in at the 
Colosseum's opening on the Ides of February. The President, he said, 
is trying to provoke us! He doesn't want reconciliation, he wants a 
public shoot-out with as many blasts on TV as he can get out of it! 
<P>
Senator Dole furrowed his brow. There was always an alternative, he 
said. We could let the budget stay unbalanced? 
<P>
Newt shook his head. No. We'll follow the lead of Caesar, and see what 
happens.

<html><head><title>Fumento:  "Seven Angels" Should Remind us of Our Priorities </title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg"><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a><center><i>11/16/95</i><hr><h2>"Seven Angels" Should Remind us of Our Priorities</h2><a href="/townhall/columnists/fumento.html"><i>Michael Fumento</i> </a></center><hr>
<P> 
FOX RIVER GROVE, ILLINOIS--
 
It's called "Seven Angels Crossing" now.  As I write this, it's still 
blocked off.  Wreaths of flowers lie next to a light pole at the 
track. Marquees in the area express the sentiments of local 
businesses: "Our thoughts are with you," "Our prayers go out to you," 
"Pray for the families," "Seven angels, now in heaven." And everywhere 
there are the blue and white ribbons that used to simply be the colors 
of Cary-Grove High School but now mean so much more.
<p>
In late October, a commuter train slammed into a bus here, killing 
five children more or less immediately.  Two more died in the 
hospital.  To say that everyone in the towns of Cary and Fox River 
Grove was touched by the killings sounds cliche, yet it is true. I 
have friends here.  Their own children are too young to be in high 
school, but the boy across the street from them was killed and the 
brother of a girl who plays with their children was injured.
<p>
And everyone is asking the same question: "Why?"
<p>
Current attention is focusing on the signal lights at the crossing, 
and the crossing itself. It turns out that in the two-year period 
before the accident, some 45 complaints were filed with Illinois and 
railroad transportation officials over the crossing and the lights, 
though whether that proves an exceptional number has yet to be seen.
<p>
If it turns out it was an unusually hazardous crossing yet nothing was 
done about it, this will prove to a great extent to be business as 
usual. If there's one thing I've learned about Americans' attitudes 
towards risk in the years I've written about the subject, it is that 
they don't really understand it.  The relationship between that which 
we should fear and that which we do fear is often tenuous at best.  
This goes likewise for expenditures to reduce risks.
<p>
Thus, for example, under a 1991 EPA drinking water regulation, we 
spend $653 million per premature death averted.  A 1988 hazardous 
waste land disposal ban of the EPA costs $4.19 BILLION. An asbestos 
occupational exposure limit laid down in 1986 cost business $71 
million per life while one for arsenic cost $74 million.
<p>
These are not the highest figures I could find, nor the lowest. 
Suffice to say that saving lives through environmental regulation is 
routinely measured in the millions per person.
<p>
By comparison, expenditures that would prevent accidental deaths come 
relatively cheap.  Since we don't know yet what went wrong here in Fox 
River Grove, we can't put a price on fixing it.  But a Harvard Center 
for Risk Analysis publication puts the price of installing flashing 
lights at railway crossings that don't yet have them at a mere 
$733,523 per life saved. Add gates to that and you're still looking at 
only $787,267.  
<p>
"It is an enigma," Book of Risks author Larry Laudan told me, that a 
society that allows so many risky activities in terms of accidents 
will, "at the same time, demand the expenditures of tens of billions 
of dollars [over $115 billion, actually] annually on pollution control 
measures."  Drunk drivers alone, Laudan said, "do far more harm in 
producing injuries and death than ALL known sources of pollution. The 
ultimate irony is that it is not even clear that pollution abatement 
efforts always do much good."
<p>
The explanation, perhaps, says Laudan, "is the remarkable success of 
the environmental movement in persuading us that pollution is one of 
the principal killers of Americans."
<p>
He also cites "the unthinking fear that invisible dangers induce.  
Like radiation, pollution generally cannot be seen or felt.  By 
contrast, most causes of accidents are tangible and palpable--even 
familiar.  Psychologists repeatedly have shown that this sort of 
familiarity breeds indifference, if not contempt."
<p>
Often we find out too late that society's familiarity and contempt 
becomes the undoing of us or our loved ones.  I found out three years 
ago when my car went careening off a cliff just south of Big Sur on 
California's notorious Pacific Coast Highway.  The car rolled several 
times before coming to a halt 350 feet down, just short of the rocks 
at the edge of the water. Despite wearing a seat belt, my girlfriend 
broke her skull and neck and I was told she would probably die.  I 
didn't feel so good myself.
<p>
The good news is that we both survived and are doing fine, thank you.  
The bad news is that when I went back to the accident site I found it 
marked by a cross for a young man whose car had also gone over but who 
hadn't been so lucky.
<p>
When I inquired at the state Department of Transportation to find out 
how much a guardrail at this literal dead man's curve would have cost, 
I was told $1,000. But in this, the most environmentally conscious and 
most environmental regulation-happy state in the country, there was no 
$1,000 to spare for a guard rail.
<p>
Of course, environmental regulatory costs are buried--passed on to 
private businesses--while guard rails require explicit tax 
expenditures. But eventually, we pay for both
<p>
A rich country can afford adequate rail crossings, guard rails, and 
good environmental laws.  But no country can afford indiscriminate 
spending inspired by political activists instead of by careful cost-
benefit analyses. Let's stop finding out the hard way what our 
priorities should be. I know seven sets of parents whom I think would 
want it that way.

<title>Presidential Patter</title>
</head>
<center>
<h2>Presidential Patter</h2>
</center>
<hr>
New York, July 11 
<p>
<p>
There were about twenty people -- mostly men, four women -- engaged
in myriad activities, including law, banking, journalism, the academy.  
They have in common a bond to the conservative political enterprise  
which, to a not inconsiderable degree, is affected by their resolutions.  
And the evening's extemporaneous subject matter was the presidential  
race. 
<p> 
The rubric called for direct speech, freed of any obligation to diplomatic  
protocol. In that spirit, one commentator confessed his sense of security  
with Senator Dole. "I feel comfortable with opportunists, because I  
always know what to expect." Dole, most agreed, is scheduled to be  
nominated, the beneficiary of a Republican tradition that consummates  
the nomination of the front-runner. 
<p>
Bush led in 1988 and of course in 1992, and was confirmed by the  
Republican Convention. Reagan led in 1980, Ford in 1976, Goldwater in  
1964. By contrast, the Democrats make way for relatively obscure  
candidates. The polls reported that 2 per cent of the American people  
knew, in January 1972, the name of George McGovern: six months later  
he was nominated for President. The polls in January 1976 recorded 3  
per cent of the public knew the name of Jimmy Carter, and 12 months  
later he was inaugurated President of the United States. 
<p>
Such arrivals of the star in the third act tend not to happen in the GOP.  
Accordingly, Mr. Dole would need to slip up, something in which he is  
practiced, but not something he has done in the past few months, during  
which his campaign has revealed near-perfect professional performance.  
Another commentator opined that Dole might well suffer during the  
campaign, when his age might become visible. FDR was able to  
campaign in 1944 as if whole in mind and body, but this is not so easily  
done any more with the ubiquitous television cameras. And even without  
a slip, there will be some heavy breathing in the voting booths at the  
prospect of sending to the White House a man who would be 73 when  
inaugurated, 77 at the turn of the century. 
<p>
A participant took the floor to pass along something he situated at least  
half way between rumor and fact. He had been told (needless to say, by a  
reliable source) that Colin Powell would figure heavily in the politics of  
1996. 
<p> 
Just to begin with, whoever gets the presidential nod, Powell is almost  
certain to be invited to run for Vice President. If indeed Mr. Dole gets  
the nomination, Powell will feel a very strong impulse to serve him as  
Vice President, on the grounds that it is all but inconceivable that Bob  
Dole would run for a second term. In other words, Colin Powell would  
be inaugurated as President in January of 2001. 
<p>
Now on this subject, the commentator went on, his word has it that  
Powell will, as scheduled, proceed to do his book tour during September  
and October. But at the end of the tour, he will make a declaration of  
principles addressed unambiguously to the political scene -- and that set  
of political principles will be unambiguously conservative. That act will  
immediately make him a presidential candidate unless he rules himself  
out, intending to accept the Vice Presidency with Dole. We need to  
remember about General Powell -- or to teach ourselves, if we did not  
know it -- that he is the most spellbinding political orator since Reagan.  
"No one else comes even close to his amalgam of dignity, self- 
deprecation, firmness, and hope.'' 
<p> 
Still, whoever it is will need to contend with Bill Clinton. An observer  
began by reciting the disqualifications of the incumbent. "Just to begin  
with, he seems to have repealed the public bias against adultery." On  
every important position he has taken conflicting stands. He is scorned  
by the rest of the world, manipulated by his own staff, arrested in his  
thinking by any visiting shaman. "Still . . . He has the powers of  
Houdini. Throw him in the trunk of the car with eight chains bound  
around him, toss the car into the ocean, and before you know it, he  
comes bobbing up to the surface.'' 
 <p>
Even now, the observer continued, Clinton is substantially up over his  
ratings of a few months ago, and it is by no means certain that he will be  
swamped by the Republican nominee. Anything can happen, which is  
bad news for the Republic, and there is no insurance policy written to  
cope with this contingency.
<p>

<H2>President Reagan's Second Inaugural Address</H2>
<HR>

<P>
Monday, January 21st, 1985 <HR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Senator Mathias, Chief Justice Burger, Vice President Bush, Speaker
O'Neill, Senator Dole, Reverend Clergy, members of my family and
friends, and my fellow citizens:
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This day has been made brighter with the presence here of one
who, for a time, has been absent--Senator John Stennis.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
God bless you and welcome back.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
There is, however, one who is not with us today: Representative
Gillis Long of Louisiana left us last night. I wonder if we could
all join in a moment of silent prayer. (Moment of silent prayer.)
Amen.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
There are no words adequate to express my thanks for the great
honor that you have bestowed on me. I will do my utmost to be
deserving of your trust.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
This is, as Senator Mathias told us, the 50th time that we the
people have celebrated this historic occasion. When the first
President, George Washington, placed his hand upon the Bible,
he stood less than a single day's journey by horseback from raw,
untamed wilderness. There were 4 million Americans in a union
of 13 States. Today we are 60 times as many in a union of 50 States.
We have lighted the world with our inventions, gone to the aid
of mankind wherever in the world there was a cry for help, journeyed
to the Moon and safely returned. So much has changed. And yet
we stand together as we did two centuries ago.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
When I took this oath four years ago, I did so in a time of economic
stress. Voices were raised saying we had to look to our past for
the greatness and glory. But we, the present-day Americans, are
not given to looking backward. In this blessed land, there is
always a better tomorrow.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Four years ago, I spoke to you of a new beginning and we have
accomplished that. But in another sense, our new beginning is
a continuation of that beginning created two centuries ago when,
for the first time in history, government, the people said, was
not our master, it is our servant; its only power that which we
the people allow it to have.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
That system has never failed us, but, for a time, we failed the
system. We asked things of government that government was not
equipped to give. We yielded authority to the National Government
that properly belonged to States or to local governments or to
the people themselves. We allowed taxes and inflation to rob us
of our earnings and savings and watched the great industrial machine
that had made us the most productive people on Earth slow down
and the number of unemployed increase.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
By 1980, we knew it was time to renew our faith, to strive with
all our strength toward the ultimate in individual freedom consistent
with an orderly society.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We believed then and now there are no limits to growth and human
progress when men and women are free to follow their dreams.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And we were right to believe that. Tax rates have been reduced,
inflation cut dramatically, and more people are employed than
ever before in our history.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We are creating a nation once again vibrant, robust, and alive.
But there are many mountains yet to climb. We will not rest until
every American enjoys the fullness of freedom, dignity, and opportunity
as our birthright. It is our birthright as citizens of this great
Republic, and we'll meet this challenge.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
These will be years when Americans have restored their confidence
and tradition of progress; when our values of faith, family, work,
and neighborhood were restated for a modern age; when our economy
was finally freed from government's grip; when we made sincere
efforts at meaningful arms reduction, rebuilding our defenses,
our economy, and developing new technologies, and helped preserve
peace in a troubled world; when Americans courageously supported
the struggle for liberty, self-government, and free enterprise
throughout the world, and turned the tide of history away from
totalitarian darkness and into the warm sunlight of human freedom.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
My fellow citizens, our Nation is poised for greatness. We must
do what we know is right and do it with all our might. Let history
say of us, &quot;These were golden years--when the American Revolution
was reborn, when freedom gained new life, when America reached
for her best.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Our two-party system has served us well over the years, but never
better than in those times of great challenge when we came together
not as Democrats or Republicans, but as Americans united in a
common cause.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Two of our Founding Fathers, a Boston lawyer named Adams and a
Virginia planter named Jefferson, members of that remarkable group
who met in Independence Hall and dared to think they could start
the world over again, left us an important lesson. They had become
political rivals in the Presidential election of 1800. Then years
later, when both were retired, and age had softened their anger,
they began to speak to each other again through letters. A bond
was reestablished between those two who had helped create this
government of ours.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In 1826, the 50th anniversary of the Declaration of Independence,
they both died. They died on the same day, within a few hours
of each other, and that day was the Fourth of July.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
In one of those letters exchanged in the sunset of their lives,
Jefferson wrote: &quot;It carries me back to the times when, beset
with difficulties and dangers, we were fellow laborers in the
same cause, struggling for what is most valuable to man, his right
to self-government. Laboring always at the same oar, with some
wave ever ahead threatening to overwhelm us, and yet passing harmless
... we rode through the storm with heart and hand.&quot;
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Well, with heart and hand, let us stand as one today: One people
under God determined that our future shall be worthy of our past.
As we do, we must not repeat the well-intentioned errors of our
past. We must never again abuse the trust of working men and women,
by sending their earnings on a futile chase after the spiraling
demands of a bloated Federal Establishment. You elected us in
1980 to end this prescription for disaster, and I don't believe
you reelected us in 1984 to reverse course.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
At the heart of our efforts is one idea vindicated by 25 straight
months of economic growth: Freedom and incentives unleash the
drive and entrepreneurial genius that are the core of human progress.
We have begun to increase the rewards for work, savings, and investment;
reduce the increase in the cost and size of government and its
interference in people's lives.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We must simplify our tax system, make it more fair, and bring
the rates down for all who work and earn. We must think anew and
move with a new boldness, so every American who seeks work can
find work; so the least among us shall have an equal chance to
achieve the greatest things--to be heroes who heal our sick, feed
the hungry, protect peace among nations, and leave this world
a better place.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
The time has come for a new American emancipation--a great national
drive to tear down economic barriers and liberate the spirit of
enterprise in the most distressed areas of our country. My friends,
together we can do this, and do it we must, so help me God.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
From new freedom will spring new opportunities for growth, a more
productive, fulfilled and united people, and a stronger America--an
America that will lead the technological revolution, and also
open its mind and heart and soul to the treasures of literature,
music, and poetry, and the values of faith, courage, and love.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
A dynamic economy, with more citizens working and paying taxes,
will be our strongest tool to bring down budget deficits. But
an almost unbroken 50 years of deficit spending has finally brought
us to a time of reckoning. We have come to a turning point, a
moment for hard decisions. I have asked the Cabinet and my staff
a question, and now I put the same question to all of you: If
not us, who? And if not now, when? It must be done by all of us
going forward with a program aimed at reaching a balanced budget.
We can then begin reducing the national debt.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I will shortly submit a budget to the Congress aimed at freezing
government program spending for the next year. Beyond that, we
must take further steps to permanently control Government's power
to tax and spend. We must act now to protect future generations
from Government's desire to spend its citizens' money and tax
them into servitude when the bills come due. Let us make it unconstitutional
for the Federal Government to spend more than the Federal Government
takes in.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We have already started returning to the people and to State and
local governments responsibilities better handled by them. Now,
there is a place for the Federal Government in matters of social
compassion. But our fundamental goals must be to reduce dependency
and upgrade the dignity of those who are infirm or disadvantaged.
And here a growing economy and support from family and community
offer our best chance for a society where compassion is a way
of life, where the old and infirm are cared for, the young and,
yes, the unborn protected, and the unfortunate looked after and
made self-sufficient.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And there is another area where the Federal Government can play
a part. As an older American, I remember a time when people of
different race, creed, or ethnic origin in our land found hatred
and prejudice installed in social custom and, yes, in law. There
is no story more heartening in our history than the progress that
we have made toward the &quot;brotherhood of man&quot; that God
intended for us. Let us resolve there will be no turning back
or hesitation on the road to an America rich in dignity and abundant
with opportunity for all our citizens.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Let us resolve that we the people will build an American opportunity
society in which all of us--white and black, rich and poor, young
and old--will go forward together arm in arm. Again, let us remember
that though our heritage is one of blood lines from every corner
of the Earth, we are all Americans pledged to carry on this last,
best hope of man on Earth.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I have spoken of our domestic goals and the limitations which
we should put on our National Government. Now let me turn to a
task which is the primary responsibility of National Government--the
safety and security of our people.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Today, we utter no prayer more fervently than the ancient prayer
for peace on Earth. Yet history has shown that peace will not
come, nor will our freedom be preserved, by good will alone. There
are those in the world who scorn our vision of human dignity and
freedom. One nation, the Soviet Union, has conducted the greatest
military buildup in the history of man, building arsenals of awesome
offensive weapons.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We have made progress in restoring our defense capability. But
much remains to be done. There must be no wavering by us, nor
any doubts by others, that America will meet her responsibilities
to remain free, secure, and at peace.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
There is only one way safely and legitimately to reduce the cost
of national security, and that is to reduce the need for it. And
this we are trying to do in negotiations with the Soviet Union.
We are not just discussing limits on a further increase of nuclear
weapons. We seek, instead, to reduce their number. We seek the
total elimination one day of nuclear weapons from the face of
the Earth.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
Now, for decades, we and the Soviets have lived under the threat
of mutual assured destruction; if either resorted to the use of
nuclear weapons, the other could retaliate and destroy the one
who had started it. Is there either logic or morality in believing
that if one side threatens to kill tens of millions of our people,
our only recourse is to threaten killing tens of millions of theirs?
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
I have approved a research program to find, if we can, a security
shield that would destroy nuclear missiles before they reach their
target. It wouldn't kill people, it would destroy weapons. It
wouldn't militarize space, it would help demilitarize the arsenals
of Earth. It would render nuclear weapons obsolete. We will meet
with the Soviets, hoping that we can agree on a way to rid the
world of the threat of nuclear destruction.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
We strive for peace and security, heartened by the changes all
around us. Since the turn of the century, the number of democracies
in the world has grown fourfold. Human freedom is on the march,
and nowhere more so than our own hemisphere. Freedom is one of
the deepest and noblest aspirations of the human spirit. People,
worldwide, hunger for the right of self-determination, for those
inalienable rights that make for human dignity and progress.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
America must remain freedom's staunchest friend, for freedom is
our best ally.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
And it is the world's only hope, to conquer poverty and preserve
peace. Every blow we inflict against poverty will be a blow against
its dark allies of oppression and war. Every victory for human
freedom will be a victory for world peace.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
So we go forward today, a nation still mighty in its youth and
powerful in its purpose. With our alliances strengthened, with
our economy leading the world to a new age of economic expansion,
we look forward to a world rich in possibilities. And all this
because we have worked and acted together, not as members of political
parties, but as Americans.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
My friends, we live in a world that is lit by lightning. So much
is changing and will change, but so much endures, and transcends
time.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
History is a ribbon, always unfurling; history is a journey. And
as we continue our journey, we think of those who traveled before
us. We stand together again at the steps of this symbol of our
democracy--or we would have been standing at the steps if it hadn't
gotten so cold. Now we are standing inside this symbol of our
democracy. Now we hear again the echoes of our past: a general
falls to his knees in the hard snow of Valley Forge; a lonely
President paces the darkened halls, and ponders his struggle to
preserve the Union; the men of the Alamo call out encouragement
to each other; a settler pushes west and sings a song, and the
song echoes out forever and fills the unknowing air.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
It is the American sound. It is hopeful, big-hearted, idealistic,
daring, decent, and fair. That's our heritage; that is our song.
We sing it still. For all our problems, our differences, we are
together as of old, as we raise our voices to the God who is the
Author of this most tender music. And may He continue to hold
us close as we fill the world with our sound--sound in unity,
affection, and love--one people under God, dedicated to the dream
of freedom that He has placed in the human heart, called upon
now to pass that dream on to a waiting and hopeful world.
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
God bless you and may God bless America.

<title>Say Hello To Senator Lugar</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<i>NEW YORK, SEPTEMBER 15</i>
<hr>
<h2>Say Hello To Senator Lugar</h2><br>
<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>
 
Richard Lugar was in town, and when that happens these days to the 
restrained, brainy senior senator from Indiana it means he is engaged 
in promoting his presidential candidacy. You shut your eyes, think for 
a minute: Who is Richard Lugar? The snippets form up deep in the 
memory. Yes . . . Rhodes scholar . . . mayor of Indianapolis . . . 
U.S. senator . . . strangely overlooked by George Bush when he went to 
the other senator from Indiana, Mr. Quayle, as Vice President, given 
that Lugar had been around longer and has here and there been 
prominent in foreign-affairs analysis.<p>

"I know more about foreign policy than anyone running for President or 
serving as President," he says, "and that is a modest claim." He is 
not the wisecracking kind, but it is an effective line and, one 
supposes, will be used by him in Iowa and New Hampshire, provided he 
can find an audience there that is interested in foreign policy.<p>

Well, what are his audiences interested in hearing about? The answer 
is: mostly taxes. Senator Lugar has proposed the elimination of the 
Internal Revenue Service. The what? someone in the company asked. Yes 
. . . exactly that. And a 50 per cent reduction in the capital-gains 
tax. And a $500 tax credit, not exemption, for every child.<p>

Well, but how are we going to finance all that?<p>

A consumption tax. Richard Lugar is all for growth, but he doesn't 
count on it to guarantee the long-term growth of the American economy. 
What we do need to do is to disencumber the economy, which is groggy 
from taxation and regulation. But the future of the economy is the 
world market. Hundreds of millions of people who want, and will 
increasingly be able to pay for, American products.<p>

But doesn't that run into the burgeoning protectionist bloc? Yes, 
indeed it does, and Pat Buchanan is doing a very good job in stirring 
that up. "I had an exchange with Pat recently and I told him the 
United States was running a trade surplus with Europe." He was flatly 
unaware of this, and showed it.<p>

"Senator Gramm said recently," a guest said, "that as a sometime 
economics professor he is well equipped to challenge the high-tariff 
people, but that this can't be done in a two-minute give-and-take or 
over talk radio. Are you going to talk about 'comparative advantage' 
in a stump debate?"<p>

Well, said the senator, the answer to that question is: You have to do 
it. "Do you know something? It costs one thousand dollars less to 
assemble an automobile in Indiana than it does in Mexico. One thousand 
dollars, because our workers have the training, the capital plants, 
the education, the advantages of transportation. Windshield wipers for 
cars, manufactured in Canada, are moving to the U.S. -- because it's 
cheaper. But Pat has them cheering and hollering with arguments from 
another age."<p>

Is it true, as recently heard, that if GATT and NAFTA were up for 
ratification tomorrow in the Senate they wouldn't get through? Yes, 
the senator said, that is true, and true also that some of the young 
Republican congressmen are infected with the protectionist virus.<p>

The candidate went on to talk about the problems of the front-runner. 
A few months ago, he said, Mr. Dole was running ahead of Mr. Clinton 
in California. Now he is behind. It is entirely possible that in May 
the GOP will wake up to find that no one candidate has got a majority 
of the delegates. So what has been planned between May and August? The 
answer to that is: Nothing. Nothing has been planned between May and 
August. But during that time I could knit together my positions -- for 
lower taxes, and increased trade -- and take on Clinton after my 
nomination. "But you have to learn to put your message, like on 
tariffs, down in black and white, in large type."<p>

Well, one guest asked, why haven't you done that? Gotten a couple of 
ad people together and given them that assignment? The senator is not 
fast on the polemical draw. He might have said that there is no 
equivalent of E=mc2 for the tariff argument, but he let it go. "That's 
a good idea."<p>

Is Senator Lugar getting anywhere? The objective indices aren't 
pulling for him. His finances are strained, and he barely showed up in 
the Iowa skirmish two weeks ago. He leaves you with the comfortable 
feeling of having been in the company of a decent, well-educated man 
who was a groundbreaking mayor, and is a fine senator.<p>

<title>ADM'S ETHANOL GETS BY WITH HELP FROM ITS FRIENDS -- Fumento</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<hr>
<center><h2>ADM'S ETHANOL GETS BY WITH HELP FROM ITS FRIENDS</h2> <p> 
By Michael Fumento</center><p>
<hr>
 

Long before the current price-fixing scandal rocked the halls of 
Archer Daniels Midland, the self-styled "supermarket to the world," 
was a super rip-off for the public. And its co-conspirators in this 
scandal are the likes of President Bill Clinton and presidential 
wannabe Kansas Republican Senator Robert Dole.<p>

The tool used to siphon hundreds of millions of dollars yearly from 
the taxpayer to ADM is ethanol, alcohol distilled from corn. When 
mixed with gasoline, ethanol is called gasohol. About 55% of the 
ethanol produced in this country is manufactured by ADM, based in 
Decatur, Ill.  With sales of about $11 billion a year, ADM is the 
largest grain-processing company in the world.<p>

But gasohol has problems at the pump. First, it hurts mileage. Second, 
it's considerably more expensive than gasoline. Nobody is going to buy 
a fuel that both costs more and hurts mileage unless either A) the 
fuel is subsidized so that it doesn't cost more, or B) they are forced 
to. In this case, ADM has arranged through its friends in high places 
to make it C) both of the above.<p>

In addition to myriad state tax breaks, gasoline blended with ethanol 
is eligible for a federal tax credit of 5.4 cents a gallon, totalling 
an estimated $770 million a year. Over half that goes straight into 
ADM CEO Dwayne Andreas's coffers.<p>

Introducing that law was Dole, ADM's point man for its assault on the 
taxpayers. Dole has introduced over two dozen bills to help the 
ethanol industry and lobbied fiercely for it outside of Senate 
chambers as well.<p>

ADM needs people like Dole because ethanol is not only too expensive, 
it's worthless.<p>

Ethanol is touted as cleaner than gasoline. Indeed, it can reduce 
emissions of carbon monoxide, a fairly minor pollutant. While harmful 
in enclosed areas, it never causes serious health problems even at the 
very highest levels found in outdoor air.<p>

Moreover, ethanol only reduces carbon monoxide emissions from cars 
built before oxygen sensors were made mandatory in 1983 or whose 
oxygen sensors are broken. Repeated studies at the University of 
Denver using a remote testing device invented there have found that 
out of 250-300 late model vehicles tested, at most one will put out 
significant carbon monoxide emissions.<p>

Ethanol is also said to reduce ground-level ozone pollution, but a 
study by Sierra Research of Sacramento, California found that it would 
actually slightly INCREASE ozone production and increase smog. Indeed, 
in 1992 the EPA declared it could not be certified as a pollution-
fighting fuel for use in the nation's smoggiest cities. Immediately, 
as the Wall Street Journal put it, Dole "lobbied the administration 
from President Bush on down." Dole won, ADM won, and airbreathers lost 
as the EPA relented and certified ethanol.<p>

 Ethanol is also presented as a way to prop up corn prices by 
increasing corn demand. It does do that, but a by-product of its 
production is a corn mash sold as feed. That reduces the demand for 
soybeans, a crop corn farmers grow as part of crop rotation.<p>

In any case, it would be far cheaper to just funnel a subsidy directly 
corn farmers rather than funnel it through ADM.<p>

The real reason for ethanol's continued blessed existence isn't amber 
waves of grain but ample waves of cash. "Dwayne Andreas just owns me," 
former Democratic Party Chairman Robert Strauss once told the 
Washington Post. It turns out Andreas actually owns lots of other 
important people, too.<p>

Since just 1991, Andreas and his family, ADM, and the ADM PAC have 
contributed over $1.18 million to the Republican Party and $1.05 
million to the Democrats.<p>

But nobody has benefited from this largesse more than Bob Dole. To 
date, ADM has contributed over $85,000 to Dole's various campaign 
bids, along with various other perks.<p>

The most lucrative contribution to Dole was ADM's co-sponsorship of 
"Face-Off," a daily three-minute radio debate between Dole and 
Massachusetts Democratic Sen. Ted Kennedy from 1984 to November 1987, 
when Dole declared his presidential candidacy. A spokesman for the 
show told me the value of this free advertising for Dole was about 
$840,000.<p>

Even while he denies being Andreas's chief  lackey, it is a position 
Dole jealously guards. In August, speaking of the ethanol industry, 
Dole told an audience at the Illinois State Fair, "So far, we've been 
shut out by this administration."<p>

Really?<p>

Last year, shortly after Dwayne Andreas served as co-chairman of a 
Democratic Party fundraiser and personally donated $100,000, the 
Clinton Administration, via the EPA, tried to mandate that about 10% 
of all gasoline sold nationally contain ethanol. But in May a federal 
appeals court declared the administration "exceeded its authority" in 
so doing.<p>

With that shot down, the ethanol lobby demanded a different gift, 
insisting that an ethanol-containing gasoline additive called ETBE 
receive the same tax break that pure ethanol gets. The Treasury 
Department quickly granted it. The ADM-supported American Corn 
Grower's Alliance then announced,  "Agriculture owes the President 
many thanks for seeing him continue to fulfill his pledge to be an 
advocate for ethanol, ETBE, and oxygenated fuels."<p>

(Note to the tobacco companies: If you want Clinton off your backs, 
just lace your cigarettes with a little ethanol.)<p>

The ADM executive who blew the whistle on its alleged price-fixing 
scheme says that the company's philosophy is: "The competitor is our 
friend; the consumer is our enemy." They could add to that another 
one: The politician is our lackey; the public is our sucker.<p>

<title>MURDER DOWN</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">

<h2>MURDER DOWN?</h2>
</center>
<hr>
 New York, July 18 
<p>
<p>
The headline was wonderfully reassuring to this part of the world.  
"Murder Rate Plunges in New York City." There are corollary decreases  
in other crime -- robberies down 22 per cent, auto theft down 25 per  
cent. The question arises: Is this a statistical blip? If not -- if it is a  
genuine trend downward -- what are its causes? More jails? Less crack  
cocaine? A dulling of the criminal spirit? 
<p>
The optimists should read the essay in the July Atlantic Monthly by  
Adam Walinsky. For that matter, so should the pessimists. It is an  
eloquent and heavily informed overview of what has happened in the  
past three decades, and Mr. Walinsky wonders why America permitted it  
to happen. Everyone deplores the high rate of crime but there is nothing  
resembling a true mobilization to combat it. 
<p>
Here are the salient figures. In the 1960s, for every violent crime  
committed we had 3.3 police officers. In 1993, for every police officer  
there were 3.4 violent crimes. Consider New Haven, Connecticut. In  
1990, with its population down 14 per cent from 1960, its robberies had  
increased more than 100 times, or 10,000 per cent. In this perspective,  
the reduction of crime in New York is, however welcome, a mere fillip.  
And the figures on police stretch out to less than one-tenth the effective  
police power of thirty years ago. ". . . in another formulation, each police  
officer today must deal with 11.45 times as many violent crimes as his  
predecessor of years gone by." 
 <p>
We have a half-million police officers, and the proposal in the crime bill  
of Mr. Clinton was an extra one hundred thousand. How many  
policemen would we need to add in order to restore the same balance as  
in 1960 of police to violent crimes? Five million. 
<p>
Are we making any strides in that direction? Only in the private sector.  
One and one-half million security officers protect corporations, private  
residential areas, shopping malls. Good. But a lot of people spend their  
time outside privately protected areas, like the overwhelming majority of  
the American people. The Department of Justice estimates that 83 per  
cent of all Americans will be victims of violent crime at least once in  
their lives; about a quarter, victims of three or more violent crimes. 
<p>
Two out of five killers, Mr. Walinsky advises us, are undetected. These  
missing killers commit what the trade calls "stranger murders." The  
notion that crime is overwhelmingly a matter of passion is simply no  
longer arguable. And the chances of the stranger murderer getting away  
are 80 per cent. Walinsky quotes a New York Times description of Omar  
Rosario going to work in a grocery store, whose previous owner was  
murdered. "Rosario prepares for work by donning a bulletproof vest and  
sliding a 9-millimeter semi-automatic into his waistband. When a young  
man with one arm hidden inside his coat enters the store, Mr. Rosario  
takes out his pistol and eases it halfway into the pocket of his pants, his  
finger on the trigger. He faces the man and lets him see the gun in his  
hand. He wants to make it clear that if the young man pulls a gun, he  
will be killed.''' 
<p> 
That's one way to go, but it hasn't had a large effect. In the last ten years,  
twice as many Americans were killed by strangers as were on the  
battlefield during the ten years we fought in Vietnam. In the black  
community the statistics are dire: One out of every 21 black men is  
killed, double the rate of American servicemen in the Second World  
War. "The collapse of the black lower class is a creation not of history  
but of this generation. It has been a deliberate if misguided act of  
government to create a welfare system that began the destruction of black  
family life. It was the dominant culture that desanctified morality,  
celebrated license, and glorified fecklessness." 
<p> 
Adam Walinsky has for many years advocated a Police Corps, an ROTC  
that would offer four-year college scholarships to young people in return  
for four years of police service following their graduation. This is not an  
expenditure from which the Contract crowd should shrink. To begin  
with, it is to confirm the most solemn obligation of government, which is  
to provide for domestic security. "President Clinton has requested $261.4  
billion for defense against foreign enemies who killed fewer than a  
hundred Americans in all of last year. It would be silly to suggest that  
the Federal Government should not or cannot spend an eighth as much --  
2 per cent of even a shrunken federal budget -- to defend the nation  
against domestic enemies who killed more than 10,000 people who were  
strangers to them in 1994, and who will surely kill more in every year  
that lies ahead."

<title>Buckley: School Uniforms?! -- 1/26/96</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/background.jpg">

<BLOCKQUOTE><BLOCKQUOTE><a href="/townhall/columnists/"><img align="right" vspace="10" src="/townhall/columnists/thcolm.gif"></a>

New York, January 26, 1996
</i>

<h2>
School Uniforms?!
</h2>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/
buckley
.html">
William F. Buckley Jr.
</a>

<P>
One commentator dealt bravely with the seven general categories of 
national problems addressed by President Clinton and finished his 
appraisal with the sentence, "Why on earth does the leader of the free 
world have to concern himself with school uniforms?"
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Well now, there are those who found that the most novel and 
potentially the most resonant sentence in the President's address. 
Flash ahead ten years, close your eyes, answer the question: "What was 
the highlight of President Clinton's State of the Union speech in 
1996?" Right, the answer will be: Oh, that's the speech in which he 
came out for school uniforms. . . . To say that was the "highlight" of 
the speech is of course to take liberties, consigning all else he said 
to generic political thought. The President declared in favor of 
health care, law and order, unity, growth, and husbandry. So does 
every candidate running for President. It was the school-uniform bit 
that caught the attention of the unwary, who asked first, What does 
Mr. Clinton know about school uniforms? and asked second, How is it 
that he intuits their importance?
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Not long ago a public-school teacher in New York City wrote to the 
Wall Street Journal a letter bristling with authenticity, relating 
that the foremost problem in the city's schools was: discipline. In 
the absence of it, she complained, practically nothing else is 
possible. What has been called the "hijacker's leverage" is operative 
here. Just as one terrorist can dictate the movements of a super-jet 
carrying five hundred passengers, so one unruly student can, for as 
long as he is able to keep it up, affect the climate of a schoolroom. 
In the late Sixties, one senior at Harvard appeared at the office of 
the president hours before the Commencement ceremony demanding that he 
be scheduled as a speaker during the ceremony. If not, he informed the 
stunned president, the ceremony would not proceed. A half-dozen noisy 
protestors, even in an assembly of two thousand, can make solemn 
processions impossible; as also, studious classrooms. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The head of Cardinal Hayes High School in New York made a point of it 
some years ago. That school -- formally a diocesan school although 
many of its students are of other faiths, 85 per cent of them 
minorities -- has arresting academic attainments; 85 per cent of its 
graduates go on to college, compared with less than 15 per cent in 
comparable public schools made up of identically endowed students. It 
is very important, the principal told his visitor, to insist on a 
school uniform. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Why? one naturally wondered. Because, he said, the symbol irradiates 
several things. The first is that the student is a member of a 
regulated community. When you are in uniform, your dress bespeaks 
hierarchy. The symbol is very important. At Cardinal Hayes the 
students are simply not expected to be late in arriving at school, and 
punctuality is accepted as a part of the system: related, in a way, to 
the requirement that the students wear their simple grey jackets and 
pants, a shirt and a tie. On the question of disorder in the 
classrooms it is as simple as that there is no disorder in the 
classrooms. Defenders of the antinomian behavior of so many public-
school students confide to you that the reason for the success of the 
private schools is that they simply expel anyone who is in any way 
nonconformist. But such chaos-defenders run into statistics: 2 per 
cent of the students at Cardinal Hayes are expelled. 
<BR> 
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The maintenance of order, the minor conformity that issues from the 
wearing of identical uniforms, is always a latent problem because the 
schools deal with boys and girls who are going through their unruly 
period in life. The sociologist who some time ago remarked that a 
single broken and unrepaired window is an invitation to corollary 
shambles gave us all an epiphany. Of course it is true! we realize. 
Student unruliness is met in different seasons in different ways. At 
Eton in the 1830s the students outnumbered faculty by about 100 to 1, 
and the notorious Doctor Keate attempted to solve his problem by 
flogging a dozen students every day. We shrink from such measures, but 
ought to welcome civilized substitutes, and the school uniform is the 
beginning of wisdom in this field, and we say hurrah to the President 
for coming upon that insight.

New York City early in the week was just the place to sharpen up on 
political and social protocol, Messrs. Giuliani and Rangel acting as 
dancing masters. The headlines went to the mayor, who sent two 
bouncers to Lincoln Center to escort Yasir Arafat out of the theater. 
This was done, apparently, even though the Palestinian delegation had 
received three tickets for the concert organized by the mayor for his 
international diplomats. The ouster was hailed by Mr. Giuliani's most 
intimate associates, condemned by everyone else, the State Department 
apoplectic in the matter. Mr. Giuliani's point was that as a 
prosecutor years ago he had handled, or been given to study, instances 
of terrorism done by Arafat and his organization. He would not, he 
declared to the press, serve as gracious host to anyone who had 
engaged in terrorism. 
<p>
That position can empty the house, of course. The former prime 
minister of Israel, Menachem Begin, not only participated in terrorist 
activity, he headed up Irgun, a terrorist organization. Nelson 
Mandela, even in jail, headed up an organization that proudly and 
defiantly exercised and defended terrorism. But if Mayor Giuliani had 
led President Mandela from the floor, he'd have provoked the black 
community, and maybe even would have violated one of the civil-rights 
laws. President Jiang Zemin of China is not too old to have 
participated in the Cultural Revolution, sustained by acts of state 
terrorism designed to tranquilize inquisitive children. And of course 
we had Castro.
<p>
Castro is a continuing phenomenon. After his opening speech at the UN 
he donned his battle fatigues and went up to Harlem, where he was 
treated as O.J. would have been if he had killed two women, not just 
one. Representative Charlie Rangel gave and got a bear hug, a 
significant emotional advancement for a man who only a few years ago 
railed against any commerce, diplomatic or material, with South 
Africa. <p>

The curious were entitled to wonder exactly why. Why should Democratic 
die-hard Charles Rangel be enthusiastic about the accomplishments of 
Fidel Castro? To begin with, there are no accomplishments save for 
full employment for prison guards and executioners. The only 
significant accomplishment of Fidel Castro is to have kept himself 
alive, given that there are at least a million Cubans who would gladly 
pull the trap on any scaffold on which Fidel Castro was poised. And 
staying alive was a considerable achievement, given that the United 
States' Operation Mongoose made several attempts to assassinate him, 
including one that dispatched for his use a scuba-diving suit that 
after a few minutes would transform itself into a host of piranhas; 
and, on another occasion, a superb cigar, except that it was designed 
to explode after two or three draws. On this matter, Fidel had himself 
a good laugh, when he told his audience in Harlem that he was not 
participating in State Department ceremonies because he didn't want to 
"interfere in this country's foreign affairs." 
<p>
Castro was received at the Council on Foreign Relations, which is okay 
given that the CFR flat-out invites any state leader, no questions 
asked, to its chambers to discuss that leader's line. And then also 
Castro dined privately with twenty establishment figures. Among them 
was Robert McNamara, defense secretary at the time Castro was 
receiving nuclear missiles aimed at the United States. We must suppose 
that Secretary McNamara apologized for acting so peremptorily back in 
1962 when he demanded the withdrawal of the missiles. We like to think 
that Castro was big about it and forgave McNamara. 
<p>
He was after all in an expansive mood, boasting that there were more 
doctors per capita in Cuba than in the United States and offering to 
send to America a few doctors to look after Americans in need. We were 
reminded of Eva Peron, who in 1949 offered straightfacedly to send 
clothes for the underclad children in Washington. . . . <p>And all the 
while New Yorkers thought that the burlesque was on Broadway.

<i>NEW YORK, NOVEMBER 7</i>

<hr>

<h2>Yitzhak Rabin, RIP</h2><br>

<a href="/townhall/columnists/buckley.html"><b><i>William F. Buckley Jr.</i></b></a><hr><br></center>

Viewing the TV and reading the papers in the days after the 
assassination one got some idea of how Mr. Rabin operated. One 
reporter said that to see Mr. Rabin was as easy as calling him up and 
taking the ten-minute trip from the reporter's office to the office of 
the prime minister. Another spoke of his "thirty or forty" sessions 
with him over the years.
<p>
And then there were the eulogies. A retired professor who served many 
years on the college admissions committee spoke once of the skill 
developed after a few years in detecting letters of recommendation 
that are synthetic. Just so, listeners to eulogies develop after a 
while an ability to discriminate between the formalistic and the 
genuine. Many eloquent statements were made, some of them -- from men 
and women who had worked closely with Rabin -- heartfelt beyond any 
histrionic power to deceive. The tribute paid by Henry Kissinger is 
not easily forgotten.
<p>
Three days ago I'd have thought it singular to recall that twice Mr. 
Rabin was with me on Firing Line and that he had once come with a 
friend to lunch with my wife and me in Switzerland. To say this now, 
which is to confess to only three encounters with him over the years, 
suggests I was practically an exile, all but ignored by the great man, 
so profuse were his journalistic and social energies.
<p>
The various passions stirred by his death are by now familiar. We know 
that a cruel element of the tragedy was the background of the 
assassin: of all things, an Orthodox Jew, rising to kill the greatest 
living Jewish hero. There is the consternation having to do with the 
political legacy. Yes, Shimon Peres will pursue the same ends. But 
although it is acknowledged that the death of Mr. Rabin will renew the 
momentum of the peace movement, its longevity cannot be taken for 
granted. When Lincoln died (Ambassador Eagleburger likened the two 
events) the nation was for a period buoyed by the sentiments he 
expressed in his second inaugural address, but it was not long before 
Reconstruction became the ugly thing it was.
<p>
In the case of Israel, something needs to be done to restore the 
perspective of those who fought Rabin. It is difficult to believe that 
people who deem themselves Israeli patriots would as recently as a few 
weeks ago design an effigy of Rabin wearing swastikas. In New York 
City one young follower of the late Rabbi Meir Kahane declared on 
television that violence can be "bad" but it can also be "good." He 
had whatever reserve of good sense it took to decline to say that he 
was pleased that Rabin had been a target of "good" violence, but he 
left that impression, cultivating as he was the line that the return 
by Israel of parts of the West Bank was high treason.
<p>
Policy differences, then, can hardly be expected to disappear in 
tribute to one martyr. Mr. Benjamin Netanyahu was convincing in his 
disavowal of the killer-division of the Israelis who join him in 
opposing the policies of Rabin and Peres. But there are Jews who are 
models of civil rectitude who oppose those policies, and they will not 
be silenced by the silencing of Mr. Rabin, nor should they: the 
security of Israel is properly the paramount concern of the Israeli 
government.
<p>
It's not all that easy to communicate to others the meaning of the 
birth of the State of Israel. Jeffrey Hart, writing several years ago, 
put it, "Now I can understand why Israel in fact has become sacred. 
The history of the twentieth century is, to put it mildly, unique. The 
Holocaust is a sort of hole in the cosmos, a guarantor of the 
existence of evil. It is an equivalent for Jews of the Crucifixion. 
Israel then became the equivalent of the Redemption. This is true even 
for relatively secular Jews. Judaism has never successfully separated 
God and Tribe. The People itself is the God carrier. I think that from 
a full experience of the twentieth century I am willing to accept the 
sacredness of Israel as a religious fact."
<p>
That is the reason the death of Yitzhak Rabin was a transfiguring 
event. That he died, and how he died, and when he died, and for what 
he died. <p>
