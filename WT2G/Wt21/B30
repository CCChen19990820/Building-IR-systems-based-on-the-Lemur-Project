Nuclear Deal with Pyongyang: Road Map to Progress or Dead End
Street?," November 4, 1994)

     The Clinton Administration's Korea policy, focused as it is on
North Korea's nuclear weapons programs, falls short of dealing with the
larger question of North-South conflict on the Korean Peninsula. Over
two months ago, the Clinton Administration inked an "Agreed
Framework" with North Korea to freeze Pyongyang's maverick nuclear
program. Despite this agreement, North Korea downed a U.S. helicopter
on December 17, 1994, killing one U.S. airman and detaining another
on false charges of American espionage. These are grim reminders that
Cold War tensions continue on the Korean Peninsula and that the
37,000 U.S. soldiers stationed there remain in harm's way. Nearly two
million troops face off across a heavily fortified demilitarized zone.
Three decades of on-again, off-again talks between Pyongyang and Seoul
have produced no significant progress in reducing tensions. Although a
cease-fire ending the Korean War was signed in 1953, the two sides
technically remain at war. The Clinton nuclear deal with North Korea
does not deal with the totality of this threat. Nor does it address the
underlying tensions between North and South which are at the heart of
the conflict on the Korean Peninsula.
<P>
<B> Clinton's Generous Deal with North Korea</B>
  <P>   The Clinton deal with North Korea is heavily "front-loaded" in favor
of Pyongyang and makes generous political and financial concessions to the
North. While enhancing its international status through direct dialogue with
the U.S., Pyongyang is allowed substantial delays in fulfilling past promises
to check its nuclear weapons program. For example, the North will keep
intact for ten years or more the nuclear fuel enrichment facility that it
pledged not to possess under a 1992 agreement with the Republic of Korea
(ROK). Under the Clinton agreement, therefore, full nuclear transparency in
the North will not be realized for a decade or longer.
 <P>
     However, the nuclear issue is by no means the only threat to vital
U.S. interests on the peninsula. A key flaw in the Administration's Korea
policy is its excessive focus on the nuclear problem. Left inadequately
addressed is the continuing high state of tensions between North and South
Korea and the immediate danger posed by the North's massive military
force, which includes chemical and biological weapons and long-range
missiles. The death of yet another American soldier at the hands of the
world's most volatile communist regime should remind Americans that, on
the Korean Peninsula, serious threats to U.S. interests linger. The
Administration should be pressed to rethink its short-sighted policy and
vigorously pursue progress in North-South tension reduction.
<P>
     The October 21 agreement between the U.S. and North Korea needs
to be strengthened. In particular, its clauses to reduce tensions between the
North and South, if handled appropriately, could serve important mutual
U.S. and ROK interests. The Clinton Administration, however, does not
appear adequately prepared or even willing to apply appropriate pressure on
Pyongyang to abide by these clauses. The State Department, for example,
which brokered the deal with Pyongyang, has not expressed its intention to
link steps toward reducing tensions with the benefits offered to the North
under the agreement.
<P>
<B> Congress Should Intervene</B>
<P>     To get U.S.-Korea policy on track, Congress needs to take a more
active role. While limited in its ability to make foreign policy, Congress
does have the mechanism of a Joint Resolution to express its will. Thus,
through a Joint Resolution, it should now construct precise policy guidelines
to improve the protection of America's interests and those of its South
Korean ally. 
<P>
     A framework already exists for reducing North-South tensions: the
Reconciliation and Denuclearization Agreements ratified by Seoul and
Pyongyang in 1992. The many ambitious commitments made in these pacts,
such as opening the border to citizen exchanges, have never been
implemented, and the Clinton Administration, for all intents and purposes,
has ignored them, preferring a direct approach to Pyongyang.
<P>
     Recent statements by State Department officials indicate that the
Clinton Administration chooses not to get directly or systematically involved
in promoting the North-South dialogue. The process is the responsibility
primarily of the Koreans themselves, these officials say. Yet, without
appropriate and consistent pressure, North Koreans will continue to avoid
contact with the South in hopes of isolating the ROK and driving a wedge
between Seoul and Washington.
 <P>
     The time is right for Congress to press the Clinton Administration
for improved North-South relations. With a large U.S. troop presence in the
South and a resulting defense burden costing American taxpayers more than
$2 billion per year, it clearly is in the vital national security interest of the
U.S. to promote substantive inter-Korean political, economic, social, and
military confidence-building measures and tension reduction. Such progress
not only would ease the threat of conflict, but also would begin to pry the
lid off North Korea's closed society and open the way for eventual reform
there. It also would assuage an increasingly nervous South Korean
government and populace who believe they have been sold short by
Washington.
<P>
<B> Use America's Considerable Leverage</B>
   <P>  The North Koreans likely will resist such actions and complain
loudly and bitterly. However, they desperately want the new agreement to
survive so they can reap significant gains. They are eager for a massive aid
package -- conservatively estimated at more than $4 billion -- that will be
funded mainly by Seoul and Tokyo. Also eagerly anticipated in Pyongyang
are diplomatic recognition by the Clinton Administration and an end to the
U.S. trade embargo. Finally, Pyongyang is obliged to pursue tension
reduction under Section III of the October 21 agreement with the U.S.,
under which North Korea agreed that it will "engage in North-South
dialogue" and "take steps to implement the North-South Joint Declaration
on the Denuclearization of the Korean Peninsula."
 <P>
     Since the North reaps great benefits from its deal with the U.S.,
America has some leverage over Pyongyang. Thus, a strong show of U.S.
determination is in order. It was a lack of political will that led the
Administration to make too many concessions to Pyongyang on October 21.
Past experience indicates that the North will be compelled to behave
responsibly only when Washington follows a steady, strong course. America
also should look for support in these endeavors from China, North Korea's
largest trading partner, and Japan, which eventually is expected to offer
Pyongyang a generous assistance package after normalization of relations
with the South. If Pyongyang balks at a dialogue with Seoul, this should
trigger trade pressure on the North by Beijing and Tokyo and the delay of
Japanese-North Korean diplomatic normalization.
<P>
<B> A Joint Resolution</B>
   <P>  To strengthen the standing of the U.S. and its allies under the
agreement, Congress should consider a Joint Resolution recommending that
the Clinton Administration:
<P>
Press for immediate resumption of long-stalled North-South talks and link
implementation of the October 21 U.S.-North Korea agreement with
substantive and rapid progress in reducing tensions. This position is
consistent with the spirit and letter of the agreement. Section III of the pact
calls for improvements in North-South relations.
<P>
Revive the Reconciliation and Denuclearization Agreements between Seoul
and Pyongyang. These agreements were ratified but never implemented.
 <P>
Appoint a seasoned negotiator as a presidential envoy to communicate
directly with Pyongyang regarding this new policy and to coordinate with
South Korea and other concerned nations.
<P>
     In concert with Seoul, the Administration should identify timetables
for reducing North-South tensions through:
<P>
Dismantling promptly the North's nuclear reprocessing facility.
Exchanging North-South liaison offices.
<P>
Expanding North-South trade relations.
<P>
Opening the border to free travel and communication by citizens of each
side.
<P>
Providing for mutual notification of major troop movements and major
military exercises.
<P>
Pulling back troops from both sides of the demilitarized zone.
Introducing phased reductions of armaments and troops.
<P>
Replacing the current cease-fire with a North-South peace treaty.
<P>
     Congress should require that, within three months of the resolution's
passage, the Administration report to Congress on the progress it has made
in implementing both the October 21 agreement and these recommendations.
If Congress is not satisfied, it should consider using its budgetary authority
to curtail or block altogether the generous benefits bestowed upon
Pyongyang by the October 21 U.S.-North Korea agreement.

Judgment?" June 14, 1991.)

<P>

    As the Navy, Congress, and the American people consider the now
notorious "Tailhook" sexual misconduct case, perspective is required.
Twenty-six women have charged that they were sexually assaulted by a
number of officers at last September's annual convention of the
Tailhook Association, the professional organization of naval and
marine aviators. If the charges turn out to be true, then those guilty
should be punished to the fullest extent of the law. Sexual misconduct
represents a grave breach of professionalism and has no place in the
military. However, the uproar surrounding this incident threatens to
harm the effectiveness of the Navy as a fighting force. Promotions of
fleet commanders have been held up, and some in Congress, such as
Representative Patricia Schroeder, the Colorado Democrat, are saying
that the only way to prevent sexual misconduct in the military is to
put women in combat. The result is plummeting morale and disarray in
one of the finest fighting forces the world has ever seen. 
<P>
     This is going too far. Concern about eradicating sexual
misconduct in the military should not be allowed to destroy the very
reason for the military's existence: to protect the security of all
Americans. The culprits, if they are guilty, should be punished, but
the Navy as a whole should not be condemned. Nor should the Navy be
forced to embark on some social experiment -- by putting women in
combat positions, for example -- which not only will do nothing to
stop sexual misconduct, but will also weaken the team cohesiveness and
fighting ability that is the key to winning battles and wars.
<P>
    Tailhook and its Aftermath. The Tailhook saga began last
September in Las Vegas at the convention of the Tailhook Association,
named for the device that stops landing aircraft on the decks of
carriers. Lt. Paula Coughlin says that she was forced to run a
gauntlet down a hotel hallway filled with Navy officers who grabbed
her breasts and tried to remove her clothing. After the Navy
investigated this incident, it was discovered that possibly seventy
officers engaged in such assaults on at least 26 women (fourteen of
them fellow officers) at the Las Vegas convention. The damage from
this incident has been compounded by the presence and alleged
complicity of senior officers, by failures throughout the chain of
command to respond adequately to complaints, and by revelations that
reports of misconduct from earlier conferences were ignored. Navy
Secretary H. Lawrence Garrett III resigned on June 26, invoking the
Navy's tradition of bearing full responsibility for the actions of his
men. Although Garrett has not been accused of participating in or
condoning the events at the Tailhook symposium, which he attended, his
handling of the subsequent investigation has been widely criticized.
<P>
    Tailhook and Congress. The initial congressional response to the
Tailhook affair is damaging the morale and combat effectiveness of the
Navy. From June 4 to July 2, Congress delayed the promotions of
roughly 4,500 Navy and Marine officers above the rank of Navy Lt.
Commander and Marine Corps Major in order to determine whether any of
them was involved in the Tailhook incident. Many changes of command
were postponed, including those for the forces responsible for the
waters off Yugoslavia, and the naval base at Guantanamo Bay, where
thousands of Haitian refugees are currently being housed and
processed. The House Appropriations Committee, chaired by Pennsylvania
Democrat John P. Murtha, on June 29 voted to double its original cut
of 5,000 positions from Navy headquarters. Murtha said that this
action was "directly connected to the obstruction and arrogance of the
Navy."
<P>
    Representative Schroeder meanwhile has tried to use the outcry
over Tailhook to bolster her case for placing women in combat
positions. For example, in a June 28 interview on Cable News Network
concerning the Tailhook incident, Schroeder criticized the Navy's
handling of the issue, implying that the real problem was the unequal
treatment of women. She said: "If you're the best for the job and you
want the job, you get it... ," meaning, of course, a combat job. 
<P>
    The idea of Schroeder and other liberal lawmakers seems to be
that the military is the proper place for social engineering, no
different from any other workplace, and perfectly suitable to applying
the feminist principles of absolute equality between the sexes.
Represenative Barbara Boxer, the California Democrat, said in a June
28 television interview concerning the Tailhook controversy: "The
thing about the military is, it has always been a place for
opportunity, first for people of color -- they broke the color barrier
-- and then for women. We have more work to do here and in other
areas, but we've got to make sure we move forward." Moving forward for
Boxer, of course, is putting women into combat. In her view, the
military is more important as a vehicle for curing social ills than as
a fighting machine.
<P>
    Unfortunately, military leaders are showing signs of caving into
the kind of pressure generated by Schroeder and Boxer.
<P>
    Example: When asked whether the problem of misconduct would be
    solved by placing more women on ships, the Chief of Naval
    Operations, Admiral Frank Kelso, replied on June 28 that he was
    waiting for the report of the Presidential Commission on the
    Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces, which is due in
    November. He failed to speak out against placing women in combat.
    In fact, in several appearances before this Commission, not a
    single senior Navy officer has argued strongly against allowing
    women into combat.
<P>
    Example: Rear Admiral Leonard N. Oden, the commander of the Naval
    Training Center in Orlando, Florida, describes an experimental
    co-educational "boot camp" for recruits as incredibly successful.
    Mixed gender recruit platoons are outperforming their all-male
    counterparts in training. But peacetime training is far removed
    from combat. The fact that the sexes have separate sanitary and
    housing facilities, totally impossible to accomplish in combat
    units or aboard combat ships in war, is not made clear.
<P>
    Military Leaders Must Hold the Line. In this emotionally charged
atmosphere, the Navy's leaders must follow three courses of action.
They must: 1) expeditiously but fairly investigate and punish those
who are found guilty in the Tailhook case; 2) continue vigorously
their support for the "zero tolerance" policy toward sexual misconduct
that was developed in 1989; and 3) forcefully explain to Congress and
the American public why women should not be allowed in combat. 
<P>
     Women do not belong in combat for several reasons. There is a
risk that physical standards for combat training will be compromised
if women are allowed into combat positions where those standards are
critically important, such as in the infantry and in special
operations units. There is also the disruption of the military's
mission that will result from the pregnancy of female troops in combat
positions.
<P>
    But most damaging would be the devastating impact on the morale,
team cohesion, and fighting spirit of the armed forces. Combat is a
team activity which brings infantrymen and sailors more closely
together than any other form of work. Some women may indeed be as
physically and mentally capable as men to perform some combat duties,
but what matters more in combat is not individual ability, but
teamwork. The presence of women in combat units, especially those in
the infantry, would disrupt the teamwork that makes a difference
between victory and defeat on the battlefield. Special relationships
inevitably would develop, introducing new risks as men acted
differently in combat toward females than they do toward males. 
<P>
     If Schroeder and other feminists want to solve the sexual
misconduct problem in the military, the last thing they should do is
advocate putting women into combat. Female soldiers will be taken
prisoner and sexually abused by enemy forces. This is precisely what
happened to Maj. Rhonda Cornum when she was taken captive by the
Iraqis during the Persian Gulf War. She was, she later acknowledged,
"violated manually -- vaginally and rectally." It makes little sense
to expose women to new and even more horrific threats in the name of
protecting them from their own American colleagues.
<P>
    The Navy as an institution should not be made a scapegoat as the
Congress tries to find a solution to the sexual misconduct problem in
the services. This not only would be unfair to the thousands of male
Navy officers and personnel who do not abuse women, it would damage
the fighting capability of the Navy, which would be a disservice to
the nation and the American people whom it is entrusted to protect.
<P>
    The Navy is a fine institution. It has successfully responded to
problems of racial prejudice and drug abuse which continue to plague
the civilian world. Its policy of "zero tolerance" for drugs, enforced
by random testing and dismissal for offenders, virtually eliminated
the problem when it was implemented in 1981. There is every reason to
believe that the problem of sexual misconduct will be dealt with in
the same manner. Outside pressure to find the culprits of sexual
misconduct is fine, but damaging the integrity of the Navy as an
institution should not be the cost.
<P>
    America Does Not Need A Kinder, Gentler Military. Despite their
justified outrage at the Tailhook incident, Americans must realize
that the military needs fighters, not laboratory subjects for
experiments in social engineering. The purpose of the military is to
fight and win wars, not to serve as a jobs program or as a vehicle for
social change. If the federal government is to ask men to risk their
lives in combat, it must not create an environment that will increase
that risk. This is what putting women into combat positions would do.
Far from solving the problem of sexual misconduct, women in combat
would merely feminize the warrior culture of the armed services, and
thereby weaken its ability to do its job.

<p>
<b>INTRODUCTION</b><BR>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
U.S. military strength in Asia underpins deterrence and U.S. leadership in Asia. If the two Koreas were to reunify, American ground troops would likely be reduced, and American air power in Asia would become much more important in maintaining deterrence. China's recent purchase from Russia of co-production rights for the Sukhoi SU-27 <I>Flanker</I> jet fighter represents a significant step in Beijing's ambition to build a world-class air force. Currently, the People's Liberation Army Air Force (PLAAF) is saddled with thousands of obsolete Soviet-era combat aircraft and is deficient in advanced munitions, electronic warfare systems, logistics, and training. The SU-27 will be China's first jet fighter with capabilities roughly equivalent to current U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine fighters. U.S. intelligence reportedly estimates that China may obtain up to 300 SU-27s. If successful in absorbing the Sukhoi's technology and production know-how, China eventually could challenge American air superiority in Asia.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

To sustain deterrence in Asia, the U.S. must proceed with programs to build advanced fighter aircraft and munitions that will guarantee American air superiority in Asia. Specifically, the U.S. should:
<ul>
<p><li><b>Sustain funding for the F-22A jet fighter.</b> This is the only U.S. jet fighter currently in development that promises a clear level of superiority to the SU-27.

<p><li><b>Maintain 12 Navy aircraft carrier battle groups.</b> The Clinton defense budget puts at risk the Navy's ability to project power in Asia. Should budget pressures force a reduction in carrier battle groups, the Navy may be required to deploy its Seventh Fleet carrier, now homeported in Japan, to non-Asian trouble spots for increasing periods of time, thereby reducing the U.S. deterrent in Asia.

<p><li><b>Develop an air-superiority fighter for the Navy.</b> With the Navy's F-14 Tomcat to be phased out by 2010, the Navy will need a fighter that is clearly superior to the Russian SU-27.

<p><li><b>Accelerate development of a helmet-sighted missile and make advanced U.S. air-to-air missiles available to U.S. allies.</b> The U.S. and its allies should have such a system to counter current Russian helmet-sighted missiles sold to China.

<p><li><b>Develop advanced versions of the F-16 and F-18 for allied and friendly Asian air forces.</b> The danger is that the U.S. could lose sales to future European or Russian aircraft.

<p><li><b>Ask Russia and Israel to curtail sales of advanced combat aircraft and related technology to China.</b> Russia and Israel should be told that they are helping to accelerate a military modernization program that could destabilize Asia.
</ul>
<p>

<b>CHINA'S SU-27 DEAL</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In February, it was reported that Moscow and Beijing had reached agreement on a $2.2 billion deal for China to begin co-producing the Sukhoi SU-27.<sup>1</sup>  The Chinese designation for this aircraft will be the J-11. China had purchased an initial batch of 24 SU-27s in 1991 for about $1 billion. These aircraft were reported to have been delivered by the end of 1992 and are based at Wuhu Air Base, about 150 miles east of Shanghai.<sup>2</sup>  In May of last year, it was reported that China had purchased a second batch of 22 aircraft as a prelude to the larger co-production deal.<sup>3</sup>  Former Russian Defense Minister Pavel Grachev said the second batch of SU-27s was delivered in April.<sup>4</sup>  These aircraft will be based at Suixi Air Base in Southern China.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Estimates vary as to the final number of SU-27s that China may purchase or co-produce. According to one report, the first co-production contract would enable the Chinese to produce 40 to 60 aircraft from Russian-made components over the next three years.<sup>5</sup>  According to another source, China may obtain a total of 72 to 78 SU-27s from this deal, enough to equip three regiments of the PLAAF, followed by co-production after five years.<sup>6</sup>  Yet another source states that China will purchase 120 sets of prefabricated components for assembly in China, with indigenous production phased in later.<sup>7</sup>  Finally, a Pentagon intelligence assessment concludes that China eventually may obtain as many as 300 SU-27s.<sup>8</sup>  In any event, it is reasonable to assume that the total could exceed 100; and if China masters full co-production, the total (to include Chinese-designed variants) could exceed several hundred.
<p>

<b>COMPARING THE SU-27 WITH CURRENT U.S. FIGHTERS</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Because the SU-27 will play a significant role in modernizing the PLAAF, it is useful to compare it to existing U.S. fighter aircraft. Some key performance parameters are listed in Table 1. Since entering service in 1986, the SU-27 has been the best fourth-generation air-superiority fighter in service with the Russian Air Force.<sup>9</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The SU-27 is roughly comparable to the F-15C, the best U.S. Air Force fighter. The F-15C is the only U.S. fighter used almost exclusively for air-superiority missions. Over 400 F-15Cs have been purchased by the United States Air Force, and 108 are deployed in U.S. Pacific Command.<sup>10</sup>  This aircraft accounted for 36 of the 39 USAF air-to-air victories in the Gulf War. The F-15C will remain the principal U.S. Air Force air-superiority fighter until replaced by the Lockheed-Martin F-22 later in the next decade.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The F-15C and the SU-27 have comparable ranges, though the SU-27 can carry ten missiles while the F-15C can carry eight. The F-15's ability to maneuver is about the same as the SU-27's.<sup>11</sup>  Both are capable of difficult maneuvers that stress the airframe to nine times the weight of the aircraft. The F-15C uses the AN/ANG-70 radar, which can detect targets about 100 miles away and can track and engage multiple targets. The SU-27's Phazatron N001 radar has a search range of over 62 miles with the ability to track 10 targets and engage two. However, unlike the F-15, the SU-27 is equipped with an infrared search and tracking (IRST) system with a range of from 15 to 31 miles that directs gun and missile systems.<sup>12</sup>  This system allows the <I>Flanker</I> to track and engage targets while turning off its radar, decreasing the chances of detection by opposing aircraft.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Grumman F-14, the U.S. Navy's primary air-superiority fighter, is a better all-around combat interception system than the SU-27. Were it not for the F-14's swing-wing, the SU-27 might be much more maneuverable that the F-14. The F-14 can carry six long-range or medium-range and two short-range air-to-air missiles (AAMs), but its unrefueled range is less than the SU-27's. With the added flexibility of a two-man crew, the F-14A's AN/AWG-9 weapons control system can detect targets out to 190 miles, track 24, and engage six at long range with its 100-mile-range AIM-54 <I>Phoenix</I> missiles.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Fourteen Navy squadrons are now equipped with F-14As, including two deployed with the Japan-based Seventh Fleet. The F-14A's principal weakness has been its Pratt and Whitney TF-30 turbofan engines, which are prone to stalling during hard maneuvers. This has led to engine failures and many crashes. Consequently, certain combat maneuvers are now restricted until these aircraft are modified with updated control systems. All F-14As are due to be retired from service by 2004. Over 90 F-14Bs, which now equip five Navy squadrons, have been fitted with more powerful and responsive General Electric F110 engines. The Navy also has acquired 56 F-14Ds with the F110 engines and more powerful radar combat systems. Three squadrons are outfitted with the F-14D. The F-14B and D are expected to serve through the next decade. A program to build a successor to the F-14, the A/F-X, was canceled by the Clinton Administration in 1993.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Later in the next decade, as the F-14 is being retired from U.S. Navy inventory, the numerically most important U.S. Navy fighter will be the F/A-18E/F. The Navy expects to purchase over 1,000 of these aircraft by 2015. They are designed to replace the current C/D version of the F/A-18, the F-14, and the long-range ground-attack Grumman A-6 <I>Intruder</I>.<sup>13</sup>  Compared to both versions of the F/A-18, however, the SU-27 has an advantage in unrefueled range and may be more maneuverable due to its more powerful engines and larger wing. The F/A-18E/F is about 25 percent larger than the C/D; has more powerful engines and a longer range because of larger external fuel tanks; and is to be equipped presently with an AN/AGP-73 multi-mode radar, which also equips the most current production model of the F/A-18C. More advanced radar upgrades already are planned for the F/A-18E.<sup>14</sup>  In terms of offensive and defensive electronic systems, the F-18E/F will be superior to the SU-27.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The F-16 also is a multi-role fighter designed for ground-attack as well as air-defense missions. It is the most numerous combat aircraft in the U.S. Air Force, currently numbering over 1,200 aircraft. Forces with the U.S. Pacific Command possess 138 F-16Cs, the major combat aircraft for South Korea. An earlier version, the F-16A, is the most capable combat aircraft in the air forces of Indonesia, Singapore, and Thailand, and soon of Taiwan. Shorter in unrefueled range than the SU-27, the F-16C carries only six medium-range or short-range AAMs. The F-16 is a single-engine aircraft, while the SU-27, F-15, F-14, and F/A-18 are twin-engine aircraft with greater survivability in combat. The F-16 is roughly comparable to the SU-27 in maneuverability; both airframes can be stressed to nine times their weight.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The Northrop F-5E <I>Tiger II</I> currently is the most numerous combat aircraft for Taiwan, South Korea, Thailand, Malaysia, and Indonesia. The F-5E is no match for the SU-27 in maneuverability, range, or weapons load. Several companies offer upgrades for the F-5's radar and combat systems. These upgrades can ease pilot workload and increase search and detection capability, but they cannot alter the F-5's inferior aerodynamic performance. As a consequence, prosperous Asian countries are acquiring new, more capable aircraft like the F-16 and F-18.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>The U.S. Technology Advantage.</b> Compared to the SU-27, all current U.S. combat aircraft benefit from better cockpit design and better avionics. For example, the U.S. practice of placing most combat relevant information on a large Head-Up Display (HUD) which combines the functions of a monitor and a weapons sight, or on large, easy-to-read flat-panel displays on the instrument panel, increases combat potential by allowing pilots to spend more time watching for opposing aircraft than tending instruments. Better U.S. aircraft computers and cockpit displays enable U.S. pilots to evaluate information more quickly and accurately. By contrast, similar Russian systems used in early models of the SU-27 are less advanced. American aircraft also are equipped with better countermeasures against radar and missile threats. These include electronic jamming systems and decoys that use several methods to confuse attacking missiles.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

U.S. Air Force, Navy, and Marine fighters have long benefited from a well-developed system of in-air refueling which extends range or combat patrol time. The U.S. also benefits from advanced airborne warning and control (AWACS) aircraft, such as the E-2C <I>Hawkeye</I> and E-3 <I>Sentry</I>. In addition, the three services employ a range of electronic intelligence aircraft that warn fighters of enemy radar and missile defenses. The Navy's EA-6B is designed to jam enemy radars, while the F-16 HTS, F/A-18, and EA-6B can use anti-radar missiles to destroy enemy air defenses.

<b>THE CHINESE AIR FORCE AND THE CHALLENGE OF THE SU-27</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The acquisition of the SU-27 and its production rights marks a major turn for the Chinese Air Force. Nevertheless, this service is beset with major weaknesses. The foremost is that the PLAAF currently is saddled with over 2,000 aircraft (including MiG-19s, MiG-21s, and TU-16s) of 1950s-era Soviet design comparable to outdated U.S. fighters like the F-100, F-8, and B-47. These aircraft are no match for current U.S. jet fighters. In addition, the Chinese Air Force lacks the capability to refuel its combat aircraft during flight, and this shortens their range. It also is bereft of AWACS aircraft that manage air battles, fire-and-forget long-range air-to-air missiles, anti-radar missiles to attack enemy air defenses, and precision-guided munitions (PGMs) like laser-guided bombs. These systems were critical to U.S. air superiority during the Persian Gulf War.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The PLAAF compares poorly to the USAF and some Asian air forces in areas of training and maintenance. A RAND Corporation study issued last year concludes that Chinese Air Force pilots do not fly as often as their U.S. counterparts.<sup>15</sup>  Chinese pilots typically fly 100 hours a year, while U.S. pilots train more than 200 hours per year. Chinese air combat tactics resemble old Soviet-style tactics that stress tight ground control of aircraft.<sup>16</sup>  PLAAF commanders place a high priority on flight safety, and this reduces pilots' initiative and inhibits the utilization of aircraft to their fullest capabilities. While the PLAAF is beginning to utilize "Aggressor" squadrons which specialize in adversarial combat tactics in an attempt to raise tactical skills proficiency, it remains to be seen whether these new training squadrons will be effective. The PLAAF also faces another severe problem:  a lack of spare parts. One of the reasons for this is that production standards vary between differing aircraft and engine manufacturers, inhibiting interchangability of parts between aircraft and engines of the same type.<sup>17</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

RAND questioned whether China can afford the SU-27 as well as indigenous aircraft programs, pointing to recent reforms that have devalued China's currency, thereby reducing PLA purchasing power.<sup>18</sup>  However, the actual size of China's defense budget is unknown. Official figures typically fail to include all military-related expenditures and earnings from PLA-controlled businesses. For example, while the official 1994 PLA defense budget figure was $6 billion, the Washington-based Defense Budget Project estimates that it could range between $92 billion and $143 billion.<sup>19</sup>  A higher budget such as this increases the possibility that the PLA could afford multiple new aircraft programs.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The RAND study estimated that China would have only 70 SU-27s in the year 2005.<sup>20</sup>  The SU-27 co-production agreement suggests that China has placed a greater emphasis on acquiring higher numbers of this aircraft in addition to its production technology. The PLA appears to want a phased transition to full co-production, preceded by domestic assembly of a large number of aircraft from major components fabricated in Russia. Co-production of the SU-27 will be difficult for the Chinese because this aircraft incorporates technologies the Chinese cannot yet produce. But PLA aircraft manufacturers will benefit from advanced Russian production techniques and from the presence of Russian technicians, who will assist SU-27 assembly and eventual production.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Chinese Air Force Difficulties with the SU-27.</b> Integrating the SU-27 into its inventory will not be easy for the PLAAF. The Chinese Air Force has had difficulty maintaining the SU-27 and was not prepared for its additional cost. Moreover, some runways are not capable of handling this heavier fighter aircraft.<sup>21</sup>  However, the SU-27 is being used in exercises. In August 1995, Chinese SU-27s approached the Senkaku Islands north of Taiwan, which are claimed by China, Japan, and Taiwan. And in March 1996, the SU-27 flew in major military exercises intended to intimidate Taiwan on the eve of its presidential election. The SU-27 possibly will be seen more frequently over the South China Sea, flying from Suixi Air Base in South China. From Wuhu and Suixi Bases, the SU-27 can reach Taiwan, many disputed areas in the South China Sea, and U.S. forces based on Okinawa (see map). Despite early difficulties in tactics and training, as well as enduring PLAAF institutional constraints, it is entirely possible that as more SU-27s enter service, the PLAAF will learn how to exploit this system to its fullest capabilities some time in the next decade.

OTHER TECHNOLOGIES THAT MAY ASSIST CHINA'S AIR FORCE MODERNIZATION

	</b><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Advanced military technology from Russia and Israel plays a major role in China's effort to modernize its military forces. This is especially true for the PLAAF. Russia in particular is viewed by China as a potential source for many systems and technologies that comprise a modern, all-weather, multi-mission air force. Advanced air-to-air missiles, precision-guided munitions, radar aircraft, and electronic countermeasures are all on China's shopping list. For now, Russia appears to be more interested in profit than in any potential threat to its interests arising from sales to China.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Advantage <i>Archer</i>.</b> The SU-27 is equipped with a series of advanced Russian missiles that in some cases exceed or equal U.S. missile capabilities. The PLAAF is the only air force in Asia to possess the Russian R-73 (NATO codename:  AA-11 <i>Archer</i>) air-to-air missile. China is believed to have an early version of the <i>Archer </i>(M1) and is known to have used it against parachute flares during March 1996 exercises near Taiwan. The AA-11 is the first effective "helmet-sighted" air-to-air missile to be employed anywhere. With this missile, a pilot can aim his weapon by turning his head, and does not have to line up his plane with the target, which has been the main practice in aerial combat since World War I. The M1 version can be fired 45 degrees off the aircraft's forward line-of-direction, or off-boresight, to a range of 12.4 miles (see chart).<sup>22</sup>  The M2 version of the AA-11 can be fired up to 60 degrees off-boresight and has a range of 18.6 miles.<sup>23</sup>  In targeting aircraft beyond visual range, the AA-11 can be cued by the <i>Flanker's </i>infrared tracking system.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In the hands of a capable pilot, the <i>Archer </i>conveys a decisive margin for victory. During 1994 air combat exercises between German and U.S. aircraft, MiG-29s of the German Air Force armed with the less capable version of the <i>Archer </i>had a clear advantage over U.S. F-16s armed with <i>Sidewinder</i>.<sup>24</sup>  Even though the F-16 was able to outmaneuver the MiG in 60 percent of the exercise engagements, the MiG already had "fired" its <i>Archer</i>, meaning the F-16 most likely was defeated.<sup>25</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The U.S. is not expected to field a helmet-sighted thrust-vectored AAM for at least six years. The AIM-9M <i>Sidewinder</i>, the most modern U.S. short-range air-to-air missile -- which lacks a helmet sight -- can acquire targets only 27.5 degrees off the forward line-of-sight and has a range of only 4.8 miles. American defense officials assert that the lack of a helmet-sighted missile is compensated for by the 32-mile-range Advanced Medium-Range Air to Air Missile (AMRAAM). This missile, called the AIM-120, is guided by its own radar, allowing the pilot to break aircraft radar contact with the target and begin evasion. This was not the case with earlier U.S. radar-guided missiles. U.S. officials argue that the AIM-120 confers much of the same tactical flexibility as the <i>Archer</i>.<sup>26</sup>  However, the U.S. still has some difficulty in exploiting the long range of the AIM-120. For one thing, it has problems with identifying targets.<sup>27</sup>  Moreover, this missile cannot be used by the F-16A or the F-5E. While U.S. fighters in Asia have the AIM-120, so far only South Korea and Thailand are approved to buy it. Equipped with AIM-120, the F-15, F-14, F-16, and F/A-18 all have a fighting chance against the SU-27. But the Russians also have their AIM-120 equivalent in the AA-12. This missile could be marketed to China in the future, and apparently has been offered for sale to the U.S.<sup>28</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

China also could acquire newer, more advanced Russian missiles and precision-guided munitions. For example, the Kh-17 (NATO codename:  AS-17 <i>Krypton</i>) missile has multiple versions that are designed to attack ships and AWACS radar aircraft at long range. The U.S. Navy is evaluating this missile for possible use as a target to simulate future threats for naval missile defense systems. One version of this missile is credited with a 125-mile range, and all versions are capable of flying at almost three times the speed of sound.<sup>29</sup>  U.S. Naval Intelligence also is concerned about a new 200-mile-range AAM designed to attack AWACS and other long-range radar aircraft.<sup>30</sup>  Russia also produces a series of laser-guided and television-guided bombs that could arm future variants of the SU-27 produced by China.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Russian Technology and China's SU-27s.</b> Russia now plans to market advanced versions of the SU-27 to China, as it already has to India. There are reports that a deal for China to purchase the more advanced SU-30 broke down over financing disagreements.<sup>31</sup>  The SU-30 is a two-seat dedicated attack variant of the SU-27 with more advanced attack systems that allow for delivery of precision-guided munitions.<sup>32</sup>  Moscow and Beijing also may have discussed Chinese co-production of the SU-35.<sup>33</sup>  The SU-35 features a better cockpit display, better missile fire-control systems, and forward horizontal control surfaces that boost maneuverability. According to Lt. General George Muellner, Principal Deputy to the Air Force Assistant Secretary, the SU-35's "missile fire control system is as good or better than the F-15."<sup>34</sup>  Sukhoi unveiled last year a variant of the SU-35 with thrust-vectored engines, called the SU-37, which Russian pilots claim will be "10-times" better in close-in dogfights than unmodified fighters.<sup>35</sup>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>AWACS and Aerial Refueling.</b> A number of reports indicate China also is seeking other "force-multipliers" the U.S. has long utilized, like AWACS and air-refueling capabilities. Russian AWACS aircraft and Israel's <i>Phalcon </i>early-warning aircraft appear to be on Beijing's shopping list.<sup>36</sup>  In a reported $250 million deal with China, Israel will put its <i>Phalcon </i>200-mile-range airborne early warning radar on a Russian Il-76 transport aircraft.<sup>37</sup>  This aircraft may also carry advanced Israeli electronic sensing and intelligence systems. China is reported to have modified up to five of its H-6 bombers to refuel J-8II <i>Finback </i>fighters -- the most advanced fighter China currently produces. This extends the range of the J-8II from 430 to over 630 miles. U.S. intelligence reportedly estimates China may convert up to 20 H-6 bombers into air-to-air refueling aircraft.<sup>38</sup>  China's SU-27s are not modified for air-to-air refueling, but this capability could be acquired later.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

China is using Russian technology to upgrade the J-8II with modern radar and engines which give the aircraft greater combat capability.<sup>39</sup>  An upgraded version of this aircraft, the J-8II M, was test-flown at the end of March.<sup>40</sup> There are about 200 J-8s in the Chinese Naval Air Force and Air Force. 
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

China is co-developing the FC-1 lightweight fighter with Pakistan which also may use a Russian engine radar and avionics, or a European radar.<sup>41</sup>This aircraft may be slightly less maneuverable than the F-16, and China initially may buy 100 copies. The FC-1 also could be marketed as a low-cost successor to aircraft such as the F-5E and Mig-21, which continue to be used widely in less-developed countries.

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<b>Israeli Assistance and China's J-10 Advanced Fighter Program.</b> Israel maintains a quiet but significant military technology relationship with China. Its largest military program with China involves the development of the J-10 advanced fighter aircraft, modeled on Israel's <i>Lavi </i>fighter that was canceled in 1987.<sup>42</sup>  Russian radar and engines also may feature prominently in the J-10 program.<sup>43</sup>  Last year, RAND Corporation analyst Mark Lorell concluded that the J-10 will benefit from the <i>Lavi's </i>"advanced airframe technology, [and] superior avionics.... "<sup>44</sup> China revealed in April a model of the J-10 that was similar to the <i>Lavi</i>. The model also showed the J-10 armed with the PL-10 short-range air-to-air missile, a copy of the Israeli <i>Python </i><i>3 </i>missile. The U.S. Office of Naval Intelligence estimates the J-10 may be more maneuverable than the F/A-18E/F but will carry less sophisticated radar and countermeasures.<sup>45</sup>  The first prototype may fly this year, and China eventually may produce 300 J-10s.<sup>46</sup>  Washington is concerned that U.S.-originated technology from the <i>Lavi </i>has been transferred to China.<sup>47</sup>  Israel is reported to have rebuffed Clinton Administration attempts to end this program.<sup>48</sup>

<b>Could China's SU-27 Go to Sea?</b> Central Military Commission (CMC) Vice President Liu Haquing, a former top PLA Navy commander, believes China needs the ability to dominate the Pacific from Japan down to the Philippines and should be able to fight as far away as Guam.<sup>49</sup>  Acquiring an aircraft carrier to help fulfill this goal appears to be a high PLA priority, and there are reports that at a December meeting of the CMC, President Jaing Zemin endorsed construction of an aircraft carrier as part of the next five-year plan.<sup>50</sup>  However, the cost of a carrier and its attendant defensive and logistic support ships may prove prohibitive for the Chinese Navy. But should China acquire its first aircraft carrier, perhaps in the next decade, the U.S. could face a Chinese sea-borne version of the SU-27. China could follow the example of Russia, which now uses a version of the SU-27 (called the SU-33) as the principal combat aircraft for its sole aircraft carrier, the <I>Admiral Kuznetzov.</I> Unlike the basic version of the SU-27, the SU-33 is equipped for air-to-air refueling, both to receive fuel and to carry a modified fuel tank that can perform in-flight refueling. The SU-33's engines generate enough thrust to allow the use of a ski-jump to get airborne, eliminating the need for complex steam-driven catapults used on U.S. Navy carriers.

<b>MEETING THE CHALLENGE OF CHINA'S SU-27</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

American leadership in Asia rests upon several factors, including a willingness to maintain sufficient military force to deter potential adversaries. In the event Korea is reunified, the U.S. very likely will withdraw ground troops stationed there, leaving the Air Force and the Navy to function as the dominant elements of the U.S. military presence in Asia. The U.S. Pacific Command now relies on about 350 Air Force, Navy, and Marine fighter and attack aircraft deployed in South Korea, Japan, Alaska, and Hawaii. One aircraft carrier, the <I>USS Independence</I>, provides the most flexible component of American airpower in Asia. In March 1996, two carrier battle groups, led by the <i>Independence </i>and the <I>USS Nimitz</I>, were ordered to locations near Taiwan in response to China's threatening military exercises. The U.S. reportedly has decided to halt regular Middle East deployments by the <I>Independence</I> in order to respond to possible scenarios involving North Korea or China.<sup>51</sup>  Such is the importance of U.S. naval power to peace and stability in Asia.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Were it to occur, China's acquisition of large numbers of SU-27s would pose a serious challenge to U.S. air superiority. Since World War II, American military commanders have aimed to establish air superiority in order to win battles on the sea and ground. Although China may not today be able to utilize the SU-27 to its fullest extent, it cannot be assumed that this will continue indefinitely. To sustain deterrence, the U.S. needs to maintain its all-around edge in strategy, tactics, and weapons systems.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In particular, aircraft that are "good enough" or slightly superior to the SU-27 do not provide a sufficient margin of superiority to guarantee U.S. dominance in the air. The U.S. must proceed with plans to field advanced combat aircraft superior to the SU-27. Current and future aircraft must be equipped with an effective helmet-sighted missile to counter the <i>Archer</i>. Failure to do so risks allowing the Asian balance of power to shift dangerously in favor of China. To prevent this from happening, Washington should:<p>

<b>Sustain funding for the F-22A jet fighter.</b><br>
To ensure U.S. air superiority in Asia, the U.S. should proceed with full funding for the Lockheed-Martin F-22A. This aircraft promises better uses of radar-evading stealth technology, engines that can achieve supersonic speeds without using fuel-guzzling afterburners, thrust vectoring that enhances maneuverability at high speeds, and advanced radar and electronic combat systems. It can carry four short-range air-to-air missiles and up to ten AMRAAM missiles and has a combat range comparable to the F-15C. There are suggestions from Pentagon officials that the planned purchase of 442 F-22As may be cut in half due to funding constraints.<sup>52</sup>  This would be a mistake because it would likely reduce the number of F-22As, which are needed to deter potential adversaries. The Air Force is requesting $2 billion for FY 1997 for research and development as part of an expected $70 billion program. This is indeed expensive, but the F-22A is the only U.S. fighter in development that can offer decisive air superiority for U.S. forces.
<p>
<b>Maintain 12 Navy aircraft carrier battle groups.</b><br>
The U.S. Navy needs at least 12 aircraft carrier battle groups in order to sustain peacetime security commitments. These commitments include the maintenance of one carrier battle group with the Seventh Fleet in Japan. However, the Clinton defense budget could force a reduction to eight carrier battle groups by the year 2002. If this occurs, the U.S. may have to deploy its Seventh Fleet carrier to potential crisis areas outside of Asia,<sup>53</sup> in which case carriers would not be available to respond sufficiently to some future Chinese provocation against Taiwan. This would be regarded by Washington's friends and potential adversaries in Asia as a significant reduction in the traditional U.S. commitment to preserve peace in Asia. To deter future potential conflicts in Asia that could damage U.S. economic and military security, the U.S. must have 12 carrier battle groups to sustain deterrence.
<p>
<b>Develop an air-superiority fighter for the Navy.</b><br>
The Clinton Administration should review its 1993 decision to forgo development of a dedicated successor to the Navy's F-14 fighter aircraft. The A/F-X program, canceled in 1993, had attracted proposals from Lockheed to develop a naval variant of the F-22. If U.S. naval task forces are to be superior to all opponents, the Navy will need a fighter with at least the capability of the F-22. While the F/A-18E/F is an impressive aircraft that incorporates advances in air combat and ground-attack systems, it does not present a decisive advance in capability over the SU-27/35 family. The Navy needs the F/A-18E/F to fulfill fighter and ground attack missions. But the Navy also needs an aircraft that will guarantee naval air superiority against the SU-27 and its advanced variants. In the meantime, as the F-14A is cycled out of Navy inventory early in the next decade, it is essential that the Asia-deployed Seventh Fleet receive priority in retaining F-14B/Ds.
<p>
The only other major combat aircraft program in the Navy's future is the Joint Strike Fighter (JSF), which is scheduled to enter service after 2010. But this aircraft also is the next major aircraft program for the Marines and the Air Force. In all, the JSF is intended to replace such diverse aircraft as the A-6, the AV-8 <i>Harrier</i>, Britain's <I>Sea Harrier</I>, the F-14, the F-16, and the F-18. The Air Force wants an F-16 replacement that is inexpensive, while the Navy seeks stealthy long-range strike aircraft. The JSF is not expected to be much larger or much more maneuverable than an F-16, but it will incorporate stealth and advanced combat systems. According to General Muellner, for the Air Force, the JSF would "not be on the leading edge of air supremacy," but would compliment the F-22.<sup>54</sup>  The Navy version of the JSF should pay greater attention to the air-superiority mission, meaning increased range and increased internal air-to-air missile carriage; if it cannot approach the air superiority capabilities of the F-22, the Navy should be directed to begin development of a fighter that provides a dedicated replacement for the F-14.
<p>
<b>Accelerate development of a helmet-sighted missile and make advanced U.S. air-to-air missiles available to U.S. allies.</b><br>
It is critical that the Pentagon be directed to accelerate the development of a helmet-sighted and highly maneuverable short-range AAM. Israel, for example, was able to field its 90-degree off-boresight-capable, helmet-sighted <I>Python 4</I> short-range AAM in about half the time it is expected to take the U.S. to field its helmet-sighted AAM.<sup>55</sup>  A former senior Joint Chiefs of Staff officer was quoted recently as saying that "For the Air Force and Navy not to have a helmet-mounted sight and off-boresight missile is absolutely criminal."<sup>56</sup>  U.S. aircraft and those of Asian allies armed only with <i>Sidewinder </i>AAMs are at a distinct disadvantage when compared with Chinese SU-27s armed with the Russian <i>Archer </i>AAM. When a helmet-sighted missile enters U.S. service, it also should be made available for sale to Asian allies and friends. In the meantime, the U.S. should sell the AIM-120 to allies and friends with compatible aircraft. Specifically, the AIM-120 should be offered to the Republic of China as its F-16s enter service next year.
<p>
<b>Develop advanced versions of the F-15, F-16, and F-18 for allied and friendly Asian air forces.</b><br>
Most countries in Asia, except possibly Japan, will not be able to afford the F-22. The JSF also may prove to be too expensive. Therefore, the U.S. should develop advanced, more affordable versions of the F-16 and the F/A-18E/F for Asian friends and allies. The danger is that unmodified U.S. types could lose markets to newer and very capable European combat aircraft like the French <I>Rafale</I> and the <I>Eurofighter-2000</I>.<sup>57</sup>  Maintaining commonality between U.S. and Asian air forces is an important U.S. interest.
<p>
<b>Ask Russia and Israel to curtail advanced weapons sales to China.</b><br>
Sales of advanced military technology to China do more than strengthen China's military capabilities:  They also constitute a potential threat to regional peace and stability. To Russia, the U.S. should stress that a well-armed China could be less benign and more inclined, for example, to press old territorial claims. To Israel, the U.S. should stress that China might sell advanced aircraft to rogue states like Iran which pose a threat to Israel. Last June, for example, China was suspected of having shipped missile components or technology to Syria.<sup>58</sup>  The U.S. also should enlist its allies and friends in Asia to warn Russia and Israel that by arming China, they are creating a potential threat to peace.


<p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b><P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

For over 50 years, the United States has enjoyed air superiority in Asia. American industry has produced combat aircraft that have been proven superior over Korea, the Taiwan Strait, Vietnam, the Middle East, and the Persian Gulf. With the demise of the Soviet Union, delay in building a fifth-generation fighter to succeed the F-15 and F-14 was justifiable. But should it occur, China's acquisition of a large inventory of SU-27 aircraft would present a major challenge to American air superiority in Asia. This poses the first major post-Cold War challenge to U.S. strategy in Asia, as America's ability to deter conflict in Asia will rely increasingly on air power.
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

To preserve U.S. air superiority and sustain deterrence in Asia in the next century, the U.S. should produce the F-22A jet fighter, field a helmet-sighted air to air missile, and make the AIM-120 advanced air to air missile available to allies and friends like the Republic of China. Equally important, it also is time to re-examine whether an F-14 follow-on must be built if U.S. naval air power is to retain the superiority critical to sustaining the credibility of U.S. naval forces in Asia. Finally, the U.S. should tell Russia and Israel that their sale to China of advanced weapons and technology is helping to create a potential threat to the peace and stability of the Asia region.

Policy Blueprint, The Heritage Foundation, May 1993.)

<P>

     Secretary of Defense Les Aspin on March 25 announced a
comprehensive, "bottom-up" review to determine the nation's post-Cold-
War defense needs. Indeed, the dramatic changes in the geopolitical
landscape over the last four years demand a thorough reassessment of
America's security strategy. However, the Aspin study will not be it.
The outcome of the review was already determined when the Clinton
Administration on February 17 announced its intention to reduce the
Bush Administration's five-year defense budget by more than $120
billion. Aspin's "bottom-up" review, therefore, is a charade. Given
budget cuts of this magnitude, it will be little more than a "top-
down" justification of Clinton's predetermined defense budget.
<P>
     A Flawed Review Process. Nowhere is the gap between rational and
systematic defense planning and the political realities of the Clinton
Administration defense budget more apparent than in assessments of the
conventional force structure. In a June 16 speech at the National
Defense University in Washington, Aspin hinted that the bottom-up
review would establish a conventional force structure based on a "win-
hold-win" strategy. The strategy calls for the military to retain
conventional forces that are large enough and strong enough to handle
two major regional contingencies. In one of the two, however, U.S.
forces would need only to hold defensive positions until the other
conflict was concluded, at which time they would be reinforced.
Specific force structure requirements to execute the strategy were
leaked to the press in conjunction with the speech.
<P>
     Perhaps because of the conceptual problems with the win-hold-win
strategy, Aspin reversed ground in a June 24 speech to flag officers
at Andrews Air Force Base in Maryland and called for a "win-win"
strategy. This strategy calls for conventional forces capable of
conducting offensive operations in two major regional contingencies
simultaneously. But in this instance, no force structure numbers were
provided. Nevertheless, it is prudent to assume that the force
structure needed to support the win-win strategy must be significantly
larger than that leaked in the context of the win-hold-win strategy.
The problem is that the conventional force structure needed even for
the smaller win-hold-win force is unaffordable under the Clinton
budget, and Secretary Aspin has all but admitted so.
<P>
     As Chairman of the House Armed Services Committee, then-
Representative Aspin in March 1992 studied the conventional force
implications of cutting defense budget authority by select amounts.
Aspin compared four options, referred to as Options A, B, C, and D,
with Option A being the lowest budget and the smallest force and
Option D the highest budget and largest force. During the campaign,
Bill Clinton proposed a defense program and budget that resembled
Aspin's relatively muscular Option C proposal. But now the Clinton
Administration proposes a defense budget that doubles the reductions
(for the period covering fiscal years 1993 through 1997) proposed
during the campaign and falls far short of Option C.
<P>

     In fact, the Clinton five-year defense budget, formally released
on April 8, more closely resembles Aspin's Option B. It proposes
cutting $176 billion in budget authority from the 1992 baseline, with
a target of $246 billion in budget authority for fiscal 1997. Option B
projects cutting $187 billion in budget authority from the 1992
baseline during the same period. It, too, has a fiscal 1997 target
figure for defense budget authority of $246 billion. 
<P>
     The Force Structure Problem. A comparison of the conventional
force structure required to execute the win-hold-win strategy and the
Option B force structure, which Aspin's analysis indicates is all the
Clinton budget can buy, reveals the scope of the Administration's
problem. Aspin's subsequent assertion that the armed forces should
execute a win-win strategy implies the need for an even larger force
than required by the original win-hold-win strategy. Thus, Aspin's new
strategy only enlarges the Administration's affordability gap. 
<P>
     Adding to the existing budget shortfall problem, Aspin is now
hinting that in order to meet outlay targets established by the
Clinton budget he will be forced to reduce 1994 budget authority by up
to $20 billion more than even the current budget allows. This could
mean reducing defense budget authority in fiscal 1994 by almost $30
billion, or over 10 percent, from the current 1993 level. And with
inflation factored in, the result could be a fiscal 1994 figure that
is 12 percent below the fiscal 1993 level.
<P>
     A budget reduction of this scope has enormous implications for
defense. Whereas the existing Clinton budget anticipates reducing
defense budget authority from $273 billion to $246 billion over a
five-year period, the adjustment could result in dropping to below
$246 billion in a single year. Instead of reducing the defense budget
over four years, a gradual reduction consistent with his campaign
pledges, Clinton actually may force a nearly $30 billion cut in a
single year. This would require cancellation of major weapons systems
and have an immediate impact on America's defense readiness.
<P>
     Aspin needs to end this charade. He can do so by declaring the
Clinton defense budget proposal, particularly for the fiscal years
beyond 1994, null and void. He should then establish a firm request
for fiscal 1994 and initiate an assessment of U.S. defense
requirements based not on predetermined budget guidelines, but on what
is needed to defend American interests against specific threats. He
should instruct the review committee to establish force structure
requirements outside the confines of existing budget directives and
pledge to support a defense budget request in the future that will
fund the force structure recommended by the review. Once this is done,
the nation will have a real bottom-up review, and not a top-down,
budget-driven charade.

<P>

      When Bill Clinton's budget figures for his February 17 State of
the Union Address were released by the White House, they showed a far
larger reduction in the defense budget than the $60 billion he
proposed during the presidential campaign. Clinton now wants to slash
the defense budget by over $120 billion between fiscal years 1993 and
1997. (This estimate is based on the comparison of the Clinton
Administration's current request for fiscal years 1994 through 1997
with the Bush Administration's fiscal 1993 requested level.  As such,
the congressional reduction of $6.5 billion enacted last year for
fiscal 1993 is applied to the Clinton total.) This doubling of the
defense cut is more than another broken campaign promise. It will mean
that America's national security will depend on good luck. With
Clinton's proposed defense budget, the U.S. cannot field a military
force capable of countering the many threats to American security.
<P>
      Notwithstanding the collapse of the Soviet Union, the threats
are indeed many. Nuclear weapons and missiles are proliferating
throughout the world. Democracy could break down in Russia, producing
an anti-American nationalist regime bent on restoring the Russian
Empire. Iraq and Iran endanger not only Western oil supplies but the
security and stability of the Persian Gulf. The list could go on. The
Cold War may be over, but as the Persian Gulf War demonstrated,
America must be able to fight and win wars in regions where her vital
interests are at stake.
<P>
      The money the nation spends on defense is in many ways analogous
to that which American families spend on insurance. Like an insurance
policy, a sound defense policy is predicated on the assumption that
things can go wrong, that accidents can happen, and that outlaws can
inflict harm. While some families are comfortable with the increased
risks assumed by not purchasing adequate insurance, prudent ones
insure themselves against these risks. If calamity occurs, the unlucky
ones face financial ruin. Likewise, if America's luck holds, she may
survive Clinton's defense cuts. But if America is not lucky, and the
many potential threats become a reality, the result will be far worse
than financial ruin -- it could be nationaldisaster.
<P>
      Threats to America's Security Have Changed, But Not Disappeared.
The first step in buying insurance is to obtain a clear understanding
of the threats one faces, including health problems, accidents, or
crime. The same is true of national security. The threats America
faces today are clearly different from those of the Cold War. The
primary threat of that era was an expansionist Soviet Union. This
overarching threat has all but disappeared.
<P>
      But new threats to U.S. security have emerged in the wake of the
collapsing Soviet Union. For example, the Soviet Union's huge nuclear
arsenal still exists and the risk of an accidental or unauthorized
launch has increased. Moreover, long-range missile technology is
proliferating. The U.S. likely will face a number of countries armed
with long-range nuclear missiles within ten years, if not sooner.
<P>
      Likewise, Russia's appetite for conducting proxy wars in the
Third World has all but disappeared. But regional conflicts are still
very much a possibility in the post-Cold-War world. Regional bullies
such as Iran, Iraq, and North Korea are still poised to exploit any
weakness to achieve regional dominance. And Russia or China could turn
belligerent and threaten regional stability in Europe and Asia.
<P>
      After the long struggle of the Cold War, the American people may
be tempted to believe that the world is now safe. But the bitter
experience of the military demobilizations after World War I and World
War II -- whereby America became dangerously weak after great military
victories -- should hold such temptations in check. The world is still
a dangerous place, and there is no substitute for vigilance and
preparedness.
<P>
      Clinton's defense cuts come on the heels of eight straight years
of declining defense budgets. This year's defense budget authority --
the amount of money the U.S. obligates for defense purposes -- is 30
percent lower than in the 1985 budget. Moreover, defense outlays as a
percentage of the total federal budget will be 5 percent less this
fiscal year than during the mid-1980s. The Clinton Administration is
accelerating this alarming decline. In fiscal year 1991, the defense
budget was falling 2 percent every year. This year, the average real
decline exceeded 3.5 percent. Clinton's annual defense reductions
could easily exceed an average of 4 percent per year in real terms if
optimistic projections about inflation do not hold up. The result: by
1997 defense outlays will constitute less than 15 percent of all
federal outlays, which is 10 percentage points below what it was in
1985. 
<P>
      The Emerging Gap Between Ends and Means. Clinton's proposed
defense reductions will make it impossible to fulfill America's global
military commitments. The first responsibility of a nation is to
defend its territory against attack, whether purposeful or accidental.
With serious questions now arising about proper control over the
nuclear arsenal of the former Soviet Union, plus the proliferation of
missile technology to other countries, the U.S. needs to deploy anti-
missile defenses. But the Clinton Administration has proposed an
almost 40 percent cut in the fiscal 1994 Strategic Defense Initiative
(SDI) budget. Cuts of this magnitude are certain to cripple this
program for developing and fielding anti-missile defenses.
<P>
      The U.S. maintains commitments that require its Navy to patrol
the Indian Ocean, the Mediterranean Sea, and the Pacific Ocean. If
Clinton gets his defense budget, the Navy will shrink to some 300
ships, with fewer than the ten aircraft carriers the President has
promised. The Navy cannot maintain continuous patrols in these three
areas with so few ships. But Navy personnel should be forewarned. If
crises arise, the Clinton Administration will try to fulfill its
responsibilities by adopting backbreaking nine- and ten-month
deployments. Normally most deployments are about six months long.
<P>
      If the U.S. were to face two regional crises simultaneously,
American forces would not be up to the task. Iraq could several years
hence still be defying U.N. Security Council resolutions in ways that
could require air strikes or constant patrols of the Persian Gulf and
Mediterranean Sea. Moreover, North Korea in a last desperate effort to
gain control of South Korea could launch an attack. With the U.S.
military shrunken by Clinton cuts, it could not respond to these two
crises at the same time. It would be short of the ships, personnel,
and equipment needed to perform its missions.
<P>
      Conducting and completing combat operations is only the most
visible purpose of the U.S. military. Its capabilities and presence
pay more modest dividends every day by fostering regional stability
and reducing the risk of conflict. U.S. military strength and resolve
have served to assure German and Japanese security since the end of
World War II. As such, neither country has felt obliged to rearm. But
how long can the U.S. proceed along its current path of disarmament
before Germany or Japan concludes that America is unable to meets its
security commitments? A militarily strong Germany or Japan undoubtedly
will foster regional suspicions in Europe and Asia. The cost to the
U.S. of addressing the regional instabilities fostered by a rearmed
Japan or Germany would be far higher than making more modest
investments now, which are required to avoid such an outcome.
<P>
      Bill Clinton has inherited a strong military that is America's
insurance policy against calamity. But Clinton's defense budget shows
a willingness to weaken this policy. His defense budget cuts will
leave America unable to protect its interests and fulfill its global
commitments. Lacking proper defense insurance, America will have to
depend increasingly on good luck in international affairs. But as
history shows, protecting America's security in a dangerous world
requires more than hope and a prayer. In fact, it requires a good
insurance policy. It requires a military that prevents an attack on
the national interest from becoming a national disaster.

INTRODUCTION
<P>
     Charges that the Congress is unresponsive, arrogant, and ultimately
ineffective have been an increasingly significant political issue for the
past decade. Now that the 1994 elections have changed partisan control of
Congress and delivered a clear reform mandate, the new leadership of the
House of Representatives has assembled a package of rules changes
designed to make that body more accountable and more effective. These
proposals, to be approved on the first day of the 104th Congress, January
4, 1995, include provisions to reduce congressional bureaucracy, to make
voting and budget procedures more fair and open, to encourage a more
deliberative and accountable legislative process, and to subject Congress to
most laws now applied to the private sector. These are large and important
first steps toward making Congress more responsive to American voters and,
in the process, restoring public confidence in that institution. As historic
as they are, these changes should mark only the beginning of continuing
congressional reform efforts, including the ultimate adoption of term limits.
  <P>   For four decades, the House of Representatives was under the control
of one party. During that period, House procedures became increasingly
arbitrary and secretive. The House's internal management grew sloppy and
bred corruption. Committee-based fief- doms were dominated by special
interests, and committees often were unable or unwilling to produce
legislation responsive to broad public desires. Congressional Republicans
increasingly criticized these developments, calling for a more streamlined,
responsive, and equitable legislative process.  In the end, voters felt
alienated from their elected officials, and Congress's approval rating
plummeted. The new House rules package largely achieves the goals of the
institution's critics, with scores of minor and major changes in House rules
designed to:<P>
Improve deliberation by banning proxy (absentee) voting in committees,
ensuring minority rights in the amendment process, and requiring fuller
reporting on spending bills.<P>
Streamline the legislative process by cutting the number of committees and
subcommittees, abolishing joint referrals of legislation, and slashing
committee staff.<P>
Promote accountability by requiring that committee meetings be open to
the public and to the broadcast media, requiring roll call votes on major
legislation, prohibiting changes in debate transcripts, and conducting a
comprehensive audit of House finances.<P>
Increase responsiveness by imposing term limits on the Speaker and
committee chairmen and providing for consideration of a measure to apply
federal laws to Congress as the first legislative vote in the 104th Congress.
   <P>  The rules changes prepared for the first day of the new House
session include numerous other provisions designed to help achieve these
four goals, which the new majority also promises to pursue in its day-to-day
administration of the House by, for instance, making legislation and
background information quickly available to the public electronically on the
Internet.
<P>     After the first day, this new, more open House of Representatives
should seek further improvements in the legislative process, including deeper
cuts in congressional staff, spending, and free mail, reductions in
congressional support agencies (requiring Senate cooperation), budget
process reforms, and term limits.
 <P>    

FILLING THE REFORM VACUUM
 <P>    Public approval of Congress has been declining for over a decade,
fueled initially by a consensus that legislators were failing to act on 
the nation's problems. Voter animus was heightened by a series of scandals
which symbolized the degree to which Congress had become self-serving
and detached from the concerns of average Americans. At the same time,
public awareness of procedural abuses in Congress was increasing, fueling
grassroots movements for limits on the number of terms that Members of
Congress could serve. Beginning in 1990, term limits were approved in
every state that held a vote on them. In 1992, a record-setting class of
freshmen Representatives was elected on a wave of reform sentiment. By
1993 an obscure House procedure known as the discharge petition became
the object of a talk radio-spawned mass movement to open up the workings
of Congress.
<P>     Despite these warning signs, leaders of the 103rd Congress took little
or no action to improve the institution, gambling that the public would lose
interest in the issue. In a meeting with a dozen reform-minded freshman
Democrats shortly after the 1992 elections, then-Speaker of the House Tom
Foley argued that nobody would be concerned about congressional reform
by the time of the 1994 elections. As a result of leadership pressure, the
103rd Congress failed to change such institutional embarrassments as
deceptive budgeting, an overgrown staff and committee system, entrenched
leadership structures, proxy voting, secret committee meetings, and near-
dictatorial powers exercised by committee chairmen. Foley's prediction that
the public would lose interest was wrong. Voters recognized that these
congressional abuses had become threats to representative self-government,
and their conviction was a significant factor in the revolutionary election
results of 1994.
 <P>    The Republicans' Contract With America includes term limits and
eight changes in House rules which the candidates promised would be
enacted on the first day of the 104th Congress. Since the election,
Republicans have assembled a rules package which fulfills those promises
and adds several provisions designed to produce a more efficient, open, and
fair legislative process. By passing this proposed new rules package, the
House will accomplish more reforms in one day than the previous
Congresses have in twenty years. These historic changes should not be the
end of the reform process, however. In the coming months Congress should
examine unfair incumbent electoral advantages such as the franking (free
mailing) privilege and large personal staffs, and sharply reduce staffing in
support agencies (possibly taking advantage of the opportunity to sell one
of its office buildings). It also should consider additional truth-in-voting
reforms such as lengthier review periods for legislation, formal restrictions
on closed rules (which prohibit or limit amendments on the House floor),
and application of the Freedom of Information Act to Congress.
  <P>   

CONTRACT REFORMS
  <P>   The reforms included in the Contract With America will be offered
as eight separate resolutions, allowing for a separate debate and vote on
each.<P>
Staff Cuts and Committee Reforms. The new rules package will eliminate
three House committees -- Post Office and Civil Service, District of
Columbia, and Merchant Marine and Fisheries -- and 25 subcommittees.
  <P>   Congressional committees and subcommittees have grown
enormously. Congress's 1947 reorganization, which cut the number of
committees and subcommittees to under 200, was undone by rapid
committee and subcommittee growth in the 1970s. This expansion nearly
doubled the number of committees and subcommittees; their total did not
fall significantly under 300 until the early 1990s.
<P> Growth in committees and staff has ensured that Congressmen will be
removed from policy choices and hindered from passing legislation, since
a larger committee structure subjects bills to redundant scrutiny and more
special-interest group influence. The concomitant larger number of
committee assignments sometimes has forced members to neglect some of
their committee duties and thus devalued the importance of committee work
and the deliberation that is supposed to take place there. Reducing the
number of panels will make Congress better able to focus on legislative
priorities.
  <P>   The committee reform provision also will shrink House committee
staff by one-third. House committee staff has grown almost twelvefold
since World War II, with the most dramatic increases again occurring in the
1970s. The growth rate of House committee staff has far outpaced the
substantial growth in Senate committee staff as well as growth in the
personal staff in either House -- in the last two decades alone, committee
staffs in the House of Representatives have grown by 158 percent. Congress
is the most heavily staffed legislature in the world by a factor of five;
with nearly 40,000 employees, it has grown over twice as fast as the entire
federal government since World War II. 
 <P>    Staff cuts are worthwhile for a number of reasons, not the least of
which is the opportunity for savings from the nearly $2.3 billion yearly
expense of the institution. Furthermore, experience shows that the larger the
congressional staff, the more likely it is to pursue independent agendas,
usurping decisions properly left to democratically elected representatives.
Former Senator Walter Mondale (D-MN) described the pressures on an
overstaffed legislator: "I felt sorry for them, so I would try to work with
them. Pretty soon I was working for them." A larger legislative staff eager
to improve the country from Washington, D.C., also creates pressure for the
expansion of the federal government.
<P>
Truth in Budgeting.
<P> The second of the Contract provisions will require committees to compare
new spending recommendations to the provisions of current law. The new
leadership is also committed to additional truth-in-budgeting reforms,
including reform of the "current services baseline," but cannot accomplish
them on the first day in session since they will require changes in statutes
or in procedures affecting both Houses of Congress.
Term Limits for Committee Chairmen.
<P>  House committee chairmen will be prohibited from serving more than
three consecutive Congresses (six years). Limitation of tenure for committee
chairmen begins to address some of the concerns of advocates of full-scale
legislative term limits. A central problem of previous Congresses has been
that the committee chairmen, who set Congress's agenda, had spent decades
in office. In the 103rd Congress, for example, two of the House's three most
powerful committees (Ways and Means and Energy and Commerce) were
chaired by Congressmen who had held the chair for over a decade, while the
third (Appropriations) had just been vacated by a Congressman who had
held it since the 1970s. Over 90 percent of House committees were chaired
by Members who had spent at least ten terms in office. Although this figure
will drop to 55 percent in the 104th Congress -- partly because of the switch
in party control -- the dangers of concentrated power and of committee
chairmen who are resistant to new ideas remain.
<P>     Term limits for committee chairmen would increase the likelihood
of their openness to new perspectives. They would also reduce opportunities
for wasteful, district- and reelection-oriented federal spending aimed at
favored constituents and special interest groups. Voters would also have less
reason to evaluate incumbents running for reelection on the basis of
seniority, and thus more reason to take into account candidates' views on
the issues of the day.
<P>
Elimination of Proxy Voting.
<P> Elimination of the practice of allowing absent members of a committee to
loan their votes to other members is a critical step to ensure fairness and to
improve committee deliberation. Although House Rules have strictly
prohibited one Member of Congress from casting votes for another on the
House floor (indeed, ethics reprimands have been triggered by this rule's
violation), proxy voting was the norm in most committees in the 103rd
Congress. In 1993, for example, the House Committees on the Judiciary,
Public Works and Transportation, and Energy and Commerce used proxies
on every single legislative vote. 
 <P>    Historically, proxy voting allowed the majority party leadership to
extend its control over committee outcomes by scheduling multiple,
contemporaneous committee and subcommittee meetings. Committee
chairmen, who determine their committee's entire legislative agenda, could
postpone votes on controversial matters until they controlled sufficient proxy
votes to ensure that the vote would go their way. Proxy voting also
promoted committee absenteeism by ensuring that legislators who skipped
meetings would retain their ability to cast votes in absentia. It allowed
legislators to abandon their deliberative responsibilities by voting for or
against legislation without hearing any discussion or argument on its merits.
Abolishing proxy voting will reduce the power of committee chairmen and
foster deliberation by forcing Congressmen to show up for work in
committees if they want their votes to count.
<P>     The additional rules reforms to follow the eight Contract provisions
include four related changes. "Rolling quorums" (allowing Congressmen to
stick their heads inside a meeting room briefly and thus meet the minimum
attendance requirement for a committee to do business) will be prohibited,
and most committees would be barred from meeting when the House is in
session. Most Members will be restricted to two full committee and four
subcommittee assignments, preventing the inflation and devaluation of
committee assignments. Finally, joint referral of a bill to two or more
committees will be abolished. Like the proxy ban, these provisions will
emphasize the importance of members actually working on legislation in
House committees, increasing committees' accountability while improving
their product. 
<P>
Open Meetings.
<P> The new rules package will also ensure public access to committee
meetings. In previous Congresses, committees frequently closed their doors
to the press and public, a step the panels could take for nearly any reason.
In fact, the two House committees that most often operated in secret --
Appropriations and Ways and Means -- were the bodies making
controversial choices about federal taxation and spending.
  <P>   Former Speaker Foley, who helped write the committee-closing rules
roughly two decades ago, once suggested that secret meetings make for
better decisions. "I think sometimes there is a feeling that there is better
discussion, less inhibited, more free and full discussion... in closed
session." But Foley's suggestion that public accountability poisons
deliberation runs counter to American ideals of republican self-government,
in which citizens are expected to pass judgment on the actions of the
lawmakers who represent them. In fact, past examples strongly suggest that
the public interest would have been served by increased openness and
disclosure. For instance, the Ways and Means Committee prevented the
public from observing discussions of the 1988 catastrophic illness
legislation. Just months later, as the public began to understand the
consequences of the law, it was repealed. Greater openness in government
might have prevented that legislative disaster.
 <P>    The new rules will allow committees to close meetings only if a
public session would endanger national security, compromise law
enforcement, or defame or incriminate individuals. Further, broadcast media
would be permitted to cover any open hearing or meeting (currently, media
coverage is subject to a vote of approval). Related additions to these
Contract provisions include requirements that committees publish recorded
committee votes in their reports (most voting records are now available only
by personal journeys to committee offices) and that committee transcripts
could not be altered other than for minor grammatical changes.
<P>
Making Tax Hikes More Difficult.
<P>The new rules package would require a three-fifths vote of the House to
pass any income tax rate increase and prohibit retroactive taxation of
income. Among Washington commentators the 60 percent rule has been
particularly controversial, with claims that the new rule is anti-democratic
or even unconstitutional. Behind the heated rhetoric of Beltway
commentators is the conviction that new tax increases are needed. The
supermajority requirement is quite similar to restrictions voters have
imposed on numerous state legislators. Among the most beneficial aspects
of the 60 percent tax rule is that any future Congress desiring to raise taxes
would have to alter or waive the rule, providing a warning sign of a
potential tax boost. The provision also balances the burden of a 1990 budget
law which effectively requires a 60 percent vote in the Senate to cut taxes
(unless the reductions are offset by increases in other taxes or cuts in
entitlement spending).
<P>
Authorization of House Audit.
<P> The seventh Contract-related rules change will authorize a comprehensive
audit of House records, assets, and facilities by an independent accounting
firm. Some House accounts have been audited sporadically by the General
Accounting Office, an internal congressional agency. Despite the fact that
one such audit uncovered the House Bank scandal, most House accounts
have not been examined regularly, and some may have never been reviewed
by an independent examiner. This audit will be the first complete accounting
of the House's financial status ever made available to the public.
<P>
Applying Federal Laws to Congress.
 <P>The last of the Contract reforms is a rule paving the way for the first
legislative action of the new House -- consideration of the Congressional
Accountability Act (CAA). This measure has both substantive and symbolic
importance. Passage of the CAA will underscore the principle that no
American should be immune from the law or receive special treatment in its
application. The bill also will encourage legislators to continue to review the
burdens that federal laws place upon American citizens and ensure that the
benefits they bring exceed their attendant costs. The laws which would be
applied to Congress include the Civil Rights Act, the Americans With
Disabilities Act, the National Labor Relations Act, the Occupational Safety
and Health Act, the Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act, and
the Family and Medical Leave Act.
  <P>   The House passed a version of the Congressional Accountability Act
near the end of the 103rd Congress, but the measure died because the Senate
failed to consider it. As a stopgap solution the House extended coverage of
the specified laws to itself by an internal rules change in September of 1994,
but a statute rather than a House rule is necessary to grant congressional
employees review rights in federal court. This year the Senate appears
poised to act on the Accountability Act early in the session, giving it very
good prospects for passage.
  <P>   The major remaining flaw in the current version of the
Accountability Act is the exclusion of the Freedom of Information Act
(FOIA) from the list of covered laws. The FOIA does not apply to the
private sector because it is intended to give the public access to government
information. Excluding FOIA can only give the appearance that Congress
thinks it has something to hide, and runs counter to the openness in
government principles infused in most other House reforms. A joint House-
Senate group apparently will study application of FOIA to Congress, though
without a promise of action.
<P>
ADDITIONAL FIRST-DAY HOUSE RULES REFORMS
  <P>   The new Republican majority in the House will go beyond reforms
promised in the Contract With America with a further package of rules
changes which will also be adopted during the House's first meeting on
January 4. These reforms are fully consistent with those offered in the
Contract, further advancing principles of fairness and accountability in
House procedures. The most significant of these are term limits for the
House Speaker, more equitable procedures governing special rules used for
significant legislation, and a more open appropriations process.
<P>
Ending the Emergency Spending Loophole and Other Appropriations
Reforms.
<P> The new rules package will close a loophole that enabled legislators to stuff
pork into emergency spending bills. Because emergency relief bills are not
subject to overall spending limits, they have been abused to advance
programs which could not be justified in the regular legislative process. For
instance, the $6.2 billion that President Clinton requested for earthquake
relief in 1993 ballooned into an $11 billion federal spending spree by the
time Congress had finished adding such extraneous items as federal
employee pay raises and funding for a New York train station. Although the
House in the 103rd Congress passed legislation banning such budgetary
sleight of hand, the Senate failed to take action on the measure. Passage of
this reform through House rules will eradicate this problem in the House
even without Senate action.
<P>     Several other changes in the appropriations process will grant rank-
and-file Members more say in spending decisions. Members will be
permitted to offer "en bloc" amendments to transfer appropriations money
from one program to another and to offer limitation amendments that
prohibit federal funds from being used for specific purposes. En bloc
amendments currently are not allowed, and limitation amendments are
allowed only if sponsors can first defeat a procedural motion. 
  <P>   New rules would also require appropriators to identify projects that
are not authorized (as is normally required). This step will both draw
attention to authorizing committees which are failing to perform their job
and to appropriators who are too eager to do it for them. For instance, no
foreign aid bill has been authorized for the last eight years, which has left
all decisions in that area entirely in the hands of appropriators.
<P>
Greater Specificity About Rules Waivers.
<P> One particularly egregious abuse of House procedures has been the practice
of the blanket rules waiver, which authorizes departure from all House rules.
Blanket waivers have enabled the majority party leadership to force
immediate votes on lengthy bills while avoiding questions about what
particular rule needed to be avoided, what part of the bill required special
treatment, and what the departure from standard procedure would
accomplish. For instance, when Rep. Jack Brooks (D-TX) came before the
Rules Committee to request a blanket waiver on the 103rd Congress's crime
bill, he was asked by Rep. David Dreier (R-CA) what aspects of the
gargantuan legislation needed waivers. "I don't know," Brooks responded,
"and I wouldn't tell you if I did!" Among the items Brooks was hiding was
a large grant to a university in his own district. The new waiver restrictions
would require the Rules Committee to specify "to the maximum extent
possible" any departure from standard House Rules, giving legislators who
opposed bending the rules a road map to focus their criticisms far more
sharply.
<P>
Minority Rights to Offer Amendments.
<P> Many House Republican complaints over the last decades have centered
around the fact that they have not been allowed to contribute to the
legislative process. This situation has been exacerbated by historically large
proportions of amendment-limiting rules. Too often majority party leaders
refused to allow the minority party any role (Former Speaker Tip O'Neill
is reported to have said during his tenure that "Republicans are just going
to have to get it through their heads that they are not going to write
legislation!"). Republicans have pledged to adhere to their own calls for
fairness as a majority party by:<P>
Guaranteeing in House rules the minority's right to offer at least one
amendment to every piece of legislation in the form of a "motion to
recommit with instructions," and<P>
Pledging that at least three-quarters of House rules will be open to all
amendments (reversing the nearly three-quarters closed ratio recorded by
Democrats in the last Congress).
<P>
Honest Housekeeping. Several new rules will provide better information to
the public, including:
<P>
Requiring recorded votes on appropriations, tax, and budget bills.
Previously, such legislation was occasionally passed by voice vote, which
denied constituents information on Congressmen's policy choices.
Preventing revision of the Congressional Record. In previous Congresses,
Members were able to hide mistakes or embarrassing statements they uttered
on the House floor by submitting corrections to Record compilers. Such
rewriting of history, which allowed Congressmen to appear in the best
possible light in the Record, would be disallowed by the new rules.
Providing more timely information on the identity of Members signing
discharge petitions (a method of bypassing recalcitrant committees).
Providing House documents and records to the public via the Internet or by
other electronic means (a step the new leadership has pledged which does
not need a rules change).
<P>
Abolition of Legislative Service Organizations (LSOs).
<P>
 There are currently 140 special interest congressional caucuses: of these, 28
have been permitted to be LSOs. This status permits groups to have office
space, access to House equipment and services, and funding through
Members' clerk-hire accounts. Unfortunately, LSO spending was poorly
controlled, allowing spending on items prohibited under normal rules. Items
billed to LSOs in the past include $2,646 worth of glass sculptures used for
gifts, $4,000 for pastries, a $9,000 reception, and over $10,000 in one year
for a petty cash fund -- with no receipts. Over one-fifth of the $35 million
spent by LSOs in the past decade remains unaccounted for. Not only did
LSOs occupy scarce congressional offices, they contributed to policy
fragmentation and client-based approaches to public policy, often acting as
official proxies for outside special interest groups.
   <P>  The new rules abolish LSOs, which could save a significant portion
of the $5 million yearly that they cost. Because LSO funds came from
individual congressional accounts, which are not addressed in the first-day
rules changes, actual savings will depend on subsequent action by Congress.
<P>
 Abolition of Commemorative Legislation.
<P> 
The new rules package would ban commemorative legislation such as
National Dairy Goat Awareness Week and National Tap Dancing Day.
Although legislation that honors certain groups or activities is appreciated
by the beneficiaries, such activity diverts congressional attention from more
important matters.
<P>
Abolition of Delegate Voting.<P>
 In the 103rd Congress, the majority congressional leadership awarded the
five delegates from the District of Columbia and U.S. Territories the right
to vote on the House floor in most instances. Republicans opposed this
measure, arguing that the delegates neither represented citizens of the states
(as specified in the Constitution) nor, for the most part, paid federal taxes.
The new rules package would eliminate this controversy by restricting the
right to vote on the House floor to those representatives of (in the
Constitution's words) "the People of the Several States."
<P>
Term Limits for the Speaker.<P>
 Reforms in the committee system and other changes in House rules have
the effect of concentrating more power in the hands of the Speaker. While
most observers agree that centralization was needed, many Congressmen
also feared that concentrating power for too long in the hands of any one
person might lead to abuses similar to those being combatted by these same
rules changes. In response to these concerns, incoming Speaker Newt
Gingrich has agreed to support a House rule limiting his own tenure (and
that of his successors) to four terms (eight years). As with term limits on
committee chairmen, or on Congress as a whole, this reform strikes an
appropriate balance between the powers necessary to govern a great nation
and the danger of leaving such power in the hands of any one official for
too long.
<P>
RULES REFORMS BEYOND JANUARY 4
  <P>   Following the sweeping rules changes on the first day of its session,
the House should not and likely will not abandon further reform efforts.
Many needed reforms will require the cooperation of the Senate, the passage
of legislation, or simply more study and consideration than was possible in
the two months between election day and the opening of the new Congress.
Among the most important of these reform areas are:
<P>
Additional Staff and Budget Cuts.
<P> House Republicans considered but postponed a proposal to reduce the
number of employees that each Representative is permitted to hire. Over 40
percent of personal office employees are devoted to casework or essentially
political functions. While Congressmen should remain sensitive to special
problems of constituents, most casework is on routine matters such as
pensions, entitlement benefits and passports. These problems could be better
addressed through nonpartisan ombudsmen, for example, leaving
Congressmen more time to address broader problems, and leaving fewer
staffers available for private electoral purposes. For instance, hundreds of
staffers currently spend the bulk of their workday writing and sending
hundreds of millions of franked letters yearly, which serve as supplementary
quasi-campaign mailings for incumbents seeking reelection. The "volunteer"
campaign work performed by many congressional staffers sometimes
approaches being a sub rosa condition of hire and almost certainly
contributes to the record incumbent reelection rates of over 90 percent that
House Members have seen on average over the last two decades. Congress
should also reduce the franking budget and consider further restrictions on
pre-election mailings. Finally, the House and Senate should work together
to reduce staffing in the bloated congressional support agencies, particularly
the General Accounting Office. Matching the one-third reductions in House
committee staffing is a realistic goal for the support agencies. Both staff and
franking are likely to be addressed this spring in the congressional
appropriations process.
<P>
Ending Baseline Budgeting.
<P> 
The new rules package requires committees to compare proposed spending
to actual current spending levels. However, without further changes, the
overall federal budget process will still use "baseline budgeting," which
compares proposed spending to imaginary totals based on actual spending,
inflation, and demographic and economic factors. This system has permitted
Congress to slip disguised spending increases into budgets without taking
responsibility for doing so. The Medicare baseline, for instance, typically
calls for yearly increases of 12 percent to 13 percent, double or triple the
rate of inflation.
   <P>  As Texas Democratic Representative Charles Stenholm has noted,
baseline budgeting "creates a bias to increase spending." The new rules
package would address this problem in the case of individual bills, but
Congress should also change the Budget Act so that the entire budget
process operates on the same principle. The House passed baseline reform
legislation last year which died in the Senate. Early House action this year
would vastly improve prospects in the Senate, where new leaders may be
more favorable to this change.
<P>
TRUTH IN VOTING
<P>     In the 103rd Congress, Representative Mike Crapo (R-ID) introduced
the Truth in Voting Act, a package of rules reforms designed to make the
House's legislative process more open, understandable, and accountable.
Roughly half of the dozen truth-in-voting reforms in Crapo's bill are
included in the House's new rules package. The balance of Crapo's truth-in-
voting reforms, however, are worthwhile.
<P>
Establish a "deficit lockbox" for spending cuts.
<P> Although Members of Congress love to trumpet their votes in favor of
politically popular spending cuts, the implied benefit of these cuts -- that
they will save money or reduce the deficit -- is almost always nonexistent.
A House vote to cut spending simply cedes control of the funds in question
back to the appropriations conference committee that originally spent the
money. That committee can simply restore the cut spending or reallocate the
money to another pet program; either of these options destroys the savings
aimed at by budget-cutters. A lock box would allow lawmakers to designate
spending cuts for deficit reduction.
<P>
Require a three-fifths majority to waive rules.
<P> Although incoming Rules Committee Chairman Gerald Solomon (R-NY)
has pledged to make three-quarters of the legislation the House considers
open to amendment, requiring a supermajority vote to block further
legislative improvements would provide a better guarantee of minority rights
in the amendment process. The House could preserve the right of the
majority to force action by specifying conditions (such as time limits or pre-
publication requirements) which could be adopted by a simple majority vote,
while requiring a higher threshold for conditions which might shut out
minority voices or rush legislation unreasonably.
<P>
Eliminate House rules that make procedural tricks possible.
<P> Among the rules abuses targeted by Crapo's Truth in Voting bill are "self-
executing rules" which cloak substantive provisions in procedural votes. In
the past, the House has made policy through procedural votes on such
disparate matters as aid to the Contras, congressional pay, changes in deficit
targets, and endorsement of President Clinton's policies on homosexuals in
the military. Perhaps the most disturbing example is a permanent self-
executing provision, House Rule XLIX, also known as the "Gephardt Rule"
which permits continual increases in the federal debt limit, in line with
annual budget resolutions, without the embarrassment of voting to hike it.
Crapo would also prohibit "king-of-the-hill" rules which permit Members to
vote on both sides of the same issue. 
<P>
Apply the Freedom of Information Act to Congress.
<P> Although the new House's first order of business -- at last to apply federal
laws to itself -- is praiseworthy, this endeavor will remain flawed and
incomplete until Freedom of Information Act coverage is included.
Congressional secrecy has done more to harm the institution and make it
susceptible to scandal than perhaps any other action. Abuses centering
around the House restaurant, post office, and bank scandals would likely
have been eliminated or curbed far earlier had knowledge about their details
been available to the general public. Citizens have a right to know about the
contacts that Members of Congress make with special-interest lobbyists and
federal regulatory agencies. Applying FOIA to Congress is the best way to
ensure that such information is disclosed.
<P>
Rein in conference committees.
 <P>Federal programs often become more expensive over the course of many
years, but they rarely become $5 billion more expensive over the course of
a few weeks. When the $22 billion Senate crime bill and its $28 billion
House counterpart went to conference committee, that committee produced
a $33 billion product. Although massive public scrutiny eventually enabled
congressional budget-cutters to reduce the bill's expense, unlimited
committee discretion routinely enables committee members to add new
spending to the legislation that ultimately must be voted on by both Houses
of Congress. New House Rules specifying that conference committees may
not fund programs at a higher level than either House of Congress had
approved would eliminate committee skullduggery and redistribute power
from conference committees to rank-and-file legislators. Such rules should
also require conference committees to follow the dictates of any motions to
instruct passed by the House, rather than allowing conferees to ignore those
often overwhelming votes.
<P>
TERM LIMITS
  <P>   The Contract With America promises only a House vote on term
limits. However, if House leaders make only desultory efforts to secure the
two-thirds supermajority necessary to pass a constitutional amendment, term
limit supporters will be outraged and citizens may feel they were tricked.
While the reforms the new House majority has embraced are huge
improvements, the task of congressional reform will not be complete until
term limits become the law of the land. Only term limits can guarantee that
Republicans will keep their vows to remember life in the minority and to
remain sensitive to the will of the American people. The clearest test of
House leaders' real commitment to term limits would be a vigorous effort
to find a way to defuse the controversy between six- and twelve-year House
service limits, which threatens to complicate this already difficult effort.
<P>
CONCLUSION
 <P>    Although disputes over the way the House operates are often
portrayed as arguments over arcane details with little significance, the votes
that establish the rules by which the House does business are some of the
most important ones that House Members will cast over the next two years.
Previous Congresses operated under rules that inflated staff, weakened the
quality of House deliberation, kept important matters out of the public's
view, and eroded individual Members' accountability. Passage of the new
rules package will be an unprecedented House cleaning: it will make the
House more efficient, more accountable, more deliberative, and more open
to public scrutiny. 
 <P>    Among the highlights of the new rules are:
Application of private sector laws to Congress;
Elimination of numerous House committees and subcommittees, a one-third
cut in committee staffs, and a prohibition on proxy (absentee) voting;
Imposition of term limits on committee chairmen and the Speaker;
Requirements for open meetings and better reporting of committee action,
particularly in the appropriations process;
Greater fairness in the rules process governing consideration of major
legislation.
 <P>    Even after their historic first day, House leaders should remain
committed to reform by pursuing:

Further staff and budget cuts;<P>
Budget process reforms;<P>
Additional truth in voting measures;<P>
A term limits constitutional amendment.<P>
     The historic changes that the new Republican majority will make in
the rules of the House of Representatives on January 4 should not be an
end, but a beginning to the process of reforming Congress. Further reforms
in Congress's structure and in the budget process are particularly critical.
Many steps in these areas will require joint action by the House and Senate,
making them impossible to address on the first day of the congressional
session. The new House and Senate leaders should quickly begin working
together to address these needed reforms. Ultimately, Members of Congress
must not forget that a term limits constitutional amendment is the true
measure of congressional reform.<P>

Backgrounder Update #216<BR>
 2/14/94<BR>
(published at 5 pages)
<P>
(Updating Memo To: President-Elect Clinton No. 4, "A Plan for
Preserving America's Military Strength," December 28, 1992.)
<P>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>

     The Clinton Administration's first-year performance in national
security policy was poor by any objective measure. In every area of
performance as Commander in Chief, the President failed to live up to
expectations or to his own rhetoric.
<P>
     Bill Clinton's record in the employment of American might around
the world is indefensible. Over two dozen soldiers were killed in
Somalia after the President and his advisers expanded the mission
there from feeding the hungry to building a nation and disarming a
tribal warlord's army. No conceivable national interest was advanced
by this change of policy. In Haiti, the decision to send in military
peacekeepers to enforce a United Nations cease-fire agreement was
rescinded when a United States warship was prevented from docking and
humiliated by a gang of armed thugs on the pier. In the former
Yugoslavia, where the President himself raised the stakes during the
1992 presidential campaign, the Administration's empty and ill-advised
threats of military action to stop the bloodshed have infuriated
America's European allies and very likely emboldened potential
adversaries. (For a full discussion on the options available to the
Clinton Administration when it took office, see Baker Spring,
"Assessing America's Military Options In Bosnia," Heritage Foundation
Backgrounder No. 939, May 7, 1993.) 
<P>
     In national security planning, the President claimed credit
throughout the year for having developed the first comprehensive post-
Cold War review of America's defense requirements. But his decision to
fire the author of the plan, then-Secretary of Defense Les Aspin,
calls into question his Administration's commitment to that so-called
Bottom-Up Review. (For a full discussion of the Bottom-Up Review, see
Lawrence T. Di Rita, et al., "Thumbs Down To The Bottom-Up Review,"
Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 957, September 22, 1993.)
<P>
     Moreover, Clinton's budget proposals during his first year make
it clear that he places a low priority on the quality of America's
armed forces. If enacted, his proposed defense budget cuts will be
more than double the reductions he promised while campaigning for the
presidency, and there is ample evidence that those cuts already are
having an impact on combat readiness. (For a full discussion of
military readiness, see John F. Luddy, "Stop The Slide Toward a Hollow
Military," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder Update No. 209, January
14, 1994.) 
<P>
     The best way to measure the President's performance is to compare
his actions to his promises. It is clear in doing so that he has
learned little from the events of 1993. In his State of the Union
address on January 25, for example, Clinton made several claims about
his commitment to a strong defense or regarding the state of America's
defenses today. However, these assertions do not match reality. 
<P>
ASSERTION #1:  "The budget I [will] send to Congress draws the line
               against further defense cuts."
<P>
     This statement apparently means that the President does not
intend to cut the defense budget any more than already planned. So far
he has decided to slash the budget by twice the amount he promised
during the 1992 presidential campaign. Having pledged to trim only $60
billion beyond the Bush cuts through 1997, Clinton actually has
reduced the defense budget by $120 billion. Further, his current
budget plans signal that he is prepared to cut force structure levels
even below those proposed in the Bottom-Up Review, which will only
invite even more budget reductions later in his term.
<P>
ASSERTION #2:  "[N]othing -- nothing -- is more important to our
               security than our nation's armed forces."
<P>
     The President has made no secret of the fact that he prefers to
concentrate on domestic issues. As reported by The Washington Post
during the search for the Administration's third defense secretary in
less than a year, one unnamed advisor noted that "[the Administration]
really just wanted to get the Pentagon off the screen. Every time it
was on, it was trouble that interfered with the President's agenda.
Their attitude was, if they could subcontract out the Pentagon, they
would." (Ann Devroy and Barton Gellman, "How Search Finally Led to
Perry," The Washington Post, January 24, 1994, p. A1.)
<P>
     As much as he may wish to do so, the President cannot
"subcontract out" his responsibilities as Commander in Chief -- not to
his National Security Adviser, not to his Secretary of Defense, and
not to the United Nations Secretary General, as he tried to do in
Somalia and Haiti. The tragic events of 1993, including the deaths of
over two dozen Americans in Somalia, suggest the President is trying
to do just that. Instead of using rhetoric to create the impression of
being committed to America's national security, the President should
simply commit the resources required to ensure a strong military.
<P>
ASSERTION #3:  "Last year, I proposed a defense plan that maintains
               our post-Cold War security.... "
<P>
     True, but the President no longer supports this plan, known as
the Bottom-Up Review. The Bottom-Up Review is collapsing and starved
for funds that could fall short of requirements by $95 billion.
Reports are already emerging that the military services are
formulating plans to reduce their forces to levels below those
recommended in the Bottom-Up Review. (David A. Fulghum, "USAF May Cut
Forces By Additional 10-15%," Aviation Week and Space Technology,
January 3, 1994, pp. 25-26.)
<P>
     By his budget recommendations, the President is making it clear
that even he does not support the findings of the Bottom-Up Review.
The budget he has proposed covering fiscal 1995 through 1999 will
support an Army force structure 20 percent smaller than that
envisioned in the Bottom-Up Review. In addition it allows for 16
percent fewer Navy ships, only 77 percent of the Marine Corps troop
strength, and an Air Force 70 percent the size of that outlined in the
study.
<P>
     But the best indication that the President no longer supports the
plan is his decision in December 1993 to fire its author, Secretary of
Defense Les Aspin. In the week before his departure was announced,
Aspin had begun to challenge in public Budget Director Leon Panetta's
assertion that an additional $50 billion in defense cuts would be
needed to meet the Administration's spending targets over five years.
<P>
ASSERTION #4:  "We honor [the armed forces'] contributions.... "
<P>
     Clinton's actions speak louder than his words. He tried last year
to force the military to accept acknowledged homosexuals in the ranks,
a highly unpopular move contrary to good order and combat readiness
that was forestalled by Congress. Moreover, his first budget
submission included a freeze on military pay, a move also overridden
by Congress. Given the President's youthful and brash comments about
"loving [the] country but loathing the military... ," (William J.
Clinton letter to LTC Eugene Holmes, Director of the Reserve Officer
Training Corps program at the University of Arkansas, December 3,
1969.) these initiatives do not suggest the actions of a President who
honors the armed forces. Nor have they done anything to raise the low
esteem in which he was held by members of the armed services when he
assumed office.
<P>
     Easing his strained relationship with the military is among the
most pressing problems the President faces. To be sure, the U.S. armed
services are made up of professionals who understand the Constitution
and the inviolability of civilian control over the military. But while
respect for the office is inviolate, respect for the office holder
must often be earned. President Clinton will not earn that respect
with platitudes that ignore his unfortunate performance as Commander
in Chief during his first year. He should instead acknowledge his
mistakes and develop a national security strategy based on strong
defense and global leadership.
<P>
ASSERTION #5:  "Our forces are the finest military our nation has ever
               had.... "
<P>
     This statement is simply untrue. Had it been made in 1991, it
would have been true. But who can argue that a Navy which has 413
ships in 1994 is stronger than one that had 528 ships in 1991?
Likewise, who believes that an Army of 20 active and reserve divisions
in 1994 is stronger than one which had 26 total divisions in 1991? The
Air Force is no better off, having lost 10 tactical air wings since
1991.
<P>
     Defense spending has been on a downward spiral since its peak in
1985; it has been reduced by nearly 40 percent since that time. But
the Clinton defense budget implies that further cuts are possible and
even desirable.
<P>
     Worse, the quality of military personnel has begun to decline.
Secretary Aspin on June 2, 1993, acknowledged that the percentage of
new military recruits with high school diplomas had dropped from 97
percent in 1991 to 94 percent in 1993 and that enlistment test scores
also declined during the same period. (John Lancaster, "Aspin Voices
Concern About Slight Decline in Quality of Recruits," The Washington
Post, June 3, 1993, p. A7.) Concerns about military readiness
generally prompted Aspin to form a blue-ribbon commission of retired
generals and admirals to examine these questions. It is well past time
for Clinton to recognize that the armed forces are weaker than they
were in 1991 and as a result of his defense program will be far weaker
yet in the future.

<P>
ASSERTION #6:  " . .. .. [A]s long as I am President, [the armed
               forces] will remain the best trained, best equipped,
               and best prepared fighting force on the face of the
               earth."
<P>
     The President is wrong on all counts. The Clinton cuts already
have begun to have a negative impact on training, equipment
procurement, and combat readiness. Funding for the purchase of new
equipment and research and development of future weapons systems has
been slashed by Clinton, while equipment modernization accounts are
also suffering.
<P>
     There will be a 17 percent reduction in procurement spending in
1994. As a result, less new equipment and weapons will be purchased.
Research and development also will drop by 10 percent, limiting future
Presidents from having the wide range of modern weapons Clinton
enjoyed as a result of defense build-up in the 1980s.
<P>
     Clinton's defense reductions are across the board. Several
critical weapons programs, including the Air Force's Multi-Role
Fighter aircraft, and the Navy's A/F-X fighter-attack aircraft have
been cancelled without replacements. Meanwhile, funding for the
nation's premier high technology defense program, ballistic missile
defense, has been halved.
<P>
     Routine maintenance levels are also in decline. For the first
time in a decade, for example, less than 90 percent of Marine Corps
equipment is ready to go to war. (General Carl E. Mundy, Jr.,
Commandant of the Marine Corps, Statement for the Record Before the
Senate Armed Services Committee, May 19, 1993.) The Marine Corps'
backlog in maintenance has gone from zero to $160 million in two
years. (Margo McFarland, "Nunn Warns That Outlay Problem in '95 Could
Be Even Worse Than '94," Inside the Navy, June 21, 1993, p. 17.) The
Navy has 150 aircraft and 250 aircraft engines overdue for maintenance
because of budget shortfalls. (Admiral Frank B. Kelso II, Statement
For the Record Before the Senate Armed Services Committee, May 19,
1993.) Meanwhile, the Army's budget for modernizing its forces is
under-funded by $1 billion. ($1 Billion of Army Modernization Plans
Unfunded," Inside the Pentagon, July 22, 1993, p. 5.)
<P>
     Clinton may claim to support a modern, well-equipped, and well-
trained military for the future, but his actions do not reflect this
priority. America's ability to develop and field high-tech weapons of
the future is withering, while training and readiness have already
been affected by the military's inability to keep its equipment in
good repair. Today's military can continue operating the weapons
developed and built in the 1980s, but Clinton's successors will
inherit armed forces greatly weakened by his short-sighted military
investment policies.

<P>CONCLUSION
<P>
     Now that Clinton has a new Secretary of Defense, he has the
opportunity to try again to develop a coherent national security
strategy. A responsible first step would be to scrap Aspin's Bottom-Up
Review and develop a plan that addresses America's global interests
and for which the Administration is prepared to pay. (For a full slate
of recommendations for the new Secretary of Defense, see John Luddy,
"A National Security Agenda for the New Secretary of Defense,"
Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 214, February 10, 1994.)
<P>
     
     President Clinton's first year in office will not be remembered
for its foreign and defense policy successes. The low point was in
early October, when 18 Americans died at the hands of a Somali tribal
chieftain and an American warship was prevented from docking by a gang
of Haitian thugs. Such humiliation demands a sober reassessment of
priorities and objectives, and not the braggadocio of the President's
first State of the Union Address.
<P>

Backgrounder Update #190<BR>
3/23/93<BR>
(published at 3 pages)
<P>
(Updating Asian Studies Center Backgrounder No. 119, "Responding to
the Looming North Korean Nuclear Threat," January 29, 1992.)
<P>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>

     South Korea's new Foreign Minister, Han Sung-joo, arrives in
Washington this week for talks with the Clinton Administration. This
visit comes at a critical time. Bill Clinton is being tested by the
world's longest-ruling Stalinist dictator, North Korea's 80-year-old
Kim Il-sung. The North Korean dictator signalled his apparent
determination to build nuclear weapons when on March 11 North Korea
announced its decision to withdraw from the Nuclear Non-proliferation
Treaty (NPT) -- the first country ever to do so. Evidence is mounting
that a North Korean nuclear weapon may be imminent. On February 24,
Central Intelligence Director James Woolsey said, there is a "real
possibility that North Korea has already manufactured enough fissile
material for at least one nuclear weapon." 
<P>
     The cost of failing to stop North Korea from obtaining nuclear
weapons is high. At the very minimum, it may prompt an Asian nuclear
arms race, and at worst, North Korea might sell nuclear weapons to
Middle East terrorists, who could threaten Americans abroad and at
home. The Clinton Administration must treat North Korea's nuclear
challenge as a serious threat to global peace. Halting North Korea's
nuclear program, while also avoiding a war on the Korean peninsula,
must now be Clinton's first priority in Asia. 
<P>

NUCLEAR THREAT IMMINENT?
<P>     The United States and its allies must recognize that North Korea
could very soon have one or more nuclear weapons. U.S. intelligence
sources were hinting in early 1992 that North Korea could have a
nuclear weapon by mid-1993. Recent public statements by the new
Director of Central Intelligence are consistent with his predecessor's
assessment. Some South Korean government sources indicate that the
North already may have more than one nuclear weapon. 
<P>
     Regardless of these estimates, it is well known that North Korea
is working hard to build a bomb. Its nuclear research facility is
located near Yongbyon, about sixty miles north of the capital,
Pyongyang. At this site are two nuclear reactors capable of producing
plutonium. A 30 megawatt reactor completed in 1987 may have been
producing 15 pounds of plutonium a year, enough for one Hiroshima-size
bomb. A larger 200 megawatt reactor may be completed this year --
capable of producing 100 pounds of plutonium a year. Yongbyon is also
known to have technology to reprocess plutonium into nuclear weapons
material. Besides the Yongbyon facility, recent defectors say, North
Korea has underground nuclear research facilities. 
<P>
     North Korea's possession of nuclear weapons would greatly enhance
the threat posed by its 1.1 million-strong armed forces. In addition
to 700 combat aircraft, North Korea soon may have a long-range missile
to deliver nuclear warheads. With possible Libyan funding, North Korea
is completing a modified Russian Scud ballistic missile with a 600-
mile range. From North Korea, this missile could reach Beijing,
Khabarovsk in Russia, Osaka in Japan, and all of South Korea. Nuclear
weapons enable North Korea to pose a number of regional and global
threats. They are:
<P>
Threats to Korea: Most directly threatened would be the 43 million
     South Koreans and the 37,000 U.S. troops there to help deter a
     North Korean attack. With nuclear weapons, North Korea can
     perpetuate its communist system and the division of the Korean
     nation. 
<P>
Blackmail: North Korea could use its nuclear weapons capability to
     pressure South Korea and Japan into making political concessions,
     such as removing U.S. military forces from their territory.
<P>
Nuclear proliferation: Pyongyang's status as a nuclear power would
     encourage South Korea and Japan to obtain nuclear weapons to
     defend themselves.
<P>
Threats to Israel: North Korea is an economic basket case. It can earn
     badly needed cash by selling nuclear weapons to radical Middle
     Eastern countries like Iran, Libya, and Syria -- which already
     have purchased North Korean Scud missiles.
<P>
Nuclear terrorism: North Korea also could market its destructive wares
     to terrorist groups bent on bombing American and other Western
     cities. North Korea, after all, is an experienced and
     enthusiastic practitioner of state terrorism. It blew up a South
     Korean airliner and its 115 passengers in 1987, and killed 21
     people while trying to assassinate South Korean President Chun
     Do-whan during a 1983 visit to Burma.
<P>

LIMITS OF DIPLOMACY
<P>
     North Korea's withdrawal from the NPT demonstrates the limits of
using diplomacy to end the nuclear threat posed by that country. For
three years now, South Korea, the U.S., Japan, Russia, and China have
cooperated diplomatically to convince North Korea to abandon its
nuclear weapons program. In 1991, for example, the U.S. withdrew its
tactical nuclear weapons from South Korea and agreed to suspend for
1992 the annual "Team Spirit" U.S.-ROK military exercises. In late
December 1991, North and South Korea signed an agreement that promised
unprecedented cooperation in political, economic, and cultural
relations. Pyongyang and Seoul signed a second agreement in December
1991 in which both nations pledged not to "test, produce, receive,
possess, store, deploy or use nuclear weapons," or to "possess
facilities for nuclear reprocessing and uranium enrichment." The
latter agreement also promised to establish a commission to organize
inspections by each side of facilities suspected of possessing nuclear
capabilities.
<P>
     North Korea, however, has failed to observe these agreements.
Wider economic and cultural contacts, which might undermine the rule
of Kim Il-sung, have not been allowed to flourish. North Korea remains
a totalitarian state whose 21 million people suffer the burden of a
steadily worsening economy. Recent visitors report power blackouts in
Pyongyang, and the government exhorts its people to eat less and less
as reports of food shortages abound. Notwithstanding, Kim Il-sung
maintains his massive military forces and goes on pouring scarce
resources into his nuclear program.
<P>
     Pyongyang also refuses to fulfill its part of the 1991 North-
South nuclear agreement. To date, the North has refused the South's
invitation to inspect any of its facilities which Pyongyang believes
to possess nuclear material. It also has denied access to North Korea
by South Korean inspectors. Last year North Korea allowed six
inspections by the International Atomic Energy Agency (IAEA), a United
Nations-affiliated agency charged with preventing diversion of nuclear
materials for military purposes. But Washington and Seoul felt that
these were not enough. Hence the request for access by South Korean
inspectors. Seoul's fears apparently are well-founded. Late last year
North Korea refused a seventh round of IAEA inspections, apparently
fearing the discovery of its nuclear weapons program. After the IAEA
on February 25 set a one-month deadline for Pyongyang to respond to
the IAEA's request for inspections, the North Koreans answered by
withdrawing from the NPT on March 11.
<P>
AMERICAN LEADERSHIP NEEDED
<P>
     If North Korea ignores the IAEA's March 25 deadline, the U.S.
should begin a campaign to end North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
On March 25, South Korea's new Foreign Minister, Han Sung-joo, will
arrive in Washington for consultations with the Clinton
Administration. To underscore the gravity of this issue, Bill Clinton
should reassure Foreign Minister Han of America's commitment to defend
South Korea and state his determination to end North Korea's nuclear
threat. A comprehensive program to end North Korea's nuclear threat
should include:
<P>
Diplomatic carrots: Clinton should declare that immediate North Korean
     resumption of IAEA inspections and near-term initiation of
     unrestricted North-South mutual nuclear inspections are
     preconditions for improved U.S.-North Korean relations,
     particularly in the area of trade.
<P>
United Nations action: Washington and Seoul should lead an effort in
     the U.N. Security Council to focus world attention on North
     Korea's withdrawal from the NPT and its nuclear weapons program.
     Because time is critical, Washington should urge the U.N.
     Security Council to establish a deadline for North Korea's
     compliance with the NPT. If this deadline is missed, the U.N.
     should consider sanctions against North Korea.
<P>
Economic pressure: Washington should consult with Seoul, Tokyo,
     Moscow, and Beijing on the range of possible economic sanctions
     against Pyongyang. Seoul already has stopped business investments
     in North Korea. Possible economic sanctions should include
     suspension by all nations of investment and trade with North
     Korea. 
<P>
Pressure on China: Washington should enlist Seoul and Tokyo in a
     campaign to convince Beijing of their common interest in imposing
     economic and political sanctions against an unrepentant North
     Korea. Chinese cooperation on economic sanctions will be
     critical, as North Korea now conducts most of its trade with
     China. However, on March 12, China blocked a U.N. Security
     Council effort to condemn Pyongyang's withdrawal from the NPT.
     The U.S. should make it clear to China that the strength or
     weakness of Washington's political and economic relations with
     Beijing will depend on its cooperation in stopping North Korea's
     nuclear weapons program.
<P>
Military options: War against North Korea would devastate the Korean
     peninsula and must be avoided at every reasonable cost. But South
     Korea must be defended. Washington should offer to upgrade South
     Korean defenses with such modern weapons as Patriot missile-
     interceptors and the J-STARS radar aircraft, which can observe
     North Korean troop movements. Despite looming Pentagon budget
     cuts, the U.S. should not reduce its 37,000 troops now in the
     ROK.  

<P>
CLINTON'S TOUGH TEST
<P>
     Since 1950, successful management of U.S.-Korean relations has
been a mark of successful U.S. Presidents. The last to stumble, Jimmy
Carter -- who sought premature U.S. troop reductions from South Korea
-- damaged both America's reputation in Asia and his own. Bill Clinton
now faces a much tougher test in seeking to end North Korean's nuclear
weapons threat. 
<P>
     With one-twentieth of its population in the military, Pyongyang
is well-armed. The addition of nuclear weapons to its arsenal
qualifies North Korea as extremely dangerous. It should be remembered
that its current ruler, Kim Il-sung, started the Korean War in 1950.
Since then he has threatened South Korea with border provocations and
terrorist attacks. The difference now is that Kim Il-sung may soon
have nuclear weapons, and at the age of 80, may have far less to lose
today than he did in 1950. 
<P>
     Kim Il-sung's bloody determination should remind Americans of
Saddam Hussein, whom the U.S. mistakenly underestimated before the
Persian Gulf War. If the U.S. and its allies treat Kim Il-sung as they
did Saddam Hussein, America's position as the world's major power,
Asia's peace and prosperity, and Bill Clinton's reputation will all be
at risk.
<P>

     Smaller is not better. Better is better.
<P>
     
                    General Gordon R. Sullivan, Chief of Staff, <BR>
                    United States Army, February 5, 1994
<P>
     This curious statement by the Army Chief of Staff suggests he
knows something the rest of the national security establishment has
not yet figured out: The Clinton Administration has no intention of
developing and equipping the forces needed to defend America's global
interests for the rest of the 20th century. Indeed, President Clinton
will fall some $100 billion short in funding the level of military
might he has determined is necessary over the next five years. (For a
full discussion of the Clinton 1995 Defense Budget, see Baker Spring,
"Clinton's Defense Budget Falls Far Short," Heritage Foundation
Backgrounder Update No. 217, March 15, 1994.) But in no armed service
are the potential effects of the Clinton Administration's dismantling
of America's defenses more vividly foretold than in the United States
Army.
<P>
     The Clinton Administration's defense budget for the period of
1995 through 1999 leaves the Army with a Hobson's choice: it will
either be too small to perform its mission of seizing enemy-held
territory overseas, or it may be large enough, but lack modern weapons
and not be combat-ready. General Sullivan, for good reason, is balking
at having to make this choice at all. But his statement of "smaller is
not better" suggests that he will resist further force structure
reductions beyond those that the Clinton Administration proposed in
its comprehensive 1993 analysis of defense policy, known as the
Bottom-Up Review. Hence, for the time being, General Sullivan
apparently hopes to preserve the Army's size, which risks creating a
"hollow force" short of equipment, spare parts, and necessary
training.
<P>
THE ARMY'S TWO OPTIONS
<P>
     The full scope of the dilemma facing General Sullivan is best
understood by analyzing the two options provided by Clinton's defense
budget proposals. If Clinton's figures are accepted, the Army ends up
with two equally unattractive options. They are: 
     
     
<P>
 Option 1: A smaller, but more combat-ready Army
<P>
     In this option, the Clinton Administration decides to reject its
own analysis of future defense needs and instead builds an Army
smaller than the one envisaged in the Bottom-Up Review. The force most
closely resembling this option is Les Aspin's "Option B," which he
developed in 1992 while he was Chairman of the House Armed Services
Committee. (Les Aspin, "Defense 1997 Alternatives," February 25,
1992.) That force consisted of eight active divisions and four reserve
division equivalents, with 808,000 active and reserve troops. (A
division equivalent is a collection of lower level units (such as a
brigade or regiment) not formally organized as a division but of
roughly the same size and strength.) This compares with the
recommendations of the Bottom-Up Review, which calls for ten active
divisions and five reserve division equivalents. At this lower force
level, more money would be available to spend on operations and
maintenance, the mainstays of combat readiness.
<P>
     Further, the size of this Army would be much smaller than that
proposed for the coming fiscal year. The Army plans to have twelve
active divisions and eight reserve division equivalents by the end of
1995, with 1.152 million troops. Thus, to reach the force structure of
Option 1, the Army would have to eliminate four active divisions and
four reserve division equivalents (see Table 1). It would also have to
eliminate 344,000 billets between 1996 and 1999 to meet the levels in
this option (see Table 2).
<P>
     A smaller force structure would enable the Army to maintain a
budget that is better balanced among its various components. For
example, if full funding of military pay is assumed, while funding for
the remaining accounts is proportional to that proposed for fiscal
1995, the outcome would be: 1) Military Personnel (compensation) =
$20.5 billion (Whereas the Clinton Administration proposes dedicating
just under 43 percent of the Army's budget in fiscal 1995 to military
pay, the hypothetical Option 1 budget for fiscal 1999 would devote 41
percent to military pay.); 2) Operations and Maintenance = $18.1
billion; 3) Procurement = $5.1 billion; 4) Research and Development =
$4.5 billion; and, 5) Military Construction and Family Housing = $1.8
billion (see Table 3). 
<P>
     Broken down this way, more could be spent on combat readiness
(the Operations and Maintenance account) in Option 1 than on a larger
force consisting of ten active duty divisions and five "division
equivalent" forces in reserves. Whereas the larger force would
allocate less than $12,000 (1994 dollars) per soldier from the O&M
account, the smaller force would spend more than $20,000. Thus, the
Option 1 or smaller Army would be more combat-ready than the larger
force option (see Table 4).
<P>
     This force may be more combat-ready, but it would be too small to
meet the defense needs outlined in the Bottom-Up Review, which
concluded that the U.S. must be able to fight two major regional
conflicts "nearly simultaneously." When the U.S. fought Operation
Desert Storm in 1991, the Army had 26 active and reserve divisions and
still found it necessary to shift forces and material from around the
globe to support General Schwarzkopf's efforts. The Option 1 force
will consist of only twelve active and reserve division equivalents.
If a force almost twice the size of Option 2 had difficulties
fulfilling the requirements of only one regional contingency, the
Option 1 force cannot possibly handle two wars "nearly
simultaneously."
<P>
     In fact, the Option 1 force could not sustain operations in one
major regional conflict if it lasted longer than a few months. For
example, the U.S. sent seven Army divisions to Operations Desert
Shield and Desert Storm. But had the conflict lasted longer, the
forces rushed to the Gulf after Iraq's invasion of Kuwait would have
to have been replaced in accordance with standard wartime troop
rotation requirements. Thus, an additional four or five Army divisions
ultimately would have to have been deployed in the Gulf War. In the
end, if the war had lasted longer, the Army would have needed eleven
or twelve divisions. This requirement is one or two divisions higher
than that envisioned in Option 1.
<P>
Option 2: A larger, but "hollow" Army
<P>
     This option assumes that the Army sticks with the size of the
force structure recommended in the Bottom-Up Review. That study
concluded that by 1999 the Army must retain ten active duty divisions
and approximately five "division equivalents" in the reserve component
(see Table 1). In this force, the Army would maintain 1.07 million
active duty and reserve troops (see Table 2). (The Army expected by
the end of 1995 will comprise twelve active duty divisions and eight
reserve division equivalents, a total of 1.152 million men and women
under arms. Thus, to reach the 1999 projections, the Army will have to
jettison two active duty divisions, more than two division equivalents
from the reserves (see Table 1), and 82,000 positions (see Table 2).)
The 1999 Army budget will be approximately $50 billion, not accounting
for inflation
<P>
     But this $50 billion is not enough to keep the Army combat-ready.
For example, Congress will insist that military pay be "fully funded,"
that is, regularly adjusted for inflation. However, if Congress fully
funds military pay for the force of 1.07 million and allocates the
rest of the funds in proportions similar to those found in the fiscal
1995 budget, it will greatly distort the Army budget. If these
proportions are followed, the Army's 1999 budget will be: 1) Military
Personnel (pay and allowances) = $27.8 billion; 2) Operations and
Maintenance = $14.0 billion; 3) Procurement = $4.0 billion; 4)
Research and Development = $3.4 billion; and, 5) Military Construction
and Family Housing = $1.4 billion (see Table 3). This breakdown
clearly demonstrates that by 1999 the cost for personnel will swamp
the budget, constituting almost 55 percent of the entire Army budget. 
<P>
     Not even during the years of the "hollow" Army in the 1970s did
the personnel accounts exceed 50 percent. For example, in 1978, when
the Carter defense budget was at its lowest, personnel accounted for
40 percent of the Army budget.  Thus, this option commits the nation
to an Army that has too many troops for the amount of modern weapons
and equipment needed to maintain combat readiness.
<P>
     The impact of adopting Option 2 on the Army's modernization
program is nothing short of catastrophic. This is because the Army's
modernization accounts have been on a downward slope for a decade. For
example, the Army budget for new weapons and equipment peaked in
fiscal 1985 at $23.7 billion (in 1994 dollars). The current fiscal
year will see $7.4 billion invested in procurement, a 69 percent
reduction from the 1985 level. Option 2 would provide only $4 billion
for procurement in 1999. This translates to slightly more than $3.5
billion when adjusted for inflation. Therefore, Army procurement under
Option 2 will be only 15 percent in 1999 of what is was in 1985 (see
Table 5).
<P>
     These draconian cuts in the Army's modernization budget are
already having an effect. For example, the Army will purchase no new
tanks in fiscal year 1995, whereas it purchased 448 in 1990 and 720 in
1985. According to General Sullivan, the Army must terminate 57
programs now in production or development between 1995 and 1999 to
meet the procurement reduction requirements imposed on him by the
Clinton budget. Another 77 programs will be delayed or deferred during
the same period. With such a budget, the Army cannot continue to be
the modern, high technology force it was in the late 1980s and early
1990s.
<P>
     Option 2 also will seriously weaken the Army's combat readiness,
which is paid for mostly out of the Operation and Maintenance (O&M)
account. Under this option, O&M will constitute only 28 percent of the
total Army budget in 1999, down from 35 percent in 1995. This level of
spending means that while around $19,000 (in 1994 dollars) in O&M
funds will be available per soldier in 1995, only $12,000 per soldier
will be spent in 1999 (see Table 4). Such low levels of funding for
operations and maintenance will produce an Army unable to fight. As
Republican Senator John McCain of Arizona warned last year, "Today,
that readiness [exhibited in Operation Desert Storm] is beginning to
evaporate." (Senator John McCain, "Going Hollow: The Warnings Of Our
Chiefs of Staff," July 1993, p. 1.)
    <P> 

CONCLUSION
<P>
     If the Clinton Administration intends to disregard its own
conclusions regarding America's defense requirements and build a much
smaller military force, the President should tell Congress and the
American people. Instead, he clings to the Bottom-Up Review, but fails
to budget enough money to build that force. He reiterated his support
for the Bottom-Up Review force in his January 25 State of the Union
Address, where he stated: "Last year, I proposed a defense plan [the
Bottom-Up Review] that maintains our post-Cold War security at a lower
cost." (The text of President Clinton's State of the Union Address is
reprinted in the January 26, 1993, edition of The Washington Post, p.
A-12.) In so doing, the Administration risks a $100 billion shortfall
by 1999.
<P>
     Fully funding the Bottom-Up Review Army will cost about $57
billion (not accounting for inflation) in 1999, or $7 billion (15
percent) more than the Administration is likely to propose. From 1995
through 1999, additional funding for the Army would amount to about
$18 billion.
<P>
     The President's strong rhetoric on defense is not being matched
by his budgetary actions. (For a full discussion, see Baker Spring,
"Rhetoric vs. Reality: Assessing Clinton's Defense Policy," Heritage
Foundation Backgrounder Update No. 216, February 14, 1994.) It is not
a question of whether, but when, this President or his successor will
have those defenses tested by threats to the nation's global vital
interests. When that happens, it will be too late for the American
people to get the full accounting of how the Clinton Administration
was allowed to dismantle America's fighting machine.

<a href="fyi114c1.gif">Chart 1</a>: GDP Growth and Magnitude of Error in Advance Estimate<br>
<a href="fyi114c2.gif">Chart 2</a>: Trend and Quarterly Real GDP Growth 1976-1996
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
On August 1, the Department of Commerce's Bureau of Economic Analysis (BEA) is scheduled to release its preliminary or "advance" gross domestic product (GDP) growth estimate for the second quarter of 1996. This number, good or bad, inevitably will make front-page news and may have a significant impact on the presidential campaign. Just as inevitably, this preliminary number most likely will turn out to be wrong, for quarterly GDP data historically have been subject to substantial later revisions, sometimes so significant that the original estimate tells nothing about the course of the economy.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

A single quarter estimate of the growth in GDP usually is a poor signal of the long-term direction of economic growth. Consider the following examples:<ul>

<p><li>The GDP growth estimate for the first quarter of 1996 has been revised downward by 21 percent (from 2.8 percent to 2.2 percent).

<p><li>During the last year of the Bush Administration, the first quarter 1992 advance estimate of GDP suggested an annualized growth rate of 2.0 percent. The subsequent revision of the GDP for that quarter showed that growth in the quarter actually was at an annualized rate of 4.7 percent. This is a 135 percent revision between the preliminary and final estimates.

<p><li>As it turns out, the BEA underestimated the growth rate during the Reagan Administration in 63 percent of its advance estimates. During the Clinton Administration, the BEA so far has overestimated the growth rate on over 69 percent of the occasions on which it published advance estimates.

<p><li>The BEA concedes that in 12 percent of the quarters between 1978 and 1991, the advance GDP growth estimate failed even to indicate correctly whether growth was positive or negative.

<p><li>The average divergence between the advance estimate of GDP growth and the final GDP growth rate between 1976 and 1996 was equivalent to 50 percent of the value of the final GDP growth rate.
</ul>

<p>
<b>WHY DOES QUARTERLY GDP FLUCTUATE SO MUCH?</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Measuring GDP changes is a very complex task, made all the more difficult by the fact that quarterly GDP figures are very volatile.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Gross domestic product (GDP) represents the total value of goods and services sold for final consumption by U.S. firms and individuals. It consists of four major components: personal consumption; investment (including business inventories and both residential and nonresidential fixed investment); net exports; and government purchases of goods and services. Fluctuations in any of these individual components of GDP in a given quarter can cause large changes in the quarterly growth rate. The components which typically have the largest and most common fluctuations are changes in business inventories and in government purchases.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

A glance at the quarterly GDP growth figures for the last quarter of 1995 illustrates this point. Despite an annualized growth rate in personal consumption expenditures of 1.2 percent and a respectable annualized increase in nonresidential fixed investment of 3.1 percent, overall annualized growth in this quarter was at a recession-like low of 0.5 percent. The reason: An annualized fall in government purchases of over 12 percent during the winter shutdown of 1995-1996 drove down GDP during this quarter.<sup>2</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

 Similarly, a number of one-shot factors probably will drive a significant increase in GDP for the second quarter of 1996. One leading econometric consulting firm, the St. Louis-based Macroeconomic Advisers,<sup>3</sup> for example, cite a number of factors to support their prediction of a 3.7 percent annualized growth rate for this quarter. These factors include the complete recovery of government purchases following the winter shutdown, the end of the UAW strike at General Motors, an increase in the number of home mortgage refinancings stimulated by lower interest rates (which put extra cash into the hands of consumers), and the economy's recovery after the harsh winter weather.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The extent to which these short-term factors can influence quarterly growth figures can be gauged by looking more closely at what is happening to business inventories. Due to the GM strike and the harsh winter, business inventories fell substantially in the first quarter of 1996 as production experienced a slowdown. Macroeconomic Advisers predicts that over 38 percent of their projected growth in GDP (1.4 percent from a total annualized growth rate of 3.7 percent) in the second quarter of 1996 will come solely from firms restocking their inventories as production gets fully back on line.
<p>


<b>WHY ADVANCE ESTIMATES OF GDP GROWTH TEND TO BE WRONG</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Measuring GDP is a massive and complicated undertaking that involves attempting to record the total sales of all goods for final consumption for the entire United States. The BEA produces its estimates based on sample sales data from a number of individuals and firms, collected during every month. Prices for thousands of individual items are estimated using sample data. Taken together, these comprise virtually millions of data points.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The problem is that when the advance estimate is published only 30 days after the close of the quarter, not all of these data have been examined -- or are even available. In 1984, for example, top BEA official Robert Parker noted that for sales of all consumer goods, other than autos and trucks, only data from the first two months of the quarter were available when advance estimates of national income were being made.<sup>4</sup>  To estimate the GDP growth in such a case, with data either missing or unexamined, BEA economists must rely on a combination of extrapolation and guesswork. But given the turbulent nature of quarterly GDP changes, this guesswork often is very inaccurate. These factors mean that large revisions need to be made as the complete dataset becomes available and is examined in full by the BEA.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The revisions also tend to be large because the GDP growth rate is a rate of change. Thus, errors of a small magnitude in total GDP can lead to large errors in the growth rate. For example, if the actual GDP growth rate is 2 percent, even a small error in total GDP could translate into a large error in the actual growth rate, perhaps even 50 percent. In this context, it is not surprising that advance GDP growth estimates often vary substantially from the real figures.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Unfortunately, despite the fact that advance GDP growth estimates are subject to frequent and large revisions, they are quickly seized upon by politicians of both parties either to support their own records or to attack those of their opponents. And unlike the publication of advance estimates, revisions of these quarterly data by the BEA hardly make the news. This process of correcting and finalizing GDP estimates can last for months -- even years -- following that initial release and can result in huge revisions which tell a completely different story about how well the economy performed.<sup>5</sup>  <a href="fyi114c1.gif">Chart 1</a> shows the difference between the initial "advance" estimates of the real annualized growth rate of GDP and the most up-to-date revisions of these figures for the period since 1976.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<a href="fyi114c1.gif">Chart 1</a> shows the difference or "error" between the advance and the most up-to-date revised estimate of the GDP growth rate. The "magnitude of the initial error" refers to the amount by which the advance GDP growth rate was later revised. Thus, if the advance estimate was a 3 percent annualized growth rate and the revised rate was 2 percent, the absolute error was 1 percentage point, which represents a revision of 33 percent.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

In most cases, the error is substantial; on a number of occasions, it exceeds the real growth rate itself. Among recent examples of large errors is the first quarter of 1992, when the BEA's advance estimate of GDP growth underestimated the real annualized growth rate by a factor of 135 percent (the advance annualized real growth estimate was 2.0 percent; real annualized growth in that quarter was actually 4.7 percent, according to the latest revision). The BEA also has revised downward its estimate of the growth rate for the first quarter of 1996 by a factor of almost one-third.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

An analysis of the revisions contained in the BEA's monthly <I>Survey of Current Business</I> over the 20-year period from 1976-1996 shows that these recent examples fit a general pattern over many years. In the 80 quarters between the first quarter of 1976 and the first quarter of 1996, the average magnitude of the total revision in annualized real GDP growth amounted to 1.4 percent of GDP. The average quarterly annualized growth rate in GDP over this period was 2.8 percent. This means that the average divergence of the advance estimate of GDP growth from the actual revised figure was equivalent to 50 percent of the value of the actual revised growth rate. According to BEA economist Allan Young, "advance" GDP growth figures failed even to show correctly whether GDP growth was negative or positive in 12 percent of all quarters over the period 1978-1991.<sup>6</sup>  Taking the Reagan years as an example, the BEA's advance figures underestimated the growth rate in roughly two-thirds (63 percent) of all quarters. Likewise, during the Clinton era, the BEA so far has overestimated the rate of growth in about 70 percent of all of its advance estimates.
<p>

<b>WHY IT MAKES MORE SENSE TO LOOK AT TRENDS IN GDP</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Because of the poor accuracy of advance estimates of GDP and the extreme volatility of quarterly GDP growth rates, a far better picture of the economy emerges from looking at the underlying trends. <a href="fyi114c2.gif">Chart 2</a> shows the trend<sup>7</sup> in economic growth compared with the <I>revised</I> quarterly GDP growth rates between the first quarter of 1976 and the second quarter of 1996.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

The data in <a href="fyi114c2.gif">Chart 2</a> show two major patterns in the rate of economic growth in recent years: an acceleration in growth rates between the first quarter of 1992 and the final quarter of 1994 and a deceleration in the growth rate beginning after the peak in 1994 and continuing through to the current period. Both the expansion and the slowdown in the economy, however, have been punctuated by misleading "spikes," or individual quarters when the GDP growth rate diverged from the trend. For example, during the first quarter of 1993, in the middle of an expansion, the growth rate of GDP fell to zero. More recently, the economy showed strong above-trend growth in the third quarter of 1995.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

As can be seen from <a href="fyi114c2.gif">Chart 2</a>, individual quarterly GDP numbers are a rough and often misleading signal of the long-term and medium-term strength of the economy. Quarterly GDP figures can fluctuate widely because of factors that are unique to that quarter and which pose no long-term implications for economic prosperity.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Americans should not be lulled into a false sense of either economic prosperity or impending economic decline by estimates of the economy's performance during a single quarter. The advance estimates that are scheduled to be released on August 1 are likely to be revised considerably in the weeks and months to come. And even if these quarterly snapshots actually were accurate, quarterly GDP numbers fluctuate considerably for reasons unconnected with the long-term economic growth rate. Americans should not allow themselves to be deceived by these numbers and the political posturing surrounding them; rather, they should pay attention to the longer term patterns in the economy.

<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>

The uncontentious confirmation hearings and unanimous Senate approval
of Secretary of Defense   William Perry last week belie the challenges
that face him as President Clinton's third choice to head the
Pentagon. It remains an open question whether he can do what Les Aspin
was unable to: develop a defense policy to address America's global
interests despite the low priority the Administration places on
defense. It is unlikely that Secretary Perry will be any more
successful than his predecessor unless the President fundamentally
alters his Administration's approach to national security planning.

<P>
Scrapping the "Bottom-Up Review" 
<P>
     The first among Perry's priorities should be to dispense with
Aspin's Bottom-Up Review of United States defense strategy and
requirements. Conducted last year by the Department of Defense, this
review was an attempt by Aspin to establish a new force structure for
the U.S. military following the Cold War. 
<P>
     The findings of the review, released on September 1, were based
on faulty assumptions. For example, Aspin asserted that the U.S. must
be able to address four dangers to American interests around the
world. Two of these dangers -- the threats posed by the spread of
weapons of mass destruction and regional aggressors -- are relevant
and deserve the attention of the Secretary of Defense. The other two
-- threats to democracy in various countries around the globe and slow
economic growth at home -- have no place in military or security
planning and will lead to the inappropriate application of military
force. The threat to democracy was cited as a reason for engaging in
"peacemaking" operations in places such as Somalia and Haiti. But
Americans saw in 1993 how faulty that rationale was for deploying
troops overseas. As a result of poorly conceived military operations
based on the flawed assumptions of the Bottom-Up Review, for example,
about two dozen U.S. soldiers died in Somalia while trying
unsuccessfully to establish democracy in that war-ravaged nation.
<P>
     In addition to flawed assumptions, the Bottom-Up Review is marred
by contradictory findings. The Heritage Foundation conducted a
detailed analysis of the Bottom-Up Review and identified a number of
shortcomings. (See Lawrence T.  DiRita, et al., "Thumbs Down To The
Bottom-Up Review," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No.  957,
September 22, 1993.) The two principal ones, which alone justify
scrapping the Bottom-Up Review, are:

     <P>
1)   The force outlined in the Bottom-Up Review is too large to be
     purchased under President Clinton's five-year defense budget.
     This fact seemed to have been an issue in Aspin's departure. The
     week before his resignation, he was embroiled in a public dispute
     with the Director of the Office of Management and Budget over the
     need for an additional $30 billion to $50 billion over five years
     to pay for the Bottom-Up Review force.
<P>
2)   The force is too small to address the two "nearly simultaneous"
     major regional conflicts it is expected to handle. Once the
     forces for each conflict were allocated as outlined in the
     Bottom-Up Review, the U.S. would be left with no forces in
     reserve for a crisis of any size anywhere else in the world. Nor
     would there be additional forces to relieve those engaged in the
     two major regional conflicts which Aspin says the U.S. must be
     prepared to face. 
<P>
     As Perry develops a new blueprint for the nation's defense to
replace the Bottom-Up Review, he must start with a new assessment of
militarily significant U.S. vital interests. Those interests are to: 
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
     protect America's territory, borders, and airspace; 
<P>
     prevent a hostile, hegemonic power from arising in East Asia,
     Europe, the Persian Gulf, or Latin America;
<P>
     defend access to foreign trade; 
<P>
     protect the lives and well-being of individual Americans against
     such threats as drug trafficking and terrorism; and 
<P>
     maintain access to resources.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     Perry must build a military force adequate to defend these vital
interests. He should establish a minimum strength or "floor force"
below which U.S. forces will not be allowed to fall. This minimum
force, as determined by Heritage Foundation analysts in their
comprehensive review of national security priorities, consists of 16
Army divisions, 21 Air Force tactical wings, 400 Navy ships, and
177,000 active-duty Marines. (See Kim R.  Holmes, ed., A Safe and
Prosperous America:  A U.S.  Foreign and Defense Policy Blueprint
(Washington, D.C.:  The Heritage Foundation, 1993).) By fielding a
force of this size and providing necessary funding, Perry can avoid
the contradictions found in the Bottom-Up Review.

<P>
Regaining Control of the Defense Budget
<P>
     Another priority for Perry should be to regain control of defense
spending. Many in Congress are expressing concern that the Clinton
Administration is cutting defense too quickly. Three senior Republican
Senators -- Bob Dole of Kansas, Pete Domenici of New Mexico, and Strom
Thurmond of South Carolina -- stated in a December 13 letter to
President Clinton: "As Commander-in-Chief, we know you will not
delegate responsibility for our national security to those responsible
solely for budget matters."
<P>
     The Senators are alarmed that Clinton's Office of Management and
Budget (OMB) is exercising too much influence over defense spending
and is thus becoming the main bureaucratic force behind defense
reductions. A major reason for the failure of the Bottom-Up Review was
the insistence by OMB Director Leon Panetta that Aspin not exceed
annual spending limits regardless of the findings of his comprehensive
review of force requirements. Thus, instead of a "bottom-up" review,
Aspin actually conducted a "top down" review, starting with the budget
he was allocated and determining a strategy and force structure to
satisfy that budget.
<P>
     Perry should heed the Senators' warning and commit himself to a
defense budget that will fund the "floor force" outlined by Heritage
analysts. Only a force at least this size is adequate to defend
America's interests around the world. To do so, Perry should seek a
defense budget that will average $280 billion per year over the next
five years.
<P>
     To do this, of course, President Clinton must abandon one of the
assumptions of the Bottom-Up Review: that the primary cause of the
country's fiscal woes is a bloated defense budget. That assumption is
hard to justify. Defense spending has declined steadily since its peak
in 1986; it would have declined by 40 percent by 1997 even with the
much smaller cuts proposed by the Bush Administration. With defense
spending falling at such a rate, it cannot reasonably be argued that
defense spending is the cause of America's economic troubles.

<P>
Reversing the Downward Spiral of Military Readiness
<P>
     Yet another priority for Perry should be to prevent budget cuts
from endangering the combat readiness of U.S. forces. In May 1993,
Secretary Aspin observed that "right now, we've got the best, most
ready force in the world.... To keep it that way, we're going to have
to do something that has proved very, very difficult in the past, and
that is we're going to have to maintain readiness during a major
drawdown of our forces." (David C.  Morrison, "Ringing Hollow,"
National Journal, September 18, 1993, p.  2242.) 
<P>
     Aspin's promise to maintain the combat readiness of U.S. forces
has been echoed by Secretary Perry, who declared during his
confirmation hearings that "readiness is my first priority." (United
States Senate, Committee on Armed Services, Answers to Advance
Questions by Dr.  William J.  Perry, reprinted in Inside the Pentagon
Special Report, February 3, 1994, p.  10.) But there is evidence that
Aspin's earlier promises are already being broken. For example:
The Army's budget for modernizing its forces, based on requirements
identified during the Persian Gulf war, is under-funded by $1 billion.
("$1 Billion of Army Modernization Plans Unfunded," Inside the
Pentagon, July 7, 1993, p.  5.) 
<P>
For the first time in ten years, less than 90 percent of the Marine
Corps' equipment is ready to go to war; 
(General Carl E.  Mundy, Jr., Commandant of the Marine Corps,
statement for the record for the Senate Armed Services Committee, May
19, 1993.) the Marines' backlog in some maintenance categories has
gone from zero to $160 million in just two years. (Margo MacFarland,
"Nunn Warns That Outlay Problem in '95 Could Be Even Worse Than '94,"
Inside the Navy, June 21, 1993, p.  17.)
<P>
Because of a budget shortfall of $765 million, the Navy has a backlog
of 150 aircraft and 250 aircraft engines in need of maintenance.
(Admiral Frank B.  Kelso, II, statement for the record for the Senate
Armed Services Committee, May 19, 1993.) 
<P>
     These figures reflect the declining combat readiness of U.S.
forces, and these forces will become even weaker if the Bottom-Up
Review is implemented. (For a full discussion of U.S.  military
readiness, see John Luddy, "Stop the Slide Toward A Hollow Military,"
Heritage Foundation Backgrounder Update No.  209, January 14, 1994.)
As already noted, the Bottom-Up Review Force (BURF) will be spread too
thin for its size and capability, and will not be sufficient to defend
America's global interests. Worse yet, the Clinton Administration
hopes to find budget savings in critical procurement and development
accounts, which will slow the modernization of the force by delaying
the purchase of advanced weapons and technology. In the fiscal 1993
budget, for example, procurement spending was reduced by 17 percent.
This will have an impact on military readiness. 
<P>
     On top of this procurement reduction, Congress imposed a steep 11
percent real reduction in the research and development (R&D) budget in
fiscal 1994, a reduction far larger than that proposed by the
Administration. The deep cuts in procurement and R&D, combined with
the overcommitment of forces embodied in the Bottom-Up Review, is a
recipe for military disaster and the needless loss of American lives. 
<P>
     With his considerable experience managing several defense
technology companies, Perry should know first hand how important it is
for the U.S. to maintain its lead in military technology. The military
must not return to the "hollow force" of the 1970s, when U.S. forces
looked strong on paper but were nonetheless unable to respond
effectively if called to war. To avoid a weakening of America's combat
capability, the Clinton Administration and Congress together must:
<P>
Budget $1.4 trillion for defense from fiscal 1993 to 1997, or
approximately $280 billion per year.
<P>
Restore the proven ratio of two procurement dollars for every one
dollar spent on research and development.  This balances the
modernization of today's force with the development of the force of
tomorrow.
<P>
Scrap Aspin's Readiness Task Force. This group is composed of eight
retired senior officers who are supposed to warn if spending cuts are
having an adverse impact on readiness. This merely creates another
layer of bureaucracy where none is necessary. The service chiefs have
statutory responsibilities for leadership of their respective
services, and it is they who should warn the Secretary if readiness is
being sacrificed.
<P>
Reversing Decisions That Weaken U.S. Missile Defenses 
<P>
     Aspin established anti-missile defense priorities that are both
misdirected and under-funded. By focusing almost all funding on
developing defenses against short-range ballistic missiles, the
Administration is ignoring the importance of defending U.S. territory
against long-range ballistic missiles. Moreover, Aspin has proposed
reducing the budget for missile defense by almost $23 billion, or by
over 50 percent, during the period from fiscal 1995 through fiscal
1999. Even high-priority "theater" defenses against short-range
missiles will be cut by $4.5 billion over the same period.
<P>
     The U.S. has only the most limited anti-missile capability, and
U.S. territory is defenseless against long-range missile attacks. This
comes at a time when a prominent Russian politician, Vladimir
Zhirinovsky -- whose party won the largest share of the vote in
Russia's December 12 parliamentary election -- has begun rattling the
nuclear saber. Zhirinovsky, for example, identifies Los Angeles and
Washington as potential nuclear targets if the U.S. challenges
Russia's "right" to "carry out its great historic mission and free the
world of wars." (For a discussion of Zhirinovsky's writings, see Ariel
Cohen and Melana Zyla, "Zhirinovsky in His Own Words:  Excerpts from
The Final Thrust South," Heritage Foundation FYI, February 4, 1994.)
Although Boris Yeltsin still controls the nuclear arsenal of the
former Soviet Union, Zhirinovsky may be a candidate for the Russian
presidency in the next election. Without U.S. missile defenses to
deter him, a future President Zhirinovsky may present an American
President with a cruel dilemma: pay the extortion he has threatened or
sacrifice cities like Los Angeles and Washington. Removing this
vulnerability will at a minimum require that Perry restore full
funding to the anti-missile effort and proceed quickly with the most
promising technologies for effective missile defense: space-based
systems.
<P>
Restoring Strength to U.S. Naval Forces 
<P>
     The end of the Cold War and the dissolution of the Soviet Union
have made the world a somewhat safer place. With no other single power
able to challenge it on the battlefield or on the high seas, America's
need for an Army, Air Force, and Navy designed to fight a large and
extended campaign is greatly reduced. 
<P>
     At the same time, there remains greater uncertainty on the
geopolitical landscape. This puts a premium on mobile, flexible
forces. Such forces can be tailored to a specific crisis, transported
to it quickly, and reinforced with heavier forces if necessary. Naval
forces provide this combination of forward presence, mobility, and
flexibility. 
<P>
     A strategy that rests on the ability to project military power to
important regions of the world depends on a strong Navy. But the Aspin
plan for naval forces is inadequate. The Bottom-Up Review force
envisions 346 ships and 11 carriers, but overcommits that smaller
number to two "nearly simultaneous" regional conflicts and an
aggressive peacekeeping agenda. Put simply, Aspin's Navy could not
cover all of the contingencies envisioned in his Bottom-Up Review.
Perry can resolve this problem by declaring that he supports a 400-
ship Navy with 12 active aircraft carriers. 

<P>
 Ending Use of the Military for Social Experiments
<P>
     Secretary Perry will have to deal with the consequences of
Clinton's ill-advised campaign to end the military's ban on
homosexuals in the armed forces. Since a stricter version of the ban
was passed into law last fall, the Clinton Justice Department has been
timid in exercising its responsibility to prosecute open homosexuals
in uniform. For example, after a three-judge panel of the D.C. Circuit
Court ruled, in a case last November involving a homosexual former
Naval Academy midshipman, that the homosexual ban was
unconstitutional, the Clinton Justice Department refused to appeal the
case to the full circuit court. 
<P>
     At least three prominent Senators on the Armed Services Committee
-- Chairman Sam Nunn (D-GA), Dan Coats (R-IN), and Strom Thurmond (R-
SC) -- have indicated that they may re-open debate in the Senate if
the Administration fails to fully enforce the ban. (Rowan Scarborough,
"Two GOP Senators Set To Revive Debate on Gays in Military," The
Washington Times, January 7, 1993, p.  3.) The American people, the
Administration, and above all the armed forces do not need a new fight
on this issue. Perry, therefore, must reaffirm the Defense
Department's sound arguments for the ban, and pressure the
Administration to enforce it to the utmost. 
<P>
     As for assigning women to combat positions, much damage has
already been done. To accommodate the career aspirations of women
officers, restrictions on women combat pilots in the Navy and Air
Force have been lifted; the Pentagon is still considering allowing
women into ground combat assignments in infantry, artillery, and tank
units. Experience has shown that the introduction of women into combat
units reduces military readiness for a variety of reasons, including
the innate physiological differences between the sexes. Moreover, in
the one historical case where women were deliberately placed in combat
-- in Israel during the 1948 Arab-Israeli War -- they were removed
within weeks. The reason: It was clear that men reacted to the
presence of women by trying to protect them and aiding them when they
became casualties instead of continuing to attack. The Israelis also
learned that unit morale was seriously damaged when men saw women
killed and injured on the battlefield. (Presidential Commission on the
Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces, International Trip Report,
September 14-27, 1992.)
<P>
     There is not a single argument based on national security or
military readiness which supports the idea of placing women in combat
units; until one is made, this social experiment must be reversed. As
Secretary of Defense, Perry must take this message to the President.
Within the Defense Department, he should also:
<P>
Overturn Secretary Aspin's decision to rescind the "risk rule," which
prevents the assignment of women to military units where there is
substantial risk of direct contact with the enemy; 
<P>
Postpone any further action regarding women until full Senate hearings
are held on this issue;
<P>
Review the findings of the 1992 Presidential Commission on the
Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces, which recommended against
assigning women to combat aircraft and ground units; 
<P>
Review physical and performance requirements to ensure that men and
women are held to the same high standards; and
<P>
Ensure that women and men are subject to equal disciplinary standards.
<P>


CONCLUSION
<P>
     The very fact that Secretary Perry was Clinton's third choice for
the post in one year indicates much disarray in the Administration's
national security policy. The President's discomfort and lack of
interest toward the military is palpable. The press widely reported
the comment of one Administration adviser, who wished to remain
unnamed, who noted the obvious during the selection process for
Aspin's replacement:
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
     They really just wanted to get the Pentagon off the screen.
     Every time it was on, it was trouble that interfered with
     the President's agenda. Their attitude was, if they could
     subcontract out the Pentagon, they would. (Ann Devroy and
     Barton Gellman, "How Search Finally Led To Perry," The
     Washington Post, January 25, 1994, p.  A1.)</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     The President's responsibility as Commander in Chief is enshrined
in the Constitution. No other duty is more important for a U.S.
President -- not reforming health care, welfare, or even stopping
domestic crime, as important as these issues are to the American
people. History will hold the President, not his secretary of defense,
accountable for the type of disaster seen last year in Somalia. More
such disasters surely will come unless Secretary Perry can convince
the President to turn around his defense policies. If the events of
1993 failed to teach the President this lesson, then tyrants around
the world such as North Korea's Kim Il-Sung and even Russia's Vladimir
Zhirinovsky may do so.

Backgrounder Update #196<BR>

(published at 4 pages)
<P>
(Updating Backgrounder Update No. 190, "North Korea's Nuclear Threat:
A Test for Bill Clinton," March 23, 1993, and Asian Studies Center
Backgrounder No. 119, "Responding to the Looming North Korean Nuclear
Threat," January 29, 1992.)

<P>

     There is little comfort for the United States or the world in
North Korea's June 11 decision to "suspend" its March 12 withdrawal
from the Nuclear Non-proliferation Treaty (NPT). The crisis North
Korea has precipitated by trying to build nuclear weapons is not over.
North Korea's latest decision, following intense discussions from June
2 to 10 between high-level U.S. and North Korean officials, did not
include a pledge by the North to resume international inspection of
its nuclear facilities. There is a real risk that North Korea is
negotiating with the U.S. merely to buy time to build its nuclear
weapons -- an event that may be imminent. Just last February, CIA
Director James Woolsey warned Congress that North Korea may have
enough nuclear material to build one bomb. President Bill Clinton must
now increase American pressure, in cooperation with South Korea and
Japan, to convince North Korea that it can no longer delay the
termination of its nuclear weapons program.

<P>
<B> PREVENTING NORTH KOREA FROM BUYING TIME</B>
<P>
     North Korea's June 11 announcement that suspended its decision to
withdraw from the NPT was correctly described by Secretary of State
Warren Christopher as an "interim step." The next step -- and it
should be taken immediately -- is to convince North Korea to resume
inspections of its nuclear facilities by the International Atomic
Energy Agency (IAEA) and then by South Korean inspectors. Washington
must insure that the latest diplomatic "concession" by Pyongyang does
not merely grant it more time to build nuclear weapons. Unfortunately,
delaying tactics and a disregard for its promises are characteristic
of Pyongyang's efforts to stave off action by the international
community, as the following examples demonstrate: 
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Although North Korea signed the NPT in 1985, it refused until
     1992 to abide by treaty obligations that required international
     inspection of its nuclear facilities. 
<P>
     After finally allowing six IAEA teams to visit in 1992, and when
     an inspection late that year showed that North Korea may have
     produced more plutonium than Pyongyang had previously admitted,
     the North halted IAEA inspections. When pressure mounted on North
     Korea to resume inspections, it became the first country ever to
     announce its intention to withdrawal from the 150-member NPT. 
<P>
     North Korea has refused to honor a December 1991 agreement that
     would have allowed the North and South to inspect each other's
     nuclear facilities. This agreement was negotiated to create a
     nuclear weapons-free Korean Peninsula. To assist it, the U.S.
     withdrew its tactical nuclear weapons from South Korea in late
     1991.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
     North Korea's nuclear program is large and serious. Its one known
nuclear research facility, near the city of Yongbyon, has two nuclear
reactors. When both reactors begin operation -- perhaps later this
year -- they may be able to produce up to 115 pounds of plutonium a
year, enough for about seven nuclear weapons the size of those used by
the U.S. against Japan in 1945. 
<P>

<B> NORTH KOREA'S NUCLEAR WEAPONS PROGRAM IS A GLOBAL THREAT</B>
<P>
     A nuclear-armed North Korea threatens U.S. allies and American
security interests in Asia. Nuclear weapons will further enhance North
Korea's military power, which includes one million men under arms,
over 700 aircraft, and a large arsenal of biological and chemical
weapons. The North's possession of nuclear arms also will multiply its
ability to threaten South Korea and the 37,000 U.S. troops stationed
there. A nuclear-armed North Korea could increase pressure on South
Korea and Japan to obtain nuclear weapons, which will further
destabilize Northeast Asia. And just as Pyongyang is hawking SCUD
ballistic missiles to such dangerous Middle East states as Iran and
Syria, North Korea eventually may sell nuclear bombs to terrorist
states like Libya or Iran. This would significantly increase the
terrible possibility that Israeli or American civilian populations
could be subjected to nuclear blackmail or detonations.
<P>

<B> AMERICAN LEADERSHIP IS NECESSARY TO STOP NORTH KOREA</B>
<P>
     As North Korea's possession of nuclear weapons would threaten
America and the world, the United States must provide the leadership
necessary to end North Korea's threat. This means that Washington, in
close consultation with Seoul, must set goals and a timetable for
results from Pyongyang. The long-term goal must be to convince North
Korea to terminate its nuclear weapons program. If this goal is not
met by early next year, it may be too late to stop North Korea from
building one or several nuclear weapons. The immediate goal must be to
convince North Korea to begin inspections of its nuclear facilities by
IAEA and South Korean inspectors. Such inspections must begin by the
end of July, to give the IAEA and other international experts time to
determine the extent of Pyongyang's nuclear weapons program. If
Pyongyang refuses, then it will have shown its duplicity once again.
Clinton must then forge a cooperative effort among South Korea, Japan,
China, and Russia to convince, or perhaps even force, North Korea to
abandon its nuclear ambitions. If necessary, this pressure should
include:
<P>
<B> Steadfast support for South Korea</B>. 
    <P> The U.S. must ensure that North Korea's nuclear weapons program
will not jeopardize America's security guarantees for South Korea. An
essential element of this guarantee is American steadfastness in
maintaining its ground and air forces in South Korea until North Korea
ends its nuclear weapons program. When Clinton visits South Korea on
July 10 and 11, he should strongly reaffirm America's commitment to
defend South Korea.
<P>
<B> Rhetorical pressure</B>. 
<P>     Clinton must use his influence as leader of the free world to
identify North Korea as a global nuclear threat. During the G-7
industrial nations summit in Japan in early July, Clinton should seek
a statement condemning North Korea's nuclear weapons program.
<P>
<B> Increased United Nations pressure</B>. 
  <P>   On May 11 the U.N. Security Council passed a resolution
criticizing North Korea that was deliberately cushioned in diplomatic
verbiage to prevent China from vetoing the resolution. Pyongyang
nevertheless condemned that resolution. The next U.N. resolution must
be tougher and include the possibility of U.N.-enforced economic
sanctions.
<P>
<B> China's and Japan's cooperation</B>. 
<P>     Japan's cooperation is critical if economic sanctions become
necessary. Because the U.S. has no trade with North Korea, the U.S.
must ask Japan to be ready to cut its nearly $500 million a year trade
with North Korea. A far more important challenge for the U.S. will be
getting China's cooperation with economic sanctions. China, for
example, is the source of 60 percent of North Korea's energy needs.
<P>
<B> Offer of better relations</B>.  
   <P>  Clinton should offer better relations with North Korea only if it
terminates its nuclear weapons program. Such an offer should include
better diplomatic relations with, and more trade and investment from,
South Korea, Japan, and the U.S. However, such benefits should not be
conferred for piecemeal concessions by Pyongyang, such as the
resumption of international nuclear inspections. 
<P>
<B> Military options</B>. 
   <P>  A new war on the Korean Peninsula would be a catastrophe. It
could devastate South Korea and cost far more American and allied
lives than the recent Persian Gulf War. Yet, impoverished North Korea
remains desperate and volatile. Clinton must not rule out military
options and the U.S. should be prepared to repel any North Korean
attack on the South.
<P>
     Pyongyang's June 11 suspension of its withdrawal from the NPT
prevented -- for now -- North Korea's nuclear threat from becoming
Bill Clinton's first major foreign policy crisis. Yet, North Korea's
nuclear weapons potential remains a major challenge to America's
future in Asia. Resolution of this threat -- peacefully if possible --
will ensure that America benefits from Asia's increasing economic
growth. If the President does not take resolute action now, first to
convince North Korea to resume international inspections of its
nuclear facilities and then to end its nuclear weapons program, the
result is likely to be increased instability in Asia. Failure by
Clinton will likely result in several disasters: rising prospects of
nuclear terrorism, nuclear proliferation in Asia and the Middle East,
and possibly even the end of the system of American-Asian strategic
cooperation that has maintained peace and prosperity in Asia for
decades.

Memo to President-elect Clinton #14<BR>

<hr size = 3 width = 30%>
</center>
<P>


<UL>      I believe it is time for a new era in environmental
      protection which uses the market to help us get our
      environment back on track - to recognize that Adam Smith's
      invisible hand can have a green thumb... [In] certain
      settings, this results-oriented approach can cut compliance
      costs, shrink regulatory bureaucracies, enlist corporate
      support, take environmental policy away from the
      specialists and lobbyists, and open it up more to the
      general public.<BR>
                   <I>  Bill Clinton,<BR> 
                     Drexel University, Earth Day, April 22, 1992.</I></UL>
<P>
EXECUTIVE SUMMARY
<P>      President-elect Clinton, if you really intend to use market
forces to reach reasonable environmental objectives, and make results
the test for legislative or regulatory action, that truly would be a
welcome and positive change in environmental policy. To accomplish
this sensible change, you will need to address a number of issues from
a fresh perspective. If you do so, you have the opportunity to end the
traditional conflict that pits environmental protection against jobs,
and give substance to your campaign claim that the conflict is a
"false choice."

<P> If you do not approach environmental policy in this different
way, however, and instead merely add a new layer of environmental
regulations to existing ones, you are doomed to fail not in only your
economic mission, but in your environmental mission as well. Contrary
to the "false choice" argument, today's environmental policies
generally do pit environmental protection against jobs. And the longer
the list of environmental regulations, the longer the unemployment
lines. 

 <P>     To give Adam Smith a green thumb, as you say you wish to do,
will require carefully crafted action on environmental issues. Five in
particular will confront your new Administration: 
<P>
1) Superfund. Superfund legislation will be up for reauthorization
      next year, providing an excellent opportunity for reform.
<P>
2)    Global Warming and Carbon Taxes. Last year's Earth Summit did
      not put this issue to rest. There is likely to be a bill
      introduced in Congress to combat the alleged global warming
      problem, through the creation of a tax on carbon dioxide
      emissions.
<P>
3)    Fuel Economy Standards. There is certain to be legislation
      introduced to raise the average fuel economy for a car maker's
      fleet to 40-45 miles per gallon.
<P>
4)    Wetlands. Wetlands disputes continued throughout the Bush
      Administration without resolution. This year, the final
      resolution of the subject will rest on your shoulders.
<P>
5)    Solid Waste and Recycling. Solid waste legislation is up for
      reauthorization, and some in Congress wish to alter radically
      the substance of the Act.

<P> Addressing these and other environmental issues from the sound
approach you have outlined requires you to shape policies using three
underlying techniques:

<P>Use of markets and property rights where possible to distribute
environmental "goods" efficiently and equitably. This will help you to
promote conservation and reduce pollution to acceptable levels. 
<P>
Base policies on sound and credible science, to ensure that problems
are real, and to determine the true levels of risk. This will mean
ignoring orchestrated media hysteria and "expert" testimony by movie
stars, and asking instead for hard scientific evidence.
<P>
Develop a priority list of environmental problems, based on the extent
of the possible harm each appears to pose and the cost of reducing
that harm to acceptable levels. This will allow Americans to receive
the maximum environmental "bang for the buck" -- or to achieve
environmental objectives with the fewest pink slips for American
workers. 

<P> Applying these techniques to the major environmental issues
before you suggest a number of specific actions you should take.
<P>SUPERFUND
<P>
Action 1: Require the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA) to set
immediately a specific cancer risk level that it defines as an
unacceptable risk. Currently, EPA can choose between different risk
levels to apply in its determination of whether a particular site
poses a cancer risk. This gives arbitrary power to bureaucrats without
giving Americans a guaranteed degree of safety. 
<P>
Action 2: Factor real exposure levels into decisions to list sites for
clean-up. Sites should be listed for remediaton only if they actually
will expose people to risk.
<P>
Action 3: Require EPA to develop within six months a list for
different Superfund site characteristics, together with the required
level of clean-up for each site. It is unnecessary to clean-up all
sites to the same degree; some pose more risk than others.
<P>
Action 4: Draw up a priority list for clean-up of orphan Superfund
sites based on the site characteristics developed by EPA, the exposure
classification, and the estimated remediation costs. Essentially the
list should correspond to a formula, determining overall risk per
dollar of remediation costs. This will end the current system of
relying on ad hoc decisions as to which sites are more important.
<P>
Action 5: Immediately instruct EPA to require lowest-bid contractors
to post assurance, such as an interest-bearing bond, when awarded
contracts for remediation of orphan sites. This will reduce the
overall cost borne by the government.
<P>
Action 6: Urge Congress to require private parties responsible for
remediation of privately owned sites that are listed as potential
Superfund sites, or low priority sites, to provide assurance. This
will ensure that monies remain available for remediation even if the
private party goes bankrupt. Meanwhile, society's economic resources
will not be squandered on sites that may never pose a threat.
<P>
Action 7: Urge Congress to reform Superfund's inequitable methods for
findings of liability. Joint and several liability currently applies
to findings of liability for remediation of Superfund sites. This
means that those responsible for only minute quantities of hazardous
waste become liable for the full costs of multi-million-dollar clean-
ups. Further, innocent owners who purchased their property before
passage of Superfund legislation should not be liable for the clean-up
of their property since they neither contaminated the sites nor were
given notice of liability. 
<P>
GLOBAL WARMING 
<P>
Action 1: Pledge continued support for increasing funding levels for
global climate change research. Most of what we know about global
warming has been learned within the last three to four years, thanks
to increased research. This trend should continue.
<P>
Action 2: Within 100 days, open up the relevant government archives to
researchers, subject to national security concerns. This would allow
researchers to gain access to a wealth of raw data collected over the
decades by America's intelligence agencies. Any access must, of
course, be tightly controlled and limited to this purpose.
<P>
Action 3: Announce that you will oppose legislative efforts to impose
a carbon tax. A carbon tax would cause the loss of an estimated
600,000 jobs and cost the nation approximately $100 billion per year.
This is too great a price to pay to insure against the possible
consequences of an unproven theory in light of more reasonable
approaches -- such as increasing the knowledge base.
<P>
FUEL ECONOMY (CAFE) 
<P>
Action 1: Announce immediately that you will veto legislative attempts
to raise CAFE standards. The Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE)
standards regulate the average miles per gallon that a car maker's
fleet must obtain. Advocates of raising the current standard from 27.5
mpg to 40 or 45 mpg ignore the fact that this policy change will
result in thousands of avoidable highway fatalities.
<P>
Action 2: Press for new legislation to replace CAFE standards with
pollution fees. These would be directly proportional to the amount of
pollution emitted from automobile tailpipes, making polluters pay the
costs of their actions.
<P>
WETLANDS
<P>
Action 1: Instruct EPA to exclude from protection those wetlands from
which pollutants cannot in practice migrate to "waters of the United
States." These would include wetlands where the physical structure or
location of the wetlands makes it impossible for pollutants to migrate
to a "water of the United States" -- the term used in legislation --
via normal water flows. This will return the protection of wetlands to
its original meaning.
<P>
Action 2: Within the first 100 days, issue an executive order
requiring the government to pay landowners the value of their
confiscated property rights when development is denied to protect
societally beneficial wetlands. It antithetical to the American system
of government not to do so. If government confiscation of private
property rights benefits the public, the public should pay for it --
not some hapless landowner.
<P>
Action 3: If you want to protect all wetlands -- even those where
pollutants cannot migrate to "waters of the United States" -- enact a
Wetland Protection Act giving EPA the authority to do so. Currently,
the authority is lacking.
<P>
SOLID WASTE
<P>
Action 1: Announce that you will oppose mandatory recycling or
packaging reduction legislation. This will allow the nation to devote
its scarce economic resources to truly important environmental
problems.
<P>
Action 2: Within the first 100 days, issue an executive order to
eliminate most of the current costly landfill regulations and require
financial assurances from operators. This will allow operators to
devise the least costly way to contain pollutants. This order should
require landfill operators to provide financial assurances, such as
interest bearing bonds, to assure compliance or funds for clean-up. 
<P>
      President-elect Clinton, you said during your Earth Day speech
last year that you prefer using markets to regulation. Now is the time
to translate that preference into public policy. This will take
backbone. Although you want to "open [environmental policy] up more to
the general public" by instituting market reforms, you will face
fierce opposition from environmental lobbyists that have a strong
vested interest in the regulatory status quo. But if you wish to use
markets to increase protection of the environment without destroying
jobs in the process, you must fundamentally overhaul the methods used
by government.

<P> Specifically, you must replace Superfund and landfill regulation
with a system of financial assurances. You also must substitute for
CAFE standards, which needlessly squander lives, a system of fees
based on the amount of pollution emitted from automobile tailpipes.
You must pay landowners for the value of the property taken in
wetlands-regulating confiscation. And you must quickly and
exponentially increase our knowledge of the global warming issue
through fostering increased research and by opening up the relevant
archives. Simultaneously, you should resist imposing a economically
devastating carbon tax that will throw hundreds of thousands of
Americans out of work to address what may be a theory full of "hot
air."

<P> Finally, and most important, you must create a priority list of
environmental concerns. Base this list on the extent of the harm
caused by the problem divided by the cost to address the problem. This
will provide you with a mechanism to obtain the maximum environmental
protection possible for the amount of economic resources used. Without
this list, costs will be needlessly high and environmental protection
will be needlessly low.
<P>
SUPERFUND: REFORM BASED ON RISK 

<P> The Superfund legislation was enacted in 1980, under the formal
name of the Comprehensive Environmental Response, Compensation, and
Liability Act or CERCLA (pronounced sir-kluh). CERCLA has failed
utterly in its mission of cleaning up old hazardous waste sites.
Billions of dollars have been spent, but large portions of this money
has been spent on legal costs, not clean-up. In fact, only 149 of the
1,275 listed superfund sites have been cleaned up. To clean the
remaining sites, EPA's costs alone -- excluding the costs to
businesses and insurance companies -- will run approximately $40
billion. Also many more sites will be listed, thus driving costs up
even higher. Total costs to the nation in the next thirty years are
estimated at $300 billion in 1990 dollars. (General Accounting Office,
"Superfund Program Management," High Risk Series, December 1992.) 

<P> Although EPA has considerably improved its oversight management
of this program since the mid-1980s, the agency still has a long way
to go. Many of the factors evaluated in the site listing process are
given varying importance, depending on the particular EPA decision-
maker. The uncertainty and poor decision-making that can result from
this practice needs to end. Moreover, Congress should recognize that,
while the legislation was well-intentioned, it has become a vehicle to
prosecute innocent landowners and businesses through the liability
laws applicable under CERCLA. Not only that, the distorted legal
framework for findings of liability unnecessarily depresses the real
estate market by discouraging lenders from making loans. Bills have
been introduced in Congress and rules have been proposed by EPA to
resolve this problem. (For example, in Congress, H.R. 4494 was
introduced by Representative John LaFalce and S. 2827 was introduced
by Senator Jake Garn in 1990; the proposed EPA rule was published in
the Federal Register, June 24, 1991, 5(121), p.28798.) But the issue
remains unsolved. (Jan Paul Acton, Lloyd S. Dixon, Superfund and
Transaction Costs: The Experiences of Insurers and Very Large
Industrial Firms," The Institute for Civil Justice, Rand, 1992.)
Congress should remedy this situation.
<P>
The key changes needed:
<P>
Action 1: Require EPA to set immediately a specific cancer risk level
that it defines as an unacceptable risk. Currently, EPA uses a range of "risks" to define when the
probability of contracting cancer crosses the line from being an
acceptable risk to an unacceptable risk. So one EPA official may
consider a site to be "hazardous," and thus subject to Superfund
legislation, if the risk of cancer from the materials at the site is
one in ten thousand over a lifetime. But another EPA official may use
a risk level of one in a million to determine if a site is
"hazardous." Still others may use various different risk levels,
depending on the site being examined. 

<P>      There is no justification for using a range of risk. The problem
is obvious. This range results in some unnecessary site clean-ups and
some sites remaining unlisted which possibly should be cleaned up.
("Striking a Better Balance: Improving Superfund Clean-up Decisions,"
Report to Coalition on Superfund, Arthur D. Little, Inc., May 1992,
page 18.)

<P> Mr. Clinton, you should instruct EPA to choose a single,
specific risk level that is acceptable, and to justify that decision.
From that point onward, EPA's discretion to pick an arbitrary standard
should cease.

<P>Action 2: Factor real exposure levels into decisions to list sites for
clean-up. 
<P>      The Office of Technology Assessment has found that clean-up
decisions at the majority of Superfund sites are based on hypothetical
future risks rather than on actual or likely risks. ("Coming Clean:
Superfund Problems Can Be Solved... ," Office of Technology
Assessment, October, 1989.) This means that remote or inaccessible
contaminated sites that pose no current or even any likely future
danger to people's health are given just as high a priority as sites
that expose people to a real present danger.

 <P>     Superfund sites should instead be classified based on categories
of actual, likely, and potential risks of human exposure to the site.
The way to do this, Mr. Clinton, is for you to instruct EPA by
executive order to classify sites according to these categories. The
exposure level risks within each category should be given a numerical
weight by the EPA so that the relative risk of each site can be
determined.
<P>
Action 3: Require EPA within six months to develop a list for
different Superfund site characteristics, together with the required
level of clean-up for each site, such as an industrial or residential
area. 
<P>      Within each site type, EPA would then assign a different level
of clean-up required, with justification for the designated level. For
instance, in a residential area, where the risk of exposure to
children playing in contaminated soil is relatively high, the de-
contaminated soil would need to be cleaner than the de-contaminated
soil in, say, a warehouse park, where less direct exposure would be
anticipated. A range of clean-up requirements of this kind would cut
Superfund compliance costs at some sites enormously, thus reducing
CERCLA's burden on the economy.
<P>
Action 4: Based on the site characteristics developed by EPA, draw up
a priority list for Superfund clean-up.
<P>      To deal with this, you should instruct EPA to develop a priority
list for superfund clean-up. This priority list would be based on the
exposure classification and the type of site, as well as estimated
remediation costs. The list would be derived from a formula allowing
EPA to arrive at an overall risk per dollar of remediation costs. This
can be accomplished by issuing an executive order.
<P>
Action 5: Immediately instruct EPA to require lowest-bid contractors
to post assurance, such as an interest-bearing bond, when awarded
contracts for remediation of orphan sites.
<P>      Whenever solvent liable parties cannot be found to clean up old
hazardous sites, the government becomes responsible for these "orphan"
sites. Contractors for orphan site remediation often have been paid
substantial sums even if no work is performed. Worse, contractors that
fail to clean up a site properly increase the total costs borne by the
government -- and ultimately the taxpayer.

<P>      Under new rules, lowest-bid contractors of orphan sites should
be required to post an interest-bearing bond when awarded remediation
contracts. This would ensure that monies were available for
remediation if the contractor improperly cleaned the site or became
insolvent. Contractors should be made legally liable for the
remediation and be given total freedom to choose methods of clean-up
without permission from the government. If the contractor failed to
remediate the site adequately for any reason, then the bond would
become forfeit and another contractor could be selected and paid with
the bond proceeds. (See Richard Stroup, "Selling Orphan (Superfund)
Sites," Political Economy Research Center, Bozeman, Montana, September
25, 1988.)
<P>
Action 6: Urge Congress to require private parties responsible for
remediation of privately owned sites that are listed as potential
Superfund sites, or low priority sites, to provide assurance.
<P>      In dealing with potential, or low priority, Superfund sites, EPA
is faced with a dilemma. If solvent liable parties can be identified,
the government is encouraged to require remediation; if it waits, the
liable parties may become insolvent, leaving the government with an
orphan site. Yet the site may never pose a threat to warrant clean-up.
To avoid the unnecessary costs resulting from this situation, liable
parties should be required to provide assurance.
<P>
Action 7: Urge Congress to reform Superfund's inequitable methods for
findings of liability.
<P>      Two particular changes are needed. The first is to eliminate
joint and several liability. This concept is a sham designed to find
somebody -- anybody -- other than Uncle Sam to pay for clean-ups of
hazardous waste. Under the doctrine the "responsible" person often has
no part or only a small part in creating the waste problem. If, say,
someone has caused 2 percent of a hazardous waste problem, that
individual or institution will become liable for the full cost of the
remedy. In practice, this means that a firm with "deep pockets" pays
for the clean-up of wastes created by another individual or firm. The
law should be amended to require that the percentage of clean-up costs
for which an individual or body is liable is no greater than the
percentage of the contamination they contributed.

<P>      The second necessary change is to divorce the status of property
ownership from findings of liability. 

<P>      What happens today is that a landowner who bought property that
was contaminated before 1980, when Superfund was enacted, is legally
responsible for the total cost of clean-up. Yet the owner neither
caused the waste nor could be given notice of liability for any clean-
up, since Superfund was not law at the time. This ownership basis for
liability leads to a host of problems. One is that it makes lending
institutions wary of repossessing properties in default because the
lender would then become liable for cleaning up any old hazardous
wastes that may be on the property. And since the collateral provides
less security because the lender is wary of foreclosure, the lenders
are less willing to make loans. This depresses segments of the real
estate market. (See footnotes 2 and 3 and accompanying text for a
brief description of actions proposed to correct this problem.) 
<P>
GLOBAL WARMING 
  <P>    Global warming, also known as the "enhanced greenhouse effect,"
is a theory that has gained growing attention over the last decade.
Basically the theory predicts that human-caused greenhouse gases such
as carbon dioxide will increase the average temperature of the earth.
This theory is the mirror image of the ice age theory popular about
fifteen or twenty years ago. Although the vast majority of climate
change scientists do not believe a runaway greenhouse effect will
occur, a vocal minority has maintained its probability. 

<P>      Although a severe greenhouse effect is improbable, whether more
minor atmospheric changes will occur within the next century is
subject to much debate. (John Shanahan, "Guide to the Global Warming
Issue," Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 896, May 21, 1992.) If
warming does occur, however, most of the temperature increase would
occur at night and at high latitudes, which could be beneficial,
rather than increasing daytime high temperatures. Moreover, most of
the models upon which climate change predictions are premised have
been flawed. For instance, one of the most widely known models
effectively moved the earth's orbit 2 million miles closer to the sun.
(The study, by Sukryo Munabe and Richard Wetherald of the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) in 1975 noted that it
had increased the sun's output by 6 percent above its actual output,
which is equivalent to moving the earth's orbit 2 million miles closer
to the sun. Still other models have incorrectly forecast that clouds
warm the earth, but new studies show that clouds actually cool the
earth; this is significant since cloud cover is increasing. V.

Ahmad, D. Hartmann, "Cloud-Radiative Forcing and Climate: Results from
the Earth Radiation Budget Experiment," Science, Vol. 243, January 6,
1989.)
<P>
Action 1: Pledge continued levels of research funding on global
climate change.
<P>      Most of what scientists know about global climate change has
been learned within the last three to four years due to the Bush
Administration's massive research effort. The U.S. now spends about
$1.4 billion per year -- more than all other nations on earth combined
-- on climate research, and the funding has been going up at the rate
of about 25 percent per year. It is likely that our knowledge will
grow ten-fold again within the next five years.

<P>Action 2: Within 100 days, open up the relevant federal archives to
researchers, subject to national security concerns.
<P>      The scientific debate over global warming could be improved if
you would order agencies to open up the relevant national archives to
researchers -- subject to legitimate national security concerns, such
as sources and methods of intelligence-gathering. This would be useful
because surveillance satellites and aircraft, submarines, and oceanic
vessels have collected a vast amount of data that can be used to
accelerate research. For example, the material could help resolve
questions about past contours and thaw rates of polar caps, ocean
chemistry, and many other issues.
<P>
Action 3: Announce that you will oppose legislative efforts to impose
a carbon tax. 
 <P>     Action to limit carbon dioxide emissions to lessen the effects
of the theoretical runaway greenhouse effect will be costly to jobs
and put an undue burden on household budgets. Yet there is no firm
evidence that runaway global warming will occur -- in fact, according
to a survey by the environmental group Geenpeace, the vast majority of
scientists believe it will not. (Greenpeace Press Release, "Climate
Scientists Fear Effects of Understanding Global Warming, Poll Shows,"
February 9, 1992.)

   <P>   Taxes on carbon emissions are popularly viewed as the best way
to reduce carbon output levels to 1990 levels by the year 2000. But if
carbon taxes are imposed, many Americans would be thrown out of jobs.
A study by the CONSAD Research Corporation found that five years after
the imposition of a $100 per ton carbon tax -- the tax amount needed
to reduce carbon to 1990 levels -- some 600,000 jobs would be lost.
The tax also would reduce total GNP by approximately 2 percent, or
$100 billion. (Congressional Budget Office, "Carbon Charges as a
Response to Global Warming: The Effects of Taxing Fossil Fuels,"
August 1990.) This is the equivalent to a $1,250 tax on every
household in America. The price of basic goods would rise
substantially. For instance, according to the Department of Energy,
electrical and natural gas heating costs would rise by 27 percent.
("Limiting Net Greenhouse Gas Emissions in the United States," U.S.
Department of Energy, Office of Environmental Analysis, Deputy Under
Secretary for Policy, Planning and Analysis, September 1991.)

<P>      A study by the George C. Marshall Institute has found that "a
five year delay in limiting carbon emissions will make the world
warmer in the next century by at most one tenth of a degree [Celsius],
compared to how warm it would be if there was no delay." (see Marshall
Institute, "Global Warming Update: Recent Scientific Findings"
(Washington, D.C. 1992).) Since our knowledge will increase
dramatically in those five years, and the theory may well prove false
or overstated, taking expensive action now probably would be
foolhardy.
<P>
      
FUEL ECONOMY (CAFE)
<P>      Corporate Average Fuel Economy (CAFE) standards , enacted in
1975 in response to the oil crisis of 1973, were designed to stabilize
oil at low prices. Today, CAFE mandates that automobile manufacturers
build cars that average 27.5 miles per gallon.

 <P>     Today, the primary support for CAFE standards comes from the
environmental community, which is concerned with energy conservation
and the perceived threat of global warming, (Global warming is
addressed in the following section.) which, if it is occurring, would
be exacerbated by carbon emissions from cars. Unfortunately, CAFE is
the wrong tool to address these concerns, and a dangerous one.
Alternative policies would be far less burdensome and far more
effective.

<P>      The most serious problem with CAFE standards, to put it bluntly,
is that they kill people. According to economists Robert Crandall of
the Brookings Institution and John Graham of the Harvard School of
Public Health, 1989 model cars are about 500 pounds lighter than they
would have been in the absence of the 27.5 miles per gallon fuel
economy standard. Crandall and Graham estimate that this weight
reduction will result in 2,500 additional deaths and 25,000 additional
serious injuries for the model year fleet. (Robert W. Crandall and
John D. Graham, "New Fuel-Economy Standards, The Politics of Energy,"
The American Enterprise, March/April 1991, p. 68.)

 <P>     If fuel efficiency standards are raised further, even more
deaths can be anticipated. If the standard is raised to 40 mpg, deaths
will likely surge to between 4,800 to 8,600 additional deaths per
model year fleet. That is why Bush Energy Secretary Admiral James
Watkins referred to a 1991 bill to raise CAFE standards as the
"Highway Death Act of 1991." (For further information, see William G.
Laffer III, "Auto Cafe Standards: Unsafe and Unwise At Any Level,"
Heritage Foundation Backgrounder No. 825, April 19, 1991.)

<P>      Proponents of raising the standards will tell you that, if
standards are phased in slowly, car makers will be able to make cars
just as safe through technological improvement, even if they are
lighter, or that cars will be more efficient so that car weights will
not need to be reduced. Both arguments may be true, but they miss the
point. If lighter cars in the future will be more safe, future cars
with today's weights will be safer still. Similarly, if future cars
can be made more fuel-efficient at today's weights, then they can be
made just as efficient as today's cars, but at heavier weights. In
either case, thousands more Americans will die each year as a direct
result of the CAFE standards.
<P>
Action 1: Immediately announce that you will veto legislative attempts
to raise CAFE standards.
 <P>     This legislation will surely be forthcoming in your first year
in office. If CAFE legislation receives your signature, the political
responsibility for those deaths will rest squarely on your shoulders.
Press stories that question whether Johnny who crashed into a
telephone pole would have lived but for "Clinton's CAFE Act" could
well result.
<P>
Action 2: Press for new legislation to replace CAFE standards with
pollution fees.
<P>      Instead of relying on regulatory bureaucracies, Mr. Clinton, it
is time, in your own words, to use "the market to get our environment
back on track." In areas of the country with air pollution problems,
fees should be assessed according to the severity of the local
pollution problem, the emission level of each individual vehicle, and
the number of miles each vehicle is driven. Since 50 percent of all
car pollution is caused by 10 percent of the cars, this will provide a
powerful economic incentive for owners of polluting cars to tune up or
scrap their cars. CAFE standards, on the other hand, place financial
penalties on those Americans who buy new cars, which are already the
cleanest cars on the road.
<P>
WETLANDS PROTECTION ISSUES 
<P>      Wetlands loss has been extensive since the founding of the
nation. An estimated 53 percent of the original number of acres has
been lost -- still leaving over 100 million acres. ("Natural Resources
Management Issues," General Accounting Office, Transition Series,
December 1992.) Moreover, most of the loss was attributable to
government draining of mosquito-infested swamplands or wetlands that
hampered navigation of waterways. (Ironically, the government agency
that drained these wetlands -- the Army Corps of Engineers -- now has
as its primary mission the enforcement of wetlands regulations.)
Today, less than one-fourth of one percent of the total is lost
yearly, and much of this small amount serves no ecologically
beneficial purpose. 

 <P>     Wetlands are currently protected under Sections 301 and 404 of
the 1977 Clean Water Act (CWA). This law regulates the discharge of
pollutants into "waters of the United States." (This term, while
ill-defined, should properly be construed to inlcude any water body
from which discharged pollutants could migrate via natural water flows
into interstate waterways.) But wetlands regulation has gone beyond
the authority granted or intended during passage of the Act. Instead,
EPA has used Sections 301 and 404 as a way to protect all wetlands for
their ecological value, such as waterfowl habitat. (For further
information, see William G. Laffer, III, "Protecting Ecologically
Valuable Wetlands Without Destroying Property Rights," Heritage
Foundation Backgrounder No. 840, July 15, 1990. Note that the
Delineation Manuel described in Laffer's paper is the 1989 Manual; the
Manual currently in effect is the 1987 Delineation Manual to which
EPA's regulatory authority has been returned. Nevertheless, EPA still
protects all wetlands for their ecological value regardless of what
criteria are used to define wetlands.) The EPA also has been depriving
landowners of the value of their properties without compensating them
for their loss, forcing many into bankruptcy. While there have been
ongoing court challenges, the results have been unclear, and have
merely fueled further litigation. In fact, wetlands regulation has now
become so inflexible that it has led to many outrageous or ridiculous
results. For instance, wetlands rules have blocked construction of low
income housing all over the country, delayed construction of shelter
for the homeless in Alaska for over a year, and even resulted in the
jailing of one environmentalist for making duck ponds. (Ibid. See also
"EPA's Most Wanted," The Wall Street Journal, November 18, 1992, p.
A16.) 

 <P>     Throughout the Bush Administration's term, there was a
fluctuating stance towards wetlands protection. The problem in part
stemmed from the lack of a clear objective. Additionally, the
litigation costs due to the government's dubious authority under
current law have been enormous, thus creating an unnecessary drain on
the economy. You will need to rectify this situation if you wish to
prioritize environmental concerns, and to minimize unnecessary
economic expenditures. Otherwise, it will be one more roadblock in
your economic agenda.

<P>      To do this, Mr. Clinton, you need to take urgent action:
<P>
Action 1: Instruct EPA to exclude from protection those wetlands from
which pollutants cannot in practice migrate to "waters of the United
States."
<P>      EPA's policy should be this: only if pollutants discharged into
a wetland can migrate via natural water flows into other water bodies,
such as streams, rivers, and lakes should government intervene.
(Ibid.) This will return wetlands protection to its original meaning.
The Clean Water Act was extended to wetlands only inorder to restrict
pollution in non-navigable water bodies from entering navigable
waterways. Thus, restricting the polluting of a wetland that is
physically connected to a waterway is proper and was intended in the
legislation; protecting wetlands for wetlands' sake was not.
<P>
Action 2: Within the first 100 days, issue an executive order
requiring the government to pay landowners the value of lands which
are designated wetlands. 
<P>      When a tract is declared a wetland, it becomes off-limits to
development. Thus a landowner or developer may be forbidden to build a
home on land that he purchased for that purpose. To be sure, society
may gain a benefit from the protection of wetlands, but blocking
development can impose an enormous cost to the owner. If wetlands
protection is for the benefit of the nation, the nation should bear
that cost -- unlucky landowners should not be forced to subsidize the
public. Moreover, requiring the federal government to reimburse the
costs imposed by its regulation will encourage government officials to
determine the priority of protecting a tract. Now, declaring an area a
wetland is a "free" decision to the government, even though that
decision can impose large costs on the economy. 
<P>
Action 3: If you want to protect all wetlands, obtain the necessary
authority through a new Wetlands Protection Act. 
 <P>     Sections 301 and 404 of the Clean Water Act, which today are
considered the sources of authority for wetlands protection, relate
only to pollution discharges that can directly or indirectly pollute
navigable waterways. Thus, enforcement of regulations to protect all
wetlands under these sections has sparked numerous lawsuits. 

<P>      You may feel that the government should have the authority to
protect all wetlands, regardless of the threat to navigable waterways.
If you do, you should seek legislative authority to do so, so the
issue can be debated publicly. Obtaining clear legislation also would
have the advantage of reducing the extensive and costly litigation
resulting from current methods of enforcement under dubious and vague
authority. 
<P>
SOLID WASTE 
<P>      As you consider your policy on the environment, solid waste
legislation should be a low priority. Legislation covering the issue
is contained in Subtitle D of the Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act (RCRA). You will hear from some environmentalists that this law
must be strengthened. They will advocate mandatory recycling and
packaging reductions to conserve raw resources and to ease the
"crisis" of shrinking landfill space. This advice is misguided. (For
further information, see John Shanahan, "A Plain Man's Guide to
Garbage: The Reauthorization of the Resource Conservation and Recovery
Act," Heritage Foundation Issue Bulletin No. 172, March 30, 1992.) New
rules also would be expensive; EPA estimates that efforts to mandate
recycling and packaging reductions could cost up to $30 billion.
(Assistant Administrator Don R. Clay, Office of Solid Waste and
Emergency Response, Letter to Representative Norman F. Lent, June 16,
1992.        ) You should adopt a very different course of action. 

 <P>     Before you design a policy, you should ask your advisors some
basic questions, and then weigh the evidence. Among the questions you
should ask:

<P>      1) Is there really a landfill "crisis?" The evidence suggests
that there is not. Landfill capacity has been declining 2.8 percent
annually while the amount of waste has been increasing 1.6 percent.
(Shanahan, "Plain Man's Guide," op. cit.) This decline is due to
stricter government regulation, which has quadrupled costs in the last
decade, and to the "Not In My Back Yard" (NIMBY) syndrome, whereby
local opposition to landfills is triggered by ill-informed health
concerns. Despite this decline, landfill space will be adequate if a
system of financial assurances replaces regulation. 

  <P>    2) What are the real health risks from using landfills and
incinerators? These actually are minimal. Today's new facilities are
state-of-the-art and pose negligible risk to health and safety.
Regulations now are so strict that if an individual sat continuously
for seventy years on an incinerator smokestack operating 24 hours a
day, that person would have only a one-in-a-million chance of
contracting cancer from smokestack pollutants. (Jerry Taylor,
"Municipal Waste Combustion: Toxic Threat or Trivial Pursuit?"
American Legislative Exchange Council Issues Analysis, April 1990.)

<P>      In fact, a major criticism of RCRA is that the regulations have
become too strict, leading to a decline in the construction of safe,
new incinerators and landfills, even though the health risks are
minuscule. 

<P>      3) Do reductions in packaging conserve resources? Paradoxically,
government pressure on businesses to reduce packaging can increase
waste. For instance, a pound of paper packaging used for foods reduces
food waste by an average of only 1.41 pounds, while a pound of plastic
packaging reduces food waste by 1.66 pounds. (Harvey Alter, "The
Origins of Solid Waste: The Relations Between Residues from Packaging
Materials and Food," Waste Management and Research 7, 1989.)

 <P>     Further, businesses already have economic incentives to reduce
packaging weights and volume. After all, the greater the amount of
packaging, the greater the transportation costs. Consequently,
manufacturers have been decreasing their packaging weights steadily
over the past two decades.

 <P>     4) Does recycling always conserve natural resources? Not always.
Recycling can be efficient and environmentally responsible, but it can
also waste resources. Whether it does so depends on the energy
requirements, the region of the country, and the characteristics of
the item to be recycled. Recycling aluminum is worthwhile because
recycling uses 95 percent less energy than making aluminum from
aluminum ore. Hence, businesses tend to recycle aluminum without being
forced to do so by the government. Recycling other products, however,
such as resource-efficient shrink wrap, actually would consume far
more natural and economic resources than making the resources from
virgin materials. Thus collecting, separating, and processing shrink
wrap to recycle would drive up costs to the economy, waste resources,
and cause air pollution.

<P>      5) Can government mandates conserve resources? Any attempt to
conserve resources by interfering with production and packaging
processes has the perverse effect result of wasting resources.
Government policies that mandate packaging reductions or recycling are
designed to encourage firms to substitute for one material another
material that consumes fewer resources. But to know which resources
should be conserved or used in every situation would require the
government to know the exact value of each resource in relation to
other resources. Market prices do this very well because they
fluctuate according to the latest information as to scarcity and
value. But if government attempts to determine resource values without
using prices, it must set the value or "worth" of each resource
according to an arbitrary standard. Hence, the "wrong" resource inputs
will be used in the production process, thus increasing overall
resource consumption. (Shanahan, "Plain Man's Guide," op. cit.)

 <P>     Given these considerations, there are two specific actions that
you should take:
<P>
Action 1: Announce that you will oppose mandatory recycling or
packaging reduction legislation.
<P>      If you do not oppose such legislation, you will be weakening the
economic recovery without any appreciable benefit to the environment.
Ironically, the environment may even be harmed by encouraging wasteful
use of raw resources in the recycling process.
<P>
Action 2: Within 100 days, issue an executive order to eliminate most
of today's costly landfill regulations.
 <P>     Rather than mandating recycling or packaging reductions, it
would be wiser to eliminate most of the current costly landfill
regulations. These erroneous rules are, in large part, responsible for
the nation's landfill capacity decline. You should instead replace
these regulations with a requirement that landfill operators provide
financial assurances, such as interest-bearing bonds, that the
landfills meet government standards of environmental safety. The
operators then should be given free rein to devise the least costly
manner of containing pollutants. But if the operator fails in this
duty, the bonds would become partially or wholly forfeit to finance a
clean-up.

INTRODUCTION
<P>
      In 1964, Marshall McLuhan pointed out that new technologies,
such as television and the computer, have changed our vision of the
world.  He wrote describing his new paradigm:
<P>
      <UL>After three thousand years of explosion, by means of
      fragmentary and mechanical technologies, the Western world
      is imploding.  Today, after more than a century of electric
      technology, we have extended our central nervous system
      itself in a global embrace, abolishing both space and time
      as far as our planet is concerned.  Rapidly, we approach
      the final phase of the extension of man -- the
      technological simulation of consciousness, when the
      creative process of knowing will be collectively and
      corporately extended to the whole of human society.</UL>
<P>
      McLuhan's vision came to be known as the global village; a
result of his equation, in its own way as revolutionary as Albert
Einstein's E=MC2, that "the medium is the message."  McLuhan's insight
was that media are the extension of the human nervous system, and "the
personal and social consequences of any medium result from the new
scale that is introduced into our affairs... by any new technology."
<P>
      One of the most important writers to follow McLuhan has been
George Gilder.  His Life After Television, significantly distributed
in "The Larger Agenda" series by Whittle Direct Books in 1990, argued
that "television, in technical terms, was dead."  Gilder counselled
against following the Japanese model of government bureaucracies and
business consortia because large, centralized organizations were an
outdated relic of obsolete technologies -- dating from the Industrial
Revolution of the 19th Century.
<P>
      With the introduction of the micro-chip, Gilder argued
"Intelligence could move from the broadcast station into inexpensive,
home-based personal computers.... The choices now made by broadcasters
at an event could be made at home by a viewer's hand-held remote
control."  The entire existing terrestrial broadcast system became
outdated, in Gilder's words, "as passe as last century's ice-box and
ice wagon."  According to Gilder, the result will be enhanced
individualism, strengthening democracy and capitalism all around the
world.  In Gilder's view, all networks are the equivalent of ice
companies doomed by the invention of refrigeration.
<P>
      Such an individualism means that the era of television as a
purely mass medium is over, to be replaced by an electronic
marketplace entered through the "telecomputer."  This marketplace will
be accessible through fiber optic cables and digital compression. 
Gilder argues such an "electronic town hall" (to borrow from Ross
Perot or Heritage's own new service) will "liberate our imaginations
from programs regulated by bureaucrats chosen by a small elite of
broadcasting professionals and governed by the need to target the
lowest common denominators of public interests," or in the case of
PBS, by political considerations.
<P>
      Gilder uses the metaphor of the magazine business, with dozens
of special interest publications for every taste, as his vision for
the micro-chip age, which is now upon us.
<P>
      Critic David Marc argues that we don't even have to wait for the
telecomputer -- that cable and satellite broadcasting, along with the
home-video cassette, have already rendered mass media as a thing of
the past.  In Demographic Vistas, he remarks:
<P>
      <UL>As NBC, CBS, ABC, and PBS and big-city independents are
      joined by HBO, ESPN, A&E, CBN, WHT, USA, CNN and the rest
      yet to come in the alphabet soup of the cable converter,
      the forty years or so during which scores of millions of
      people watched the same TV shows day in and day out are
      likely to be remembered as a quaint, naive period.  Cable
      innovations will allow the demographer marketeers to
      decentralize structure and even to isolate and attack
      pockets of aesthetic resistance (the highly educated are
      among the early, prominent target groups).</UL>
<P>
      So McLuhan, Gilder, and Marc all argue that the transformation
of technology has changed our way of life irrevocably, and that the
approaches of the past will be of little help in the future.  In this
sense they have an affinity with Jacques Ellul, who argues in The
Technological System that "the human being who uses technology today
is by that very fact the human being who serves it.  And conversely,
only the human being who serves technology is truly able to use it." 
At a crucial moment, then, one might ask "not what your technology can
do for you, but what you can do for your technology."  And it is with
this constrained vision that I would like to discuss the role of
public television on the cultural marketplace after privatization.

<P>
A SEA CHANGE
<P>
      The current debate over public television is not occurring in
isolation.  The present moment is one of tremendous change in the
communications industry and show-business, as the impact of the events
of the 1980s is beginning to be felt.
<P>
      In Europe, the fall of Communism has resulted in an explosion of
private media outlets, and a revolution in the relationship between
broadcasters and the marketplace.  I recently returned from MIP, the
international TV program market in Cannes, where I attended a press
conference on the privatization of Russian television, and heard a
pitch on why a network buy in Russia now was a bargain.  At the same
time, the European Community is preparing to increase production of
television, much of it in English, designed for sale to the American
market.  And in France there are rumors that Antenne 2, the second
public channel, will be sold off to private investors before the next
national elections.  Already, Canal, Plus, a private wireless cable
channel, is the most successful station in Europe, and owns Carolco
pictures, which produced both Basic Instinct and JFK.  TF-1
successfully drove its competitor, le Cinq, off the air -- with a
little help from the French government, which plans to split its
franchise between a French-German cultural channel and Jacques Lang's
dream of a national MTV for France.
<P>
      In England, the BBC announced a joint venture with Thames
Television on a new satellite channel featuring shows from their tape
libraries -- fully financed by advertising.  This is a dramatic change
for the BBC, and was announced only days after the victory of John
Major and the Conservatives.  The BBC also has started a service to
Asia, again with advertising on its satellite feed.  Thus, even Auntie
Bee is moving into the marketplace with surprising alacrity.
<P>
      Here in the United States there is evidence of dramatic change
in telecommunications.  In addition to the CPB reauthorization still
pending in the Senate, there remains serious legislation to re-
regulate the cable industry; to decide on the entry of telephone
companies into competition with the networks; and to set up a new
satellite service dedicated to educational use called EDSAT.  The
networks are pressing for an end to Fin/Syn.  In addition, the
competing HDTV suppliers have pooled their resources.  Each of these
events alone is a small sign of the sea change in broadcasting.  Put
together, they mark the most significant shift since the Nixon
Administration's decisions of Financial Interest in Syndication,
Prime-Time Access, satellites, and cable entry.  It is also rumored
that Clayton Yeutter has set up a telecommunications policy working
group in the White House, which indicates just how important these
matters will be in the coming months and years.  The tectonic plates
are clearly shifting, and the fight over the public broadcasting bill
is now seen to be a volcano erupting on a fault line, a fault line
caused by the irresistible force of market pressures on a highly
regulated industry.  The immense demand can no longer be met by
government sanctioned gatekeepers extracting monopoly rents.
<P>
      Some measure of the transformation in broadcasting can be seen
in viewing statistics.  In 1983-1984, the networks had a 69 share,
independent broadcasters a 19 share, PBS a 3 share, basic cable a 9
share, and pay cable a 5 share.  Six years later, the numbers had
shifted dramatically.  In 1990-1991, the networks were down sixteen
points, to a 53 share, independents up slightly to a 21 share, and
basic cable up fifteen points to a 24 share.  Meanwhile, PBS remained
static at a 3 share, which meant its core of loyal viewers were not
switching, but neither were they getting new audiences.  Another set
of statistics, from Entertainment Weekly, actually reported PBS
audiences went down by 12 percent in 1990-1991.  In that same period,
cable stations doubled their expenditures on programming from $1.74
billion to $3.46 billion, some three times the annual budget for
public broadcasting.  Given these statistics, how can public
broadcasting cope with the seismic changes in their universe?  Harold
Vogel points out in his book Entertainment Industry Economics that
Direct Broadcast Satellite, Microwave Multi-point Distribution of
Signals, Small Master Antenna Television, and subscription television
will all be growth technologies challenging cable's dominance, as well
as the current share of the networks and PBS.  He notes "technological
development has been the driving force behind the growth of the
entertainment industries."  Vogel further notes that in a competitive
environment, small entrepreneurs (not established) thrive because of
the inherent non-standardization and novelty required.  Vogel says
creative works "are uniquely produced and are normally originated by
individuals working alone or in small groups, and not by giant
corporate committees.  One can become rich and famous as a direct
result of one's own creative efforts."
<P>
      How can public broadcasting provide an environment which
attracts such creative entrepreneurs?  Only by transforming the system
into one which rewards individualistic impresarios rather than
bureaucratic operators.
<P>

CREATIVE COMPETITION
<P>
      This competition means that government funding, with its
strings, serves to stunt the growth of public broadcasting.  Richard
Blum and Richard Lindheim predict that pay-per-view will become an
increasingly competitive source of programming in the 1990s, in their
book Primetime Network Television Programming.  In that book, they
point out that the creative process is an extremely personal one.  The
presentation begins with an oval "pitch" explaining a series idea. 
The written presentation is usually not shown to the network, unless
there is a complication.  The most important factor is showmanship. 
They add:  "A number of key ingredients are necessary for a successful
presentation.  Among them are honest enthusiasm, abundance of detail,
humor, conviction, and adaptability."  Once the idea is accepted, the
written concept is purchased.  As the authors point out, it "often
sounds like a TV guide marketing blurb."  They reprint the one-
paragraph concept for Murder She Wrote as follows:
<P>
      <UL>Angela Lansbury stars as a celebrated mystery writer,
      Jessica Fletcher, whose penchant for crime-solving
      invariably involves her in often bizarre and always
      colorful escapades.  Once a contented widow from a small
      town in Maine, Jessica has found fame, as well as
      adventure, by turning her avocational scribblings into a
      lucrative new career.  A star-studded cast and an endless
      chain of nieces and nephews will join her as she solves the
      most intriguing of crimes with the most eccentric of
      methods.</UL>
<P>
      In contrast to the highly personal creative process surrounding
commercial programming, because of its reliance on tax dollars today
public broadcasting operates much more like a government bureaucracy. 
According to 1988 congressional testimony from Fred Wiseman, the
system is a "mess."  He added, "most competent professionals would not
consider working in public television in its present form."  Yet, so
long as public broadcasting is accountable for federal tax dollars it
will rightfully be hamstrung by administrative procedures inimical to
the creative spirit, designed for civil service priorities.  Evidence
for this can be seen in the lack of successful new series on PBS
prime-time schedules, even a follow-up to General Motors' The Civil
War.  Evidence can also be found in P.J.  O'Rourke's description of
bureaucracy.  He says "the actual work of government is too
unglamorous for the people who govern us to do.  Important elected
office-holders and high appointed officials create bureaucratic
departments to perform the humdrum tasks of national supervision. 
Government proposes, bureaucracy disposes.  And the bureaucracy must
dispose of government proposals by dumping them on us."
<P>
      Such a system rewards the bureaucratic mind, not the creative
and glamorous spirit.  It is a fact that even Norman Lear, one of the
most successful producers in Hollywood and certainly a bona fide
liberal, was unable to get his American Writer's Theatre -- which
would have featured adaptations of classic American authors -- through
the PBS and CPB maze.  It is not surprising, as Jonathan W.  Emord has
shown in his book Freedom, Technology and The First Amendment.  "The
normal functioning of the free speech and press models is possible
only in the absence of government regulation."  But federal tax
dollars carry federal strings.  Therefore, for public broadcasting to
be free and creative, it must be truly independent -- and that means
financially private -- in order to thrive.
<P>
      How is this to take place?  The answer lies in the rich
potential of the ancillary revenues from public broadcasting.  As has
been shown by the success of ventures such as Bill Kling's $77,000,000
Minnesota Public Radio catalogs, or Ken Burns's and Bill Moyers's
video and book tie-ins, or Sesame Street's licensing of $1 billion
worth of merchandise world-wide, there are substantial revenues to be
earned in the public broadcasting aftermarkets.
<P>
      With a real, bottom line after privatization, public
broadcasters will be encouraged to make deals so that the profits from
ancillary income go directly to finance the creation of new
programming.  This will be true for stations as well.  The copyrights
for public broadcasting productions would be the motor of this
prosperity.  Combined with donations, underwriting, and increased
corporate support, these sums will more than make up for the trade-off
in federal funds.  Such a self-supporting public broadcasting system
could be run on either a non-profit or a for-profit basis.  If non-
profit, the model might be The National Geographic Society.  With
10,000,000 members -- twice as many as public broadcasting -- National
Geographic runs $450,000,000 of cultural and educational programs each
year -- including two TV series, a magazine, the visitor center, and
numerous expeditions and publications.  Yet, it receives no direct tax
dollars, unlike the present CPB.
<P>
      Or CPB could go for-profit as a publicly held and publicly
traded corporation, receiving its capital from the marketplace instead
of the taxpayer.  This would still leave the local stations untouched,
free to operate as they have been doing.
<P>
      But instead of receiving community service grants as they now
do, local stations and other recipients would have to bargain over the
terms of contracts with a partner who had a bottom line to meet.  This
would enforce fiscal discipline on the entire system, and perhaps
encourage public television stations to increase their audiences.  It
would create incentives to reach viewers.  Share holders could
participate proudly in any profits, having converted charity to an
investment.
<P>
      The non-profit model is already successful for Children's
Television Workshop, grossing $100 million annually.  The for-profit
model also exists in production companies such as Ken Burns's
Florentine Films and Bill Moyers' Public Affairs Television.
<P>
      All of them are already truly thriving in the cultural
marketplace, selling books, records, and videocassettes, among other
items.  There is no reason their successes could not be duplicated in
such a way that contribute directly to the system instead of
extracting profit (and "non-profit") from the system.
<P>

CONCLUSION
<P>
      By entering the cultural marketplace as a truly private entity
and directly competing with new services, and by using its strongest
programming to support new products, Public Television has every
opportunity to grow and prosper in the multi-channel marketplace.  For
in addition to all its tangible assets, Public Television enjoys
another benefit -- the good will engendered by its long established
reputation for quality educational and cultural programming.  It is a
blue-ribbon name, on which one cannot even place a dollar estimate. 
With the proper marketing strategy, and a willingness to go head-to-
head in competition, there can be no doubt but that PBS could
establish itself in the market niche of the "Tiffany" service by the
end of the 1990s, and Tiffany's is a very successful shop.
<P>
      Without the stifling influence of the government bureaucracy
which goes with its congressional appropriation, a liberated CPB will
be free to bring far more of the finest in arts, education, and
culture to viewers like you, at no cost to the taxpayer.

<title>Senator Dole's Remarks</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">






<b>Senator Dole</b>: Thank you very much.  It's a privilege for me to be here, and a privilege to see Ben Franklin again.  He was just telling me about his childhood with Senator Thurmond.  But Ben Franklin, Thomas Jefferson, George Washington, and the rest of our founding fathers probably never imagined the
 technology that produced the computer age, and the Internet.  But one thing they did imagine -- a
 government closer to the people; a government that listened to the people, and a public that took active
 involvement in the issues today, and that is what Town Hall is all about.  Thanks to Town Hall, Americans are into the information age and the super-highway to take a detour around the traditional media road blocks.  And I am just one of countless Americans, who will be taking a right on the information highway, and heading straight for Town Hall.<p><hr>

<title> Town Hall Launch</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">
<center>
<h2>Town Hall Launch</h2>
June 29, 1995
</center>
<p>
<hr size="3" width="45%">
<p>
<b>Tim Butler</b>: About four years ago <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Ed Feulner</a> had an idea.  Now there is nothing new there, but he understood that a new emerging on-line technology was going to have a tremendous impact on the way America and the world communicates.  He also understood that the conservative movement must embrace
 these new communications opportunities.  The result of that is Town Hall.  Today Town Hall moves into a new dimension, the Internet.  And I'm very pleased to introduce the man behind the dream, Dr. Edwin J. Feulner, Jr., Town Hall's Chairman of the Board.
<p>
<b>Ed Feulner</b>: Thanks very much Tim, for that very nice introduction.  I appreciate it.  I'm very pleased to have with me my colleague from the Town Hall Board of Directors, Ed Capanno whose real job is publisher of <a href="/nationalreview/welcome.html"><i>National Review</i></a>.  Town Hall, from its very beginning, has been a joint project of <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a> and <i>National Review</i>.  And Ed, it's been a great learning curb for us, certainly, and we've been through a lot, but I think today bears witness to the fact that it has been worth working at.
<p>
 We are here today to officially launch Town Hall, the first conservative community on the Internet.  Like most communities, Town Hall has been created to serve people.  To provide an innovative site for political discourse and dialogue -- an international electronic center where new ideas and policies can be debated and studied by anyone who's interested.
<p>
 And Town Hall will use the technology of the Information Age -- the Internet -- to create this community of literally millions of people around the world.
<p>
Two hundred years ago, people concerned about the direction of their government and committed to the ideals of freedom and liberty, joined together to talk and argue, to dream and debate radical new ideas to make their lives and the lives of their families, their children, and their communities better.  In that respect, Town Hall will be no different.
<p>
I am very proud that the Heritage Foundation and National Review, together, created Town Hall as the conservative meeting place on the Internet, and I am equally proud that, through Town Hall, will continue to play a part in the Second Great American Revolution that has swept Washington and the halls of Congress like a great whirlwind.  Today, we have with us, the Revolution's two great generals in this extraordinary battle of ideas.
<p>
 From the Senate, we have Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, who continues to fight for America's families after a lifetime of commitment to his country.  In war and in peace, Bob Dole is and always will be a national leader -- a man of action and a man of accomplishment.
<p>
On the House front, everything <a href="http://www.house.gov/mbr_dir/GA06.html">Newt Gingrich</a> does shows how deeply he cares about his country and the hopes and dreams of its people.  He is a man of endless ideas whose extraordinary leadership has literally changed the course of history.
<p>
 We stand here in the shadow of the Capitol -- at one end of a long continuum -- a continuum that began
 with the goosefeather pen of Thomas Paine and reaches across time to the computers that sit here on this stage.  I can't think of anyone better to launch this historic connection than these two men -- leading the charge to preserve the Founding Fathers' great legacy of freedom.  Please join me in welcoming Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole and Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich.
<p>
Gentlemen, thank you both for joining us.  We're honored to have you here.  Before I ask you to take a seat at the controls, I want to bring out another special guest we are privileged to have with us today.  Just to make sure that the Founding Fathers would have approved, we've been able to produce someone who ought to know.  Please welcome in his 290th year, the father of invention and innovation, the Honorable Benjamin Franklin.
<p>
Senator Dole, Mr. Speaker will you each take a seat at the keyboards and Mr. Franklin, will you do the honors, please?
<p>
<b>Benjamin Franklin</b>: Let it be known that on this, the 29th day of June in the year of our Lord one thousand
  nine hundred and ninety-five, we open wide the doors of Town Hall in a spirit of experiment and good
  will; to preserve liberty and prevent tyranny, and to seek change in the principles, opinions, sentiments and affections of the people as we share in the progress of human knowledge.  Gentlemen, on the count of  three.... one ... two ... three ... start your engines.
<p>
<b>Ed Feulner</b>: Alright!  Town Hall is officially launched!
<p>
Thank you very much, Senator Dole, Mr. Speaker and, of course, you too Mr. Franklin.  Thomas Jefferson would be proud.  It is now my happy duty to introduce you to the charter members of Town Hall -- America's leading conservative organizations who vision and creativity have spurred them to join in this innovative effort.  I'm very please to welcome them to the Town Hall Community.
<p>
As I introduce their representatives, we will all get a look at each group's site as it will appear in Town Hall on big screen.
<p>
<ul>
<li>First, please welcome, <a href="/conservative/kbio.html">David Keene</a>, Chairman of the <a href="/conservative/welcome.html">American Conservative Union</a>.
<li>Next, Shades of the Boston Tea Party, is Grover Norquist, President of <a href="/atr/1.html">Americans for Tax Reform</a>.
<li>It is a great pleasure to welcome Charlie Kupperman Executive Director of <a href="/empower/welcome.html ">Empower America</a>.
<li><a href="/townhall/FRC/bauer.html">Gary Bauer</a>, President of the <a href="/townhall/FRC/welcome.html">Family Research Council</a>.  Welcome aboard, Gary.

<li><a href="/yaf/home.html">The Young America's Foundation's</a>, <a href="/yaf/sharp.html">Michelle Sharp</a>, Director of Lectures, is here.
<li>And Finally, my colleague -- <a href="/heritage/staff/truluck.htm">Phil Truluck</a>, the Executive Vice President of <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>.
</ul>
<p>
As Tim said, it's a great starting line-up, but only the beginning of a conservative community.  We thank  you all for being here today.  I would now like to give you all an opportunity to hear from our two  wonderful leaders here today.  It is truly an honor for me to first introduce to you the great Speaker of the House of Representatives -- the Honorable Newt Gingrich.

<title>Speaker Newt Gingrich's Remarks</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/townhall/paper2.jpg">




<b>Speaker Gingrich</b></a>: I want to say first of all that I am delighted to be here.  I was explaining to Senator Dole that last night we pretended we were the Senate.  And we ran all night, and we're not use to this, we didn't get out till almost ten o'clock this morning.  He's used to these kind of marathons where you have to go all the time, but we're not quite that tough.  I'm a little blurry eyed, but delighted to be here.  I believe this is part of entering the information age, I think that this is a very important commitment to reach out and to allow literally people around the entire planet to be able to interact, have ideas, to have dialogues, to know
what's going on.  And to contribute good ideas.  And I'm just delighted that Ed Feulner brought all of us
together here today, to participate in creating Town Hall, and I can tell you from our stand point we look
forward to having lots of Americans, and frankly lots of people all across the world, to share with us their
ideas and their comments, and then to work with the various groups who will have their pages on this site.  We're very grateful, and I'm delighted to behalf of the House Republicans to be here to help inaugurate this.<p><br>

<B> INTRODUCTION</B>
<P>
      Americans overwhelmingly believe that parents know best how to
raise young children. This is confirmed in poll after poll. ("For
Better or Worse, Results from a Newsweek Gallup poll, 1989," Newsweek,
Special Issue on Children, Summer 1990, p. 18.) Experts, too, agree
that the family home is the optimum setting for early childhood
development.
<P>
      Yet the federal government ignores this definitive data. In
fact, the federal government is greatly increasing its efforts to take
very young children out of their homes and put them, for part of the
day or all day, into government-funded institutions. Washington is
even launching a campaign to persuade parents to part with their sons
and daughters at ever earlier ages. 
<P>
      These actions amount to a federal family policy that undermines
families. And this policy is becoming more expansive, aggressive, and
expensive. Examples:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Activists are seeking to increase funding beyond the $23.5
      billion already authorized for child care and early education
      programs for 1991-1995. The total includes $4.5 billion to set
      up child care bureaucracies at the state level. 
<P>
      George Bush is asking for a nearly $700 million increase in the
      fiscal 1992 federal budget for Project Head Start, already the
      largest federally funded early childhood development program.
      The program would cost just over $2 billion.
<P>
      The Bush Administration wants to spend $60 million in fiscal
      1992 on Even Start, a Department of Education program similar to
      Head Start. The budget request is a 200 percent increase over
      fiscal 1990 and a 21 percent hike over fiscal 1991.
<P>
      A congressionally appointed, taxpayer-funded panel is
      considering ways to conduct national academic testing of 3-year-
      olds.
<P>
      A taxpayer-financed study for the Department of Education
      pleads the case for a federally directed, federally subsidized
      system of national child care standards and early childhood
      education services. The Department is listening to no opposing
      views.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
      Despite a glaring lack of scientific evidence that early
childhood programs help children now or in the future, as their
sponsors claim, the federal government is spending ever more
taxpayers' money on them.
<P>
      To be sure, for severely disadvantaged children, Head Start and
other programs initially improve academic performance. But studies
show that the impact does not endure for more than a year or two.
Despite this, Head Start is often touted as a "magic bullet" that
helps poor children succeed in school. Based on the available
evidence, Head Start may deserve support as a welfare program
providing nutrition and care for poor children, but not as an
educational jump start. 
<P>
      Says J. Craig Peery, professor of human development at Brigham
Young University and the author of the 1981 Project Head Start
reauthorization bill: "I think we know a lot about early childhood
education -- and it doesn't work." (Telephone interview, March 7,
1991.) 
<P>
      Potentially Harmful. Many experts feel that early education that
emphasizes performance is not only not beneficial but potentially
harmful. Says pediatrician and author Benjamin Spock: "When we
instruct children in academic subjects, or in swimming, gymnastics, or
ballet, at too early an age, we miseducate them; we put them at risk
for short-term stress and long-term personality damage for no useful
purpose. There is no evidence that such early instruction has lasting
benefits, and considerable evidence that it can do lasting harm."
(Quoted in David Elkind, Miseducation, Preschoolers at Risk (New York:
Alfred A. Knopf, 1988), p. 4.) 
<P>
      Aside from one small study that finds significant long-term
gains, even the most positive analyses of early childhood programs
acknowledge few lasting effects. Indeed, the most comprehensive Head
Start study compares school testing of Head Start children with those
not enrolled and concludes: "by the end of the second year there are
no educationally meaningful differences." (Executive Summary, The
Impact of Head Start on Children, Families and Communities, Head Start
Evaluation, Synthesis and Utilization Project, U.S. Department of
Health and Human Services, June 1985, p. 6.) 
<P>
      Out-of-Home Problems. In contrast, research shows that children
in out-of-home programs for extensive periods tend to be more
aggressive, have more psychological problems, favor peer groups over
parental authority and get into more fights than home-reared children.
(Nicholas Zill, Developmental, Learning and Emotional Problems: Health
of Our Nation's Children, cited in "Family-Induced Disturbances Affect
One in Five Children," Education Daily, Vol. 23, No. 238, December 11,
1990, p. 3. Also, Deborah Vandell and Mary Corasaniti and others cited
by J. Craig Peery in "Children At Risk: The Case Against Day Care,"
The Family in America, Rockford Institute, February 1991.) Young
children are also more likely to contract serious illnesses in
institutional settings. (Reed Bell, "Health Risks From Daycare
Diseases," in Phyllis Schlafly, ed. Who Will Rock the Cradle?, Two
Conferences on Childcare (Eagle Forum Education and Legal Defense
Fund, 1981), pps. 115-122.) 
<P>
      Even Yale psychologist Edward F. Zigler, widely known as the
foremost proponent of early childhood development programs, warns that
such programs may not be suitable for all children: "There is a large
body of evidence indicating that there is little if anything to be
gained by exposing middle-class children to early education." (Edward
F. Zigler, "Formal Schooling for Four-Year-Olds? No" in Sharon L.
Kagan and Edward F. Zigler, eds., Early Schooling (New Haven: Yale
University Press, 1987), p. 30.) He adds: "We must listen to those
families who neither want nor need their young children placed in
preschool .... whenever the family situation permits it, the best
place for a preschool child is often at home." (Zigler, op. cit., p.
34.)
<P>
      Warning Bells. The virtual absence of proof that programs have
long-term benefits and growing evidence that children in institutional
settings are at risk should ring warning bells in Washington. It
should make the federal government proceed with caution before funding
existing and new programs for young children -- until research proves
that such programs not only do not harm children but significantly
help them. 
<P>
      Yet this evidence routinely is ignored at the Departments of
Education and Health and Human Services, and sometimes even at the
White House. Ignored too is the fact that the most important cultural
problem facing America is dysfunctional families -- the families in
which children are most often at risk.
<P>
      What is puzzling is that some leading officials rhetorically
admit that the well-being of American families is the key to a healthy
society, even while the agencies run by these officials pay scant heed
to the rhetoric. Louis W. Sullivan, Secretary of Health and Human
Services, earlier this month told the annual legislative conference of
the National League of Cities: "So many of our problems -- drug and
alcohol abuse, the spread of AIDS, teen pregnancy, infant mortality,
youth homicide, among others -- reflect the personal isolation,
alienation and despair that follow from the widespread erosion of
family and community." (Paul Taylor, "Family Seen as Key to Aiding
Children," The Washington Post, March 11, 1991, p A-5.) Adds
Minneapolis Mayor Donald M. Fraser: "We know we have a welfare system
that discourages marriage.... we have a [federal] public policy that
is designed to destroy families and nobody talks about it." (Ibid.)
<P>
      Sullivan, a Republican, and Fraser, a Democrat, both call for
the abolition of federal programs that weaken families. (Both men,
however, support expansion of Head Start. Sullivan calls it a "middle
ground" that shores up families without supplanting them.) This call
merits very broad support. To succeed, it requires a strategy whose
first steps include:
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
1)    Ending the funding of all early childhood education programs
      except those for the poor. 
<P>
2)    Supporting research into early education for disadvantaged
      children to determine if there is a model that works and can be
      replicated. Such efforts should target only severely
      disadvantaged children, follow methods for which there is some
      evidence of success, and use a controlled experiment format.
<P>
3)    Evaluating independently all existing federally subsidized early
      childhood education programs. Conflicts of interest should
      preclude bureaucracies that administer programs from evaluating
      their effectiveness. 
<P>
4)    Expanding the use of vouchers or tax credits to allow parents to
      choose the best education and care for their children. Parental
      involvement should be a paramount consideration in any program.
      Early childhood education may indeed be worthwhile for some
      disadvantaged children, but studies indicate parental
      involvement with children is the key developmental factor.
<P>
5)    Reducing federally imposed financial burdens on the family. In
      1948, a family of four of median income paid 2 percent of its
      income to federal taxes. This year, that family pays 24 percent
      in federal taxes in addition to state, local, and excise taxes.
      (Robert Rector, "Fourteen Myths About Families and Child Care,"
      Harvard Journal on Legislation, Vol. 26, No. 2 (Summer 1989), p.
      542.) Some ways to aid families include: increasing the personal
      exemption for dependents, increasing the earned income tax
      credit and extending it to more families, and redesigning
      welfare programs to encourage fatherhood, not father
      abandonment. Minnesota, for instance, has waived welfare rules
      that have been driving fathers out of the house.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B> THE FEDERAL ROLE</B>
<P>
      Despite lack of evidence that early childhood programs
substantially benefit children, the U.S. government agencies actively
promote these programs in several ways.
<P>
* The Tax Credit for Dependent Care allows parents to deduct from
their gross income a portion of child care expenses on their federal
returns. The deductions totalled $3.895 billion in fiscal 1990 and are
projected to total $4.395 billion in fiscal 1992. (Telephone interview
with Terry Harrow, legislative branch director for Human Development
Resources, U.S. Department of Health and Human Services, March 12,
1991.) The program has the merit of giving parents economic assistance
to choose the kind of child care they want, including religious-
affiliated facilities. The trouble is that the program discriminates
against parents caring for children at home. In effect, the government
says: "If you leave your child with someone other than one of the
parents (or grandparents, or aunts, or neighbors), you get a tax
break."
<P>
* Child care provisions in the 1991 Omnibus Budget Reconciliation Bill
will cost an estimated $23.6 billion over five years for several
programs. (Other provisions are: a Child Health Insurance Credit. This
$5.2-billion program assists families in buying health insurance for
children. In 1994 the maximum credit will be $483. A "Wee Tots"
Supplemental Tax Credit. This $700 million program gives families with
a child under one year a supplemental credit or allows them to choose
the Dependent Care Tax Credit. By 1994, the "Wee Tot" maximum credit
will be $403.) Among them: <P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
1)    The Earned Income Tax Credit. Projected to reduce federal tax
      revenues by $12.4 billion over five years, this gives a small
      measure of tax relief (a direct refund of up to a maximum of
      $953) to poor families with children. 
<P>
2)    Child Care and Development Block Grant. Estimated to cost $4.45
      billion over five years, this gives money to states based on the
      number of low-income children in the state under age five. Some
      75 percent of the money can be used for services to children;
      the other 25 percent is targeted for quality control, early
      childhood programs, and day care for latch-key children. Because
      of fuzzy wording, the money for children's services could be
      siphoned into campaigns for a child care bureaucracy. 
<P>
3)    Title IV Family Support Ways and Means Grant. Allocating $1.5
      billion over five years, this gives money to poor working
      families for child care to keep parents off welfare rolls. 
<P>
4)    Standards and Training Ways and Means Grant. At a cost of $250
      million, this will help states improve standards for child care,
      monitor compliance, and provide training for child care
      providers.
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<B> Head Start</B>
<P>
      The largest federally funded early childhood development program
is Head Start. Begun in 1965 as part of Lyndon Johnson's War on
Poverty, Head Start is a comprehensive early childhood development
program providing children ages 3 to 5 from low-income families with
educational, social, medical, dental, nutritional, and mental health
services. (Head Start: A Child Development Program, pamphlet, U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services, 1990, p. 2.) In the past
quarter-century, more than 11 million children have been Head Start
clients. Beginning with a summer-only enrollment of 561,000 and a
budget of $96.4 million (Project Head Start Statistical Fact Sheet,
January 1990, p. 2.) the program grew rapidly. By 1966 the budget was
$198.9 million, enrollment rose to 733,000, and the program expanded
to full-day. (Ibid.) In 1982, when seasonal programs were replaced by
year-round-only services, 395,800 children were enrolled in the
program, which had a budget of $911.7 million. (Ibid.) During the 1990
school year, more than 488,000 children were enrolled at a estimated
average cost of $2,767 per child (Ibid., pp. 1,2.) while the budget
grew to $1.386 billion. The program has a paid staff of 79,549, plus
615,000 volunteers. (Ibid., pp. 2,3.)    Some 54 percent of Head Start
families are headed by a single parent. Handicapped children account
for 13.5 percent of enrollees. Up to 10 percent of Head Start slots
can be filled by children not deemed at risk. 
<P>
      Head Start gives children hot meals, comprehensive health care
including dental treatment, and social activities. Parents are offered
positions on policy-making boards, workshops on child care and
nutrition, and training for Head Start jobs. (Serving the Nation's
Children and Families, Administration for Children, Youth and
Families, Department of Health and Human Services, undated, p. 11.) 
<P>
      Modest Success. Head Start's lack of quantifiable success for
long-term effects does not mean that it has not done any good; some
poor children get meals and health care that they might not otherwise
receive; the program has reduced the number of poor children
misdiagnosed as retarded, and some studies indicate improvement in
school attendance, academic performance and IQ test results for the
first year or two. There is, moreover, anecdotal evidence of
individual successes. Some of Head Start's operating premises --
parental involvement, self-help emphasis, local control -- are an
improvement over those of typically top-heavy bureaucratic welfare
agencies. 
<P>
      Good Intentions. While Head Start rightly claims modest success
in aiding some disadvantaged youngsters, the program mainly thrives on
good intentions. The most comprehensive study of Head Start was
completed in 1984. Among its most important findings: short-term gains
fade within a couple of years. (R. H. McKey, et al. , The Impact of
Head Start on Children, Families and Communities, 1985, cited in Ron
Haskins, "Beyond Metaphor, The Efficacy of Early Childhood Education,"
American Psychologist, February 1989, pp. 274-281.) Says Ron Haskins,
a developmental psychologist and welfare analyst for the House
Committee on Ways and Means: "Results from Head Start projects are
uncertain for the special education effects, and there is virtually no
evidence [that Head Start reduces] teen pregnancy, crime, welfare, or
unemployment." ( Haskins, op. cit., p.279.)   
<P>
      No major studies of Head Start have been released since 1985,
and none are underway, according to Esther Kresh, a senior researcher
at Head Start. Observes Kresh, who favors more studies into Head
Start's effectiveness: "There isn't anything going on now. The whole
body of research was in the early days." (Telephone interview, March
8, 1991.) Kresh adds that "the real study has never been done" on Head
Start. As a Head Start proponent, she believes that such a study would
reveal that the program works, although not to everyone's
satisfaction. For one thing, the program keeps changing. Says Kresh:
"It's gone from being a child-development program to a full-family
development program." (Interview, op. cit.)
<P>
      No Panacea. A Head Start advisory panel last year recommended
studies "to identify early and intermediate outcomes" and factors
outside the program that affect children's later chances for success,
such as family life and schooling. (Head Start Research and
Evaluation: A Blueprint for the Future. Recommendations of the
Advisory Panel for the Head Start Evaluation Design Project,
Department of Health and Human Services, September 1990, p. 4.) The
report affirms agency officials' belief in the success of other child
development programs, but cautions that "policymakers and the general
public should not be oversold that early education and intervention
programs such as Head Start, even when implemented in a high-quality
fashion, are some kind of panacea that succeed even in the absence of
appropriate ongoing child and family support." ( Op. cit., p. 14.) 
<P>
      Head Start lacks a serious benefit-cost analysis, which is a
method of expressing costs and benefits in dollars and comparing them.
"Unfortunately, there are few benefit-cost studies of early childhood
education," says Ways and Means Committee welfare analyst Haskins.
"....The only thorough benefit-cost studies published to date were
performed on one project -- the Perry Preschool program." (Haskins,
op. cit., p. 279.) And, as Haskins emphasizes, "Perry is not Head
Start." (Telephone interview, March 19, 1991.)
<P>
      To sum: Hard evidence is lacking for claims by Head Start
proponents. As such, before Washington spends more taxpayer money on
Head Start, the program should be researched thoroughly. Without
conclusive evidence of lasting benefits, Head Start should not be
expanded, nor should similar programs such as Even Start. 
<P>
<B> Even Start</B>
<P>
      A little-known program, Even Start was begun in 1989. Now the
U.S. Department of Education is seeking $60 million in the fiscal 1992
federal budget for Even Start, almost triple its fiscal 1991 outlay.
Even Start's purpose, as stated in the Federal Register, is to assist
eligible local educational agencies in "providing family-centered
education projects to help parents become full partners in the
education of their children, to assist children in reaching their full
potential as learners, and to provide literacy training for their
parents." (Federal Register, Vol. 56, No. 23 (February 4, 1991), p.
4390.) Although Head Start also has parent education, Even Start
requires it. Even Start is home-based, and enrolls children aged 1
through 7; Head Start is for children ages 3 to 5 and is based in
classrooms.
<P>
      To enroll in Even Start, parents must reside in a poor area and
be eligible for adult education assistance programs. Even Start
requires parent involvement in all activities and stresses adult
literacy, parenting skills, and parent-child interaction. Asked to
compare Head Start and Even Start, Tisch Rennings, Even Start
education program specialist at the Department of Education, told a
Heritage Foundation researcher: "There really isn't any difference.
It's essentially funding for the [early childhood] programs from a
different source." (Telephone interview, February 26, 1991.) There are
no studies to date on Even Start. 
<P>
<B> The Early Education Lobby</B>
<P>
      Taxpayers are funding a campaign to increase federal support of
early childhood development programs. One of these efforts is
"Excellence in Early Childhood Education: Defining Characteristics and
Next-Decade Strategies," a pamphlet published by the Department of
Education's Office of Educational Research and Improvement. It is
written by Sharon L. Kagan, associate director of the Bush Center in
Child Development and Social Policy at Yale University. She is active
in child care lobbying organizations like the Child Care Action
Network, the Children's Defense Fund, and the National Association for
the Education of Young Children. 
<P>
      "Excellence in Early Childhood Education" calls for more federal
oversight, national standards, and more federal subsidies to child
care professionals. The 29-page essay, part of a four-part series of
"Public Policy Perspectives," calls for, among other things, a broad
campaign to persuade Americans that "early care and education programs
are now a permanent part of the social landscape." (Sharon Kagan,
"Excellence in Early Childhood Education: Defining Characteristics and
Next-Decade Strategies," Office of Educational Research and
Improvement, U.S. Department of Education, July 1990, p. 21.) By
publishing this essay, the Department of Education is lobbying for
expansion of programs for which there is little proof of
effectiveness.
<P>
      Kagan consistently argues for a larger federal role in early
childhood development. To do this, she wants "a single agency at the
Federal level." (Kagan, op. cit., p. 4.) Her essay includes no dissent
from the view that early childhood programs are effective, essential,
and should be brought under a federal umbrella. Parental rights
receive only lip service. The pamphlets, which cost $4,080 to print,
plus a $2,500 fee for Kagan, (Telephone interview March 18, 1991, with
Lewis Walker, chief of the Educational Information branch of the
Office of Educational Research and Improvement, Department of
Education.) were distributed to about 4,000 educators and policy
makers across the country. Although the pamphlet contains the caveat
that it "does not necessarily represent positions or policies of the
U.S. Department of Education, and no official endorsement should be
inferred," the Department's blessing is clearly implied. Indeed, the
Department has issued no companion publication with opposing views. 
<P>
<B> National Test For 3-Year-Olds</B>
<P>
      A federal panel is exploring ways to test children as young as
age 3 to determine "the skills and attitudes of the school-entering
population." ("Congressional Panel Examines Testing Three-Year-Olds,"
Education Daily, December 11, 1990, p. 2.) Yet kindergarten begins for
most children at age 5 or 6. Testing children at age 3 serves no
purpose other than to provide statistics that can be used to marshall
support for schooling at earlier ages.
<P>
      The Special Study Panel on Education Indicators was mandated in
the Hawkins-Stafford Elementary-Secondary School Improvement Act in
1988. Last December in a preliminary draft of a report to be released
this June, the panel recommended national testing of 3-year-olds. Says
panel chairman Alan Morgan, who is New Mexico's state school
superintendent: "We won't break the cycle of poverty unless we
intervene early." (Ibid.) He maintains that testing 3-year-olds "will
allow us to determine the sources of education inequities near their
roots, rather than after children have already spent time in
elementary school." (Ibid.)    The test, whose format is still under
study but which one panelist calls "a Pampers SAT," would be
expensive, requiring one-on-one sessions with "an adult trained in
early-childhood development." (Ibid.) 
<P>
      Such a testing program could be the first step in the formation
of compulsory schooling for very young children. 
<P>
<B> WHY EARLY CHILDHOOD EDUCATION?</B>
<P>
      "Early childhood education" generally refers to developmental
programs designed for 3- to 5-year-olds. Some experts prefer the term
"early childhood development" because they fear children might be
harmed by undue academic pressures. 
<P>
      Programs vary widely, from custodial care, which is basically
baby-sitting, to highly structured curriculums. Children spend as
little as a couple of hours a week at a care facility or as much as
ten hours a day, five days a week. 
<P>
      The problem is not the concept of preschools. Even families with
one full-time parent often enroll young children in nursery schools
two or three mornings a week for social activities and to give tired
parents a short break. 
<P>
      The problem is that federally funded programs are growing
rapidly despite scant evidence that they work. Says developmental
psychologist Peery: "Nobody is doing any critical thinking. It's a
mantra now." (Telephone interview, March 7, 1991.)
<P>
      In the mid-1970s, several model education programs were
organized into a consortium study, whose findings were released in
1982. (Irving Lazar, et al., Lasting Effects of Early Education: A
Report from the Consortium for Longitudinal Studies, Monographs of the
Society for Research in Child Development, 47, 2-3 Serial No. 195,
1982, cited in Haskins, op. cit., p. 274-282.) With the exception of a
study of the Perry Preschool Program, the analyses, taken as a whole,
reported substantial initial gains in children's cognitive
performances, followed by declines within a year or two, with
inconclusive evidence about long-term effects. Perry Preschool, which
early education proponents cite frequently as proof that such programs
work, is the only program for which studies report dramatic long-term
results. Neither the Perry Preschool study, however, nor the programs
in the consortium were representative of most preschools. Notes
welfare analyst Haskins: "These intervention programs were conducted
under ideal circumstances: Skilled researchers, capable staffs, ample
budgets... it seems unwise to claim that the benefits produced by such
exemplary programs would necessarily be produced by ordinary preschool
programs conducted in communities across the United States." (Haskins,
op. cit., p. 277.) Head Start, on the other hand, he adds, "can be
offered as a close approximation of what could be expected from
universal preschool education for poor children." (Ibid.)
<P>
      In recent years, interest in early childhood education has
increased for several reasons:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>1)    America's failing educational system. Test scores are still
      falling, dropout rates are high, especially among the poor, and
      literacy skills are declining, despite the highest level of
      public spending on education in American history. Some people
      fear that America's children will grow up unable to compete in a
      global economy. 
<P>
2)    A plethora of seemingly intractable social problems,
      particularly in America's inner cities. Early intervention is
      seen as a way to equip children with skills that will allow them
      to succeed in school and later in life.
<P>
3)    The entry of many women into the workforce since the 1960s,
      which has created a demand for non-maternal child care. Just as
      it would be unreasonable to fashion a federal policy to induce
      all mothers to stay at home, it is just as unreasonable to
      induce all children into day care, even that which emphasizes
      early childhood education. As Heritage Foundation family policy
      analyst Rector writes in the Harvard Journal on Legislation: "We
      must ask whether government policy should actively discourage
      the home rearing of children." (Rector, op. cit., p. 541.)
</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<B> UNEXAMINED ASSUMPTIONS</B>
<P>
      To justify the drive for more federal spending on programs,
early childhood advocates make several claims, among them:
<P>
CLAIM #1: 
<P>      Traditional child-rearing, that is, family life, is "obsolete"
or a mere idealization. "Less than 10 percent of families" now fit the
Ozzie and Harriet model, says Representative Patricia Schroeder, the
Colorado Democrat who has just assumed chairmanship of the House
Select Committee on Children, Youth and Families. (Cited in David
Blankenhorn, "Ozzie and Harriet: Have Reports of Their Death Been
Greatly Exaggerated?" Institute for American Values, Family Affairs,
Vol. 2, No. 2-3 (Summer/Fall, 1989), p. 10.) Another typical comment
is found in a report funded by a grant from the Department of
Education: "[Norman] Rockwell's Portrait of American Family Is
Changing: Only 4-7 percent of American families have an employed
father, full-time homemaker mother, and two children." (National
Commission on Working Women, cited in Resegregation of Public Schools:
The Third Generation, Network of Regional Desegregation Assistance
Centers, June 1989, p. 40. ) 
<P>
REALITY: 
  <P>    The citations above are very misleading. For one thing, only
families with two children are counted. If a family has one child, or
three or more, it is not counted as a "traditional" family, even if
the family has an employed father and a full-time homemaker mother.
Not counted also are families in which the mother is employed part-
time, even if only during the summer, or is employed full-time for
only part of the year, or families with unemployed fathers. For
another thing, the term "families" is misused; the data really count
"households." This includes college students, empty nesters with grown
children, childless single adults, and others who are in different
categories entirely. 
<P>
      The latest data from the U.S. Labor Department and the Census
Bureau clearly show that two-thirds of the nation's young children are
being raised at home, most by full-time mothers or mothers who are
employed only part-time. (Marital and Family Characteristics of the
Labor Force from the March 1990 Current Population Survey, U.S.
Department of Labor Bureau of Labor Statistics, October 1990, p. 4.)
Many women leave the labor force after the birth of a second child.
Some resume part-time or full-time jobs outside the home when their
children are older. More than one-third of mothers with children aged
6 to 13 are outside the labor force; half of mothers with children
aged 6 to 17 either are outside the labor force or are employed part-
time. (Ibid.) Of mothers employed full-time, most juggle child care
responsibilities with their husbands, other family members, or
neighbors. (Ibid.)
<P>
CLAIM #2: 
    <P>  Government programs for young children prevent social ills and
boost academic scores in later life.
<P>
REALITY: 
  <P>    The only longitudinal study to claim dramatic, long-term results
is of the Perry Preschool Program. Hundreds of other studies have
failed to duplicate the Perry findings. 
<P>
CLAIM #3: 
  <P>    A "crisis" in child care exists, so the federal government
should spend more on early childhood programs.
<P>
REALITY:
   <P>   Care facilities and programs for young children are expanding
rapidly. Between 1960 and 1986, the capacity of formal group care
centers in America increased from 141,000 to 2.1 million, while the
number of centers grew from 4,400 to 39,929 in the same period. Many
churches now operate full-day or part-day care centers. There even may
be an oversupply of day care. National day care chains such as Kinder-
Care Learning Centers, Inc. report average vacancy rates of 25
percent. (Rector, op. cit., p. 524.) The bulk of child care is being
done by parents, relatives, neighbors or by the more than 1.6 million
small, unlicensed day care providers. A 1988 Labor Department survey
finds "no evidence in support of the contention that there is a
general, national shortage of available care." (Child Care: A
Workforce Issue 10, Secretary's Task Force, U.S. Department of Labor,
1988, cited by Rector in ibid.)     
<P>
<B> The Perry Preschool Experiment</B>

   <P>   The most-often cited evidence that early childhood education
works are studies of the Perry Preschool Program, a project involving
123 black youths from poor families in Ypsilanti, Michigan. Begun in
1962, the study explores long-term effects of this high-quality early
childhood education program on 58 children. Another 65 children were
used as a control group; they did not attend preschool. The
researchers began tracking the 123 youngsters when they were three and
four years old.
<P>
      In 1984, when the subjects were between ages 19 and 24, studies
indicated long-term gains for the Perry pupils. According to the
High/Scope Educational Research Foundation, which both designed the
preschool curriculum and conducted the study, the Perry pupils had
half the rate of teen-age pregnancy, a much lower rate of arrests and
juvenile delinquency and were half as likely to depend on welfare
assistance as the pupils in the control group. (John R.
Berrueta-Clement, et al., Changed Lives. The Effects of the Perry
Preschool Program on Youths Through Age 19 (Ypsilanti, Michigan:
High/Scope Educational Research Foundation, 1984).) 
<P>
      Predicted Benefits. A Perry benefit-cost analysis reviewed such
factors as savings in public expenditures on education, welfare and
crime, and added taxes paid by later-employed Perry participants.
(W.S. Barnett, The Perry Preschool Program and its Long-Term Effects:
A Benefit-Cost Analysis, High/Scope Early Childhood Policy Papers, No.
2., Ypsilanti, Michigan, 1985. C.U. Weber, P.W. Foster and D.P.
Weikart, An Economic Analysis of the Perry Preschool Project
(Ypsilanti,Michigan:High/Scope, 1978). Both studies cited in Haskins,
op. cit., p 279.) Researchers concluded that "for each dollar invested
in the Perry Preschool Project, taxpayers receive a return of $1.46 by
the time participants are about 20 years of age. Predicted net
benefits over the lifetime of participants are even more substantial."
High/Scope researchers estimate that every dollar spent on preschool
education for children at risk saves $5.73 in projected future costs
to taxpayers.  (Ibid.)
<P>
      The Perry findings have been accepted widely as proof that
preschool programs, including Head Start, are good investments for
taxpayers and good for America's children. Calling the Perry program
"impressive," the House Ways and Means Committee's Haskins says well-
designed programs probably benefit some children, at least in the
short run. But he cautions: "It is unreasonable to expect that
extending preschool programs of the Head Start type to more low-income
children would produce benefits of the magnitude found in the Perry
project." (Haskins, op. cit., p. 280.) The problem with the Perry
study is that the Perry Preschool Program was far from typical. The
lessons learned from it thus have very limited applicability.
<P>
      Examples:

   <P>   Sample size. The Perry Preschool Program used a microscopic
segment of a narrowly defined population: poor, black children with
IQs between 61 and 81 in households in which a parent was home during
the day. (Zigler, op. cit., p. 30.)  Yale psychologist Zigler warns
that Perry "was not only unrepresentative of children in general;
there is some doubt that it was representative of even the bulk of
economically disadvantaged children.... it is even problematic as to
whether the sample was representative of low-income black children."
Other backers of early childhood education also say Perry's findings
need perspective. Notes Head Start's Kresh: "When they talk about a
difference in something happening, they're talking about 10 percent.
In a sample that small, they're talking about two or three kids."
(Telephone interview, March 8, 1991.) 
<P>
      Program Idiosyncrasies. Perry preschoolers were in a highly
controlled academic environment and were instructed by highly
professional educators. Perry pupils' parents were heavily involved,
and instructors visited pupils' homes each week. Few programs
duplicate such conditions, and even those that are similar have not
reproduced Perry's successes. 
<P>
      Conflicts of Interest. Studies of the Perry Program were
conducted by the same people who designed and administered the
project. High/Scope researchers have a professional and economic stake
in the program's success, including the marketing of early childhood
education program material. Such conflicts of interest prevent
High/Scope researchers, even with pure intentions, from being
objective observers. In High Scope Resource magazine, High/Scope
founder David Weikart tells educators: "Well folks, hold on to your
hats, because your salaries are going up!... Next year, Head Start
should receive approximately $700 to $800 million more in
appropriations .... There are signs of increasing financial support
for the early childhood field, including federal day care spending
bills that provide 'wrap-around services' for Head Start, allowing
Head Start to provide child care beyond its current program hours."
(David P. Weikart, High Scope Resource, Fall 1990, p. 22.) Weikart
calls for more lobbying: "We must be out there as advocates in the
public schools across the states when they are passing their
appropriations bills." (Ibid.)
<P>
<B> CONCLUSION</B>
<P>
      In the absence of hard scientific data, the federal government
should be very cautious before launching any programs. This is
particularly true, of course, for Washington's many-faceted campaign
to expand taxpayer-funded early childhood programs. 
<P>
      Warns psychologist Peery: "The public standard ought to be that
of prohibiting government from doing anything to children unless it
can be convincingly demonstrated that the children will benefit." 
<P>
      The answer to American cultural problems lies not in more
government programs to make up for family dysfunction but policies
that support families, particularly those with parents who care for
their own children. 
<P>
      To ensure that federal efforts help America's children:
<P>
      ** The Executive Order on the Family should be vigorously
enforced. Signed by Ronald Reagan in 1987, the order requires federal
agencies to take into account their policies' impact on family
formation, maintenance and general well-being" and to question whether
policies "strengthen or erode the stability of the family and the
marriage commitment" and "erode the authority and rights of parents in
the education, nurture and supervision of their children." This
Executive Order is widely ignored. The White House Office of Policy
Development submits an annual report on agencies' compliance with the
Executive Order on the Family and recommendations to the President. It
is time for George Bush to enforce them. 
<P>
      ** More research should be done on early education for
disadvantaged children to determine if there is a model that works and
can be replicated. Such efforts should target severely disadvantaged
children, follow methods for which there is evidence of success, and
use a controlled experiment format.
<P>
      ** Existing childhood education programs should be evaluated by
independent researchers. Bureaucracies cannot be expected to analyze
fairly the programs that they administer. Studies -- and federal
policies -- should take into account the impact of and impact on
families. 
<P>
      ** Federal policies should be based on giving parents more
choices. This could be achieved through vouchers and tax credits for
child care and education. If schools fail to teach, it is not because
they have not enrolled children soon enough.
<P>
      ** Families should be strengthened, not supplanted by social
programs. The federal tax code should not punish two-parent families
with children. The personal exemption for dependents should be
increased substantially. The $600 exemption of 1948 would be worth
more than $6,000 today. Welfare programs should be redesigned to
encourage fatherhood, not father abandonment. Taxpayers should not be
subsidizing family break-up, and government should intervene only in
cases of extreme hardship or abuse.  
<P>
      Families are America's greatest cultural resource. Federal
policies, however well-intentioned, that hinder families or supplant
parental authority lead to more social problems, not fewer. Parents
who sacrifice by cutting work hours, by temporarily leaving the work
force, by rearranging schedules or downscaling their life styles so
that one parent can care for young children at home suffer
discrimination two ways: they are taxed to subsidize services they do
not want or use, and they are taxed to support campaigns designed to
justify those services. 
<P>
      Early childhood development programs must be better scrutinized
for their effects on children and families before the federal
government spends more taxpayers' money on them. Says former Education
Secretary William J. Bennett: "Government, obviously, cannot fill a
child's emotional needs. Nor can it fill his spiritual or moral needs.
Government is not a father or a mother." (William J. Bennett,
"Children and Culture in Modern America," remarks at University of
Notre Dame, South Bend, Indiana, October 17, 1990.)
<P>
      Empowering Parents. Children need their parents, and parents
need more choice in how they spend their time and money. The best way
to empower children is to empower their parents -- the people who care
most and know what is best for their children.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<P>
     As Congress reconsiders recent crime legislation, lawmakers have an
opportunity to correct deficiencies in the law that encourage federal judges
to cut short the sentences of criminals -- often violent criminals -- and
release them back into the community.
<P>
     Tucked away in the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement
Act of 1994 is Section 3626, a little-noticed provision that deals with the
role of the federal courts in prison and jail litigation: "A Federal court shall
not hold prison or jail crowding unconstitutional" unless an "individual
plaintiff inmate proves that the crowding" inflicts "cruel and unusual
punishment" (Eighth Amendment violations) on him. Relief in such cases
"shall extend no farther than necessary to remove the conditions that" afflict
the particular inmate plaintiff. A "Federal court shall not place a ceiling on
the inmate population of any Federal, State, or local detention facility" as
a remedy for Eighth Amendment violations unless "crowding is inflicting
cruel and unusual punishment on particular identified prisoners."
Unfortunately, this provision has not had the intended effect.
<P>
     Both in letter and in spirit, the crowding provision of the 1994 crime
bill enjoyed wide bipartisan support in Congress, drew favorable on-the-
record remarks from President Clinton and state and local officials of both
parties, and won great praise from law enforcement organizations. Moreover,
the provision reflected strong public support. In every relevant public
opinion survey on crime conducted since 1980, the need to keep judges
from interfering unduly with the detection, arrest, prosecution, and
incarceration of predatory street criminals has been supported by wide
majorities of citizens of every demographic description in every region of
the country.
<P>
     As a rule, federal judges are enormously respectful of both the public
safety and the federalism concerns at stake in prison and jail litigation. But
the first major test case of Section 3626 makes it clear that this provision,
as drafted in the 1994 crime bill, will succeed neither in keeping
irresponsible federal judges from releasing violent criminals nor in
preventing them from gutting highly effective truth-in-sentencing laws and
related public safety measures.
<P>
     Prosecutors already are pointing to the need for fresh legislation. In
December 1994, the National District Attorneys Association, a nonpartisan
body representing concerned prosecutors throughout America, approved a
resolution calling on federal lawmakers to adopt more detailed legislation
to deal with the reality that "federal court orders in prison litigation often
have severe adverse effects on public safety, law enforcement and local
criminal justice systems." What these prosecutors and other law enforcement
officials understand is that the federal courts have gone overboard in
protecting prisoners' rights. They have done so at a huge human and
financial cost to law-abiding Americans and at the expense of making a
mockery out of democratically enacted laws. Some federal judges have
made themselves the sovereigns of the cell blocks, forcing changes in
operations that have resulted in inmate-on-inmate murders, inmate-on-staff
assaults, a dramatic increase in spending on amenities and services for
inmates, and the early release each year of literally hundreds of thousands
of violent or repeat criminals.
<P>
     Congress needs to strengthen Section 3626 to address this continuing
problem.
<P>
<b>THE FAILING CRIMINAL JUSTICE SYSTEM</b><P>
     In 1970, not a single prison system was operating under the
sweeping court orders common today. By 1990, some 508 municipalities
and over 1,200 state prisons were operating under judicial confinement
orders or consent decrees. Indeed, led by the federal bench, judges over the
last quarter-century have undone almost every major governmental anti-
crime initiative. 
<P>
     For example, in the 1970s, when state legislatures attempted to cut
funds for ineffective "rehabilitation" programs, judges declared that prisoners
have a legally enforceable right to some such services. In the June 1993
edition of Justice Quarterly, Professor Charles H. Logan of the University
of Connecticut and Dr. Gerald G. Gaes of the Federal Bureau of Prisons
offered an exhaustive analysis of the literature on such programs. They
found no evidence either that these programs rehabilitate prisoners or that
they come any closer to doing so today than they did twenty years ago.
    <P> Largely because of the courts, today about half of every tax dollar
spent on prisons goes not to the basics of security but to amenities and
services for prisoners. Prisons have about twice as many staff per inmate
today as they did in 1958. Yet most of the staffing increases have been to
administer the services and programs that judges have declared essential to
prisoners' rights -- recreation, education, and medical services.
<P>
     Likewise, in the 1980s, as many states passed mandatory-minimum
sentencing laws, the judges checkmated the public and its elected
representatives by imposing prison and jail caps. In the September 1994
edition of The Prison Journal, Dr. Gaes reviews the empirical literature on
prison crowding and reaches the same conclusions as numerous other
scholars: despite the conventional wisdom about the harmful effects of
crowding, the data simply do not support the belief that inmates suffer
greater levels of violence, illness, or other problems when prisons are
crowded. In many places, prison managers have run very crowded prisons
without any increases in critical incidents or other problems.
<P>
     Just the same, judges have continued to treat crowding as an
automatic threat to the well-being of prisoners and have enforced orders
resulting in the early release of dangerous criminals. In part because of these
judicial interventions, mandatory-minimum sentencing laws have been
largely ineffective: the median time that state prisoners spend in
confinement is only about 35 percent to 40 percent of their maximum
sentences.
<P>
     Many states are now tightening or abolishing parole and instituting
truth-in-sentencing laws that require offenders to serve at least 85 percent
of their sentenced time behind bars before release. Some are also instituting
measures that would result in life without parole for thrice-convicted violent
offenders. But unless the Congress acts decisively to curb federal judges,
they and their brethren on state and local benches -- not the legislatures --
will continue to be the chief doormen of America's revolving-door justice
system.
<P>
<b>REVOLVING-DOOR JUSTICE</b><P>
     According to studies by the U.S. Bureau of Justice Statistics (BJS),
in America today there are over 5 million persons under correctional
supervision -- behind bars, on probation, or on parole. But about 72 percent
of them are not incarcerated. Between 1980 and 1993, the nation's prison
population increased by 184 percent, and in 1994 there were over one
million convicted criminals in state and federal prisons. But over the same
period the nation's parole population increased by 204 percent. In 1994 over
3.5 million persons were on probation or parole.
<P>
     The vast majority of prisoners are violent or repeat offenders. The
latest BJS data show that 49 percent of state inmates are in prison for a
violent crime, 62 percent have been convicted of one or more violent crimes
in the past, and 94 percent have been convicted of a violent crime or been
sentenced in the past to probation or incarceration. Thus, barely 6 percent
of state prisoners are nonviolent offenders with no prior sentence to either
probation or incarceration.
<P>
     While official statistics show clearly that virtually all prisoners are
violent or repeat criminals, for at least two reasons the actual amount and
severity of crimes committed by prisoners when they are free are still many
times greater than these statistics reveal.
<P>
     The first reason is plea bargaining. Numerous studies show that over
90 percent of all adjudicated felony defendants do not go to trial, because
the offender pleads guilty to a lesser charge. Countless crimes are swept
under the criminal-records rug by plea bargaining.
<P>
     The second reason is that most prisoners commit many times more
non-drug felony crimes than the ones for which they are arrested, convicted,
and imprisoned. In two studies conducted in the early 1990s and published
in The Brookings Review, Harvard University economist Anne Morrison
Piehl and this author found that the median number of crimes, excluding all
drug crimes, committed by prisoners the year before they were imprisoned
was twelve.
<P>
     Not surprisingly, therefore, letting violent and repeat criminals out
of prison or jail and putting them on probation, parole, or pretrial release
results in countless murders, rapes, assaults, weapons offenses, robberies,
and burglaries each year. BJS data for the nation show that within three
years of sentencing, nearly half of all probationers and parolees are
convicted of a new crime or abscond. Among probationers with new felony
arrests, 54 percent are arrested once, 24 percent are arrested twice, and 22
percent are arrested three times or more. Nearly one-third of parolees who
were in prison for a violent crime, and nearly one-fifth who were in prison
for a property crime, are rearrested within three years for a violent crime.
Indeed, about 35 percent of all persons arrested for a violent crime are on
probation, parole, or pretrial release at the time of their arrest.
<P>
     The closer one looks, the clearer it becomes that a huge fraction of
America's crime problem results from lax probation, parole, and pretrial
release policies. For example, the August 1994 report of the Virginia
Governor's Commission on Parole Abolition and Sentencing Policy reveals
that in Virginia 68 percent of all murders, 76 percent of all aggravated
assaults, and 81 percent of all robberies are the work of repeat offenders.
Between 1986 and 1993 alone, the people of Virginia would have been
spared over 1,000 violent crimes, including 73 murders, if non-drug felons
out on parole had remained in prison.
<P>
     Likewise, a 1993 Florida Department of Corrections study reported
that between January 1, 1987, and October 10, 1991, some 127,486
prisoners were released early from Florida prisons. Within a few years of
their early release, they committed over 15,000 violent and property crimes,
including 346 murders and 185 sex offenses. Most of these crimes would
have been averted had the convicted criminals spent even 85 percent of their
sentenced time in prison. But as BJS data show, nationally, about half of all
parolees serve 14 months or less in prison before they are released and
spend well under half of their sentenced time in confinement.
<P>
<b>THE PHILADELPHIA STORY</b><P>
     The public safety toll of court-ordered revolving-door justice and the
difficulty of getting irresponsible federal judges to respect the Constitution
and yield to these concerns is a grave problem. This is epitomized by the
recent history of the prison cap imposed on Philadelphia by U.S. District
Court Judge Norma L. Shapiro. 
<P>
     Typical of the judicial modus operandi in such cases, Judge Shapiro
cajoled the city into signing two consent decrees, one in 1986 and one in
1991, which gave her virtually unfettered control over the system and its
finances. This relieved her of the necessity of ever having to issue a finding
that any particular inmate in the system was suffering from any specific
violation of his constitutional rights. Philadelphia's Mayor, Edward Rendell,
who is a former district attorney, has been battling for years to get Judge
Shapiro to relinquish her control. So far, she has resisted successfully.
<P>

     The main consequence of Judge Shapiro's intervention has
effectively been to decriminalize drug and property crime in Philadelphia.
Data compiled by the Philadelphia District Attorney's Office and by two
independent researchers show that some 67 percent of all defendants
released because of the prison cap simply fail to appear in court. In just one
recent 18-month period in Philadelphia, 9,732 arrestees out on the streets
because of the prison cap were rearrested on new charges, including 79
murders, 90 rapes, 701 burglaries, 959 robberies, 1,113 assaults, 2,215 drug
offenses, and 2,748 thefts. Among those murdered by offenders released
because of the court's prison cap was Danny Boyle, a 30-year-old rookie
Philadelphia police officer.
<P>
     The prison cap has played havoc with the city's downtown
redevelopment efforts and forced local businesses to spend even more than
they have been spending on security. It also has turned Philadelphia into a
major drug smuggling port. One reason for this is that under the terms of
Judge Shapiro's orders, a drug criminal who possesses less than 50 grams
of heroin (street value $33,000), 50 grams of cocaine (street value $5,000),
or 50 pounds of marijuana (street value $225,000) goes free. Some 76
percent of drug defendants do not even bother to appear in court.
<P>
     In a statement issued on October 31, 1994, Judge Shapiro did what
some federal judges all around the country have been doing in such cases
for the last three decades: She rejected the public safety concerns of law-
abiding citizens. She dismissed empirical evidence on the effects of
crowding. And she ignored the relevant language of Section 3626 of the
1994 crime bill, which clearly mandates that consent decrees in such cases
be reopened forthwith.
<P>
<b>THE TEXAS CASE</b><P>
     The adverse public safety impact of rulings like Judge Shapiro's are
bad enough. But one also must be mindful of how unbridled federal court
intervention affects prison safety and prison budgets. A good illustration on
both counts is the Texas case of Ruiz v. Estelle. The case began in 1972 and
is still not completely resolved today. It was led throughout by Federal
Judge William Wayne Justice of the Eastern District Court.
<P>
     In a 248-page opinion issued in 1980, Judge Justice required scores
of changes in the Texas prison system. Among them: <ul>
<P><li>
 An end to the use of "building tenders" (inmates who served as prison
guards and often brutalized fellow prisoners); 
<P><li>
A complete revision in the inmate disciplinary process; 
<P><li>
A division of the prison population into management units of not more than
500 cells each; 
<P><li>
The delivery of state-of-the-art medical services to prisoners; 
<P><li>
A reduction in the number of prisoners in maximum-security blocks; 
<P><li>
The provision of a spacious single cell for each prisoner. 
<P></ul><p>
     Some of these orders were constitutionally required and highly
desirable (for example, the end of the corrupt building tender system). But
most of the orders had not a single constitutional, scientific, or moral
anchor. Nor did they acknowledge the fact that Texas prison officials had
already developed some outstanding programs for prisoners, including the
only fully accredited prison education system in the nation. Instead, the
micromanagement simply reflected Judge Justice's ideology and that of his
team of court monitors.
<P>
     In 1982 the U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals for the Fifth District tried
to talk sense to Judge Justice, admonishing him that "the district court's
decree administers a massive dose when it is not yet demonstrable that a
lesser therapeutic measure would not suffice" to remedy conditions inside
Texas prisons. The Court of Appeals instructed him to "respect the right of
the state to administer its own affairs so long as it does not violate the
Constitution." Meanwhile, Texas prison officials continued to plead with
him to recognize that certain of his sweeping administrative requirements
would spawn short-term inmate violence and, in the decades to come, would
bankrupt the system if not the State of Texas itself.
<P>
     But Judge Justice turned a deaf ear to all such pleas. As a result, in
the mid-1980s Texas prisons experienced wholly unprecedented bouts of
murderous inmate-on-inmate violence. Between 1973 and 1980 there was a
total of 19 homicides in Texas prisons, and inmate-on-staff assaults were
exceedingly rare. But in 1983 and 1984, as the court's orders went into
effect, scores of prisoners were murdered, thousands were severely
assaulted, and rates of inmate-on-staff violence skyrocketed.
<P>
     So did costs. Prison operating expenses in Texas grew from $91
million in 1980 to $1.84 billion in 1994, a tenfold increase in real terms,
while the state's prison population barely doubled. In 1994 the Texas
Comptroller of Public Accounts issued a report which documented the fiscal
and administrative impact of the court's order on Texas prisons. The irony
of this report was that, after years of being battered by Judge Justice for
ostensibly failing to comply with his orders, Texas prison officials now were
being criticized for "overcompliance" with them. But the full and final
measure of responsibility for the human and financial toll of the court's
sweeping intervention must lie with the court itself.
<P>

<b>RESTRAINING JUDICIAL PANIC: THE JOB FOR CONGRESS</b><P>
     The history of judicial intervention into prisons and jails teaches that
it is not enough to raise public awareness or pass new laws. For
representative democracy to work on crime policy, and for Americans of
every race, creed, and color to be protected against the ravages of street
crime, more fundamental changes are needed.
<P>
     Whatever Congress does in revisiting the rest of the federal crime
bill of 1994, one of the most crucial steps must be to prohibit federal judges
from becoming de facto legislators and corrections czars. Section 3626 of
the 1994 federal crime bill was a step in the right direction, but only a tiny
step. The Congress should revisit this issue at once and take pains to ensure
that federal judges abide by federal laws governing the limited role of the
federal courts in conditions of confinement and related cases.
<P>
     The United States Constitution states in Article III, Section 2 that
"the Supreme Court shall have appellate Jurisdiction, both as to Law and
Fact, with such exceptions, and under such Regulations as the Congress
shall make" (emphasis added). The Supreme Court has declared over and
over again that federal courts must restrain themselves with respect to
conditions of confinement cases. To cite just a few key decisions, in Bell v.
Wolfish (1979), the Court declared that double-celling did not violate due
process. In Rhodes v. Chapman (1981), the Court held that double celling
was not cruel and unusual punishment. In Wilson v. Seiter (1991), the Court
ruled that constitutional violations had to be based on specific conditions
rather than "totality." And in Rufo v. Inmates of Suffolk County Jail (1992),
the Court endorsed flexible standards for modifying consent decrees in light
of changed circumstances.
<P>
     But within weeks of the passage of Section 3626 of the 1994 crime
bill, the National Prison Project of the American Civil Liberties Union
issued a memo, dated September 15, 1994, on how to "confront" the
provision. The memo mocked Congress for "taking a stand in favor of God,
motherhood, and locking up criminals" -- three values which, apparently, the
ACLU does not hold so dear. 
<P>
     Irresponsible federal judges, along with prisoners' rights lawyers and
anti-incarceration lobbyists, need to be reminded of the clear language of the
nation's governing political document with regard to the power of Congress
to set the appellate jurisdiction of the federal judiciary. Most Americans
want prisoners to have basic amenities (decent food, adequate medical care)
and services (educational opportunities, drug treatment). But they do not
want prisons to be virtual resorts, and they most certainly do not want
another generation's worth of violent and repeat criminals returned to the
streets because of some judge's political ideology, rejection of statistical
evidence, jurisprudential ignorance, or stubborn delusions about the
consequences of "crowding."
<P>
     To prevent judges from acting in this way, Congress needs to pass
legislation that unambiguously defines and further limits appropriate
remedies in prison and jail conditions cases. For unless and until the courts
are curbed, no mere changes in the law -- truth-in-sentencing reforms, three-
strikes mandates, new death penalty provisions -- will survive the judicial
gantlet that has effectively stymied every major democratically enacted anti-
crime measure of the last quarter-century.
<P>
     What if Congress acts to strengthen Section 3626 of the federal
crime bill but the lower federal courts do not abide by the additional
restrictions on prison remedies set by Congress? If that happens, then the
Congress, in the name of the people, should move at once to exercise its full
powers under Article III, Section 2 of the Constitution. The most
authoritative interpretation of that power is the plainest one. The late
Edward S. Corwin is widely considered this country's premier scholar of the
U.S. Constitution. As he wrote, "[T]he lower Federal courts derive all their
jurisdiction immediately from acts of Congress.... Also, all writs by which
jurisdiction is asserted or exercised are authorized by Congress.... The chief
external restraint upon judicial review arises from Congress's unlimited
control over the Court's appellate jurisdiction, as well as of the total
jurisdiction of the lower Federal courts."
<P>
     Congress should no longer abdicate its responsibility for the human
and financial harm done by activist federal judges. The place to begin is by
curbing federal judges who substitute the ACLU's prisoners' rights
manifesto for the Bill of Rights and impose prison caps and other orders
which permit violent and repeat criminals to rule the streets.

Proposal," June 28, 1991.)

<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>


    The Los Angeles riots have triggered demands for fundamental
reform of many policies affecting poor, inner-city neighborhoods. One
of the most pressing is education. In south-central Los Angeles, like
most inner-city communities, children today are consigned to an
extensive public school system which fails to educate them. That lack
of a basic education in most cases holds back those children for the
rest of their lives, condemning them to low-wage jobs or
unemployment. 
<P>
    The good news for these children and their parents is that the
Bush Administration authored legislation last year that was intended
to achieve fundamental education reform by "reinventing" the American
school system. The America 2000 proposal centers on parental choice,
national testing, and a program creating new kinds of schools.
<P>
    The bad news for inner-city children, and indeed for all American
children, is that one year later the reform package is facing fierce
opposition on Capitol Hill. In January the Senate stripped the
legislation of its most significant reform provisions, most notably
school choice. The America 2000 proposal is about to be taken up in
the House, where hostility to the core provisions is, if anything,
greater than in the Senate.  
<P>
    If poor Americans are to have the chance of a good education, the
Administration must regain the ground it has lost in the debate. This
requires George Bush to stand fast and fight much harder for his
America 2000 proposal, especially the key parental choice provisions.
If it is to succeed, the Administration must:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Strongly support certain proposed floor amendments to committee-
    passed legislation, most notably the amendment authored by Dick
    Armey, the Texas Republican, which revitalizes the school choice
    initiatives.
<P>
    Threaten to veto any legislation that omits central elements of
    the Administration's original reform package, such as school
    choice.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
<B> America 2000</B>
<P>
    President Bush's original America 2000 proposal contained four
central themes:
<P>
1)       Getting better and more accountable schools, through
         parental choice, national testing, and alternative
         certification (Alternative certification means allowing
         individuals without education degrees to become certified
         teachers, provided they have appropriate experience or a
         degree in their field.);
<P>
2)       Creating a new generation of American schools by encouraging
         schools that "break the mold" by offering alternative
         educational programs;
<P>
3)       Producing a nation in which families and communities help
         encourage students to learn by instilling respect for
         education, competence, and academic performance; and 
<P>
4)       Creating communities in which learning can happen, by
         increasing parental and community involvement in education
         reform.
<P>
    The President's America 2000 strategy also incorporated national
education goals to make Americans more competitive in the world
economy. These goals include the achievement of specific academic
standards, new curricula for American schools, a system of voluntary
national examinations, and more flexibility for public school teachers
and principals.
<P>
<B> Hill Action</B>
<P>
    The Administration sent its America 2000 package to Congress last
fall, after announcing the outline of the package in April. But
instead of incorporating the proposal's main features in a new
education bill, the House Education and Labor Committee last October
reported out H.R. 3320, which largely ignored the President's
strategy. Not to be outdone, the Senate this January passed S. 2,
which also failed to incorporate the most significant aspects of the
President's plan, and did little more than authorize $850 million for
a new block grant for school experiments effectively controlled by the
education establishment. 
<P>
    The Senate bill is severely flawed. Because of unwise concessions
by the Administration, the legislation contains only watered-down
provisions for creating "New American Schools," the experimental,
"break the mold" schools, intended to test innovative programs and
approaches to education, and it allows little regulatory flexibility
for teachers and administrators. In fact, the Senate bill is largely a
triumph of bureaucratic process over substance. 
<P>
    Worst of all, the Senate rejected even a very modest version of
the Administration's school choice proposal.The defeated amendment,
designed by the Administration and Senator Orrin Hatch, the Utah
Republican, would have authorized a three-year demonstration project
granting $30 million each year in education vouchers to help low-
income parents send their children to quality private schools, and it
would have provided a $5 million grant to each of six low-income
communities selected nationally to create pilot programs offering low-
income students in the community their choice of area public or
private schools.
<P>
    While very small, when compared with the total federal education
budget of $32.3 billion, these choice provisions would give low-income
parents the financial means to opt out of their failing public school
-- a choice which middle and upper income families already have -- and
allow their children to be educated in another school. This small
demonstration program simply would give school choice supporters an
opportunity, on a limited trial basis, to show that choice works. But
as a result of intense pressure from the education bureaucracy,
particularly the teacher and school administrator unions, the Senate
refused to sanction an experiment with choice.
<P>
    Likewise, the committee-passed House bill contains no choice
provisions. Representative William Ford, the Michigan Democrat and
Chairman of the House Education and Labor Committee, announced in
February that he would not bring the House bill containing portions of
the Bush Administration's education proposals (H.R. 3320) to the floor
for a vote. Instead, the House will consider a committee-authored bill
(H.R. 4323), which explicitly bans federal funding of private school
choice programs. It actually scales back existing community
involvement in improving local schools and gives more control to
public school boards, who in the past have had little interest in
serious innovation. H.R. 4323 also could hinder choice legislation at
the state level by sending a signal from Washington that choice is
unacceptable, and also by prohibiting the use of federal funds, which
often are used to pay for state pilot programs involving private
school choice. At the end of last year's legislative session 23 states
had some type of choice plan, and well over half gave consideration to
choice legislation. (School Choice Programs:  What's Happening in the
States, compiled and edited by Jeanne Allen with Angela Hulsey, The
Heritage Foundation, March 1992.) Significantly, efforts to promote
choice at the state level have been led by teachers and business
leaders as well as parents.
<P>
    The bill calls for a $700 million federal block grant program
which would be spent as the state and local bureaucracies saw fit as
long as it did not go toward choice programs involving private
schools. Vague descriptions of authorized activities would permit
practically any fad the education bureaucracies want to fund, without
any kind of accountability to parents. H.R. 4323 also contains
provisions aimed at "addressing disparities in expenditures and the
reasons for such disparities among local educational agencies in each
state and among states across the nation." These latter provisions
reflect the assumption that the way to improve schools in poor
communities is to make sure that school spending is equal throughout
the country. Yet numerous studies show that there is no significant
correlation between spending and school quality. (See John Chubb and
Terry Moe, Politics, Markets, and America's Schools (Washington, D.C.: 
The Brookings Institution, 1990).)
<P>
<B> The Armey Amendment</B>
<P>
    In an effort to correct the shortcomings of H.R. 4323,
Representative Dick Armey, the Texas Republican, plans to offer a
floor amendment to H.R. 4323. The amendment goes a long way toward
restoring the original content of the President's America 2000
proposals. The amendment: 
<P>
1)       Limits the use of the $700 million in new funds to projects
         based on school choice, site-based management, alternative
         teacher certification, merit testing, and New American
         Schools; <P>
2)       Allows the Secretary of Education to deny grants to
         activities which in his view will not promote reform in
         education; and<P>
3)       Gives state governors, not teachers and school
         administrators, the authority to head the panels charged
         with determining the use of federal grant money. 
<P>
    The Armey amendment explicitly allows private, parochial, and
public schools to be included in choice experiments and earmarks a
minimum of 25 percent of program funds for these initiatives. The
White House Choice
<P>
    America 2000 advocates the use of federal funds to stimulate
state and local level reforms based on choice and other promising
approaches. Congress, however, is transforming the plan into yet
another education spending bill aimed at propping up a government
school monopoly that is ruining American public schools and failing to
educate American children. The results so far of such congressional
"business as usual" education policies: Federal education spending at
all levels of government has increased over 25 percent since 1989, yet
test scores have fallen. 
<P>
    So far, the Administration has shown a desire to compromise on
its original proposal while the Senate and House tears it to shreds.
White House dithering merely encourages Hill opposition. As the
legislative disaster in the Senate was unfolding, the President
rightly threatened to veto any bill that did not contain education
choice provisions. But after the Senate passed a bill explicitly
rejecting choice, the Administration backpedaled and announced that it
was "reevaluating" its own position. Now, with the House legislation
soon facing a vote, opponents of major reform take comfort in the fact
that the Administration has neither issued an explicit veto threat
against H.R. 4323, although Education Secretary Lamar Alexander has
recommended such a veto, nor even indicated that it will support the
Armey Amendment on the House floor. The "Education President,"
opponents understandably conclude, seems prepared to give up on real
education reform without a fight. 
<P>
<B> Conclusion
</B><P>
    The Bush Administration has an historic opportunity to improve
American education. But the President can only do this if he takes the
initiative and makes clear to friend and foe alike what he really
supports and what is unacceptable. If he wishes to keep alive any
prospect of the core elements of America 2000 becoming law, he must:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Back strongly amendments for education choice and other key
    reforms when H.R. 4323 reaches the House floor, including the
    proposed Armey Amendment;
<P>
    State unequivocally that he will veto any education bill that
    does not contain education choice provisions.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
    Only if the Administration draws a clear line, and forces
Congress to choose between fundamental reform and business as usual in
the schools, will inner-city children in America at last have the
chance to obtain a sound basic education.

<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

One of the most important fiscal policy debates developing in this election involves the question of whether changes in tax policy have "supply-side" effects. In other words, will lower tax rates increase economic growth, resulting in more jobs, higher wages, and bigger profits?  If the answer is yes -- meaning that lower tax rates cause taxable income to rise -- it is reasonable to argue that a tax cut will be at least partially self-financing. The extent to which increased revenue from a bigger tax base helps offset the revenue loss from lower tax rates then becomes an empirical question. This is what "static" versus "dynamic" scoring is all about. Static analysis assumes that tax changes have no impact on economic growth, meaning no increases in revenue; dynamic analysis recognizes that taxes do affect the economy. Unfortunately, government estimators use a static approach.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The battle over revenue-estimating methodology may seem an esoteric, inside-the-Beltway issue, but it has important implications. Politicians generally favor tax cuts, but they do not relish voting for higher deficits and certainly are loathe to approve offsetting savings from the spending side of the budget. Dynamic scoring, assuming it is used properly, can facilitate sound tax policy by reducing the politically "unpleasant" side-effects of tax cuts.<sup>1</sup>  In the short term, a proper understanding of the importance of dynamic scoring would make it easier either to repeal the 1990 and 1993 tax hikes or to provide an across-the-board reduction in tax rates.<sup>2</sup>  In the long term, the move to a flat tax would be expedited if dynamic scoring were used to allow the lowest possible rate.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Because dynamic scoring would make tax rate reductions more attractive, it is understandable that those who oppose tax cuts want to maintain the current system of static scoring. An objective examination of the historical evidence, however, demonstrates that dynamic scoring gives policymakers more accurate information.<sup>3</sup>  When taking steps to modernize the revenue-estimating process, policymakers should consider the following points:<ul><p><li><b>Learn from history.</b> Static scoring routinely overestimates how much revenue will be generated by tax increases. The 1990 luxury tax, the income tax rate increases of 1990 and 1993, and the 1986 capital gains tax rate increase are all examples in which revenues fell far short of static predictions. By contrast, the 1981 Reagan tax cuts, the 1978 capital gains tax reduction, the Kennedy tax cuts of the 1960s, and the 1986 Tax Reform Act all demonstrate how pro-growth tax changes will generate revenue feedback.<sup>4</sup><p><li><b>Don't make the perfect the enemy of the good.</b> It is impossible to predict all the effects of any single change in government policy. The fact that dynamic scoring cannot pinpoint all the multiyear effects of a change in tax policy, however, is not an argument for maintaining a static process guaranteed to give an answer that is wrong and farther from the truth.

<P><LI><B>Not all tax cuts are created equal.</b> The higher the tax rate, the bigger the supply-side response when the rate is reduced. Likewise, reducing tax rates on capital income, which is more easily controlled by the taxpayer, will have a greater impact than similar tax reductions on labor income. And some tax cuts, such as credits, will have little or no revenue feedback effects since incentives to engage in productive behavior remain unchanged.<sup>5</sup><p><li><b>Open the process to public scrutiny.</b> Even though they are the ones who pay the bills, taxpayers today are not allowed to examine the static models and methodology used by revenue estimators at the Joint Committee on Taxation and the Treasury Department. Whether or not the revenue-estimating process is improved, policymakers should insist on full disclosure. If policymakers adopt dynamic scoring, an open process will keep the system honest by inhibiting those who are tempted to exaggerate the benefits of tax cuts.

<p><li><b>The goal of tax policy is to maximize growth, not tax revenues.</b> For years, budget deficits have played a big role in the political debate. As a result, some tax policy proposals, such as reductions in the capital gains tax, are judged primarily by their effect on tax collections. This myopic approach inevitably interferes with sound tax policy and should be discarded.

<p><li><b>Include estimates of private and governmental compliance costs.</b> According to the Tax Foundation, the current tax system imposes $225 billion in compliance costs on the productive sector of the economy.<sup>6</sup>  In addition to these private costs of lawyers, lobbyists, accountants, tax preparers, and lost man-hours, about $13 billion in direct government expenditures is associated with taxation.<sup>7</sup>  Yet revenue estimators confess that "staff does not estimate the administrative costs incurred by either the IRS or taxpayers that may result from proposed legislation."<sup>8</sup></ul><p><b>WHAT IS STATIC SCORING, AND WHO DOES IT?</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are two official sources of revenue estimates in Washington. The Administration uses the Office of Tax Analysis (OTA), which is part of the Treasury Department, and Congress uses the Joint Committee on Taxation (JCT). Both use static scoring, though it is important to define the term.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Static scoring does not mean there is absolutely no recognition that taxpayers might modify their behavior in response to changes in tax policy. Defenders of the status quo thus argue that dynamic effects are incorporated into revenue forecasts. To a limited extent, they are right.<sup>9</sup>  If asked to estimate the revenue impact of a change in the gasoline tax, for instance, the current process attempts to measure the degree to which the change in the tax will affect the amount of gasoline purchased. Likewise, changes in income tax rates will include some calculation of tax avoidance behavior.<sup>10</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Missing from the equation, however, is any effort to capture the revenue effects caused by changes in macroeconomic variables. Revenue estimators assume that economic growth, job creation, and income will remain unchanged, regardless of how much taxes are reduced or increased. The Treasury Department's Office of Tax Analysis, for example, in a 1995 analysis of the flat tax wrote that:
<blockquote>
	no attempt is made to estimate the tax-induced behavioral responses of either individuals or corporations. Following the standard revenue estimating conventions used by both the Office of Tax Analysis and the Joint Committee on Taxation, the macroeconomic aggregates, such as the level of compensation, prices, employment, and gross domestic product, have been assumed to be unchanged by the proposal.<sup>11</sup></blockquote><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These assumptions effectively require the Treasury Department and the Joint Committee on Taxation to ignore the real world. This may be a reasonable approach for minor alterations of the tax code,<sup>12</sup> but it certainly produces inaccurate answers when examining significant changes. Thus, if asked to predict what would happen if tax rates were doubled, for instance, revenue estimators would assume that tax collections, with some minor modifications, would double as well. Some may think this is an exaggeration, but consider the actions of the Joint Committee on Taxation. In 1988, Senator Robert Packwood (R-OR), ranking Republican on the Finance Committee, asked the JCT to estimate the revenue impact if the government confiscated all income over $200,000 annually.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The revenue estimators at JCT responded that such a tax would raise $104 billion the first year, $204 billion the second year, $232 billion the third year, and $263 billion and $299 billion in the fourth and fifth years, respectively.<sup>13</sup>  As Senator Packwood noted, however, this view of the world is impractical because it "assumes people will work if they have to pay all their money to the Government. They will work forever and pay all of the money to the Government when clearly anyone in their right mind will not."<sup>14</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To be fair, the revenue estimators are not really the ones at fault.<sup>15</sup>  The decision to modernize and improve the scoring process will have to come from the top. At the Office of Tax Analysis, presidentially appointed officials at the Treasury Department are the only ones with the power to authorize this change. On Capitol Hill, this power lies with the Members of Congress who serve on the Joint Committee on Taxation, particularly the Chairman and Vice-Chairman. Indeed, the JCT has set up a Revenue Estimating Advisory Board to explore "ways to improve the estimating process and estimating methodology."<sup>16</sup><p><b>WHAT IS DYNAMIC SCORING?</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
In simple terms, dynamic scoring means that estimates would be designed to capture revenue effects from changes in overall economic conditions. Instead of deliberately ignoring these variables, as is the convention today, revenue estimators would predict whether a change in policy would be likely to affect the level of compensation, prices, employment, and gross domestic product (GDP). If there is an effect on one or more of these variables, they would then calculate the amount of revenue feedback or loss.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

How would this work?  Take the example of the 15 percent across-the-board tax cut proposed some weeks ago by Senator Spencer Abraham (R-MI). Static revenue estimates reportedly show this proposal reducing tax revenues by about $500 billion over a six-year period.<sup>17</sup>  If such a proposal boosted the economy's rate of growth by one-half of one percentage point over the same period, however, Congressional Budget Office sensitivity tables (designed to measure the effects of selected economic changes on budget projections) indicate that $170 billion of that loss would be recouped in the form of revenue feedback and lower interest costs. Administration figures show the feedback would be more than $200 billion.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

As shown in <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090t1.gif">Table 1</a>, both the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) agree that faster growth helps reduce the budget deficit. These numbers work both ways, incidentally, with slower growth boosting the budget deficit. The key questions are whether a change in tax policy will promote growth and, if so, by how much.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Contrary to popular wisdom, dynamic scoring does not mean that tax cuts pay for themselves. The degree of revenue feedback depends on what tax rate is being reduced and by what amount. Only in extremely rare circumstances is it believed that a tax rate reduction will generate enough economic activity to offset all of the revenue loss associated with the lower rate.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

<a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090c1.gif">Chart 1</a>, popularly known as the Laffer curve, illustrates this principle. A zero rate tax will stimulate considerable growth but, by definition, collects no revenue. A 100 percent tax rate also generates no revenue, however, because it eliminates all incentive to earn income -- not to mention what happens to the rest of the economy. What happens, though, if the government imposes a tax rate of, say, 10 percent?  With a low, flat rate, almost all taxpayers presumably will continue to work, so the government will collect one-tenth of the income earned. As tax rates rise, however, taxpayers gradually become discouraged and reduce their earnings. As long as tax rates are not excessive, the increase in revenue associated with the higher tax rate exceeds the revenue loss caused by lower levels of income. At some point, however, the tax rate reaches a revenue-maximizing level. Any efforts to raise tax rates beyond this level will reduce revenues because of the fall in taxable income.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Tragically, there are some taxes in America that fall on the wrong side of the Laffer curve. These include:<ul>

<p><li><b>Income tax rates on the rich.</b> Wealthy taxpayers are particularly sensitive to high tax rates. Not only can they afford the best tax lawyers, accountants, and financial planners, but they also receive most of their income in the form of dividends, interest, capital gains, and other business income (see <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090c2.gif">Chart 2</a>). When tax rates become too onerous, these taxpayers can shift their assets to tax-free status, move their money offshore, or take other steps to alter the timing or composition of their income.<sup>18</sup>  According to recent research by James Poterba of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology, lower tax rates on the richest 0.5 percent would generate higher rather than lower tax revenues.<sup>19</sup>

<p><li><b>Estate taxes.</b> The government confiscates 55 percent of a person's assets in excess of $4 million upon death.<sup>20</sup>  Those smart enough to build up businesses and portfolios of this value, however, typically are also smart enough to protect their families' wealth from the government.<sup>21</sup>  Thus, even though the estate tax collects about $15 billion annually, it is estimated that the government loses money because of reduced income tax collections caused by aggressive estate planning (which occurs in the years prior to death when wealthy taxpayers transfer funds, cease working, set up trusts, give to charity, and take other steps to reduce the tax value of their assets).<sup>22</sup><p><li><b>Capital gains taxes.</b> Revenue estimators from both Congress and the Administration acknowledge that lower capital gains taxes will boost sales (or realizations) of stock, bonds, real estate, and other assets. This "unlocking effect," by itself, may be large enough to produce a net revenue increase.<sup>23</sup>  Unfortunately, both the JCT and the OTA fail to calculate the impact of lower capital gains taxes on economic growth. If the revenue estimates included the effects of higher growth, they almost surely would show a significant revenue gain.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tax rates that are so punitive that they actually lose revenue certainly should be reduced. The lower rate would please conservatives who favor economic growth, and should please liberals who want the government to collect more money.<sup>24</sup>  It is important to recognize, however, that there is a huge difference between the revenue-maximizing tax rate and the growth-maximizing tax rate. Largely because of hefty value-added taxes (a form of national sales tax), many countries in Europe take a much higher percentage of their citizens' money than America does.<sup>25</sup>  These nations may be near the revenue-maximizing point of the Laffer curve, but it comes at a heavy price. European countries, compared to the United States, suffer from higher unemployment, slower growth, larger budget deficits, and lower incomes.

<b>HISTORICAL EXAMPLES</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The strong theoretical argument for dynamic scoring is augmented by a great deal of historical evidence. The United States has experienced significant shifts in tax policy over the years, and the historical record both demonstrates the shortcomings of static analysis and provides ample proof that the revenue-estimating process should be modernized.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Before looking at specific examples, however, it may be useful to look at the broad picture. As <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090c3.gif">Chart 3</a> illustrates, tax revenues traditionally have consumed about 19 percent of America's economic output.<sup>26</sup>  This relationship has been remarkably stable even though tax rates have shifted by large amounts. At times, the top income tax rate has exceeded 90 percent, while at other times it has fallen to less than 30 percent. The chart also shows income tax collections as a percentage of GDP. As is the case with total tax revenues, income tax collections are remarkably stable, hovering between 8 percent and 9 percent. The only two times they reached 9.4 percent or more, in 1969 and 1981, the economy fell into recession.<sup>27</sup><p><b>The Tax Cuts of the 1920s.</b> Tax rates were slashed dramatically during the 1920s, falling from 73 percent to 24 percent.<sup>28</sup>  The economy boomed, growing at an average annual rate of 6 percent between 1921 and 1929.<sup>29</sup>  Personal income tax revenues increased substantially, rising from $719 million in 1921 to $1,160 million in 1928.<sup>30</sup>  This 61 percent increase in revenue occurred at a time of no inflation. As <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090c4.gif">Chart 4</a> shows, the percentage of the tax burden borne by the rich jumped dramatically, climbing from 44.2 percent in 1921 to 78.4 percent in 1928. These results, not surprisingly, would not have been predicted by static analysis.<p><b>The Kennedy Tax Cuts.</b> Lower taxes on savings and investment were approved in 1962, followed by across-the-board tax rate reductions in 1964. Economic growth picked up, with GDP increasing at an average annual rate of 5 percent between 1961 and 1968.<sup>31</sup>  The Kennedy tax cuts triggered the longest expansion in America's history, and revenues grew by 62 percent over the seven-year period.<sup>32</sup>  One of the most compelling pieces of supply-side evidence is the way different income groups responded to lower tax rates. As seen in <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090c5.gif">Chart 5</a>, wealthy taxpayers wound up paying significantly more tax revenues after their tax rates were reduced -- exactly as dynamic forecasting would have predicted.
<p>
<b>The 1978 Capital Gains Tax Cut.</b> The more control a taxpayer has over a taxable activity, the more pronounced the supply-side effect. Capital gains taxes are the best example of this phenomenon since a taxpayer can avoid the tax by not selling assets. In 1968, legislation was approved raising the capital gains tax from 25 percent to 49 percent. (Effective tax rates almost always were higher--sometimes over 100 percent -- since the government did not, and still does not, allow taxpayers to adjust asset prices for inflation.) Not surprisingly, capital gains revenues were sluggish throughout the 1970s. In 1978, however, the rate was reduced to 28 percent.<sup>33</sup>  The very next year, revenues jumped 45 percent.<sup>34</sup>  Capital gains tax revenues continued to rise, climbing even more when the Reagan tax cuts lowered the rate even further, down to 20 percent in 1981.<p>
<b>Windfall Profits Tax.</b> During the Carter Administration, a heavy tax was imposed on crude oil. The Joint Committee on Taxation estimated in 1979 that the tax would collect $184.5 billion between 1980 and 1985. But it brought in just $77.7 billion.<sup>35</sup>  To be fair, the huge revenue gap probably was due to President Reagan's decision to decontrol oil prices, something the JCT could not have predicted in 1979. At the same time, however, foreknowledge of this move may have caused the revenue estimators to make an even bigger mistake, since most liberals believed that restoring competition to the petroleum market would cause oil prices to skyrocket.<sup>36</sup><p><b>The Reagan Tax Cuts.</b> Campaigning on across-the-board tax cuts, Ronald Reagan took office at a time when the economy was in horrible shape. The economy was in the middle of a severe double-dip recession. Inflation was running at double-digit rates, unemployment was rising, and interest rates had climbed to more than 20 percent.<sup>37</sup>  Critics claimed the tax cuts would be inflationary and would do nothing to boost growth, but just the opposite happened. Americans did not receive a net tax cut until sometime between July 1982 and January 1983 because previously legislated payroll tax increases and bracket creep offset the portions of the tax cut that took effect in 1981 and 1982.<sup>38</sup>  Once the tax cuts did take effect, the longest peacetime economic expansion in the nation's history began.<sup>39</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

The most comprehensive analysis of the revenue effect of the Reagan tax cuts shows two things: The lower tax rates on the rich more than paid for themselves, and there were substantial feedback effects from lower tax rates on other income classes as well (see <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090c6.gif">Chart 6</a>). Defenders of high tax rates condemn the Reagan program, noting that tax revenues in the early 1980s were well below the Administration's original projections.<sup>40</sup>  But this reasoning is seriously flawed. First, it blames the tax cuts for the second half of the double-dip recession of 1980-1982, a drop in the economy that began before the economy received a tax cut. Second, it fails to recognize the irony that two-thirds of the revenue shortfall occurred because inflation was reduced much faster than was originally thought.<sup>41</sup>  Significantly, the forecast of the Democrat-controlled Congressional Budget Office closely matched the Administration's.<sup>42</sup><p><b>The 1986 Tax Reform Act.</b> This legislation provides one of the best examples of why dynamic forecasting is needed. The Tax Reform Act lowered tax rates on individual income and increased the tax burden on corporate income.<sup>43</sup>  According to the static estimates, the shift in taxes amounted to more than $100 billion over the five-year period. Actual tax collections, however, showed a very clear and pronounced supply-side effect. As taxpayers responded to lower rates, individual income tax revenues grew faster than expected, nearly 6 percent above projections. The higher tax burden on corporate income, meanwhile, had the opposite effect. Corporate income tax receipts were very sluggish, falling nearly 25 percent below the static estimates.<sup>44</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The divergent responses of personal and corporate income tax collections are critical. Defenders of static forecasting always try to argue that the dynamic effects are a coincidence. The booming economy and rapid revenue growth of the 1920s, 1960s, and 1980s, for instance, are said to have had nothing to do with lower tax rates. Likewise, the economy's poor performance during the 1930s, 1970s, and 1990s is said to be just bad fortune completely unrelated to higher tax rates. These arguments fall apart when analyzing the Tax Reform Act, since it is impossible to blame sluggish corporate tax collections on a weak economy while at the same time claiming that strong personal tax collections are the result of a strong economy.
<p>
<b>The 1986 Capital Gains Tax Rate Increase.</b> As part of the Tax Reform Act of 1986, policymakers increased the capital gains tax from 20 percent to 28 percent. Two noteworthy things happened. Capital gains realizations (asset sales) and revenues soared before the tax rate increase took effect and then collapsed by more than 50 percent when the higher rate took effect.<sup>45</sup>  When the Congressional Budget Office put together its revenue baseline in 1990, however, it assumed that capital gains realizations would grow at the same rate they did during the early 1980s when the tax rate was low. This proved to be a huge error. In fact, the high capital gains tax discouraged asset sales, and realizations were stagnant, usually less than half of CBO's projections.<sup>46</sup>  Moreover, the Joint Committee on Taxation used this inflated baseline in 1990 to put together static revenue estimates suggesting that a reduction in the rate would lose money and primarily benefit the wealthy. But the 1986 increase in the capital gains tax rate actually hurt middle-income taxpayers more than the rich, since the tax rate on their gains rose from 14 percent to 28 percent.<sup>47</sup><p><b>The Luxury Tax.</b> The 1990 budget agreement included provisions imposing excise taxes on products thought to be purchased by the "rich," including luxury boats and private airplanes. These taxes backfired so badly that Congress repealed them. Actual collections from the boat tax reached $32.5 million, according to the Treasury Department, far below the $53 million originally forecast.<sup>48</sup>  The Joint Committee on Taxation, meanwhile, admitted that the airplane tax collected just 10 percent of the static estimate.<sup>49</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Defenders of the tax have tried to argue that the revenue shortfall was coincidental,<sup>50</sup> but the actual effects are even worse than these numbers indicate. When boat builders lost their jobs and boatyards shut down, the federal government lost income and payroll taxes and also had to pay out unemployment benefits.<sup>51</sup>  The static estimates recognized that some people might have lost jobs as a result of the tax but assumed that those workers would immediately get jobs someplace else paying the same wage.<sup>52</sup>  Life in the real world, unfortunately, does not operate as flawlessly as these static blackboard models.<p><b>The Bush Tax Rate Increase.</b> In 1990, President Bush reneged on his no-new-taxes promise and signed into law a major tax increase, including an increase in the top rate from 28 percent to 31 percent. Rather than bring in new revenues, however, the government began to collect less revenue than was projected before tax rates were increased.<sup>53</sup>  In 1991 alone, revenues fell by more than $6 for every $1 the tax increase was supposed to generate.<sup>54</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Defenders of static scoring admit this happened but blame the stagnant economy for the drop in revenues. Since the tax increase certainly helped throw the economy into the tank, however, this excuse rings hollow. Even if one accepts the unlikely assumption that the tax increase had nothing to do with the recession, there are other compelling numbers showing the dynamic effect. In 1991, income tax receipts from those making more than $200,000 fell by more than 6 percent.<sup>55</sup>  Yet tax collections from those making less than that rose by 1 percent. In other words, the government wound up collecting less in revenue from the taxpayers who were slapped with higher tax rates, but collecting more from those whose taxes did not go up.
<p>
<b>The 1993 Clinton Tax Rate Increase.</b> Without a vote to spare in either the House or the Senate, President Clinton during his first year in office imposed the largest tax increase in history. His increase in tax rates, from 31 percent to 39.6 percent,<sup>56</sup> was the biggest jump since Herbert Hoover boosted the rate from 25 percent to 63 percent in 1930. Harvard economist Martin Feldstein estimates that the tax rate increase raised only one-third of the promised revenue.<sup>57</sup>  The combined effect of the Bush and Clinton tax rate increases has been an utter failure. As shown in <a href="/heritage/library/categories/budgettax/bg1090c7.gif">Chart 7</a>, revenues from the personal income tax actually have declined as a percentage of economic output since Reagan left office.<sup>58</sup><p><b>REVENUE ESTIMATES AND THE FLAT TAX</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The perils and pitfalls of static forecasting are clearly evident in the flat tax debate. Representative Richard Armey (R-TX) resuscitated the idea of moving to a simple and fair one-rate tax system in 1994. Almost immediately, the proposal was attacked by the Administration. Shortly before the mid-term elections that year, the press reported a Treasury Department estimate that the flat tax would require a rate of 25.8 percent to be revenue neutral.<sup>59</sup>  Six months later, the Administration criticized the flat tax yet again, but this time charged that the rate would have to be 22.9 percent to avoid increasing the deficit.<sup>60</sup>  More recently, the Treasury Department issued its third static estimate of the flat tax, this time claiming that the revenue neutral rate would be 20.8 percent.<sup>61</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Clinton Administration's inability to settle on a single rate is instructive for two reasons. It demonstrates that even static revenue estimates, which involve more simplistic calculations, are far from exact. Even more important, the White House inadvertently has provided compelling evidence for the flat tax. The Treasury Department's most recent estimate, predicting a revenue neutral rate of 20.8 percent, is still exaggerated.<sup>62</sup>  But it confirms that Representative Armey's 20 percent flat tax, which includes $40 billion in budgetary savings,<sup>63</sup> is deficit-neutral -- even using static analysis.<p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not surprisingly, dynamic estimates of the flat tax, using more sophisticated econometric and modeling techniques, find that growth increases significantly. This additional growth, as illustrated earlier, results in substantial revenue increases. An important question, of course, is who benefits from the economy's expansion. Representative Armey and Senate co-sponsor Richard Shelby (R-AL) believe that taxpayers should reap the benefit of faster growth. As a result, they reduce the flat rate to 17 percent in the third year.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

Numerous studies support the contention that the economy will expand dramatically if the existing tax code is replaced by a single-rate flat tax. For example:<UL>

<p><li>Professor Dale Jorgenson, Chairman of the Economics Department at Harvard, testified before the National Commission on Economic Growth and Tax Reform that a single-rate system could boost the economy by 15 percent or more within a decade.<sup>64</sup><p><li>University of California professor Alan Auerbach, formerly an economist with the Joint Committee on Taxation, estimates that the economy would be 5.7 percent larger within five years with a flat tax.<sup>65</sup><p><li>Stanford University economist Michael Boskin, a former Chairman of the Council of Economic Advisers, has testified that a flat tax would boost growth by 10 percent within ten years.<sup>66</sup><p><li>Even without growth effects, two former Treasury Department economists estimate that a flat tax would be revenue neutral at 17 percent.<sup>67</sup><p><li>Boston University economist Laurence J. Kotlikoff estimates that a move to a single-rate tax that does not double-tax capital income would raise living standards by between 7 percent and 14 percent.<sup>68</sup><p><li>A study by two academic economists found that a 17 percent flat tax would boost growth so much that tax revenues would increase by 1.8 percentage points.<sup>69</sup></ul><p><b>QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS ABOUT DYNAMIC SCORING</b><p><b><i>Q: Will lower tax rates reduce the underground economy, and will dynamic forecasting reflect this shift?</i><p>A:</b> Yes, but probably not enough to affect revenue forecasts. By definition, measuring the size of the underground economy is difficult. Those that have tried have produced estimates ranging from a low of 5 percent of GDP to a high of more than 25 percent of GDP.<sup>70</sup>  An added problem is that no one knows how much of the underground economy exists for the purpose of evading taxes. It is safe to assume that most drug dealers, bookies, and prostitutes do not pay taxes, but that will not change if tax rates are lowered. For activities that are legal, however, lower tax rates would reduce tax evasion. The American Bar Association conducted a three-year study which concluded that lower tax rates encourage greater compliance.<sup>71</sup><p><b><i>Q: What safeguards would be needed to ensure that the party in power did not abuse dynamic forecasts?</i><p>A:</b> This is a legitimate concern. Politicians often exaggerate the benefits of legislation they support, and it does not take a wild imagination to envision revenue estimators pressured to produce excessively optimistic numbers. The Congressional Budget Office, for instance, was often accused of tailoring its figures to help the Democrats when they were in the majority.<sup>72</sup>  This is why public disclosure of the model and methodology is so important. If outside experts were allowed to review all decisions, the potential for mischief would shrink dramatically.<sup>73</sup><p><b><i>Q: Should there be dynamic forecasts of spending legislation?</i><p>A:</b> If the scientific evidence is clear, the answer is yes. Considerable research has been done to show that government spending, particularly for consumption items, is a drag on economic growth.<sup>74</sup><p>Incorporating this new research into budget analysis would help policymakers make proper decisions. As with dynamic scoring of tax legislation, full disclosure is critical. The Congressional Budget Office, for instance, used a version of dynamic scoring during the debate over the 1995 Balanced Budget Act. Unfortunately, in predicting dramatic reductions in interest rates following enactment of legislation to reduce budget deficits,<sup>75</sup> the CBO was almost surely wrong.<sup>76</sup>  If the CBO had to publish its analyses and defend them before outside experts, estimators would be forced to refine and improve their techniques.<p><b>CONCLUSION</b><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;During the post-Reagan years, the economy has experienced its worst seven-year performance since the end of World War II.<sup>77</sup>  The average family has lost more than $2,000 of real purchasing power,<sup>78</sup> and there is little reason for optimism about the future. The Congressional Budget Office estimates that economic growth over the next ten years will average only 2.1 percent if current tax and spending policies are maintained.<sup>79</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;America can do better. From the end of World War II until the end of the Reagan years, the economy's growth rate averaged well over 3 percent -- and that includes recession years.<sup>80</sup><p>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To get America growing again, tax policy will have to change. In the short term, immediate tax rate reductions are needed to boost growth; in the long term, the entire tax code should be replaced by a simple, flat tax. Unfortunately, these pro-growth changes will be harder to achieve if revenue estimators continue to use outdated and inaccurate static models. Dynamic revenue estimates, by contrast, would provide policymakers with more accurate information. Dynamic forecasting is based on a proper understanding of how the economy works, and history has shown this approach to be far more realistic.

 <p><li>   When estimating the effect of higher tax rates in 1993, the JCT examined several non-macroeconomic factors, such as "shifting from investments which yield interest and dividend income, taxed at the new higher rates, into investments that provide capital appreciation, which is taxed at unchanged lower rates. Also considered were shifts from taxable to tax-exempt assets, conversion to C corporation business form, conversion of wage income into tax-deferred compensation or tax-exempt fringe benefits, and increased noncompliance and avoidance." All these factors, however, only reduced the pure static revenue loss by 7 percent over the five-year period.

When Senator Packwood made a similar request in 1994, the committee responded by reporting the amount of after-tax income over $200,000 while noting that "If the 100-percent tax rate were to be in effect for a substantial period of time, so that taxpayers would have no rational hope of avoiding or evading the 100-percent tax in the outyears by deferring income to lower rate years or using other tax avoidance or deferral plans, then in our judgment there would be a substantial reduction in income-producing activity in the economy and, thus, a significant reduction in tax receipts to the Federal government."

May 14, 1996 <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Even assuming the Clinton Administration's forecast for this year is accurate, the United States economy's performance since 1989 will have been the worst seven-year period since the end of World War II. Adjusted for inflation, median household income has declined by 6.6 percent since Ronald Reagan left office.<sup>1</sup>  And while the unemployment rate is reasonably low, many Americans are worried about the future and fear their children will be the first generation to have a lower standard of living than its parents. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The economy's sub-par performance has triggered a debate on how best to stimulate economic growth and boost income. The good news is that all sides of the debate agree that the key to economic growth is capital formation -- increasing the levels of savings and investment (including investments in human capital). The bad news, however, is that there is a significant disagreement over the policy changes that will best meet that goal. On one side are those who argue that high tax rates dampen incentives and believe that correcting the anti-savings, anti-investment bias of the current income tax code will improve the economy's performance. The flat tax, they would argue, offers the best opportunity to generate a substantial and positive impact on job creation and income growth. The other side of the debate is dominated by those who believe the most important variable is the budget deficit. They argue that a lower budget deficit will lead to significant reductions in interest rates and that lower interest rates will spur higher levels of investment.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Finally, no discussion of economic growth would be complete without addressing the size of government. Regardless of whether it is financed through taxes or borrowing, government spending represents a transfer of resources from the private sector to the public sector. If government spends that money in a way that generates a sufficiently high rate of return, the economy will benefit. If the rate of return is below that of the private sector, however, then the rate of growth will be slower than it otherwise would have been.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Needless to say, the debate over growth has important policy implications. Should taxes be increased or decreased?  Should the budget be balanced and, if so, how quickly?  Is the deficit the real problem, or is it a symptom of an underlying problem of too much government?  What is the impact of tax reform?  What types of government spending count as investment?  If certain policies increase growth, should that higher growth be included in government economic and revenue estimates?
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Careful analysis of the historical and theoretical evidence yields three important conclusions that can help guide policymakers as they focus on the nation's economic problems:<ol>

	
<p><li>The tax system is taking too much money out of the productive sector of the economy. Perhaps even more important, the structure of the tax system is grossly flawed and imposes a particularly steep penalty on the very behaviors -- saving and investing -- that are needed to promote growth.

<p><li>Government borrowing is morally wrong because it imposes bills on future generations,<sup>2</sup> but the deficit should not drive economic policy. Contrary to what both political parties argue, there does not seem to be a strong relationship between the budget deficit and interest rates. Nor is there much reason to believe that lower interest rates, by themselves, will have a pronounced effect on investment. Moreover, focusing on the deficit can undermine sound economic policy by leading some to view higher taxes as an appropriate policy option.

<p><li>Government spending is too high. Many programs fail to generate an adequate rate of return (and many, such as welfare programs, almost certainly have a negative return and have made things worse). Not all government spending, needless to say, is dependent on "rates of return," but legislators should fully understand that funding programs with money that could be more productively used by the private sector will result in less economic growth. Finally, for those who do view the deficit as the key variable, there is ample evidence that slowing the growth of spending -- not higher taxes -- is the only way to achieve a balanced budget.
</ol>

<p>
<b>Why Capital Matters</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	As stated above, there is very little controversy about what causes growth. There is near-unanimous agreement that salaries and wages are linked closely to productivity. The only way to raise the income of workers permanently -- assuming no change in their skills -- is through savings and investment. Simply put, workers are paid on the basis of what they produce, and giving them better tools allows them to produce more. The level of capital formation, for instance, largely explains why workers in the United States, Germany, and Japan earn more than workers in Brazil, India, and Nigeria. Similarly, workers in America today earn more than their parents because of net investment (increases in the capital stock). As a result, they are more productive, generating more output per hour of labor.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Economists of all persuasions recognize this relationship between investment and wages. Paul Samuelson, for example, a Nobel Laureate economist who endorsed Bill Clinton for President, has written:<blockquote>

	What happens to the wage rate now that each person works with more capital goods?  Because each worker has more capital to work with, his or her marginal product rises. Therefore, the competitive real wage rises as workers become worth more to capitalists and meet with spirited bidding up of their market wage rates.<sup>3</sup>
</blockquote>
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Another example is taken from a 1991 report on economic growth prepared by the staff of the Joint Committee on Taxation, then controlled by the Democrats:
<blockquote>
	When an economy's rate of net investment (gross investment less depreciation)<sup>4</sup> increases, the economy's stock of capital increases. A larger capital stock permits a fixed amount of labor to produce more goods and services. The larger a country's capital stock, the more productive its workers and, generally, the higher its real wages and salaries. Thus, increases in investment tend to cause future increases in a nation's standard of living.<sup>5</sup>
</blockquote>
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; According to a 1989 report on economic growth published by the Congressional Research Service:
<blockquote>
	Capital deepening has been and will likely continue to be a central force for accelerating growth and potential output over the medium term. But as we have seen, a permanent increase in the long-term rate of growth will hinge on the United States' ability to increase the pace of technical advance and innovation. However, both of these routes to faster growth will be contingent upon the ability to increase the level of investment spending -- more spending for capital equipment and more spending for research and development. To finance higher investment will, in turn, require that Americans raise the national rate of savings.<sup>6</sup>
</blockquote>
	<p>&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Or consider the views of the White House. In the 1994 Economic Report of the President, the Administration noted that:
<blockquote>
	The reasons for wanting to raise the investment share of the GDP [gross domestic product] are straightforward: Workers are more productive when they are equipped with more and better capital, more productive workers earn higher real wages, and higher real wages are the mainspring of higher living standards. Few economic propositions are better supported than these -- or more important.
</blockquote>

<p>
<b>Competing Theories of Growth</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Every economic school of thought -- even Marxism -- agrees that capital formation is the key to rising living standards. This happy consensus, however, does not translate into agreement about how to spur more savings and investment. In the political economic debate, at least in America, there are basically three (actually two and one-half) views on how to promote economic growth. These are:<ul>

<p><li><b>Old-Fashioned Keynesianism.</b> This is the half-theory because it has so few adherents in America. In periods of economic sluggishness, Keynesians believe the government should increase spending, financed by borrowing, to give the economy a shot in the arm. This spending is supposed to stimulate aggregate demand, which causes private sector behavior to perk up. With a handful of exceptions, such as the failed 1993 stimulus bill, this approach does not receive much attention in Washington.

<p><li><b>1950s Republican/1990s Democrat Balanced Budget Orthodoxy.</b> The title is made up because this school of thought does not really have a name. Proponents of this approach, which is dominant in Washington, believe that the economy hinges on changes in the budget deficit. Contrary to old-fashioned Keynesianism, however, this orthodox approach argues that reducing the budget deficit is the key to economic growth. The theory works as follows: A lower budget deficit leads to lower interest rates, lower interest rates lead to more investment, more investment leads to higher productivity, and higher productivity means more growth. Although some of the proponents favor smaller government as a philosophical goal, the balanced budget crowd does not think taxes have a major effect on incentives to engage in productive behavior. As a result, they are skeptical of tax cuts and instead are willing to raise taxes.

<p><li><b>The Free Market.</b> Another made-up title because other options -- supply-side, conservative, classical liberal -- do not capture the central tenet, the free-market approach believes that the keys to economic growth, at least in terms of fiscal policy, are the size of government and the structure of the tax system. In short, the free-market approach believes that total spending, regardless of whether it is financed by taxes or borrowing, hinders the economy's performance by transferring scarce resources from those in the private sector who have incentives to use them wisely to politicians and bureaucrats who oftentimes respond to political incentives. Because the size of government matters, free market advocates would prefer a government with a $1 trillion budget and a $200 billion deficit to a government with a $2 trillion budget that was balanced. On the tax side of the ledger, free market supporters believe taxes affect incentives to work, save, and invest. A major goal of these folks, therefore, is radical tax reform designed to minimize tax rates and eliminate multiple taxation of capital. These reforms, it is believed, will boost capital formation, which will increase productivity, which means faster economic growth.
</ul><p>


<b>Who Is Right?</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The policy debate in Washington largely revolves between Options 2 and 3 (though there is also a fight amongst supporters of Option 2 over the size of government -- Should the budget be balanced at level "X" or level "X+Y?"). Stripping away much of the rhetoric, the victor in this struggle depends on which set of relationships is more robust:
<ol>
<p><li>Are balanced budget proponents right that interest rates will fall significantly once deficit spending comes to an end?  And are they correct in believing that investment is very sensitive to interest rates?

<p><li>Are free market supporters correct in believing that there is an inverse relationship between economic growth and the size of government?  Even more important, are they accurate in stating that decisions to work, save, and invest are significantly altered by the tax code?
</ul>
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; In some sense, both sides are right. Unless economists want to repeal the laws of supply and demand, there can be no doubt that lower budget deficits will lower interest rates. And, all other things being equal, lower interest rates should mean more investment. It is also unambiguously true that lower taxes will reduce the price of providing labor and capital to the economy. And it is certainly accurate to note that a large government, by reducing the cost of not working, will adversely affect the economy's performance. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The real question is the magnitude of these effects. Would balancing the budget really reduce interest rates by two percentage points?  Is the level of investment primarily driven by the interest rate?  Just how sensitive are decisions to work, save, and invest to the rate of taxation?  To what extent do government spending programs actually undermine work effort?
<p>

<b>Doubts Regarding Balanced Budget Orthodoxy</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There is ample reason to question the robustness of the interest rate argument. According to the theory, lower budget deficits should result in lower interest rates. Yet there is little evidence to suggest that interest rates are significantly affected by changes in the U.S. budget deficit. This does not mean that the laws of supply and demand have been repealed. It simply means that in world capital markets, a shift of $30 billion, $40 billion, or $50 billion is unlikely to have a dramatic effect and can easily be overwhelmed by other factors such as monetary policy and demand for credit. <sup>7</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Even if interest rates fall by a significant amount, the second link in the balanced budget chain of reasoning is very weak. Yes, interest rates must affect investment choices, but it appears that this variable is dwarfed by other influences.<sup>8</sup>  Why invest, for instance, if there is no hope of making a profit?  Real interest rates were negative during the 1930s in America, yet investment was moribund because investors did not see many opportunities to earn an adequate rate of return. Likewise, real interest rates were high in America during much of the 1980s, yet investment rose because people saw ways to make money. Moreover, since a large portion of investment is self-financed on the part of business, it is difficult to see how interest rates would have a dramatic impact.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	All things being equal, it is a good idea to balance the budget. And, yes, lower interest rates will promote investment. Balancing the budget, however, is not a silver bullet for the economy. This approach is especially short-sighted if it is used as a reason to raise taxes or block pro-growth tax cuts. As the following section illustrates, changes in tax policy can have a pronounced effect on the economy's performance.

<p>
<b>Why Free Market Supporters Are Right About Taxes and Capital Formation</b> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The attached appendices provide a sampling of empirical work on the impact of taxes. To put that work in context, however, it is useful to walk through an example illustrating just how heavy the tax burden is on savings and investment. Between personal income taxes, corporate income taxes, capital gains taxes, and estate taxes, a single dollar of investment income can be subject to as many as four layers of tax in America. Added to that burden are provisions of the law, such as depreciation and the alternative minimum tax, which force taxpayers to overstate their income. Adding insult to injury is the heavy compliance cost of the current system. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The following example illustrates why savings and investment suffer in the current tax climate. A taxpayer has $100 of income and must decide what to do with it. He can consume the $100, spending it on food, vacations, clothing, haircuts, or some other product or service, in which case (with the exception of possible sales taxes) he will receive close to $100 in goods and services for his money. Or he can invest in the stock of a start-up company with the potential to provide new jobs to the community and produce goods that consumers desire. If the company succeeds, the investor most likely will profit. If it fails, he will lose his $100.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In this case, the investment bears fruit and yields a 10 percent rate of return, enabling the company to produce $10 of annual income for every $100 invested. Under the current tax code, 35 percent is skimmed off to pay the corporate income tax, leaving only $6.50 out of the original $10. This $6.50 then goes to the investor as a dividend. But there are other taxes. Depending on the investor's income, the personal income tax will take as much as 39.6 percent of his $6.50, leaving him with less than $4.00 of annual income from a "successful" $100 investment. In addition, he may face applicable state and local income taxes.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Finally, if the investor ever decides to sell the stock, he will be hit by one of the highest capital gains taxes in the industrialized world. To make a bad situation even worse, he will be taxed on the nominal gains, often meaning that taxes are paid on assets that have lost value in real terms (and do not forget that the person who sold him the stock originally may have been subject to capital gains taxes on that sale). The final insult is the estate and gift tax. Successful entrepreneurs who try to accumulate an estate to pass on to their children are penalized by inheritance taxes which can confiscate 55 percent of a deceased's assets.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Thanks to the tax code, a fortunate investor -- one who actually earns money on his investments -- may have to send more than 80 percent of his earnings to the government, not to mention having already paid taxes on the money used for the investment in the first place. Thus, government tax policy has created a very tilted playing field. By punishing saving and investment, the tax code encourages both individuals and businesses to consume rather than to build for America's future.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Since taxes have such a dramatic impact on incentives to work, save, and invest, it should come as no surprise that major tax changes almost always have a significant impact on the economy. Herbert Hoover's decision in 1930 to increase the top tax rate from 25 percent to 63 percent certainly contributed to the Depression. Lyndon Johnson's surtax on income tax liabilities, enacted in 1968, together with an increase in the capital gains tax helped end the 1960s expansion. Large tax increases, including inflation-induced bracket creep, contributed to the economy's dismal performance under Jimmy Carter. George Bush's record tax increase in 1990 was a principal cause of the recent recession and subsequent anemic recovery. And the sub-par performance of today's economy, particularly the decline in median household income, almost certainly is attributable in part to the record tax increase pushed through Congress in 1993 by Bill Clinton.
<p>


<b>The Answer: The Flat Tax</b> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	Each of the tax code's many shortcomings can be addressed by targeted legislation, but a far better approach is simply to replace the existing system with a flat tax. There have been many flat tax proposals over the years, but they all share certain key features. These are:
<ul><p><li><b>One low tax rate.</b> All flat tax proposals have a single tax rate that applies to all income subject to tax. The actual rate imposed varies, but the upper limit would be about 20 percent. The Armey-Shelby flat tax legislation, for instance, begins with a 20 percent rate which phases down to 17 percent after a couple of years.

<p><li><b>Tax income only once.</b> Flat tax proposals are designed to eliminate the tax code's bias against capital formation by ending the double- (and sometimes triple- and quadruple-) taxation of income generated through savings and investment. The key principle is that the tax code not discriminate against income that is used for savings and investment as opposed to income that is consumed. 

<p><li><b>Elimination of deductions, credits, and exemptions.</b> All pure flat tax proposals eliminate provisions of the tax code that bestow preferential tax treatment on certain behaviors and activities. Included in this would be special tax breaks for businesses and corporations and, for individual taxpayers, the home mortgage interest deduction, the charitable contributions deduction, and the state and local mortgage interest deduction. Eliminating these "loopholes" solves the problem of complexity, allowing taxpayers to file their tax returns on a postcard-sized form.

<p>
</ul>
<b>Benefits of a Flat Tax</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	By addressing the many problems of the existing tax code in one fell swoop, the flat tax would have an immediate and dramatic positive impact. Included among the benefits are:
<ul>
<p><li><b>Faster economic growth.</b> A flat tax would spur increased work, saving, and investment. According to many economists, the rise in productive behavior would likely add one percentage point to the annual rate of economic growth. How significant is this?  An increase in the growth rate of just one-half of one percentage point would boost an average family of four's yearly income by more than $5,000 after ten years.

<p><li><b>Instant wealth creation.</b> Eliminating the second, third, and fourth layers of taxation on capital income would significantly boost the value of all income-producing assets. According to Professor Dale Jorgenson of Harvard University, enactment of a flat tax would immediately boost wealth by some $1 trillion.

<p><li><b>Simplicity.</b> The 600-plus tax forms of the current system would be swept into the trash and replaced by two simple postcard-sized forms. Wage, salary, and pension income would be reported on the individual form and business and capital income would be reported on the business form. Neither form would require more than a few minutes to complete, substantially reducing the 5.4 billion-hour yearly burden of today's tax code.

<p><li><b>Fairness. All taxpayers and all income would be treated equally.</b> A taxpayer with ten times the taxable income of his neighbor would pay ten times as much in taxes. Successful entrepreneurs no longer would be penalized by discriminatory tax rates, and no longer would the politically well-connected by able to benefit from special loopholes and preferences.

<p><li><b>An end to micromanagement and political favoritism.</b> All deductions, credits, exemptions, loopholes, and preferences would be eliminated under a flat tax. Politicians would lose their ability to pick winners and losers, reward friends and punish enemies, use the tax code to impose their values on the economy. Investment decisions would be guided by economic forces rather than tax considerations.

<p><li><b>Increased civil liberties.</b> The complexity of the tax code makes it nearly impossible for either taxpayers or IRS agents to follow the law. A greatly simplified tax code would eliminate virtually all of the conflicts and controversies that make the IRS one of the most feared agencies of the federal government.
</ul><p>

<b>The Spending Problem</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	While current tax policy represents a huge impediment to economic growth, policymakers also must focus on the size of government. To the extent that politicians and bureaucrats do not spend money as wisely or efficiently as it would be spent in the private sector, economic growth will lag as government increases in size. More specifically, many government programs do not generate benefits (or minimize costs) to the economy that  exceed those which would have occurred had the money remained in private hands. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The appropriate approach for policymakers is to determine whether spending for a given program will yield enough benefits to offset the loss of the money to the private sector (including the incentive and compliance costs of collecting taxes). A certain level of transportation spending, for instance, will facilitate economic growth by permitting the efficient flow of goods and services. Policymakers should debate, of course, whether the spending could be privatized or conducted at the state and local level. And to the extent they believe it has to be conducted by Washington, they should do their best to ensure that funding is allocated according to sound guidelines rather than pork-barrel politics. Other types of spending, such as crime prevention, also may help the economy by reducing the cost of crime.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In too many cases, however, there is strong reason to believe that the federal government is spending money in ways that do not produce good results for the economy. Some programs, such as welfare, reduce the cost of not working and inevitably undermine productive economic behavior. Other types of spending, such as the budgets for regulatory agencies, can have significantly negative rates of return because of the heavy costs they impose on the private sector. Unfortunately, policy makers usually do not subject government programs to this type of cost/benefit analysis.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Note that one important conclusion from using this approach is that the deficit is not the critical variable. The key is the size of government, not how it is financed. Taxes and deficits are both harmful, but the real problem is that government is taking money from the private sector and spending it in ways that often are counter-productive. As a result, fiscal policy should focus on reducing the level of government spending, with particular emphasis on those programs that yield the lowest benefits and/or impose the highest costs. The importance of reducing spending, it should be noted, exists regardless of whether the budget happens to be balanced and is not contingent on changes in the tax system (just as reforming the tax system and adopting other pro-growth tax changes should not be contingent on what happens to the spending side of the ledger).
<p>

<b>Conclusion</b> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

	There is no magic formula to boost growth. The economy can only grow if people work more or work better. Unfortunately, much of the world has adopted policies that impose increasingly steep tax penalties on those who add to the economy's wealth. Compounding the damage of these policies are spending programs that shield people from taking responsibility for their own lives. The combination has been an unmitigated failure. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This raises a particularly important issue for those on the left. They must decide what is more important: keeping a tax system that may satisfy an ideological impulse to punish success, or adopting a system that helps boost the living standards of the less fortunate. It is certainly true that modest reforms like reducing the tax rate on capital gains or big reforms like the flat tax will boost after-tax income of the rich. The empirical evidence, however, shows that other income classes will benefit as well -- and may benefit even more.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Critics of tax reform complain that it is nothing more than "trickle-down" economics that relies on tax cuts for the "rich" to boost wages. Such rhetoric may be useful politically, but it cannot change economic reality. Economist John Shoven has explained:<blockquote>

	The mechanism of raising real wages by stimulating investment is sometimes derisively referred to as "trickle-down" economics. But regardless of the label used, no one doubts that the primary mechanism for raising the return to work is providing each worker with better and more numerous tools. One can wonder about the length of time it takes for such a policy of increasing saving and investments to have a pronounced effect on wages, but I know of no one who doubts the correctness of the underlying mechanism. In fact, most economists would state the <I>only</I> way to increase real wages in the long run is through extra investments per worker.<sup>10</sup>
</blockquote> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	For a profession usually chided for its lack of agreement, economists are nearly unanimous in their recognition that capital formation is the key to economic growth. Policymakers seeking to boost living standards and take-home pay face two competing options for how best to achieve the goal of more savings and investment: Should they focus on the deficit or should they shrink the size of government and reform the tax system?  While these goals need not conflict, to the extent there is a division, there should be little doubt that a myopic fixation on the deficit will not necessarily produce the right policy results. Adopting a flat tax, by contrast, combined with long-overdue reductions in the level of government spending, will generate the desired outcome of a more prosperous economy.

<hr><p><b>APPENDIX 1:<br> Taxes Affect Decisions to Work</b></center> <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Joint research by economists from Princeton University and Brigham Young University, based on a random survey of physicians, found that a one percentage point increase in marginal tax rates is associated with a reduction of as much as 1.11 percent in hours worked.<sup>11</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A University of California economist found that because of the Tax Reform Act of 1986 (which lowered tax rates), the work effort of high-income married women rose by 0.8 percent for every one percent their after-tax wages increased.<sup>12</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Another economist found that "Husbands of retirement age, 60 and over, show substantial variation in hours of work, related systematically to wages and income in the expected way."  Moreover, "Wives in all age groups are quite sensitive to wages and income."<sup>13</sup>  In other words, as after-tax income falls, so does the incentive to work.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Two other economists estimated that "wives' labor supply will increase by 3.8 percent" in response to a reduction in the marriage penalty.<sup>14</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A comprehensive study in <I>The Journal of Human Resources</I> found that taxes reduce married males' hours of work by 2.6 percent and married females' by between 10 percent and 30 percent.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	According to a statistical study in <I>Econometrica</I>, yearly hours of work for white married women increase by 2.3 percent for every one percent increase in after-tax earnings.<sup>16</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	While husbands are not as sensitive to taxes as wives, the impact of taxes on their behavior is nonetheless dramatic. One study found that they work eight percent less than they would in the absence of taxes.<sup>17</sup>  This indicates a loss in economic output of at least $1,000 per person.<sup>18</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	All studies acknowledge that higher after-tax incomes increase incentives to work by increasing the "price" of leisure, but some assume this effect is offset because lower taxes allow workers to achieve a certain level of income by working fewer hours. While this trade-off is relevant when looking at individual choices, two economists note that "the generalization of the individual analysis to the economy as a whole is invalid" because "It will be impossible for all individuals to consume both more goods and more leisure as the individual work-leisure analysis implies."<sup>19</sup>  The actual economy-wide response to changes in tax rates will be higher than almost all studies indicate.<sup>20</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	One econometric model found that a one percent reduction in tax rates increased work effort for lower-income workers by 0.1 percent, for middle and upper-middle-income workers by 0.25 percent, and for upper-income workers by more than 2.0 percent.<sup>21</sup>

<p>
<center><b>APPENDIX 2:<br> Taxes Reduce Savings and Investment</b><p>
</center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
In a book on taxes and capital formation, Norman B. Ture and B. Kenneth Sanden noted, "The bias against saving in the present tax system results from the fact that, with few exceptions, taxes are imposed both on the amount of current saving and on the future returns to such saving, whereas the tax falls only once on income used for consumption."<sup>22</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Economist John Shoven estimates that a reduction of 20 percent in the top rate for capital gains would cause the stock market to rise by 3 percent.<sup>23</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Undersecretary of the Treasury Lawrence H. Summers has written that "increases in the real after-tax rate of return received by savers would lead to substantial increases in long-run capital accumulation."  Further, "bequests may account for a large fraction of national capital formation," which strengthens the argument that taxes influence savings.<sup>24</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A study in <I>The American Political Science Review</I> noted that "Nations... where the extractive [tax] capacity of government did not significantly increase, relative to the economic product, have, in a sense, opted for... an increasing rate of private capital accumulation."<sup>25</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Analyzing the decline in savings, a study by three experts concluded that Social Security and other transfer programs have led to a "decline in U.S. saving."<sup>26</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Two other economists also concluded that Social Security reduces savings because workers no longer worry as much about retirement.<sup>27</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Econometric results, according to a study published in the <I>Journal of Public Economics</I>, "suggest that dividend taxes have important effects on investment decisions" and that "an increase of 10 percent in the stock market would raise the investment rate by about 15 percent."<sup>28</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Writing in the <I>National Tax Journal</I>, three economists found "significant effects for the after-tax return on saving, after-tax cost of borrowing, or both."  The Reagan tax cuts "had a major impact on U.S. economic growth."<sup>29</sup>


<p>
<center><b>APPENDIX 3:<br> Growth Is Weaker When Government Penalizes Economic Behavior</b>
</center><p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
A 1983 World Bank study of 20 countries found that low-tax nations experience faster growth, generate more investment, and enjoy more rapid increases in productivity and standards of living than high-tax nations.<sup>30</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The tax system imposes between 22 cents and 54 cents of losses for every dollar raised, according to a labor-supply economist. For working wives, the losses are even higher: more than 58 cents for very dollar of tax revenue.<sup>31</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Another study found that each 1.0 percent increase in the federal tax burden reduces economic growth by 1.8 percent and lowers national employment by 1.14 percent.<sup>32</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	According to a statistical study published in the <I>American Economic Review</I>, for every dollar paid to the federal government in taxes, 33.2 cents is lost to the economy.<sup>33</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The increased tax burden between 1965 and 1980 drove an estimated 1.9 million people out of the U.S. labor force.<sup>34</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Statistical research published in <I>Lloyd's Bank Review</I> has found that in the U.K. each one percent rise in payroll taxes causes hiring to fall by approximately 1.4 percent. The same study estimated that each $1 of additional tax revenue costs $3 in lost economic output.<sup>35</sup> 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A study printed in the <I>American Sociological Review</I> concluded that "Increases of one percent in the tax burden relative to household income are directly associated with a 2.8 percent decline in economic growth over three years, or just under one percent annually."<sup>36</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	An <I>American Economic Review</I> study found that every dollar of taxes could impose as much as $4 of lost output on the economy, with the probable harm ranging between $1.32 and $1.47.<sup>37</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A 1981 analysis of the Swedish economy in the <I>Journal of Political Economy</I> found "The estimated long-run effects [of high marginal tax rates] are sufficient to explain up to 75 percent of the recent decline in the measured growth of the Swedish GNP."<sup>38</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	According to a former Treasury Department official, between 75 percent and 80 percent of the additional wealth generated by increased savings and investment goes to workers.<sup>39</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Another study in the <I>Journal of Political Economy</I> estimated that the corporate income tax costs more in lost output than it raises for the government. The "excess burden" is "123 percent of revenue."<sup>40</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A 1984 study in the <I>American Economic Review</I> estimated "20.7 cents of welfare loss per additional dollar of tax revenue."<sup>41</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A study of U.S. taxes at the state level found that low-tax states grew 35 percent faster than high-tax states between 1970 and 1980.<sup>42</sup>  The relationship between growth and taxes among the states has been shown in literally dozens of studies.<sup>43</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Another economist was able to illustrate a very strong inverse relation between average per capita growth rates and average tax rates on income and profits in developed countries.<sup>44</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	According to an article in the <I>Journal of Political Economy</I>, based on worldwide data, increasing the tax burden by ten percentage points will reduce annual growth by two percentage points.<sup>45</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	In a paper presented at the World Bank, two economists uncovered an "impressive negative relation between the rate of growth and the ratio of tax revenue to GDP" as well as a "negative association between growth and... the 'marginal' income tax rate."<sup>46</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Of the explosive growth of Hong Kong, Taiwan, Singapore, and South Korea, Hoover economist Alvin Rabushka has written that 
<blockquote>
	The four Asian tigers adopted supply-side tax policies decades before the Reagan and Thatcher revolutions. Finance ministers oversaw systems of taxation that featured low rates and/or low levels of direct taxation of individuals and businesses, the absence of or very light charges on capital income (interest, dividends, capital gains), and a smorgasbord of inducements for domestic and foreign enterprises to invest and reinvest in each economy.<sup>47</sup>
</blockquote>
	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Other studies have found that the economy is harmed when government spends tax revenue:
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	A National Bureau of Economic Research study, using worldwide data, found that an increase "in government spending and taxation of 10 percentage points was predicted to decrease long-term growth rates by 1.4 percentage points."<sup>48</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	According to Daniel Landau, "The results of this study [published in the <I>Southern Economic Journal</I>] suggest a negative relationship exists between the share of government consumption expenditure in GDP and the rate of growth of per capita GDP."<sup>49</sup>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Two economists found that increases in U.S. government outlays for social programs "are associated with reductions in the growth rate."<sup>50</sup>

<P>


      As this audience knows only too well, growing concerns about
health care costs and poor access have stimulated the development of
multiple health care reform proposals.  Proposals from members of the
House and Senate, medical specialty societies, public interest groups,
and organizations such as The Heritage Foundation, to name a few
sources, are piling up on the public policy table at a rapid clip.
Yet when all of these proposals are distilled, three models stand out:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>     
 "Single-payer," in which the government runs the health care
      system in one way or another;
<P>
      "Play-or-pay," which mandates employer financial contributions
      to expand access; and
<P>
      "Consumer choice," which involves the use of tax credits or
      vouchers to give consumers a direct financial incentive to
      behave as responsible buyers of health care -- or in other
      words, to put market incentives into the health care system.
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
      I support the version of the Consumer Choice approach which is
being actively considered in Maryland as a statewide demonstration.  I
believe it can work in Maryland, and I believe it offers a model for
the nation as well, because unlike the other approaches, it achieves
four critical health care reform goals:
<P>
First, it provides universal and continuous access for all to standard
      insurance benefits without regard to employment or health
      status;
<P>
Second, it moderates costs by using competition to pressure insurers
      and health care providers to operate efficiently, and to put
      more purchasing power in the hands of consumers;
<P>
Third, it is budget neutral and uses an equitable financing
      methodology; and
<P>
Fourth, it preserves what is good about our system  -- a system that
      fosters competition and innovation, encourages the development
      of technology, and allows Americans to keep what they value so
      highly, the right to choose doctors they trust, without long
      waits for care.
<P>
      All four goals must be achieved if we are to see true reform in
this country.  The piecemeal solutions of the past simply have not
worked.  In fact, they have exacerbated our problems.
<P>
      I contend that neither the single-payer  nor the play-or-pay
approach offers viable solutions for fundamental reform.  The single-
payer model forces cost control through global budgeting by price
regulation and capping the volume of services.  As in every other
country where this has been tried, the inevitable result is rationing
and waiting lines.
<P>
      I also believe that this model will discourage innovation in the
development of new medicines and technologies.  Furthermore, consumer
research repeatedly shows that while most Americans want reform, they
do not want a system run by the government.
<P>
      The play-or-pay approach leaves one-third of the uninsured
population uncovered, including many unemployed and part-time workers. 
This model also puts an enormous financial burden on employers,
without offering them any hope of reducing their health care benefit
expenses and becoming more competitive.
<P>
      Finally, both approaches would require a substantial infusion of
funds into a system that already costs too much, at a time when the
country is staggering under the weight of our deficit.  Neither
approach would encourage competition or put market forces to work to
moderate cost increases.
<P>
      It probably goes without saying, that one of the reasons that
health care costs are consistently higher than the Consumer Price
Index is that the end users of the health care services, consumers,
and those who order health care services, health care providers, have
been shielded from the economic consequences of their choices by
insurance.
<P>
      Imagine what would happen if everyone in this country, for the
price of an annual premium, had a food card that provided access to
any grocery store and covered costs, with a deductible or co-payment,
of whatever food products the store manager recommended.  The lack of
marketplace incentives surely would result in a steady escalation of
food prices.
<P>
      Ten Points.  Simply put, we need marketplace incentives in the
health care system that put the consumer in the driver's seat.  The
Consumer Choice Health Plan being debated in Maryland does that.  In
this model:
<P>
1)    All Marylanders, including those currently served by Medicaid,
      and excluding only those already covered by Medicare, would
      purchase a comprehensive standard insurance program from a
      qualified carrier.  Purchase of supplemental insurance would be
      optional.
<P>
2)    Consumers would purchase the standard insurance from their
      employers or shop on the open market.  Those who are unemployed
      could obtain insurance from designated public agencies or
      brokers.
<P>
3)    The standard insurance would be similar to comprehensive
      programs available on the market today and would include
      preventive as well as acute care benefits.
<P>
4)    Issuance of the standard insurance would be guaranteed and
      renewable without regard to health status or claims experience. 
      In other words, no more exclusions on pre-existing conditions,
      and no more loss of insurance when you change jobs.
<P>
5)    All Marylanders, not just those at lower income levels, would
      receive a refundable tax credit or voucher to use toward the
      purchase of the standard insurance.
<P>
6)    The tax credit would be progressive and the amount would be
      geared to pay 100 percent of the estimated cost of the standard
      plan for those below the poverty level, and scaled down to where
      it would provide 50 percent of the cost of the standard plan for
      families with incomes over $100,000 (See Table 1).
<P>
7)    The tax deduction for health care benefits received by
      individuals would be eliminated.  Today, high income individuals
      benefit from a hidden tax subsidy because they do not pay taxes
      on the value of health care benefits paid by their employers. 
      The value of this subsidy is $65 billion nationally and $1
      billion in Maryland.
<P>
          It is important to note that in the Maryland Plan, the
      value of the progressive tax credit is calculated to offset
      taxes in a way that families earning less than $50,000 will
      break even or gain financially from this proposal, assuming the
      employer does not contribute anything to the Plan.  If the
      employer holds the employee harmless, which I believe most will
      do, even those earning $100,000 or more will break even (See
      Tables 2 and 3).
<P>
8)    Consumer protection would be built in.  In order to do business
      in the state, carriers would have to be qualified.  To be
      qualified they would have to offer the standard insurance, meet
      certain financial criteria including caps on administrative
      expenses, and be proficient in managing the cost and quality of
      care.
<P>
9)    The workplace would remain the focus for purchasing health care
      benefits for most consumers.  All employers would offer a
      standard and a supplemental insurance program to their
      employees, but financial contribution to the plan would be
      optional, just as it is today.
<P>
10)   Employers would all pay a 4 percent payroll tax as their only
      mandatory contribution to health care benefits.  This is
      significantly less than the 8 percent to 10 percent of payroll
      they are paying today.  For those employers who are not
      contributing today, it would provide an affordable way for them
      to participate.
<P>
      Let's look at how this would work in an employment setting. 
First, an employer would arrange through a qualified carrier or broker
to offer a standard and supplemental plan at group rates to its
employees, and decide the level of its financial contribution.  We
estimate that employer savings will be between $500 and $1,000 per
employee, depending on the level of health care benefits currently
provided (See Table 4).
<P>
      An employer who wanted to maintain the same benefits program
that was in place before consumer choice would already be financially
ahead of the game, because the cost to the employer to fund the
identical program will be reduced by the amount of employee tax
credits now available to defray the cost.
<P>
      Employer savings could be passed on to employees as increased
wages, invested, or retained as earnings or profit.
<P>
      Employees, knowing the value of their tax credit and how much
the employer would pay (in other words, how much they have to spend),
would decide whether to purchase the standard benefit from the
employer or search for a better deal on the open market, as well as
whether to purchase any supplemental benefits.
<P>
      Value-Conscious Consumers.  Comparison shopping would be greatly
simplified because the standard insurance benefit would be just that
-- standard.  When consumers know how much money they have to spend
and can truly comparison shop, they will be far more value-conscious. 
Insurers will be forced to offer insurance products at or below the
target price associated with the full value of the tax credit to stay
in business.   (Just as an aside, I can tell you from our experience
at Blue Cross and Blue Shield with consumers who purchase insurance
directly, that they are very value-conscious and they put enormous
pressure on us to deliver good insurance values.)
<P>
      Under the competitive pressure generated by the Consumer Choice
Health Plan, qualified carriers will in turn contract with health care
providers in organized delivery systems that can demonstrate the
ability to deliver quality care in an efficient and cost-conscious
manner.  This is managed care in action.  Obviously, selective
provider contracting is happening today, but it will intensify and
become much more sophisticated.
<P>
      Consumer demand for value also will put enormous pressure on the
entire system -- health care providers and insurers alike -- to find
ways to eliminate waste in the system.  The Consumer Choice Health
Plan also assumes the adoption of a uniform bill and installation of
electronic networks throughout the state to eliminate the cost and
burden of today's paperbound processes.  The Plan also assumes that
there will be caps on administrative expenditures.
<P>
      Sources of Funds.  One of the cornerstones of the Consumer
Choice Health Plan is its funding mechanism.  There is enough money in
the system today to expand basic insurance to all and to fund the tax
credit.  The funds just haven't been allocated equitably.  The five
principal sources of funds are as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE> Individual income taxes associated with the elimination of the
      tax exclusion for health care benefits as well as the deduction
      for out-of-pocket medical expenses.
<P>
      A 4 percent employer payroll tax.  As I said before, employers
      who contribute to health care benefits today pay between 8
      percent and 10 percent of the payroll.
<P>
      Increased corporate tax revenues on any increased profits earned
      to the extent that employee tax credits reduce the level of
      employer expenses for health care benefits.
<P>
      Federal and state public funds currently spent for the acute
      care part of Medicaid and other public health programs.
<P>
      Uncompensated care dollars no longer needed to cover hospital
      bad debt.</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
      It all adds up to a program which is budget neutral (See Table
5).  It can be done.  The math works for Maryland and it works for the
nation.
<P>
      Can the Consumer Choice Health Plan be successful?  Yes, I
believe it can.  The current Federal Employees Health Benefits Program
is structured somewhat like the Consumer Choice Health Plan, in that
it offers a specified amount of financial contribution which is known
to federal employees together with wide choice of plans.
<P>
      I believe that the success of the FEHBP program in moderating
costs can be attributed in large part to the design which gives
consumers a clear role in making their purchase decisions.
<P>
      As you can see, this proposal varies in significant ways from
that proposed by President Bush and somewhat from that proposed by The
Heritage Foundation.  The Bush proposal provides a tax credit for
individuals at the lower income scale, but offers no explicit funding
mechanism.  It also continues the tax deduction for employer-based
insurance, which insulates consumers from the market.
<P>
      Employer Participation. The Heritage proposal goes much further,
by repealing the tax deduction for health care benefits, and imposing
an individual mandate, as well as expanding the tax credit to a wider
income band.  However, the Maryland Plan relies much more heavily on
employers to participate through the requirement that all employers
offer insurance as well as help finance the tax credit through the 4
percent payroll tax.
<P>
      In conclusion, I believe that the strength of the Maryland
Consumer Choice Health Plan is that it achieves all four reform goals
in an integrated way.  It provides universal access to a standard
benefit which eliminates the need for a separate public program for
acute care Medicaid.
<P>
      The Consumer Health Plan brings competitive pressures into the
system to control costs.  It reallocates funding equitably so that it
is budget neutral.  And it preserves what is good about our system.
<P>
      Solid and Equitable. Obviously there are aspects of this
proposal that are controversial and details that are subject to
further discussion.  But I believe that the principles inherent in the
Plan are solid and equitable.  The truth is that fundamental reform
requires everyone to give a little to make it work.
<P>
      If the problems of the system are looked at from an integrated
rather than a piecemeal perspective, I think we will have a real shot
at success.
<P>
      At this point, Delegate Casper Taylor and others are working
hard in Maryland to implement the Consumer Choice Health Plan as a
statewide demonstration.  We strongly believe that experimentation at
the statewide level is the way to go because of the dramatic changes
that potentially could occur with a significant part of the national
economy under a permanent change of such scope.
<P>
      It is important to note that when other countries moved to a
form of national health system, health care spending was approximately
3 percent to 4 percent of the GNP.  Ours is now in excess of 12
percent.  We cannot afford to make errors that would dramatically
affect our economy in a negative way.
<P>
      Let me end by quoting Franklin Delano Roosevelt, who said:  "The
test of our progress is not whether we add more to the abundance of
those who have too much; it is whether we provide enough for those who
have too little."  Consumer Choice does just that in the health care
arena.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress has kept its promise to the American people that it would begin to cut regulatory red tape and return common sense to regulation. It has reduced the size and cost of government and increased the health and well-being of all Americans. But alarmists have done a good job of convincing the American people that exactly the opposite has been true, seizing the moral high ground with rhetoric designed to convince the public that a reformed regulatory system would have disastrous consequences. Nevertheless, this Congress can point to a record of solid reforms and progress toward a more flexible and less burdensome regulatory system that will cost less and achieve the same or higher levels of public health, safety, and environmental protection.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
What is the reality?  Legislation passed by the 104th Congress and signed into law:
<p>
<ul> 
<li> Repealed the federally mandated 55-mph speed limit that had been on the books since 1974.
<p>
<li> Deregulated two major industries: agriculture and telecommunications. Farmers will now be able to grow what their customers want, not what bureaucrats demand.
<p>
<li> Stemmed the tide of costly new unfunded mandates on states and localities.
<p>
<li> Moved away from "one-size-fits-all" regulations by making it easier for the needs of small businesses to be taken into consideration.
<p>
<li> Established clear goals for agencies to reduce the paperwork burden, which will save Americans as much as 70 million hours of their time (valued at more than $1 billion) this year to use for more productive activities.
<p>
<li> Made itself directly accountable to the public by giving itself the authority to review and stop burdensome, unjustified new regulations developed by federal regulators.
<p>
<li> Forced a review by the Clinton Administration of all existing and proposed federal regulations.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In addition, Congress:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Passed and sent to the President the Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act, which would have required federal regulators to follow a set of rational principles in deciding whether and how to regulate. These include the use of cost-benefit analysis, sound science, and risk assessment, as well as market-based alternatives and performance standards. President Clinton vetoed this bill.
<p>
<li> Passed and sent to the President with bipartisan support the Common Sense Liability Reform Act which would have curbed abuses of the legal system by relieving the crushing burden of frivolous and unfounded cases brought against state and local governments, charitable organizations, and America's product manufacturers. President Clinton vetoed this bill.
<p>
<li> Passed legislation to reduce the existing burdens of the Safe Drinking Water Act, one the largest unfunded environmental mandates. Signed by President Clinton on August 6, 1996, the legislation will give states and localities the flexibility to target their resources more effectively to achieve greater levels of protection.
<p>
<li> Started an important national debate about how to resurrect commonsense regulation. This Congress, for example, introduced proposals to restructure the Superfund program in ways that would encourage faster cleanups, eliminate most of the need for lawyers and the courts, and reduce federal spending while improving public health, safety, and the environment. Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration so far has blocked reform, choosing to leave in place a program in which one-third of the money will continue to go to lawyers and transaction costs while failing to clean up many of the most hazardous waste sites.
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Taken together, in just 18 months this Congress has accomplished and initiated the most significant changes in more than 20 years, and has changed the terms of the debate in a way that will affect the shape of federal regulation for decades.

<p>
<b>THE BOLDEST AGENDA IN 20 YEARS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Alarmists did a good job in this first round, convincing the American public that regulatory reform was just another term for the rollback of important public health, safety, and environmental protections. As a result, Congress has not yet seen many of its most ambitious efforts to reform the Superfund program, the Endangered Species Act, the Clean Water and Clean Air Acts, the Food and Drug Administration, or the Occupational Safety and Health Administration signed into law. Many in Congress believe they lost the battle to reduce the burden of regulation and cut away the approximately $700 billion in red tape<sup>2</sup> that strangles American businesses and consumers.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Nothing, however, could be further from the truth. In less than two years, the 104th Congress accomplished unprecedented and far-reaching reforms that impose discipline on the federal regulatory decisionmaking process, deregulate the agriculture and telecommunications industries, and fundamentally change the way the federal government and the American people think about public health, safety, and environmental regulation.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>Surpassing Reagan.</b> The regulatory agenda of the 104th Congress is the boldest of the past 20 years. The successful enactment of legislation to deregulate the agriculture and telecommunications industries is comparable to the transportation deregulation successes of the late 1970s.<sup>3</sup>  Although the Reagan Administration had bold intentions to reverse the growth of economic and social regulation, the completed action fell short. Other than modest steps to deregulate the energy and communications industries and a new administrative review process that enjoyed some success in reducing the rate and cost of new rules, for example, the Reagan Administration could not follow through with new versions of the Clean Air Act, the Clean Water Act, and Superfund, or with FDA or OSHA reform.<sup>4</sup>  Thus, the 104th Congress stands alone in the scope and scale of its reform efforts. Until now, the deregulatory accomplishments of the last 20 years focused on freeing industries to rely on market forces. But the 104th Congress also has taken on for the first time the rapid expansion of major health, safety, and environmental programs which have increased steadily since the 1970s. The costs of these "social" regulations, particularly environmental regulation, has almost tripled over the last 20 years from about $80 billion in 1977 to more than $220 billion in 1995.<sup>5</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress needed to take such bold action because the problems have never been worse. For example:
<p>
<ul>
<li> According to <a href="/atr/1.html">Americans for Tax Reform</a>, the total cost of government has been estimated at $3.38 trillion, nearly $1 trillion of which results from federal and state regulation. The federal government is responsible for imposing more than $700 billion in regulatory costs each year: more than $2,800 for every man, woman, and child in America. Of the 366 days in 1996, the average American will work 184.6 days for the government. More than 40 of these days will be just to pay for the cost of federal regulations.<sup>6</sup>
<p>
<li> As the number of regulations has grown, so has the number of federal regulators enforcing these rules. The number of permanent, full-time regulatory staff has increased from 69,946 in 1970 to 128,566 in 1994.<sup>7</sup>
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
 And more is not always better. A seminal new study from Harvard University reveals that roughly 60,000 lives are lost every year because of the current command-and-control regulatory system, which squanders billions of dollars on efforts to eliminate risks that are negligible or nonexistent while failing to protect the public from others that are much more serious.<sup>8</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress has fought to bring common sense back to the way federal agencies make decisions about whether and how to regulate to improve the environment and public health and safety. Today, federal regulators are no longer giving Americans the highest levels of protection for the billions of dollars they take from taxpayers, consumers, and businesses. By making sure that regulators follow rational principles that tell them to evaluate risks sensibly and consistently, consider the costs and benefits of their actions, and use market-based solutions, policymakers can do an even better job of protecting the environment and public health and safety while spending less and with fewer rules.
<p>
<b>COMMONSENSE REGULATORY REFORMS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In just 18 months, the 104th Congress has put in place a number of important reforms that will provide significant benefits to the economy and the well-being of all Americans.
<p>
<b>The Telecommunications Act of 1996</b><br>
The 104th Congress succeeded in passing the Telecommunications Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-104), signed into law by President Clinton on February 8, 1996. This is the most important industry-wide deregulatory initiative undertaken by Congress in over a decade. The Act removes unnecessary layers of federal rules governing telephone, cable, and broadcasting competition.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Act eventually will eliminate restrictions that prohibit competition between local and long-distance companies, as well as cable companies, so that they can offer consumers a full range of communications and entertainment services.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One 1993 study estimated that complete deregulation would help create 3.6 million more jobs by 2003 and pass along savings of roughly $63 billion a year to consumers.<sup>9</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Although the Telecommunications Act does not go quite as far as the more rapid, comprehensive deregulation this study envisioned, comparable gains can still be expected over time as a result of the bill.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Deregulation also will mean the end of the Cable Act of 1992, numerous restrictions on beneficial merger and alliance activity, and many other needless Federal Communications Commission activities.
<p>

<b>The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform Act of 1996</b><br>
The Federal Agriculture Improvement and Reform (FAIR) Act of 1996 (P.L. 104-127) eliminates federal programs that manipulate production and prices of major crops (wheat, feed grains, cotton, and rice) through production subsidies and acreage reduction. This legislation will mean greater freedom and enormous opportunities for rural America. By dismantling much of the restrictive straitjacket on farmers, the new law will free the U.S. economy -- farmers and related businesses -- to take full advantage of the growing global market, which should mean huge economic benefits for Americans. According to an analysis by The Heritage Foundation,<sup>10</sup> the new law will mean that:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Farmers will earn an additional $16 billion in net income between 1996 and 2002.
<p>
<li> Suppliers of the inputs used in agricultural production will sell an additional $14.6 billion in products during the same period.
<p>
<li> Taken together, the agriculture community will enjoy a rise of $30.6 billion in income.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In addition, the Act establishes an Environmental Quality Improvement Program to provide funds for a cooperative effort with farmers to protect wetlands, using a flexible, incentive-oriented approach while increasing wetland acreage under the conservation program. 
<p>
<b>The Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995</b><br>
In response to the increasingly hostile reaction of states and localities to unchecked and costly federal mandates, Congress in March 1995 enacted the Unfunded Mandates Reform Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-4). The Act requires Congress to take into consideration the cost to states, localities, and Indian tribes of new mandates. Federal agencies must assess the impact of new regulations both on state, local, and tribal governments and on the private sector; and the U.S. Advisory Commission on Intergovernmental Relations is tasked with a review of existing mandates.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
One year later, states already feel the relief from new unfunded mandates.<sup>11</sup>  Thanks to this legislation, the Congressional Budget Office (CBO) is tasked with estimating the costs of these new legislative mandates. Now many Members of Congress can find out the costs of proposed mandates and reduce the cost to the states.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Some examples of how these additional consultations and deliberations have resulted in important policy changes that saved hundreds of millions dollars:
<blockquote><p>
<b>Immigration.</b> The benefits of CBO's input were evident in the development of the immigration bill. Originally, the Senate bill required that all drivers' licenses without valid Social Security numbers would be invalid immediately upon the date of enactment of the law. CBO estimated that this would cost from $80 million-$200 million for states that would have to purchase new equipment and make other necessary changes to handle the volume of people who suddenly would need to have new licenses issued. <sup>12</sup> This provision was changed in the final legislation to allow for a six-year phase-in period during which states could renew licenses when they normally would come up for renewal. This dropped the costs to states to around $20 million.
<p>
<b>Agriculture.</b> The House version of the farm bill contained provisions that would require milk sold for fluid uses to contain greater amounts of nonfat solids than currently required and lock in higher fluid milk prices under the archaic Milk Marketing Order System. CBO estimated the direct costs of this provision to dairy processors and manufacturers at somewhere between $800 million and $1 billion annually. The final farm bill did not contain a national higher fluid milk standard, and CBO's estimates were used to help make the case for its elimination.<sup>13</sup>
<p>
<b>Health Care.</b> The Kennedy-Kassebaum health care reform bill initially included a provision that would have required insurers to provide the same benefits for mental health coverage as for other illnesses, and the case for dropping this unjustified mandate was greatly facilitated by CBO estimates of the cost. The CBO noted that imposing this mandated benefit on private health insurance would have huge public and private sector costs. It projected that the Senate mandate would impose $423 million in additional costs on the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) between 1996 and 2002, rising to $739 million by 2005. If it was applied to Medicare and Medicaid, program outlays would increase by almost $80 billion for Medicare between 1997 and 2000, and by another $35 billion for Medicaid during the same period. CBO also estimated that the premiums for traditional fee-for-service plans would increase by 5.3 percent, while managed care plans would see an increase of 4 percent.<sup>14</sup>  The costly provision was taken out of the bill.
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In addition:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The National Highway System Designation Act (P.L. 104-59)</b> ended a burdensome, costly unfunded mandate requiring states to satisfy a minimum tonnage utilization requirement for asphalt pavement containing recycled rubber on federal-aid projects. According to the CBO, the Federal Highway Administration estimates that states would save up to $1 billion annually in paving costs by not having to comply with the crumb rubber requirements.<sup>15</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>Amendments to the 1990 Clean Air Act employee commute option (ECO) program (P.L. 104-70)</b> make the program optional for states if they can undertake alternative methods that will achieve equivalent emissions reductions. While the EPA had estimated the cost of the ECO program at $1.2 billion to $1.4 billion annually,<sup>16</sup> it also called the impact of the program "minuscule" because it proved to be relatively ineffective at achieving emission reductions.<sup>17</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Land Disposal Program Flexibility Act (P.L. 104-119)</b> exempts waste determined to be non-hazardous under the Clean Water Act or Safe Drinking Water Act from regulation under the Solid Waste Disposal Act, since chemical compounds safe enough to drink presumably are safe enough to bury. Municipal solid waste landfills likewise are exempt from ground water monitoring requirements if they are small (waste disposals of less than 20 tons daily).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>Repeal of the federal speed limit.</b> As part of the National Highway system bill that President Clinton signed on November 28, 1995, the federally mandated 55-mph speed limit was repealed unconditionally. Beginning on December 8, 1995, states were able to begin freely adjusting speed limits within their boundaries. Several states immediately took action to raise their limits in response to the bill.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

<b>Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996</b> Small businesses are the engine of economic growth in this country. For small business owners, Washington looms as "public enemy number one." Small businesses want to get government off their backs so they can do what they do best -- create jobs and generate tax revenue -- without the excessive burden of reporting and regulatory compliance.<sup>18</sup>  Regulation also does not affect all businesses equally. "One-size-fits-all" regulations impose the heaviest burden on small and medium-sized businesses because they find it harder to spread the high overhead costs of paperwork, attorney and accountant fees, and staff time needed to negotiate the federal regulatory maze.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In response to the concerns of small business, Congress passed the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act (SBREFA) of 1996 (P.L. 104-121), which was signed by the President on March 29, 1996. This legislation:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Authorizes judicial enforcement of the Regulatory Flexibility Act of 1980, which requires agencies to provide information on the impact of their regulations on small businesses and other entities;
<p>
<li> Allows small business to recoup expenses and legal fees incurred when agencies make excessive demands for penalties that cannot be sustained in court;
<p>
<li> Provides for an independent ombudsman to receive confidential complaints from small businesses about their dealings with federal regulators; and
<p>
<li> Requires federal agencies to prepare "Plain English" compliance guides spelling out in easy-to-follow language how small businesses can comply with federal regulations.
</ul><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress deserves credit for this modest reform in the face of the Clinton Administration's overwhelming opposition to more fundamental reforms that small businesses desperately need. For example, President Clinton vetoed a number of important regulatory, tax, and legal reforms proposed by the 104th Congress that were important priorities not just for small businesses, but for all businesses so they can promote economic growth and create more jobs. These included environmental and workplace reform, secure property rights, a reform of outdated labor laws, repeal of Davis-Bacon, capital gains tax reduction, estate tax reform, tax equity in health care reform, pension reform, and tort reform.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995</b> More than one-third of the costs of regulation -- about $200 billion -- in 1995 was due to paperwork.<sup>19</sup>  Thus, even a modest reduction in the total paperwork burden imposed on the public can save Americans thousands of hours of time and hundreds of millions, if not billions, of dollars in lost productivity. Most Americans fill out some kind of paperwork, such as federal tax forms or forms to obtain some type of government benefit. Businesses also must maintain a myriad of records to demonstrate compliance with environment, workplace, and other rules.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Intent on easing the burden imposed by the federal government on individuals and businesses, the 104th Congress voted overwhelmingly to pass the Paperwork Reduction Act of 1995 (P.L. 104-13), and President Clinton signed it into law on May 22, 1995. The Act further amended and recodified the original Paperwork Reduction Act of 1980. The new law sets a government-wide paperwork reduction goal of 10 percent in each of the first two years after its enactment, and 5 percent from FY 1998 through FY 2001.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The General Accounting Office (GAO) recently released a report showing that the number of hours of paperwork imposed by the government rose by 500 million in the one-month period immediately before the effective date of the Act, from 6.39 billion hours on August 30, 1995, to 6.90 billion hours on September 30, 1995.<sup>20</sup>  The estimated burden imposed by OSHA rose the most dramatically, from 1.5 million hours to about 208 million hours.<sup>21</sup>  These significant increases were due to the fact that the new law forced agencies to more accurately acknowledge the level of paperwork burden they impose on the public.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The GAO projects that federal agencies are expected to reduce the paperwork burden by about one percent in FY 1996.<sup>22</sup>  For the first time since 1989, Congress has managed to force a decrease of as much as 70 million hours in the government paperwork burden. This is equivalent to allowing 36,350 people now working full-time on paperwork each year to engage in other, more productive activities.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Congressional Review Act of 1996</b> For too long, federal agencies have blamed Congress for many of the burdensome regulations it has crafted, and often this blame is justified. The 104th Congress now has made itself accountable and responsible to the American public for all regulations. The Congressional Review Act, part of the Small Business Regulatory Enforcement Fairness Act of 1996, allows Congress to review each new rule and consider a joint resolution of disapproval to overrule it. Under this Act, no rule may go into effect until it is delivered to Congress for its review. A "rule" is defined very broadly to include all general agency statements that affect the public, including "interpretive" rules, agency "policy statements," "guidelines," and "staff manuals."  Federal agencies will have to report to Congress on each rule, stating whether they have evaluated the costs of the rule relative to the benefits, whether the rule takes private property, and whether it affects the relationship between the federal government and state and local governments. Congress can reject a rule, which would then have to be changed substantially before it could be resubmitted to Congress.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
More reform would have been achieved had President Clinton not vetoed other measures passed by the 104th Congress. Among them:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 

<b>The Common Sense Liability Reform Act (vetoed by President Clinton)</b> The Act would have curbed abuses of the legal system. It had strong bipartisan backing in Congress but was vigorously opposed by the trial lawyers -- incidentally, among the largest contributors to Clinton's presidential campaign. Liability reform is desperately needed to reduce the crushing burden of frivolous and unfounded cases brought against state and local governments, charitable organizations, and America's product manufacturers. Unfortunately, Congress did not have the votes necessary to override Clinton's veto of May 2, 1996.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
<b>The Comprehensive Regulatory Reform Act of 1995 (vetoed by President Clinton)</b> In September 1993, President Clinton had revised and reissued the regulatory review executive order first issued by President Reagan. Executive Order 12866, Regulatory Planning and Review, established a set of principles to guide federal regulators in developing rules and the Office of Management and Budget (OMB) in reviewing rules. These principles include consideration of costs and benefits and the use of market-based alternatives and performance standards. The Clinton Administration, however, did not appear very committed to making sure the regulatory principles it embodied were being taken into consideration by federal agencies. A review of EPA rulemaking between April 1994 and September 1994 showed that:
<p>
<ul>
<li> Of 45 significant rules reviewed by OMB, only six contained a determination that the benefits justified the costs; only three contained a determination of a compelling public need; and only nine considered alternative approaches to regulating. Of the other 177 EPA rules issued during that six-month period but not reviewed by OMB, no rule determined that the benefits justified the costs.<sup>23</sup>
</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The 104th Congress recognized that for regulatory reform to be truly effective, it must force regulatory agencies to behave differently, and a statutory change was the only way to achieve it. Federal regulators needed to be required to base their decisions on costs, benefits, and actual risks faced by Americans, and they need Congress to give them the roadmap to do it. Congress enacted such legislation as part of a temporary increase in the debt ceiling. But President Clinton vetoed this bill on November 13, 1995.

<p>

<b>THE BAND-AID APPROACH: THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION'S "REGULATORY REINVENTION INITIATIVES" </b>
<p><blockquote>
<center>	I am going to stop handing down mandates to you and regulating you to death.</center>

<P>
--Bill Clinton, remarks before the U.S. Conference of Mayors, Houston, Texas, June 22, 1992.
</blockquote><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Despite campaign promises to cut red tape, the growth of regulation has continued during the Clinton Administration.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
At the end of 1992, the Code of Federal Regulations (CFR), the annual accumulation of all federal regulations in effect, filled 199 volumes and 128,344 pages. By the end of 1995, the CFR had grown to 205 volumes and 138,186 pages -- almost 10,000 pages of new executive branch rules in just three years.<sup>24</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
To be sure, soon after the 104th Congress took office, the Clinton Administration initiated a number of steps that made it look as if it was really serious about slowing the growth of new rules. For example, on February 21, 1995, the White House directed federal agencies to conduct a review of their existing regulations to determine which should be eliminated and which should be streamlined, updated, overhauled, or otherwise improved.<sup>25</sup>  However, one year later, it is clear the Administration is making no real progress in reducing the overall burden of regulation. For example:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
In June 1995, the Administration claimed that agencies had identified over 16,000 pages in the Code of Federal Regulations that they would be eliminating.<sup>26</sup>  But some of the pages being eliminated are for rules for which the underlying statute has long since been repealed, treaties that no longer exist, and the like. This alone easily could achieve a 10 percent reduction in the CFR without accomplishing any real changes in the way the federal government goes about regulating the public. So while it sounds impressive, it is not. At the same time, the Administration already has added 10,000 pages of new regulations.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
While EPA claims to be streamlining various permitting, review, and reporting requirements for a number of programs, the Clinton Administration simultaneously is pushing forward with burdensome regulatory initiatives, such as expanding the universe of sources that must be reported as part of the Toxic Release Inventory. Critics argue that last year's expansion will mean as much as $331 million in compliance costs.<sup>27</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Administration, while asserting that it is committed to sound science, is pursuing federal guidelines on cancer assessment to make it easier to regulate or ban substances despite the lack of sound scientific evidence that they pose any risk. Virtually all scientists who conduct statistical analyses to determine cancer risks -- or any other analyses, for that matter -- use confidence levels to determine the likelihood that their results are accurate. But the EPA proposed new rules this April that would eliminate the current requirement that EPA use confidence levels in doing risk assessments. Under this new rule, EPA would be able to conclude that something is dangerous on the basis of evidence that would fail under any rigorous scientific study.<sup>28</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Although the Occupational Safety and Health Administration (OSHA) is consolidating a few rules and eliminating duplicative pages in the Code of Federal Regulations, it also is working on new regulations that will impose over $12 billion in compliance costs on consumers and businesses (indoor air quality and ergonomics) and increase the cost of a home by $1,000 to $5,000 (fall protection).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
Clearly, the Clinton Administration's "reinvention" effort does little to curb the rising costs and inefficiencies of regulation. The Administration claims to be reinventing regulation but goes about implementing new burdensome regulations about as fast as it can take old ones off the books.
<p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
When the 104th Congress began in January 1995, the federal government's ever-expanding reach into the lives of Americans -- the food they eat, how they use their private property, how they run their businesses -- was a source of great concern to the American people. The 104th Congress has made historic progress toward fundamentally changing how the federal government regulates the lives of all Americans. And it has done so by applying a set of principles: free markets, competition, consideration of costs and benefits, sound science and risk assessment, priority setting, and assigning of property rights.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160; 
The Clinton Administration will now attempt to take credit for regulatory reform through its "reinvention" efforts, but all it actually has done is try to play "catch-up" by repackaging the same old regulatory system and passing it off as something new. Making it easier for businesses to comply with regulations that were unjustified in the first place or claiming to take away rules while simultaneously adding new ones does not represent true regulatory reform. The American people are too smart for that. In the final analysis, they know that true reform gives them more freedom and incentives to take actions for their own benefit, and that the 104th Congress has delivered on its promise in a way that will affect the shape of federal regulations for decades.

<title>High Layoffs and Long-Term Unemployment Cloud Jobs Picture - Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><h3> HIGH LAYOFFS AND LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT CLOUD JOBS PICTURE </h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/wilson.htm">Mark Wilson</a>, Rebecca Lukens Fellow in Labor Policy <br>
<p>
<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
F.Y.I. No. 115<br>
August 5, 1996<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
<a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/fyi115c1.gif">Chart 1:</a> Announced Layoffs for the First Six Months of 1996 Continue at Rapid Pace<br>
<a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/fyi115c2.gif">Chart 2:</a> Compared with Previous Economic Expansions, Long-Term Unemployment Remains High<br>
<a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/fyi115c3.gif">Chart 3:</a> Manufacturing Employment Has Declined for the Last Year and Remains 6.2 Percent Below 1989<br>

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;


Since the end of the last recession in March 1991, the total number of payroll jobs has grown by 11.4 million to a total of 119.7 million, and the unemployment rate has declined from 6.8 to 5.4 percent. Despite this good news, many workers continue to be apprehensive about their economic future. In fact, one of every five Americans believes jobs are hard to get, and well over one of every ten believes there will be fewer jobs in the future.<sup>1</sup>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

A look at the data behind the total number of jobs created and overall unemployment rates reveals why Americans are concerned.<ul>

<p><li>Announced job layoffs continue at a rapid pace, with layoffs at near record levels for the 1990s. Displaced workers who did find new jobs did so at an average of 8.2 percent lower wages.

<p><li>Long-term unemployment remains stubbornly high. The percentage of long-term unemployed is at record levels for this stage of an economic expansion.

<p><li>Overall real earnings growth is stagnating, and men's real earnings continue to decline.

<p><li>The number of high-paying manufacturing jobs continues to decline -- down 282,000 since March 1995 -- and weak economic growth is limiting job opportunities for many Americans.
Focusing on just the total number of new jobs and the low overall unemployment rate without taking these sobering facts into account paints a misleading picture of economic growth and job opportunities.<sup>2</sup>  The economy is still failing to perform as well as similar expansions.


</ul><p>
<b>ANNOUNCED LAYOFFS CONTINUE AT RAPID PACE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
After a flurry of press attention last winter, the continued pace of corporate downsizing has gone largely unnoticed. Despite this, many workers remain concerned about their job security. One-half of all Americans believe that jobs are not very plentiful,<sup>3</sup> and 46 percent believe the economy is getting worse.<sup>4</sup>  New jobs may be available, but they usually pay substantially less and may not have the same benefits.<ul>

<p><li>Announced job layoffs for the first six months of 1996 were the second-highest this decade (see <a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/fyi115c1.gif">Chart 1</a>).<sup>5</sup>  Layoffs were 28 percent higher than the first half of 1995 and 6.0 percent ahead of 1993, the largest downsizing year of the decade.

<p><li>So far this year, the telecommunications industry has announced layoffs totaling almost 43,000; the food industry, over 25,000; the computer industry, over 22,000; the retail industry, over 21,000; and the automobile industry, almost 18,000.

<p><li>The median weekly earnings of displaced workers who found new jobs were 8.2 percent less than for their old jobs.<sup>6</sup>  They were over 14 percent less for workers 45 to 55 years old. One of every five displaced workers who found new jobs was no longer covered by group health insurance.
</ul>

<p>
<b>LONG-TERM UNEMPLOYMENT REMAINS HIGH</b><p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;

How long Americans are unemployed (duration) is just as important as the level of unemployment. An unemployment rate of 7.5 percent with most workers out of work for only a week as they change jobs or are recalled from layoff is significantly better than an unemployment rate of 5.5 percent with many workers still struggling to find work six months after losing their last job. Because of weak economic growth, long-term joblessness has not declined as rapidly as it normally does after recessions.<sup>7</sup>
<ul>
<p><li>Long-term unemployment remains stubbornly high.<sup>8</sup>  <a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/fyi115c2.gif">Chart 2</a> shows that the proportion of Americans unemployed for at least six months remains unusually high after five years of modest economic growth. Since the end of the last recession, the proportion of unemployed who have been out of work for six or more months has not dropped significantly for youths (ages 16 to 24), black Americans, and service workers.

<p><li>After six months of looking for work, almost one of every five unemployed managers and professionals still has not found a job.<sup>9</sup>

<p><li>The overall unemployment rate also does not reveal significant problems facing workers in various age groups, industries, or occupations. While the total unemployment rate was 5.4 percent in July 1996, the rate for all teenagers was 16.4 percent, and the rate for black teenagers was 33.1 percent.
</ul>

<p><b>EARNINGS GROWTH STAGNATES, MEN'S EARNINGS STILL DECLINE</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Over the past five years of modest economic recovery and expansion, the real median usual weekly earnings for all full-time wage and salary workers has stagnated.<sup>10</sup>  For men, real median weekly earnings have declined 5.1 percent. For black and Hispanic Americans, the decline has been even worse: 5.4 percent and 8.2 percent, respectively.
<ul>
<p><li>After increasing 2.5 percent from the first quarter of 1991 to the first quarter of 1993, the index of real hourly compensation has not increased.

<p><li>Over the past five years, only workers in the finance, insurance, and real estate industries have seen their real average hourly earnings improve substantially.
</ul><p><b>

WEAK ECONOMIC GROWTH LIMITS JOB OPPORTUNITIES FOR AMERICANS</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Although total employment and unemployment numbers are significant, they often do not convey important information about problems various age groups, industries, or occupations may be having. There actually are fewer manufacturing jobs now than when the economic recovery began five years ago, and the dismal pace of economic growth has meant no substantial improvement in job opportunities for men and minorities. Workers in some occupations have not yet regained the ground they lost in the last recession. For example:
<ul>
<p><li>Since March 1991, the percentage of the population employed has increased 1.4 percentage points to 63.2 percent.<sup>11</sup>  The percentage of men employed, however, has increased only 0.5 percentage points and still remains well below its 1989 peak of 72.8 percent.

<p><li>The employment-population ratio for white teenagers has increased 0.7 percentage points to 48.0 percent since March 1991 but remains well below the rate of 53.4 percent reached in August 1989.<sup>12</sup>  Likewise, the employment-population ratio for black teenagers has increased 2.0 percentage points to a disappointing 25.8 percent since March 1991 but remains well below the pre-recession rate of 32.4 percent reached in July 1989.

<p><li>The number of manufacturing jobs has declined 282,000 to 18.3 million since March 1995, and is down almost 1.2 million since its peak in 1989 (see <a href="/heritage/library/categories/regulation/fyi115c3.gif">Chart 3</a>).<sup>13</sup>  Durable goods manufacturing employment has increased only 55,000 over the past five years and remains below its 1989 peak by 794,000 jobs. Manufacturing workers have regained only 1 of every 5 jobs lost between 1989 and 1993.

<p><li>The number of Americans working in high-skilled technician and related occupations has declined 478,000 since July 1992, and the number of workers in administrative support and clerical occupations has declined by 298,000.<sup>14</sup>

<p><li>The number of Americans working in precision production, craft, and repair occupations has declined 13,000 to 13.4 million from March 1991 to July 1996 and remains 519,000 below the peak of 14.0 million reached in March 1990.
</ul><p>

<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
Despite the creation of 11.4 million additional jobs since the end of the last recession, workers continue to be concerned about their economic future. The average annual growth rate of the past seven years has been the worst economic performance since the end of World War II.<sup>15</sup>  Layoff announcements for the first half of this year were the second-highest this decade, long-term unemployment remains high, and real earnings growth has stagnated for the past five years. Focusing only on total job growth and the low unemployment rate without taking these facts into account paints a misleading picture of economic growth and job opportunities.

A Special Report to the House Banking and Financial Services Committee
<P>


<b>INTRODUCTION</b>
<p>
The Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 requires a number of government agencies--the Congressional Budget Office (CBO), the General Accounting Office (GAO), the Department of the Treasury, and the Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD)--to report on the feasibility and effects of privatizing the two largest housing-related government sponsored enterprises (GSEs): the Federal National Mortgage Association (Fannie Mae) and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation (Freddie Mac).
<p>

As these reports are being submitted to Congress,<sup>1</sup> the House subcommittee on Capital Markets, Securities and Government Sponsored Enterprises is holding oversight hearings to study the issue of privatizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. The hearings have highlighted the diverse opinions of the federal agencies on the advantages and disadvantages of privatization. Several of the academic studies and the Congressional Budget Office report indicate that federal sponsorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac provides stockholders with a significant subsidy that may indicate government sponsorship is unnecessary. On the other hand, the Department of the Treasury and the Department of Housing and Urban Development both conclude that government sponsorship of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac continues to be necessary to preserve the mission and ensure the success of these GSEs.


<p>
Because of the divergent views among government agencies and outside experts on privatization, some observers are arguing that, even if the GSEs are not privatized, congressional oversight is inappropriate because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are legally private corporations and not government agencies. Thus, Congress now finds itself defending its oversight role as well as considering the option of privatization.
<p>

Although Congress will hear many different views on these issues, it must keep in mind  two important facts to help guide its decisions:
<ol>

<p><li><b>Congress is ultimately responsible for safeguarding the interests of taxpayers.</b> Congressional oversight of government sponsored enterprises is not only appropriate but indeed critical as long as GSEs like Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac receive government subsidies, undertake a public mission, and place taxpayers at risk.

<p><li><b>The original mission of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, establishing an efficient secondary mortgage market, has been fulfilled.</b> Thus, Congress should take steps to end the relationship between these organizations and the federal government.
</ol><p>
<b>Congressional Oversight of GSEs Is Critical As Long As 
Taxpayers Are At Risk</b>
<p>

The structure and mission of government sponsored enterprises (GSEs) makes their relationship to the federal government and role in the economy ambiguous and at times risky. GSEs typically are stockholder-owned corporations, and therefore private, but chartered and overseen by the federal government, and therefore public. This dual personality can create a conflict between a GSE executive who is responsible for maximizing profit for the corporation's stockholders and the federal official whose duty is to ensure that the public mission of the corporation is met.
<p>

Because GSEs are private organizations responsible to their stockholders, they may view congressional oversight and investigations as intrusions into the internal affairs of their private business. At the same time, none of the GSEs want to lose the special privileges afforded them by federal charter and implicit government guarantees. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are active across the country and easily can mobilize broad-based support within Congress for favorable treatment. This is especially true when the topic of discussion is privatization.
<p>

However, there are several reasons why congressional oversight and investigation is important and necessary as long as GSEs remain under the umbrella of taxpayer support and protection. These include: 
<ul>
<p><li><b>The GSEs were chartered by Congress to fulfill a specific public policy goal.</b> In exchange for the government support enjoyed by GSEs--such as exemption from state and local taxes, the ability to borrow money from the federal treasury, and participation in Federal Reserve Open Market transactions--these private organizations are expected to fulfill a specific public policy goal. In the case of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, this goal is to make home mortgages more readily available by creating an efficient and fluid secondary mortgage market. Although this mission has been met, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac continue to receive significant benefits from the federal government. It is necessary, therefore, to ensure that the GSEs do not use these benefits to stray from their original charters.

<p><li><b>The federal oversight agency can have conflicting roles as regulator and advocate, putting taxpayers at risk.</b>The Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 created the Office of Federal Housing Enterprise Oversight (OFHEO) to oversee the activities of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. Specifically, the OFHEO is required to establish minimal risk-based capital standards to be met by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. These requirements limit the potential risk faced by taxpayers in the case of a serious failure. However, the risk-based capital requirements also have the effect of limiting the profitability of the GSEs by restricting the amount of productive investments that can be made at any one time. Therefore, the goals of advocacy and regulation can be in direct conflict. If the OFHEO chooses to lean toward advocacy rather than regulation, then taxpayer risk could increase.<sup>2</sup>  The Congressional Budget Office reports that "OFHEO's objective of minimizing risk is inconsistent with the current objective of using the GSEs to finance the achievement of social goals."<sup>3</sup> Thus, Congress also must oversee the activities of the OFHEO.

<p><li><b>Congress is ultimately responsible for avoiding a GSE failure that potentially could cost taxpayers billions of dollars.</b> Congress is responsible for protecting the interests of the American taxpayers. Taxpayers have a large vested interest in government sponsored enterprises and it is incumbent upon Congress to ensure that this interest is carefully protected.
</ul><p>
<b>Privatizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac</b>
<p>

Privatization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac would have a number of important economic benefits. In the short-term, the loss of an implicit government guarantee would increase the cost of business for GSEs, and it is likely that part of this increase would be passed on to consumers in the form of higher mortgage interest costs. In the long-run, however, the end of Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's implicit government guarantee would create a more competitive secondary mortgage market. Increased competition would counter the loss of federal subsidies and help to keep mortgage costs down. Competition also would lead to greater innovation and hence more consumer choice. In addition, privatization would mean an end to taxpayer support and the mandate to achieve certain public policy objectives. Thus, the federal government's oversight role would end, and the GSEs would be free to exit existing lines of business and enter more profitable ones. 
<p>

Several important factors make privatization a viable and attractive option. These include:
<ul>
<p><li><b>Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have fulfilled their original mission; secondary mortgage markets are established and fluid.</b> There is a consensus that the secondary mortgage market in America is well established and fluid. In fact, each of the four studies mandated by the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act of 1992 concludes that an efficient secondary mortgage market exists today (see box). Along with other private firms, they would able to take advantage of the established market without posing a threat to taxpayers. </ul>
<table border>

<tr><td><b>BY ALL ACCOUNTS, TODAY'S SECONDARY MORTGAGE MARKET IS ESTABLISHED AND FLUID</b></td></tr>
<tr><td>"The secondary market now provides an efficient, stable, and dependable source of liquidity for mortgage credit markets."<sup>4</sup> - <I>U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development</I><p>

"Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have succeeded in developing a liquid secondary mortgage market for conforming, conventional mortgages. ... There seems little doubt that securitization and the secondary mortgage activities pioneered by Ginnie Mae, Fannie Mae, and Freddie Mac are now well-established and that the secondary market for conforming, conventional mortgages could operate efficiently and effectively even if Fannie Mae's and Freddie Mac's government sponsorship were altered."<sup>5</sup> -  <I>U.S. Department of the Treasury</I>
<p>
 "Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have played critical roles in establishing and maintaining a nationwide secondary mortgage market, enhancing the affordability and availability of housing finance, and increasing efficiency through greater standardization of mortgage products and processes."<sup>6</sup> - <I>General Accounting Office</I>
<p>
"From a perspective of financing mortgages, the good news is that access to mortgage funds has increased."<sup>7</sup> - <I>Congressional Budget Office</I>
</td></tr></table>
<ul><p>

<p><li><b>There is no rationale for further government intervention in the mortgage credit markets.</b> Fannie Mae was created in 1938 in an attempt to increase the availability of affordable home mortgages. At that time, technological shortcomings and a Depression-era private economy prevented the widespread availability of home mortgages. Even in 1970, when Freddie Mac was chartered, an efficient secondary market was an illusive goal. However, today technology and more fluid capital markets have increased the availability of mortgages to all potential home buyers.

Indeed, the development and efficiency of the home mortgage markets in America is, at least in part, a credit to the activities of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac. After having met their original goals, however, these GSEs are now involved in activities that relate only tangentially to their original missions. The Congressional Budget Office reports, "Having achieved their original purpose, the housing GSEs can now cite the authority to undertake a large number of tasks whose precise nature is not always clearly defined."<sup>8</sup>  The expansion of activities undertaken by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac indicates that they have fulfilled their original public policy mission. These expanded activities also pose new risks to the taxpayers.
<p>

<li><b>The tremendous size of the housing GSEs, which is made possible only by implicit federal guarantee,  presents a dangerous presence in the capital markets.</b> Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac together have more than $1.4 trillion in debt and mortgage-backed securities. This is equivalent to nearly two-fifths of the publicly held federal government debt.<sup>9</sup>  Together the two housing GSEs purchase more than 50 percent of all conforming mortgages.<sup>10</sup>  By any measure, then, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are "800-pound gorillas" in the capital markets. This tremendous size is made possible only by the distinct advantages enjoyed by the organizations as government sponsored enterprises.
<p>
The advantages enjoyed by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac and their enormous size present several dangers to the credit markets in general and the mortgage markets specifically. Private firms cannot compete with Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac.<sup>11</sup> The federal government, in essence, has created a duopoly that hinders innovation and prevents consumers from obtaining the most efficient delivery of home mortgages. Moreover, in the case of a GSE failure, the mortgage credit market would be severely crippled because of the lack of participants able to fill the void left by such a primary participant.
<p>
In addition, the large number of transactions carried out by Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac have significant effects on other credit markets. Demand for mortgages is abnormally high because Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are able to borrow money in the credit markets at a subsidized rate. This subsidy is partially passed on to consumers, who will forego other investment activities when faced with a lower mortgage price. In fact, residential structures today represent nearly 30 percent of total tangible wealth in the United States. This figure has slowly been rising over the past two decades. Government distortion of the capital markets means that natural demands within other sectors--such as small business loans, consumer loans, and farm loans--are not being fully met. This distortion may have a long-term impact on the strength of the American economy as more capital is diverted away from productive business activities and into home ownership.
<p>
<p><li><b>The mixed private/public nature of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac constitutes a conflict of interest.</b> Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are stockholder-owned companies. As such, they are responsible for earning the highest possible profits for their shareholders. In the private market this would be completely acceptable. However, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are accountable for meeting several public goals that may conflict with their private incentive to earn a maximum profit. If Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac vigorously pursue their private goals, then the public mission is lost and taxpayers are placed in jeopardy. On the other hand, stockholders are denied a maximum rate of return if Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac pursue their public missions too vigorously. This conflict between public and private interests will continue as long as Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac remain government sponsored, but structurally private, enterprises.
<p>
Fannie Mae admits that the value of its stock depends largely on federal government subsidies. Responding to one of the five academic studies prepared for Congress, Fannie Mae writes, "[I]f shareholders are not compensated fully, they will likely claim that privatization constitutes an appropriation of private property without just compensation in violation of the Due Process or the Takings Clause of the Fifth Amendment."<sup>12</sup> Thus, even Fannie Mae recognizes that the current structure of the housing GSEs constitutes a transfer of wealth from the entire pool of taxpayers to the relatively small number of GSE stockholders. As in all areas of government, such a transfer is highly suspect.
</ul><p>
<b>CONCLUSION</b>
<p>
The reports mandated by the Federal Housing Enterprises Financial Safety and Soundness Act and the current congressional hearings represent a positive step in addressing the need for and appropriateness of federal interference in the financial markets. Congress has a responsibility to oversee the ongoing activities of all GSEs, including Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac, as long as American taxpayers provide support and assume risk for GSE activities.
<p>

With their original goal of a comprehensive and fluid secondary mortgage market fulfilled, however, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac no longer require government support. Increasingly, housing GSEs are venturing into new areas of operation that pose a significant threat to taxpayers. With the job done, Congress should break the links between Fannie Mae, Freddie Mac and the federal government and completely turn these profitable operations over to the private sector.
<p>
<b>ENDNOTES</b>
<ol>
<p><li> CBO and GAO have submitted their reports and testified before Congress on their findings. In addition, five academic studies also have been submitted to various agencies and Congress. The Treasury Department and the Department of Housing and Urban Development are expected to report their findings later this month.
<p><li> In fact, Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac already enjoy a lower mandated capital to asset ratio (a prime indicator of financial institution stability) than commercial banks and thrift institutions. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac typically maintain a capital to asset ratio of 3.5 percent and 4.9 percent respectively. The average commercial bank ratio is 7.8 percent and the average private thrift maintains a ratio of 7.9 percent. Several analysts have pointed out that these relatively low capital to asset ratios pose a potential threat to the solvency of the GSEs. See for example, Thomas Stanton, "Restructuring Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac: Supplementary Analysis," in <I>Studies on Privatizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac</I>, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Policy Development and Research, May 1996, pp. 74-96.
<p><li> Congressional Budget Office, <I>Assessing the Public Costs and Benefits of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac</I>, Washington, DC, May 1996, p. 36.
<p><li> U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, "Privatization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac: Desirability and Feasibility," <I>A HUD Report</I>, Office of Policy Development and Research, July 1996, p. 34.
<p><li> U.S. Department of the Treasury, <I>Government Sponsorship of the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation</I>, July 11, 1996, pp. 9, 83.
<p><li>General Accounting Office, "Housing Enterprises: Potential Impacts of Severing Government Sponsorship," <I>GAO Report to Congressional Requesters</I>, GGD-96-120, May, 1996, p 4.
<p><li> Congressional Budget Office, <I>Assessing the Public Costs and Benefits of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac</I>, May 1996, pp. 2.

<p><li> U.S. Department of the Treasury, <I>Government Sponsorship of the Federal National Mortgage Association and the Federal Home Loan Mortgage Corporation</I>, July 11, 1996, p. 7.
<p><li> A "conforming" mortgage is one with a principal below an amount set by statute and based on the median value of owner-occupied homes. Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac are only able to purchase conforming mortgages. Mortgages above the conforming limit are known as jumbo mortgages and are securitized only by completely private firms.
<p><li> For evidence, see Benjamin Hermalin and Dwight Jaffee, "The Privatization of Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac: Implications for Mortgage Industry Structure," in <I>Studies on Privatizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac</I>, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Policy Development and Research, May 1996, pp. 225-302.
<p><li> Fannie Mae, "Fannie Mae Review of the Stanton Paper," in <I>Studies on Privatizing Fannie Mae and Freddie Mac</I>, U.S. Department of Housing and Urban Development, Office of Policy Development and Research, May 1996, p. 65.</ol>

	1 had a problem this week.  With the Waco and Whitewater Hearings, the tax debate, Medicare negotiations, and Bosnia going on, 1 couldn't decide what I should write.  After spending a solid 5 minutes thinking, I decided to write about Town Hall's new programming schedule.<p>

	Starting Monday, August 7, Town Hall will implement a new programming schedule.  The first component is entitled the <b>Spotlight</b>. A new one will appear each Monday and will focus on an issue, event, organization, or person.  After reading a Spotlight, you will be able to enter a special Forum where you can debate the issues with other Town Hall users.  (It is still under construction so please use the regular Forum to discuss this week's topic.  Look for the one with the <b> Spotlight/Flat Tax</b> title.  <a href="/townhall/hotissues/welcome.html.cgi"> (Click here to jump to the Forum page</a>) <p>
 <A HREF="/townhall/spotlights/i-flatx.html">This week's Spotlight</A> focuses on tax reform.  The Armey-Shelby flat tax plan, the Archer sales tax plan, and Dick Gephardt's 10 percent tax plan are presented, while <a href="/townhall/atr/1.html">Americans for Tax Reform</a>'s Grover Norquist, <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a>'s Dan Mitchell, and other tax analysts examine the pros and cons of each plan.  Look for a new book from the <a href="/townhall/sbsc">Small Business Survival Committee</a>'s Raymond Keating to be available through the Town Hall shop in the coming weeks.<p>

	Town Hall will begin to expand our programming next week with news summaries, a daily what's new, polls, surveys, games, etc.  Use the <a href="/townhall/cyber_personth/cyberper.htm">Ask Tom</a> link to suggest other information or activities that you would like to see on Town Hall.<p>

	1 hope that you enjoy our inaugural Spotlight on Tax Reform!  Don't forget to go to the <a href="/townhall/hotissues/welcome.html.cgi">Forum</a> to let everyone in Town Hall know what you think about the issue.<p>

<h2>Education: A Conservative Primer <br>
</h2>

<hr>
<br>
This week Town Hall is pleased to bring you an exclusive spotlight on education in America.  
<p>
Everyone agrees that the success of the tomorrow's Americans is dependant on a good education today; however, the type of education is an ongoing debate between liberals and conservatives.
<p>
No one disagrees that educational progress in the last thirty years is embarrassing.  Low test scores and rankings as compared to other countries, poor discipline in the classroom and violence in school have been the results of liberal ideology on the school system.  Instead of focusing on the immediate purpose of primary education--educating our youth in history, mathematics, social science, and language-- enlightened members of academia have determined that diversity, multicultural curriculum, and self-esteem programs represent the true focus of the American educational experience.  
<p>
What is the solution? Well, in Town Hall's exclusive spotlight this week, you'll discover that leading conservative organizations have developed numerous programs to combat the current state of American education.  Along with raising standards and restoring a sense of order and discipline in the classroom, other policies include school choice, market-based reform, and privatization.  Best of all, these policies are now the central components of the ongoing debate, which is a victory in itself for conservatives.

<H2>What YOU Should Know About the Congress as they Reconvene
to Debate their Fall Agenda</CENTER></H2>
<HR>

<P>
The 104th Congress' Fall session is peeking its head around the
corner and hopefully America is looking. The last full session
of the year has historically been a provider of memorable moments
in our nation's legislature. This year will not disappoint. Issues
such as welfare reform, Medicaid, Medicare, education legislation
and the United States' involvement in the Bosnian civil war will
be discussed until the time the autumn leaves give way to winter
snow.
<P>
In our representative democracy an educated populace is imperative.  The result is a public with
informed, yet differing, opinions. The theory behind a representative democracy
is that citizens, out of their own free will and privilege, vote another citizen to represent them in
our nation's capital. Understanding the political process is essential if we are to hold politicians
accountable. When public opinion coalesces into consensus, legislators take notice.  <p>

The problem is that private citizens are
just that--private. They work, provide for their families, spend
time with their loved ones and raise their children. Many simply don't have the time to acquire,
much less absorb, the mass of information detailing how the system works and impacts their
lives.
<P>
For your convenience, Town Hall has assembled a guide to the 104th Congress and how
legislation becomes law.  Democracy is fragile.  It is absolutely necessary that it be nurtured by
private citizens.  It has never been easier.

informed, yet differing, opinions. The theory behind a representative democracy
is that citizens, out of their own free will and privilege, vote another citizen to represent them in
our nation's capital. Understanding the political process is essential if we are to hold politicians
accountable. When public opinion coalesces into consensus, legislators take notice.  <p>

The problem is that private citizens are
just that--private. They work, provide for their families, spend
time with their loved ones and raise their children. Many simply don't have the time to acquire,
much less absorb, the mass of information detailing how the system works and impacts their
lives.
<P>
For your convenience, Town Hall has assembled a guide to the 104th Congress and how
legislation becomes law.  Democracy is fragile.  It is absolutely necessary that it be nurtured by
private citizens.  It has never been easier.

<H2>What YOU Should Know About the Congress as they Reconvene
to Debate their Fall Agenda</CENTER></H2>
<HR>

<P>
The 104th Congress' Fall session is peeking its head around the
corner and hopefully America is looking. The last full session
of the year has historically been a provider of memorable moments
in our nation's legislature. This year will not disappoint. Issues
such as welfare reform, Medicaid, Medicare, education legislation
and the United States' involvement in the Bosnian civil war will
be discussed until the time the autumn leaves give way to winter
snow.

<h2>Presidential Candidate Spotlight</h2>
</center>
<br>
<hr>
<br>
February is only a few months away and politicians are once again flocking to New Hampshire in hopes of capturing the all important first primary of the presidential race. Currently there are 9 GOP candidates in the race, all participating in the ideological labeling which takes place before the issues control the campaign.  With nine candidates, it is difficult to remember who they are and what they stand for.<p>
This spotlight summarizes the candidtaes in question and relays a portion of their ideology and stance on the political spectrum.  Biographies and speeches can be found as well as the current <i>Heritage Foundation Policy Review</i> article which relays arguments for each of the candidates. Links to all of the presidential HomePages are also available.<p>
As the sun sets on the presidential race, there will only be one man who will assume power.  Make sure you make an informed decsoin with your vote.  Start here for the information!<p>

<h2><Center>Welfare Reform in the 104th Congress:<br>Will it happen?</h2>
<hr>
<a href="#welfare">Spotlight on Welfare</a><br></center><P>
During the 1992 campaign, President Clinton promised to reform "welfare as we know it".  So far has failed to live up to his promise.  Will he sign the welfare reform bill into law if the Republican Congress passes it?
<p>
This week, the <b>Town Hall Spotlight</b> will focus on the issue of welfare reform and the welfare bills making their way through Congress.<p>
After an 87-12 affirmative vote in the Senate last week, the welfare reform bill moves to a conference committee where large differences between the two bills must be worked out.  The house bill contains many good provisions to prevent illegitimacy and promote individual responsibility.  The Senate version has been gutted of most of these measures by the liberals so a struggle in conference committee is inevitable.<p>
The looming questions are; will the Republicans be able to come to a consensus on a welfare reform bill, and more importantly, will President Clinton sign it.<P>

<h2><Center>Welfare Reform in the 104th Congress:<br>Will it happen?</h2>
<hr>
<a href="#welfare">Spotlight on Welfare</a><br></center><P>
During the 1992 campaign, President Clinton promised to reform "welfare as we know it".  So far has failed to live up to his promise.  Will he sign the welfare reform bill into law if the Republican Congress passes it?
<p>
This week, the <b>Town Hall Spotlight</b> will focus on the issue of welfare reform and the welfare bills making their way through Congress.<p>
After an 87-12 affirmative vote in the Senate last week, the welfare reform bill moves to a conference committee where large differences between the two bills must be worked out.  The house bill contains many good provisions to prevent illegitimacy and promote individual responsibility.  The Senate version has been gutted of most of these measures by the liberals so a struggle in conference committee is inevitable.<p>
The looming questions are; will the Republicans be able to come to a consensus on a welfare reform bill, and more importantly, will President Clinton sign it.<P>

<H2>The Great "Train Wreck" on Pennsylvania Avenue:<BR>
The Debate over the 1996 Budget</CENTER></H2>
<HR><center><a href="#Misc">Spotlight on the Budget Battle</a></center>
<P>
If you listen to the rhetoric coming out of Washington D.C. these days, you might think that a natural disaster was bearing down on our nation's capitol.  What is actually happening is quite the opposite.<p>
This Week the <b>Town Hall Spotlight</b> will focus on the issues constituting the budget battle.<P>
As opposed to past years, where the Congress has been irresponsible, the 104th Congress is taking on the tough choices in order to achieve a balanced budget.  Conservatives are in control of the purse-strings and do not plan to let go.  In fact,  Republican leadership has taken a "no-summits" stance in order to avoid the catastrophe that ruined George Bush in 1990.<p>
Because there is little chance of the Congress passing appropriations bills that the President will sign before October, the President must be willing to give in on spending levels or risk a government shut-down. It may sound like a natural disaster to many liberals whose policies are being scrutinized, but conservatives cannot help but enjoy having the upper-hand in the big debate.  When October 1st goes by, Clinton will have to convince the Congress to pass  continuing resolutions in order to keep the federal government working.  As long as the Republicans do not give in,  America will come out of this budget battle having taken the biggest step toward fiscal responsibility in decades.<p>
Throughout the week,  Town Hall will be releasing several spotlights brought to you by the many conservative organizations that make up Town Hall.

<A NAME="FEATURES">
<h2>Product Features and Benefits</h2>
<b>Indexicon Creates Indexes Automatically!</b>
<BR>
<blockquote>Indexicon takes the work out of indexing documents. There's no
need to re-read your text and manually tag significant terms, since
Indexicon locates important words and builds indexes for you.
<p>
With Indexicon, it is easy to produce consistent quality,
back-of-the-book indexes for every document: <p>
<ol>
<li>Indexicon automatically scans your document and marks the indexable terms.
<li>Indexicon uses Word's built-in-facility to compile the index that
appears at the end of your document.
<li>Indexicon allows the user to experiment with different levels of detail
and to vary the degree of comprehensiveness of the index.
<li>Indexicon's unique features allow the user to exclude portions of the
document from indexing and to edit the index entries.
</ol>

</blockquote>

<b>Easy to Install and Easy to Use</b>
<p><blockquote>
There's nothing to learn!  If you can click a mouse, you can index
a document of any size with Indexicon. <i>PC
Magazine</i> says, <i>with Indexicon, creating an index
is as quick and easy as spellchecking</i>. <b>
<p></blockquote>
Semantic and Syntactic Analysis</b>
<p><blockquote>
Indexicon disambiguates the English language.  Even when words
appear to be the same, such as <em>lead</em> the soft metal, and <em>lead</em>
to guide or influence, Indexicon recognizes the contextual difference
and indexes them accordingly.
<b></blockquote>
<p>
Quality Indexes Produced Quickly<blockquote>
<p></b><i>Indexicon is fast,</i> a reviewer for WINDOWS Magazine
states (10/94). <i> We created an index for a 50-page technical
manual in less than a minute.</i>  A task that would normally
take hours of tedious effort if done manually can now be done
effortlessly within a few minutes. <b>
<p></blockquote>
Economical Information Management
<p><blockquote>
</b> Indexicon-generated indexes will enable you to locate
specific information quickly while saving you time and money in production
costs and minimizing lengthy management tasks. You will appreciate
the efficiency and accuracy of Indexicon, as well as its compatibility
with <i>WordPerfect's </i>and <i>Microsoft Word's </i>indexing
features.</blockquote>


<center><i><font color=0000BB size=+1><b>Easily Creates Quality
Back-of-the-Book<BR> Indexes for Any Document!</b></font></i></center>


<BR><BR>
<A NAME="NEW"><h2>New Features for Indexicon 2.5</h2>
<ul type="square">
<li>The indexing process is 15-20% faster than version 2.0.
<li>20,000 new terms have been added to the primary lexicon.
<li>Double entries are automatically created for certain types of entries.
Where version 2.0 created an entry for "Byzantine architecture," version 2.5
will now create that entry as well as "Architecture: Byzantine."  Where
version 2.0 created an entry "Blue chip stocks," version 2.5 will, in
additon, create an entry for "Stocks, blue chip."
<li>Version 2.5 includes much more logic for recognizing personal names,
including logic for expanding partial name references.  If Indexicon 2.5
finds a reference to "Mr. Culpepper" in the text, it will now icnlude an
entry which expands the name to its fully indexable form, "Culpepper, Bradley
H.," if that complete form has been supplied elsewhere in the document.
<li>Pathnames, URLs, and e-mail addresses are now recognized.
<li>More sophisticated analysis is now done to determine the indexing value
of individual entries, resulting in a better distribution of entries across
indexing levels.</ul>
<b><i>New LexEdit features in Indexicon 2.5</b></i>
<ul type="square">
<li>Potential indexing values change according to the part of speech
selected for an entry.  For most parts of speech the indexing values are the
same ones that were available in earlier versions of LexEdit:  Rarely Index,
Sometimes Index, Always Index, etc.  But in other parts of speech the choices
change to reflect the special needs of that part of speech.  For instance, if
Personal Name is indicated as the part of speech, the available indexing
values are: First Name, Last Name, Famous Last Name, and Indexable as a
Single Name.
<li>Checkboxes have been added so that capitalization and abbreviation of
entries can be indicated.  This helps make the analysis process more accurate
and offers the user better control over indexing, especially the indexing of
proper nouns.</ul><br><br>

<h2>Frequently Asked Question About Indexicon</h2>
<P>
<B>Q: </B>Now that I have installed Indexicon, where can I find it?<br>
<b>A: </b>Indexicon is found under the <b>Tools</b> menu from within Microsoft
Word. <p>
 <b>Q:</b>  Is the indexing <EM>fully</EM> automatic?<br> <b>A:</b>
The index generation is fully automatic.  However, the user can set certain
options and/or emphasize certain words to guarantee full control over the
final index. <P> <b>Q:</b>  How much information can it process at a
time?<br> <b>A:</b>  The amount of information that Indexicon is able to
process depends entirely on the speed of your processor, the amount of RAM
you have, the density of the document you are processing, and how
comprehensive you want the index. Generally, you can produce 1,000 or more
index entries without straining a typical system's resources. <P> <b>Q:</b>
Is the program independent from MS Word and WordPerfect?<br> <b>A:</b>  No.
Indexicon is an add-on that works in conjunction with both Word's and
WordPerfect's indexing features. <p> <b>Q:</b>  Can you edit the index and
the index entries?<br> <b>A:</b>  Yes.  The user maintains full control of
the final index.  An Entry Editor is provided as well as a utility to produce
specialized &quot;control lists.&quot; <p> <b>Q:</b>  Does Indexicon work
with FrameMaker?<br> <b>A:</b>  We are currently studying FrameMaker and plan
on producing an Indexicon product for it in the near future. <p> <b>Q:</b>
Does the user have control over the format of the final index?<br> <b>A:</b>
Yes.  The style of the index, including number of columns, etc., is
controlled through Word and WordPerfect's settings.  Indexicon will not override
any existing index styles.  We simply generate an index in the format specified
in the parent application.
<p>
<b>Q:</b>  How do I create an index for a master document or multiple file
projects using Indexicon with Microsoft Word?<br>
<b>A:</b>  Two ways:  <A HREF="REF_DOC.HTM">Reference Document Field (RD)</a> and <A HREF="MASTER.HTM">Master Document Field (MD).</a>
<p>
<b>Q:</b> How do I create an index for a master document or multiple file
projects using Indexicon with WordPerfect?<br>
<b>A:</b>  In WordPerfect, the only thing you can use is the <A
HREF="WPMASTER.HTM">Master Document Field (MD).</a>
<p>
<b>Q:</b> How do I include chapter numbers in the index using Microsoft Word or
WordPerfect?<br>
<b>A:</b> For <A HREF="CHAP_NUM.HTM">Microsoft Word.</a>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For <A HREF="WPCHAP.HTM">WordPerfect.</a>
<p>
<b>Q:</b> If I already have index marks within a document, how should I use
Indexicon with this document?<br>
<b>A:</b>  Prior to manually editing the index, try removing all of the previous
index tags and run Indexicon on the document to see what kind of output is generated.
If you wish to leave the previous index tags in the document, Indexicon will
not replace the tags with its own.  Your index tags will be left as is.  If
necessary, you may import any previous &quot;control lists&quot; you may have, then create
an unknown word list, and then create a lexicon from those.  After all of that, you can
edit the entries.
<p>
<b>Q:</b>  Does Indexicon work with Doc-to-Help? <br>
<b>A:</b>  Yes.  We recommend using Indexicon first, then running Doc-to-Help to
add entries that Indexicon did not add.  Doc-to-Help's indexing feature is
pretty memory intensive and you can save time by running Indexicon first to place
index entries.  Doc-to-Help will recognize our index tags and convert them
to K-footnotes.  However, beware of the Remove TOC Bookmarks command.  If you
choose this option, Doc-to-Help alters the index tags so that Indexicon's
Entry Editor does not recognize them.  WexTech is aware of the problem and has put
it on their bug list.
<p>
<b>Q:</b>  What if I don't want to index the entire document?<br>
<b>A:</b>  Indexicon comes with a feature called the Exclusion Zone editor that
allows you to designate certain parts of the document that you do not wish to have
indexed.
<p>
<b>Q:</b>  Does Indexicon work with PageMaker?<br>
<b>A:</b>  No.  Sorry.
<P>

<h3><em>Automatic online indexing of your word-processing or HTML documents, with
hyperlinks to key words, ideas, and phrases.</em></h3>
<p>
With the aid of WebAnchor software, any word processing document or online
document can now feature its own hypertext index.
<p>
Remarkably comprehensive, WebAnchor adds usability to all your
material, organizing documents and allowing for quick reference and
ease of access to information.
<p>
Once the WebAnchor software is installed, your documents can be organized
by an automatic three-step process:
<blockquote>
<h4>
<ol>
<li>WebAnchor <em>analyzes</em> the document.
<li>It then <em>inserts hypertext "anchors"</em> within the document.
<li>WebAnchor <em>indexes</em> your document - creating a complete
alphabetized page index.
</ol>
</h4>
</blockquote>
<b>That's it!</b>

<H1 align=center>Indexicon Review by Ann Cope</h1>
<hr width=80% align=center>

<blockquote>
The following Indexicon review was written by Ann Cope of the
Central Jersey Computer Club.  The Central Jersey Computer Club is comprised of over 1000
professional engineers, archivists, librarians, and indexers.  Because of her
many years of experience as the principle indexer for Lipincott medical books, Ann
Cope's views on indexing are well respected.  Ann gave a presentation of
Indexicon to a couple hundred members of the Central Jersey Computer Club
and the following piece is a summary of that presentation.

<h2>Presentation Summary of Indexicon</h2>
<b>by Ann Cope</b>
<BR>July 1996
<BR>Reprinted with permission.

<BR>
<P>

I have a love-hate relationship with Indexicon from Iconovex.  As you may
recall from a little over a year ago, I reviewed its version 1.0.  At that
time, I was amazed that a program could do most of what I had done as a
professional indexer.  Unfortunately, it did it much faster, with less user
tedium and at far less cost to the client.  Of course, I said the &quot;
unfortunately&quot; with tongue-in-cheek.  What had been highly paid, highly
skilled work by a small group of intelligent, dedicated professionals, now
was being made possible by just about anyone with a computer and either
WordPerfect for Windows or Microsoft Word.
<P>

Of course, this was not entirely true.  There still had to be a measure of
user intervention, especially when doing a level 6 (highest of the
multi-level in-context) index.  But we were impressed at how intuitive it
was and the degree of mastery with which it did perform.  Its indices were
far more useable than simply a typical computer index-every-word then sort
it index.  In fact, I was not impressed.  I was amazed and became an ardent
supporter of this product - that was MY competition.
<P>

But it had shortcomings, which secretly made me feel better.  After all,
this program still could not do all that I could as a professional indexer.
For example, version 1.0 could not customize its personal lexicon with
compound words.  Hence, you couldn't feed it many names (&quot;Admiral
Richard E. Byrd&quot;) nor pipe in previously made index entries that
contained compound entries on a single line.  This was a major advantage.

<P>

Well I am happy/unhappy with its new version 2.0.  It is faster the version
1 because of its converting some of the user files to program code.  It can
handle multiple lexicons at once or selectively exclude some.  There are two
different methods of modifying or making lexicons that add to the ability to
customize the outputted product.  You can give level of importance ratings
to all entries in a customized list or individualize each, as the case may
require.
<P>

The selections are more accessible.  Searching is more useful and generally
lesser tweaks seem to have enhanced the product across the board.  But the
great advancement seems to be in two areas.  One is crucial and the other
just is plain nice.
<P>

The most crucial advance that really threatens the future of us professional
indexers (thankfully I am close to retirement, so I can use it as a
freelancer and now REALLY enjoy indexing) is the giant leap to being able to
handle compound words in the customized lexicons.  It appears that a
compound string can have up to nine words.  So phrases such as &quot;Little
Bo Peep Pre-School Children Discount Shops&quot; now can be accommodated.
Now our old indices (less the pagination, of course) can be imported
verbatim as my template for subsequent indexing of the following volume in a
journal series.  Great!
<P>

The really nice other significant addition has nothing to do with the
software.  It has to deal with their customer support that only can be
described as customer-centered (what a refreshing change in computerdom).
They now have published documents that explain how we can manipulate
Indexicon or its helper program (e.g., WordPerfect 6.1) to do those things
we need done that require come guidance.  This would include how to use WP's
Master Document feature to compile and index where a document has multiple
parts.  They even have a document to aid compiling a cumulative index,
something we all crave to have made easier.  This parallels the excellence
of their manual that nicely explains with clarity and an absence of cute
siness rather complex topics and procedures.  Such an aspect of their
service alone is worth the support and encouragement.
<P>

A few gigs:  I know most of you didn't want to use WP 6.0.  Well now you
will have to not want to use WP 6.1.  The new version is incompatible with
the earlier WP version.  Fortunately, customized lexicons can be converted
for use under the new Indexicon.
<P>

A major ding still has to deal with how Indexicon handles proper nouns.
Parts of multiple proper nouns, when appearing alone (e.g., &quot;
Eisenhower,&quot; where it does not appear with &quot;Dwight David,&quot;
&quot;President&quot; or &quot;General&quot;), are overlooked by default.
This only can be rectified by importing each to-be overlooked singular
proper noun into a customized lexicon.  But that would require doing manual
macro index, which this program is supposed to obviate.  Why could we not
have the choice of turning on or off this &quot;feature,&quot; that is
locked off by default?
<P>

I just had an index job that had a critical person's name (&quot;Speed&quot;
) appear singularly a number of times in the text that should have been
indexed.  The author tended to use only last names after having introduced
characters.  But all further incidents of Lt. Speed's name were omitted by
Indexicon.  I had to manual redo the index to find every incidence of &quot;
Speed.&quot;
<P>

That would not have been required if I had originally entered &quot;Speed
&quot; as a noun always to be indexed in my customized lexicon.  Sure, there
would have been some entries that required deletion (such as when &quot;
Speed&quot; was used as a non-proper noun at the beginning of a sentence).
But that would have been far better than having to go back through the
document to find each occurrence of the proper noun.
<P>

So it isn't perfect, but my is it better.  And great, even with a few
blemishes that still would be nice to have corrected.  Let's see it in
action (do the demonstration by indexing a 150-page historical manuscript on
contemporary polar history).

<h2>Indexicon Review</h2>
<B>by Jeanie C. Crain</b>
<BR>Professor, English
<br>Missouri Western State College
<br>E-mail:  crain@griffon.mwsc.edu
<br>January 1996

<P>
.... Imagine being able to write your document before you begin worrying
about
 what items in it need to be flagged for inclusion in the Index.  Thanks
 to Indexicon, this is now possible.
<p>
 Indexicon (for Microsoft Word) enables automatic indexing:  to accomplish
 this, the program analyzes the document, finding and compiling the
 indexable terms automatically; Indexicon bases its choices on the context
 in which a word is used.  The wonder of the software is that properly
 installed, it appears as the last item under the Tools menu; when the
 document is loaded, the writer merely clicks on Indexicon to pull up a
 dialog box where a choice of options can be made, among these, Creating
 Index where the level of detail to be included allows a range from 1 Most
 Comprehensive to 6 Least Comprehensive. Other options include the index
 automatically, generate index at end of document, and monitor the
 process. In using Indexicon, I've discovered a conference-type paper (15
 pages) with a high level of detail and in the most comprehensive mode can
 be indexed in five to ten minutes; longer manuscripts involve more
 computer time. For a short paper, I  find myself setting the function to
 automatic and taking a coffee break; when I return, I complete finesse
 details and formatting. In minutes, I have a sharp, professional index.

<h3>
 Learning to Index Using Indexicon
</h3>
 The logic of the indexing process used in Indexicon is best seen in its
 own "Contents" and On-line Help.  Once Indexicon is installed, the user
 simply clicks on the submenu "Indexicon" under the main menu "Tools." The
 dialog box then enables a choice among options:  Create Index, Entry
 Editor, Exclusion Zones, LexEdit, About, Help, and Cancel.  Choosing Help
 brings up the Contents "Using Indexicon" :
<p>
 Tools<br>
 Contents<p>
 Using Indexicon<p>
 Main Menu<br>
 Indexing a Document<br>
 Level of Detail<br>
 Comparing Levels of Detail<br>
 Editing Index Entries<br>
 Exclusion Zones<br>
 Indexing  Part of a Document<br>
 Getting the Best Index<br>
 Tips and Troubleshooting<p>

 Getting Help, and thus learning Indexicon, is then as simple as clicking
 on "Indexing a Document" where we find the following information taken
 directly from the manual:<p>


 To use Indexicon's basic indexing features
<ol>
<li> Open the document you want to index.
<li> Choose Tools - Indexicon - Create Index.
<li> In the Create Index dialog box choose the level
 of detail you want your index to include, and the
 format for the page numbers in your index.  You
 can also set other options, mentioned below.
<li> Click on OK.
</ol>
 To demonstrate what an index generated in Indexicon looks like, we can
 actually click now on Indexicon in Tools and choose "Create Index."
 Having done this, we will see another dialog box and will have the
 following options:  Generate index at end of document, Monitor progress,
 Save the update during processing, Level of detail, Page number format,
 and Index.  For now, we will click on the first option to "Generate
 Index," wait a mere minute or so, and see a completed, comprehensive index:

<p>
 One has to marvel at this point at the completeness and ease with which
 Indexicon has generated an index.   We could at this point stop and
 become users of Indexicon, but looking closely at the above index, we
 probably would see immediately that we might want to add or change
 entries, remove some or all, add subentries, or change the appearance of
 text.  To accomplish this, we simply go back to our original dialog box
 and click  Entry Editor.
<h3>
 More Advanced Indexing</h3>
 The Entry Editor in Indexicon functions much like the Mark Entry dialogue
 box in the Insert-Index and Tables-Mark Entry section in Word under
 Insert. The familiar Find is used to locate index items; these can then
 be edited in any way the writer chooses.  Subentries can also be created
 for any index entry by simply entering Subentry.  For edits to be written
 to the document, the Update button needs to be clicked.  You may also
 cross reference entries by keyboarding in the "cross reference" box; when
 updated, the generated index will contain a cross reference rather than a
 page number.  It's really very easy to review and customize all index
 entries since the Entry Editor also permits movement from entry to entry
 with the click of  a button, using either ((  for back and  (( for
 forward.  Movement through entries can be monitored easily since all
 entries are machine marked symbols.  The real ease provided by Indexicon
 is, of course, that such markings are made automatically rather than
 manually.  Anyone using Word's  more cumbersome indexing program will
 love Indexicon.<p>

 Just as the index can easily be customized, so can the automatic indexing
 process exclude areas in the text for which no entry is wanted, zones
 such as Contents Tables of Authorities, tables, charts, graphs and so
 forth. Additionally, it is possible to index only part of a document by
 highlighting text and then generating an index.
<p>
 Finally, the best index is probably the one created and maintained for
 specific technical or specialized documents.  Here, the maintenance tool
 LexEdit is used.  LexEdit permits the creation of lexicons (defined as a
 list of words to which indexing value has been added) or the importing of
 text lists created in another text editor or word processor.  You can
 also transport your lexicons as straight text files for use in other
 programs. LexEdit allows for 17 syntax categories for indexing:
 adjective, adverb, geographical names, ing verb, ing verb/adjective, ing
 verb/noun, name acronyms and abbreviations, noun/adjective, past tense
 verb, plural noun, present tense verb, past tense verb/adjective, present
 tense verb/noun, personal names, singular nouns, subject acronyms and
 abbreviations. These indexing values are fairly straightforward and
 self-explanatory and also fairly complete and flexible.
<h3>
 Conclusion
</h3>
 If the purpose of computers and software is to make ordinary routines
 less work intensive, then Indexicon is one of the tools of the moment.
 One has to stack up Indexicon's retail price ($129)against its
 usefulness.  For professional writers of multiple and complex documents,
 Indexicon is a "not to be missed" tool.  It can in minutes make the
 writers look like hours were spent at the computer.  What I like about
 the automatic indexing is that it frees me to do the more important
 matter of generating internal text, knowing that I can worry about
 indexing at the appropriate time--after the document has been created,
 revised, and proofed.   As a tool, Indexicon is functions smoothly within
 Word for Windows; permits choice among only useful functions and
 features; provides clear WYSIWYG documentation on-line that is clear,
 helpful and complete; and strikes a useful tradeoff between automatically
 and edited indexes.  Since I'm a devoted Macintosh user, I can only hope
 that Indexicon will soon be available on this platform, also.

<p>
After Indexicon catches on, Captain Picard and the crew are probably going
to have to redefine "warp speed". This automatic indexer can index a 100-page
document in one minute -- or polish off an entire year's work of a
professional indexer in one hour.
<p>Talk about your endangered species.
<P>Fifteen years in the making, the software can read a document, locate
significant terms and
phrases, and generate a back-of-the-book-style index, all with the click
of a mouse.
<p>
For any doubters still out there, try this one
on for size: Indexicon has already been used to index the 1,300-page
North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) in 12
minutes.
<p>Plus, Indexicon can go beyond traditional indexing to "disambiguate" language
-- something that ordinarily should not be tried at home.  In essence,
this disambiguation function enables the software to determine when
"lead" is being used to describe a common metal, or to indicate that
followers are being taken in hand.

<p>Designed initially for
use with WordPerfect, the program can be customized within that word
processor to give special emphasis to words and phrases that a user
considers especially important. The result: an index that includes
user-generated entries, as well as those selected by
Indexicon.

<p><h2>Indexicon Indexes Documents

<p>
Indexicon for WordPerfect for Windows 6.0,
Version 1.0 ($149.99), is a smart but still-evolving word processor add-on
that makes creating indexes simple. This capablity makes long business
documents more useful and saves time and money for those creating
opuses.
<br>. . .
<br>The program generates an index by using its 55,000-word dictionary and
extensive set of rules for determining parts of speech and key concepts to
analyze each sentence and determine the most important words and phrases.
Indexicon's speed is impressive, particularly when compared with
professional indexers, who typically index between three and six pages per
hour. On a 33-MHz 486 with 16MB of RAM, Indexicon created an index for a
50-page, single-spaced document to three levels of detail in 6 minutes 30
seconds.
<p>While the result is generally an accurate and
thorough index, it requires polishing . . . But even with manual cleanup,
Indexicon took a fraction of the time and cost of professional indexing.

<h1 align=center>Indexicon Info World Review</h1>

<HR width=80% align=center>

<H2>Indexicon takes the pain out of indexing</h2>
<b>October 17, 1994</b>
<br>Reprinted with permission
<p>

Anyone who has ever tried to use Microsoft Corp. Word's
so-called "automatic" index-creation utility will immediately appreciate
Indexicon 1.0.
<P>
Iconovex Corp., which a couple of months ago shipped a
version of its indexing program for WordPerfect for Windows, has just
released a version for Word for Windows 6.0.
<P>
Indexicon's
installation routine places the program on Word's Tools menu for quick
access. And unlike Word's automatic indexing feature, Indexicon
does not require you to first create a separate concordance of index terms
before getting started. All you have to do is call up Indexicon, specify
the level of detail you want (on a scale from 1 to 6), and Indexicon takes
care of the rest.
<p>The program also provides pop-up tools for adding, deleting, or modifying
index terms and for excluding sections of your document from being indexed.

<TITLE>Indexicon Press Releases</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY><U>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</U>
<h3><center>ICONOVEX ANNOUNCES THE RELEASE OF INDEXICON 2.0 WITH NEW
     FEATURES FOR MORE VERSATILE INDEXING</center></h3>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Bloomington, MN -- Iconovex Corporation, leaders in intelligent
 abstracting software, today announced the release of Indexicon 2.0 for
 Microsoft Word 6.0 for Windows.  Indexicon is the first and only
 software that can actually read and understand the subtleties of the
 English language.  The software integrates into the tools menu, and
 allows users to create an automatic index at the click of a mouse,
 making quick work of the most daunting, time-consuming tasks.  Based
 on Iconovex's proprietary parsing technology, Indexicon uses
 syntactical rules and semantic weight-in-context -- not simple
 statistical calculations of word frequency -- to analyze document
 content, identify the significant words and phrases and build a
 back-of-the-book style index automatically.  With new features for
 added ease and user control, Indexicon can make indexing a document as
 easy as spellchecking.<P>  Indexicon 2.0 is much faster and more robust
        than its predecessor, and it creates indexes that are more
        complete and accurate.  Version 2.0 is especially improved in
        its handling of proper nouns and personal names.  New features
include a full-function Index Entry Editor which allows users to easily
find and modify and index entry and new paragraph-by-paragraph processing
which includes a built-in utility for creating and maintaining "control"
lists, terms that the user considers particularly important (or unimportant)
for indexing purposes.  Using control lists to alter the indexing
process, users can now automatically build indexes that reflect the
particular priorities of their own fields and specialties.<P>  "With the
addition of our full-function entry editor, we have created a versatile
tool that will fulfill everyone's indexing needs," says Bernardo
Sotomayor, vice president and general manager of Iconovex.  "Indexicon
2.0 can be used by the student who wants the ease of a fully automatic
indexer, yet it's a suitably sophisticated tool for the professional
writer who wants to control every detail of the final index." <P>
Indexicon 2.0 joins the Iconovex product line of natural language
processing programs which includes Syntactica, the parsing engine upon
which Indexicon is based, and AnchorPage, the only automatic indexing,
abstracting and hyperlinking software available for the World Wide Web.<P>
Indexicon 2.0 sells for $129 and is available through premiere resellers and
distributors.  A version for WordPerfect 6.1 will be available in
February, 1996.  Order direct by calling the Iconovex Corporation at (800)
943-0292 or by email <a
href="mailto:fyi@iconovex.com">fyi@iconovex.com</a>.  For a limited time,
free 30-day evaluation copies of Indexicon 2.0 are <A
HREF="http://dominion.iconovex.com">available for downloading</a>. The
Iconovex Corporation is a software development company and a wholly-owned
subsidiary of Innovex, Inc. (NASDAQ: INVX), the world's leading
manufacturer of lead-wire assemblies for the thin-film disk drive market.

<BODY><U>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</U>
<center><h3>NEW PRODUCT OFFERS FULLY AUTOMATIC INDEXING AT THE CLICK OF A MOUSE</h3></center>
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Bloomington, MN.  ICONOVEX Corporation announces the release of
Indexicon, the first fully automatic indexing software.   Currently
available in versions for WordPerfect for Windows, Microsoft Word
for Windows, and Microsoft Word for the Macintosh, Indexicon &quot;reads&quot;
the user's document, locates the significant terms and phrases,
and generates a back-of-the-book style index, all at the click of a
mouse.  Using syntactic and semantic analysis, Indexicon is able
to disambiguate language; it can distinguish, for instance, when
the term &quot;lead&quot; means to take followers in hand and
when that same term refers to the common metal.
<P>
&quot;Indexicon
produces a fully detailed, comprehensive index every time,&quot;says
Robert Griggs, vice president of sales and marketing for ICONOVEX.
 &quot;And it's so fast and easy to use that no one who creates
or manages documents will ever again consider a significant document
complete until it has an index.&quot;
<P>
Indexicon is fully automatic.
 Other indexing products require that the user painstakingly review
documents line by line and mark index entries manually, or create
a concordance file from which an index can be built. With Indexicon,
the user simply sets the level of detail he or she prefers, and
the software does the rest.  A chore that would page two take hours of
tedious effort if done manually, can now be done in a few minutes
with no effort at all. Indexicon integrates seamlessly with
WordPerfect 6.0, Microsoft Word and MS Word for Mac.  Once installed,
it becomes an item on the Tools menu with its own cascading submenu of options.
And because it's fully integrated, Indexicon allows the user to take advantage of the
other word processing features to control the shape and even the
content of the final index.  The user indicates formatting preferences
in the Define Index dialog box.  Content can be controlled through
Indexicon's adjustable level of detail or by using Indexicon in
conjunction with the manual indexing features.  The user can,
for instance, mark several terms or phrases she wishes to give
emphasis, then run Indexicon on the document.  The resulting index
will include the usergenerated entries as well as Indexicon's
selections.
<p>
Indexicon costs $249 and is available through a network
of resellers or direct at 1-800-943-0292.
<p>
The ICONOVEX Corporation is a software development company and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of INNOVEX, Inc., the world's leading manufacturer
of lead-wire assemblies for the thin film disk drive market.

<Blockquote>This is a demostration of how Indexicon works.  The screen shots
are taken from Indexicon 2.0 for Microsoft Word 6.0.
<P>
All you need to do before running Indexicon is open the document you wish to
index.  You dont need to build any control lists or concordance files;
Indexicon doesnt create an index by searching for a particular word and
"tagging" every instance of that word.  Indexicon actually reads your
document and chooses what terms to index based on their context within a
paragraph.</blockquote>

<P>This is how comprehensive you want your index to be.  Level 1 is most
comprehensive and it will contain <I>all </I>of the indexable terms in the
document; Level 6 includes the most significant indexable terms.  Levels
2 through 5 represent relative increments in between.

<A NAME="E7E1899"></A>
<P><B><I>Personal Names</I></B><P ALIGN=CENTER>
<P>This option is on by default, meaning Indexicon will index most personal
names and rotate the name around the last name.  When the checkbox is not

part of a larger proper noun or noun phrase that should be in the index.

<A NAME="E7E1902"></A>
<P><B><I>Geographical Names</I></B><P ALIGN=CENTER>
<P>This option is off by default, meaning that Indexicon will suppress most
geopolitical names (cities, states, and nations) that it recognizes, when they
stand alone, but include topographical names (lakes and mountains) it
recognizes in the index.

<A NAME="E7E1905"></A>
<P><B><I>Lexicons</I></B><P ALIGN=CENTER>
<P>This button opens a dialog where you can activate lexicons you have
created with <a href="LEXEDIT2.HTM">LexEdit</a>.  Values you have assigned to
words in <I>your</I> lexicons will override values for those words in the
primary lexicon; this way you can alter how Indexicon makes its indexing decisions.

<A NAME="E7E1908"></A>
<P><B><I>Unknowns</I></B><P ALIGN=CENTER>
<P>This button opens a dialog where you can instruct Indexicon to create a
list of words it did not recognize during processing.  This list can then be
imported into LexEdit, where you can assign values
and grammatical information to those unrecognized words.

<blockquote>
<P>Here we provide samples of indexes produced with Indexicon.  In order to
give you an accurate idea of Indexicon's capabilities, we have indexed each
of the documents at several different levels of comprehensiveness (Indexicon
provides 6 levels). No entries have been manually added to the index, though
some entries have been edited and some others removed, so you should be able
to get a clear picture of the type of information that Indexicon will index
automatically.  If this were a professional index, we would of course add
other entries for topics that Indexicon missed or for topics that aren't
mentioned literally in the text.
<P>
In each case we attempt to provide a fair estimate of how much time was
involved in the whole process.  These indexes were produced using Indexicon
2.0 for Microsoft Word 6.0, on a 486 with 16 RAM.

<P>The first set of sample indexes were created from document on
oceanography (3,507 words), indexed at <A HREF="SAMPLE1.HTM#s1lev1">Level
1</A>, <A HREF="SAMPLE1.HTM#s1lev3"> Level 3</A>, and <A
HREF="SAMPLE1.HTM#s1lev5">Level 5</A>.

<P>The second set of indexes were created from a document excerpt on
photography (6,658 words), indexed at <A HREF="SAMPLE2.HTM#s2lev1">Level
1</A>, <A HREF="SAMPLE2.HTM#s2lev3"> Level 3</A>, and <A
HREF="SAMPLE2.HTM#s2lev5">Level 5</A>. </blockquote>

<TITLE>Reference Document for Microsoft Word</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY bgcolor="#ffffff" link="#ooooff" vlink="#663399">

<H1><center>Reference Document (RD) Field</H1></center>

<center><B>(Microsoft Word)</B></center>
<P>
The Reference Document (RD) field allows you to indicate which files you
wish to include when you are creating a table of contents, table of
authorities, or an index.
<P>
If you have a number of separate documents that you wish to include into
<EM>one</EM> comprehensive index, you can use the RD field to select which
documents you want in the comprehensive index.  Each of these individual
files must contain index fields (Indexicon must be run on each of them.  For
better results, do not check the Generate Index at end of Document box).
<P>
<H2>How To</h2>
<h3>Use Reference Document (RD) field with Indexicon:</h3>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Run Indexicon on the series of documents that you wish to create an
index for.  Do not, for efficiency, generate an index at the end of any of
the documents (Do not place a check in the Generate Index at end of Document
box)</li>
<p>
<li>Open the document in which you want the index to appear and scroll to the
end of the document.</li>
<P>
<li>Select <B>Insert--Field </B>from the Word menu at the top.</li>
<P>
<li>Select the <B>Index and Tables </B>from the Categories box and <B>RD</B>
from the Field Names box.</li>
<P>
<li>Modify the <B>RD</B> field by clicking your cursor next to the <B>RD</B>
in the Field Codes text box and typing in the filename of the document you
wish to include.  If you include a path to the filename, you must double all
of the back-slashes in the path (i.e., c:\\winword\\docs\\paper1.doc).
<P>
<b>Note:</b>  The Reference Document field appears in your document as hidden text,
so you will not be able to actually see the field unless you click on the
Show\Hide Paragraph button on the tool bar.
<P>
<li>Since you can only reference one document at a time, you must repeat
steps <B>3-5</B> for <EM>each</EM> document/file that you wish to include in
the comprehensive index.</li>
<P>
<li>Once all of your files have been referenced, make sure that your cursor
is at the very end of the document (after the references) and select <B>
Insert--Index and Tables </B>from the Word menu at the top.</li>
<P>
<li>Choose the <B>Index </B>option (you can change the &quot;style&quot; of
the index in this dialog if you would like) and click <B>OK</B>.</li>
<P>
<li>An index will be generated for all of the documents listed in the <B>RD
</B> field.</li>
</ol>

<P>
<BR>
<h3>Number Pages Continuously with Reference Document</h3>
<P>
You can instruct Word to number your pages continuously in Reference
Document, but you will have to set several options.
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Open the first document that will be indexed (the document that will
begin with page 1) and then choose <B>Insert--Page Numbers</B>.</li>
<P>
<LI>Click <B>Format</B> and in the Page Number Format dialog, make sure that
Page Numbering is set to start at 1.</li>
<P>
<li>Click <B>OK</B> and save your document.</li>
<P>
For <EM>all</EM> remaining documents, you must calculate where page
numbering will begin and then manually set the Page Numbering to start
there.  For example, if the first document is 5 pages long, you must open
the second document and then follow steps <B>1-2</B>, but set the Page
Numbering to begin at 6.  Repeat this process for the remainder of the
documents in the set.
<P>
After all of your page numbering is complete, follow the instructions for
the Reference Document field to include the documents in your index (be sure
to reference the documents in the order that you set in the page numbering).
If you have already generated an index with RD,  make sure that the
documents are referenced in the order that you set the page numbering and
update the index (<B>F9</B>).
</ol>

<BR><P>
<h3>Make each Document a Chapter and Include the Chapter Number in the
Index</h3>
<P>
Like with continuous page numbers, you must manually mark each
document as a chapter and then choose to include it in your index in the
appropriate order.
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Open the first document in the set and type in a desired chapter title
at the top in Heading 1 form.  Now choose <B>Format--Heading Numbering</B>.</li>
<P>
<LI>Choose the chapter style you want and then click <B>Modify</B>.</li>
<p>
<li>At the Modify Heading Numbering dialog, choose what kind of text you want to
appear before the chapter heading, whether you want the chapters to be
bulleted or numbered, what text you want after the chapter heading, and
where to begin the chapter numbering.  (Since we want each document to be a
separate chapter, do not place a check in the Restart Numbering at Each New
Section box).  When you are finished, click <B>OK</B>.</li>
<P>
<LI>Choose <B>Insert--Page Numbers</B>.</li>
<P>
<LI>At the Page Numbers dialog, choose where you want the page numbers to
appear in the Position text box and where you want them aligned in the
Alignment text box.  You can place a check in the Show Number on First Page
box if you wish to display a page number on the first page of a document or
section.</li>
<P>
<LI>When finished, click <B>Format</B>.</li>
<P>
<LI>In the Page Format dialog, place a check in the Include Chapter Number
box and select what heading style to use for the chapter titles (in this
case, heading 1) and what separator you want to use (hyphen, colon, etc.).
Under Page Numbering, select Start at: 1 (since this is the first document
in the set).  When you are finished, click <B>OK</B>.</li>
<p>
<li>Now save the document and then close it.</li>
<P>
<LI>Now open the next document that will be referenced and included in the
index.  Follow steps <B>1-8</B>, but select the appropriate starting chapter
and page number.</li>
<p>
-- In the Modify Heading Numbering dialog, make sure to choose the right
chapter number to start at (Start at 2 for the second document title, Start
at 3 for the third document title, etc.).
<p>
-- In the Page Number Format dialog, make sure that under Page Numbering, you
select the appropriate page that you want the page numbering to begin on
(i.e., if you want continuous page numbering and document one is 5 pages long
and document two is 5 pages long, you should begin page numbering for document
three at 11).  However, if you want page numbers to restart at 1 for each new
chapter/document, you must open each document and set the page numbering to
start at 1.
<p>
<li>After all of your chapter and page numbering is complete, follow the
instructions for the Reference Document field to include the chapter numbers
in your index (be sure to reference the documents in the order that you set
in the chapter and page numbering).  If you have already generated an index
with RD,  make sure that the documents are referenced in the order that you
set the chapter and page numbering and update the index (<B>F9</B>).</li>

<TITLE>Master Document for Microsoft Word</TITLE>
</HEAD>

<BODY bgcolor="#ffffff" link="#ooooff" vlink="#663399">

<center><h1>Master Documents</center></h1>
<center></B></I><B>(Microsoft Word)</B><B><I></center>
<P>

</B></I>Some might wish to combine two or more related Word documents in
order to create one comprehensive index.  One of the ways that they can
accomplish this is through Master Documents.  A Master Document is
essentially a container for subdocuments.  Master Document can be used along
with Indexicon to produce a comprehensive index for several documents.
Therefore, when an index is generated, a comprehensive index is considered
for the ENTIRE Master Document (all subdocuments included).
<P>
<h2>How To</h2>

<h3>Insert existing Word documents into a Master Document:</h3>

<P> <OL>
<LI>Open a new document in Word. (<B>File--New</B>) Use the &quot;<B>Normal
</B>&quot; template.<br></li> <p> <LI>Choose <B>View--Master</B>
<B>Document</B>.</li> <p> <li>Type in the &quot;title&quot; of each document
that you wish to include in your Master Document and press <B>Enter</B> after
each one.  For example, if you are including three documents in your Master
Document (one about baseball, one about space, and one about computers), type
in a &quot;title &quot; for each of those documents and press enter after
each one.  These titles can be generic (Baseball, Space, Computers) since
they are only &quot;placeholders&quot; that signify new subdocuments.</li>
<P> -- Word uses built-in heading styles when it creates subdocuments.  Use
these styles when you are entering the &quot;titles&quot; of your
subdocuments. For example, type each <EM>document</EM> title in Heading 1
form and Word will create a new subdocument at every Heading 1. <P>
<LI>Highlight all of the &quot;titles&quot; that you wish to designate as
subdocuments and include in your Master Document.  Click the <B>Create
Subdocument</B> button on the Master Document toolbar.  Make sure that the
first heading selected is the heading level you want Word to use at the
beginning of each subdocument.</li> <p> <LI>Once your Master Document
&quot;template&quot; is finished with all of the headings established, choose
a name for the document and save it. </li> <P> <b>Now you can begin inserting
any subdocuments&#133;..</b> <P> <LI>Position your cursor where you wish to
add an existing document (usually underneath the appropriate subdocument
title).</li> <p> <LI>On the Master Document toolbar, click the <B>Insert
Subdocument</B><I> </I>button.</li> <p> <li>A file chooser will appear where
you can select the document you wish to insert.</li> <P> --You must repeat
steps <B>7-9</B> for <EM>each</EM> subdocument you wish to include. <P>
<LI>You may not actually see the text of the subdocument after you insert
it.  You can open the subdocument <EM>within</EM> the Master Document in two
ways:</li>
<p>
a.) Place the cursor in the subdocument title and click on the Expand button on
the Master Document tool bar (+).<br>
b.) Double-click the Expand button (+) found directly to the left of the
subdocument title.
<P>
<b>Note:</b>  If the text of your document is maximized after you insert it, you
can minimize it by clicking the Collapse button (-).
<P>
<li>To open any subdocument in a different window, you can click the
Subdocument icon at the far left of the subdocument title.</li>
<P>
<LI>Switch to Normal view (<B>View--Normal</B>) and run Indexicon (<B>
Tools--Indexicon</B>) on the Master Document and a comprehensive index will be generated for the entire
document (subdocuments included).
<P>
-- It is important to realize that the page numbers are generated in the
order in which the subdocuments are inserted in the Master Document.
For example, if you first inserted a 10-page document about &quot;
computers&quot; and then inserted a 10-page document on &quot;cars,&quot;
the document related to computers will be numbered from 1-10 (since it was
the first document inserted) and the document related to cars will be
numbered 10-20.  Individual documents are still maintained separately
as well as being in the Master Document.  You can open individual
subdocuments from within the Master Document or from within the
directory the subdocument was originally stored.
</ol>
<BR><P>

<h3>Include Chapter Numbers in the Index with MD</h3>
<P>
In order to have chapter numbers included in the index, you must
first switch to Normal view (<B>View--Normal</B>) and then follow these
instructions:
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Choose <B>Format--Heading Numbering</B>.</li>
<p>
<li>At the Heading Numbering dialog, choose the desired style you want your
chapter titles to appear as and click <B>Modify</B>.</li>
<P>
<li>At the Modify Heading Numbering dialog, choose what kind of text you
want to appear before the chapter heading, whether you want the chapters to
be bulleted or numbered, what text you want after the chapter heading, and
where to begin the chapter numbering.  Placing a check in the Restart
Numbering at Each New Section box will restart chapter numbering at 1 for
each designated section (sections must be divided with a section break).</li>
<P>
<LI>At the Level text box, you are able to assign heading levels to your
chapters.  For example, you choose which heading level you want Word to
designate a new chapter.  If you choose Heading 1 as a chapter style, Word
will assume that each Heading 1 is the start of a new chapter, etc..  For
example, if you want each subdocument to be a new chapter, make sure that
the heading level for your chapter style matches that of your subdocuments.
When you are finished, click <B>OK</B>.
<P>
<LI>Choose <B>Insert--Page Numbers</B>.</LI>
<P>
<LI>At the Page Numbers dialog, choose where you want the page numbers to
appear in the Position text box and where you want them aligned in the
Alignment text box.  You can place a check in the Show Number on First Page
box if you wish to display a page number on the first page of a document or
section.</LI>
<P>
<LI>When finished, click <B>Format</B>.</LI>
<P>
<LI>In the Page Number Format dialogue, place a check in the <B>Include
Chapter Number </B>box and select what heading style to use for the chapter
titles (heading 1, heading 2, etc.) and what separator you want to use
(hyphen, colon, etc.).  Under Page Numbering, you select whether you want
page numbering to begin on the first page or to continue from a previous
section.  You may select any other page if you wish to begin on a page other
than 1.  When finished, click <B>OK</B>.</LI>
<P>
-- This may alter the previous page numbering scheme in your original Master
Document, particularly if you choose to restart numbering at each new
section.
<P>
<LI>If you wish to have page numbers restart at each new section, you must
separate each section with a section break (if you haven't already).  Now
click your cursor into each section and then select <B>Insert--Page Numbers
--Format</B> again and set Page Numbering to start at 1.  You must click <B>
OK</B> each time you set Page Numbering to start at 1 for the changes to
occur.  This must be done for each section in order for page numbers to
restart at every new section.
<P>
<LI>Now run Indexicon on the document.</LI>

A master document is a file that contains links to subdocuments, or other
files. With this feature you can easily organize and more quickly work with
larger documents because you can open and edit portions of the document
rather than the entire document.
<P>
If you are working with a large document you may choose to use WordPerfect's
Master Document feature so you can break up the file into more managable
pieces, perhaps by chapter or section. You can also use this feature create
a comprehensive index for several documents, without having to merge all the
portions of a document into one file.

If you wish to expand your subdocuments into the master document, do so
before generating the index.<B> </B>After expanding the documents, place the
cursor where you want the index to appear and continue with #4 in the
previous instructions.<B> </B>If you leave your subdocument files open when

expanded into the master document during generation, possibly placing the
index at a location other than the end of the document.
<P>

<center><H3>Page Formatting in the Index</H3></center>

WordPerfect will use the same page formatting in the index as defined in the
Page Numbering dialog box. If you are generating an index in a master
document, WordPerfect will, by default, use the same page numbering format,
but will not include chapter numbers. See <I>Including Chapter Numbers in a
WordPerfect Index</I> for instructions on including chapter numbers in the
index.

<center><B>(Microsoft Word)</B></center>
<P>
There are some basic procedures that need to be followed in order to have
chapter numbers included along with page numbers within your index.  First
and foremost, it should be noted that  chapter numbers can only appear in an
index when they are actually printed in the document (the chapters must be
physically labeled).  The process has two main steps.  You must first mark
chapter headings within the text and, after the appropriate headings have
been designated as chapter titles, you then can instruct Word to include
those chapter titles as part of the page numbering format.  These procedures
need to be taken prior to running Indexicon, or Indexicon needs to be re-run
after these steps have been taken.
<P>
<b>To include chapter number along with your page numbers in the index:</b>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Choose <B>Format--Heading Numbering</B>.</li>
<p>
<li>At the Heading Numbering dialog, choose the desired style you want your
chapter titles to appear as and click <B>Modify</B>.</li>
<P>
<li>At the Modify Heading Numbering dialog, choose what kind of text you
want to appear before the chapter heading, whether you want the chapters to
be bulleted or numbered, what text you want after the chapter heading, and
where to begin the chapter numbering.  Placing a check in the Restart
Numbering at Each New Section box will restart chapter numbering at 1 for
each designated section (sections must be divided with a section break).</li>
<P>
<LI>At the Level text box, you are able to number different heading levels
within any given chapter.  For example, you may want to apply a specific
numbering pattern to all Heading 2 styles in your document.  This feature
will allow you to do that.  When you are finished, click <B>OK</B>.</li>
<P>
<LI>Choose <B>Insert--Page Numbers</B>.</li>
<P>
<LI>At the Page Numbers dialog, choose where you want the page numbers to
appear in the Position text box and where you want them aligned in the
Alignment text box.  You can place a check in the Show Number on First Page
box if you wish to display a page number on the first page of a document or
section.</li>
<p>
<li>When finished, click <B>Format</B>.</li>
<p>
<li>In the Page Number Format dialogue, place a check in the <B>Include
Chapter Number </B>box and select what heading style to use for the chapter
titles (heading 1, heading 2, etc.) and what separator you want to use (
hyphen, colon, etc.).  Under Page Numbering, you select whether you want
page numbering to begin on the first page or to continue from a previous
section.  You may select any other page if you wish to begin on a page other
than 1.  When finished, click <B>OK</B>.</li>
<P>
<li>If you wish to have page numbers restart at each new section, you must
separate each section with a section break (if you haven't already).  Now
click your cursor into each section and then select <B>Insert--Page Numbers
--Format</B> again and set Page Numbering to start at 1.  You must click <B>
OK</B> each time you set Page Numbering to start at 1 for the changes to
occur.  This must be done for each section in order for page numbers to
restart at every new section.</li>
<P>
<li>Now run Indexicon on the document.</li>
<P>
<li>When you are finished running Indexicon, place your cursor at the end
of the document and select <B>Insert--Index and Tables</B>.  Click <B>Index
</B>, choose the desired index format and settings, and click <B>OK</B>.</li>
<P>
<li>An index will be generated with chapter numbers included along with
page numbers.</li>

<CENTER><H1>Including Chapter Numbers in the Index</H1></center>
<center><b>(WordPerfect)</center></b>
<P>
If you are creating a large document, you may wish to include chapter in the
index so your readers can quickly and easily find the information they need.
There are two steps you need to perform to ensure you get the type of page
numbering you desire in the index: (1) define the appropriate chapter
numbers in the document or documents, and (2) indicate the page numbering
you want WordPerfect to use in the index.
<P>
<H3>Defining Chapter Numbers in a Document</H3>

In order for WordPerfect to generate an index with chapter numbers, these
chapter numbers must be defined in the document or documents, though the
page numbers themselves need not reflect the chapter numbers.
<P>
<B>To insert chapter numbers into a document:</B>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>Open the document (or subdocument) to which you want to apply chapter
numbering.</LI>
<p>
<LI>Place the cursor at the very beginning of the document or the page where
you want to begin a new chapter. </li>
<p>
<LI>Select <B>Format -- Page -- Numbering</B>.</li>
<p>
<LI>In the Page Numbering dialog, click <B>Value</B>.</li>
<p>
<LI>In the Numbering Value dialog box, indicate the Chapter Number under
Chapter Settings.If you wish, you can also insert the chapter number into
the document by marking Insert and Display at Insertion Point. Keep in mind
that this will insert the page number <I>exactly</I> at the insertion point.</li>
<p>
<LI>Click <B>OK</B>.</li>
<p>
<LI>Click <B>OK</B> to return to your document.</li>
<p>
<LI>Apply chapter numbers in the same manner throughout the document or to
each subdocument you have.</li>
</OL>
<H3>Defining the Page Numbering for the Index</H3>

WordPerfect will, by default, use the same page number formatting in the
index as you applied to your documents. If you are generating an index in a
master document, WordPerfect will, by default, use the same page numbering
format as in the subdocuments, but will not include chapter numbers.
<P>
<B>To change the page type and formatting in the index:</b>
<P>
<OL>
<LI>If you are changing an existing index, place the cursor at the beginning
of the index or somewhere within the index.</li>
<p>
<LI>Choose <B>Tools -- Index</B>.</li>
<p>
<LI>On the Index feature bar, click <B>Define</B>.</li>
<p>
<LI>In the Define Index dialog, click <B>Page Numbering</B>.</li>
<p>
<LI>In the Page Number Format dialog box, you can indicate whether you want
to use the page number format used in the document (or subdocuments) or
define a different format for the index.
<UL>
<LI>By marking Document Page Number Format, WordPerfect will use the page
number format you defined in the Page Numbering dialog box in your document.
If you are generating an index for a master document, WordPerfect will you
use the format defined in each subdocument. You will need to define your
own, user-defined page number format if you want to include chapter numbers.</li>

<LI>Mark User-Defined Page Number Format to specify an different numbering
format for the index. Use the Insert drop down list to insert the page
number codes you want to use in your page numbers. For example, if you want
the chapter number displayed with the page number, you would click Insert
and select Chapter Number. You can type in any other text or you want to
appear with the index page numbers, like a hyphen to separate the chapter
and page numbers.</li>
</UL>
<p>
<LI>Click <B>OK</B>.</li>
<p>
<LI>In the Define Index box, click <B>OK </B>to return to your document.</li>
<p>
<LI>To regenerate your index, place the cursor anywhere in the index and
press <B>Ctrl + F9</B>.</li>

<h3><center>Product Overview</center></h3>
<P>
<blockquote>
<B>EchoSearch</B>
<br>
EchoSearch&#153;, our second award-winning product, is the first search
accelerator that allows you to search the web faster, smarter, and easier.
It uses multiple search engines and our proprietary linguistic analysis to
select and prioritize the most relevant hits for your review.  You no longer
have to pull up list after list of hits that are unrelated to your search.
These <I>Qualified Results</I> are then presented to you in a hyperlinked
format that very easily allows you to navigate the documents most relevant
to your search.  EchoSearch searches on <I>ideas</I> not just words.
<P>

<B>
AnchorPage</B>
<br>

The award-winning AnchorPage&#174;, from Iconovex, is the only automatic
hypertext indexing and abstracting software to use true linguistic analysis
to extract the significant phrases, concepts, and ideas from HTML documents.
This linguistic analysis allows individuals to organize large amounts of
information quickly, efficiently, and reliably into four different
organizational views of the information (Table of Contents, Phrase, Concept,
and Summary Views).  By applying the rules of the English language and
analyzing the individual words in their context, AnchorPage is able to
&quot;read&quot; and understand documents and provide concise synopsis or
summary of the information contained within.  AnchorPage automatically
organizes information on your internal or external Web sites while easing
the frustration users experience in locating specific information.
AnchorPage also decreases the amount of system resources used by search
engines.
<P>

<B>Indexicon</B>
<br>
For single document users, ICONOVEX released a shrink-wrapped version of
the Syntactica technology,  Indexicon, priced at $129, is the only fully
automatic indexing software.  Indexicon finds key terms within a document,
then builds a Back-of-the-Book style index which displays those key terms
alphabetically and by page number.  Its ease of use and seamless integration
are making Indexicon a big hit with end users.  ICONOVEX Corporation is
currently shipping Indexicon for Windows versions of WordPerfect 6.1,
Microsoft Word 6.0 and Word 7.0 available through our premiere network of
resellers or call us directly.
<P>

<B>
Syntactica Web API (SWAPI)</B>
<br>

The Syntactica Web API (SWAPI) is a C language interface to a library that
enables client applications to perform linguistic analysis of data and HTML
based documents while automatically hyperlinking the various forms of
linguistic output back to the original source data. The available linguistic
outputs are Indexes, Concepts, Summary, and Table of Contents. The
hyperlinking is done using standard HTML 2.0 conventions and can be read by
any HTML 2.0 compliant browser.
<P>

The primary goals of SWAPI are to:
<P>

<UL>
<LI> Provide a high level API to perform linguistic analysis, hyperlinking
and formatting on HTML and other data<p>
<LI> Provide flexibility and ease of use to SWAPI Client Application
developers<p>
<LI> Be functionally equivalent across all platforms
</UL>
<p>
SWAPI is built as a layer of abstraction over the Syntactica API (SAPI).
SAPI is a lower level interface to Syntactica - ICONOVEX's parsing and
linguistic analysis engine.
<P>

<B>Syntactica API (SAPI)</B><B> </B>
<P>

The Syntactica API (SAPI) is a C language interface to a library that
enables client applications to perform linguistic analysis of ASCII data and
automatically produce four different linguistic outputs; Indexes, Concepts,
and Summary.  SAPI is similar to SWAPI discussed above, but is a lower level
interface to Syntactica - Iconovex's proprietary parsing and linguistic
analysis engine.  SAPI permits the OEMs to integrate at a lower level and
have the ability to fine tune the analysis engine.

<p>
<a name="problem"><h2>The Problem:  Too Many Words, Not Enough Facts</h2>

<p>The Web is hot.  Carefully designed home pages with bright graphics are hot.  Real-time
multimedia and animated anything are hot.  But as much as we may like the fancy interfaces and
the glitzy toys, the real business of the Web is information exchange, and the vast bulk of that
information is in the form of text.</p>

<p>Which brings us to the problem: the sheer volume of information available on the Web is
overwhelming, and finding the particular fact youre looking for on a particular day can be pretty
frustrating.  You know its probably out there somewhere, but you just cant seem to locate it.  In
short, the information is available, but its not accessible.</p>

<p>For most users the only available solution is the search engine, and this probably works well
enough for casual searches on simple subjects.  If youre casually interested in volcanoes, you
can enter that term in most search engines and get back a list of sites that mention volcanoes,
though of course some of these hits will be only passing references and one might refer to a
midget football league team in Arizona.  But you wont discover that until after youve
downloaded the page that showed up in the search engines hit list as Arizonas Famous
Volcanoes.</p>

<p>The problem here is that most search engines depend on some form of inverted index, a simple
table of words and their locations with no information about context or meaning.  Search engines
find words, not facts.</p>

<p>The solutionwhether youre building a product for the Internet or a corporate Intranet, whether
for the end-user hunting for information or for the Webmaster who wants to make information
more accessible to end-usersis the unique combination of Natural Language Processing and
hypertext-linking technology found in the Syntactica Web API.</p>

<a name="technology"><h2>SWAPI Technology</h2></a>


<p>SWAPIs consists of three basic functions:  analysis of the text, creation of hypertext links
within that text, and for those who wish to work at the file level rather than the stream level, the
production of hyperlinked output pages.</p>

<ul><li>Natural Language Processing is used to analyze the text and extract significant concepts
from it.  These concepts are used as a basis for producing four different representational
views of the texts principal ideas: a keyword index, a concept index, a full-text summary,
and a table of contents based on headings.
<li>SWAPIs  hypertext technology links the entries in each of these representational views with
their source in the original text.
<li>At the file level, SWAPI builds hyperlinked pages for each of the representational views.
Each of these views can be used to present the end-user with a logical and coherent mode of
hypertext access to the information within the text.</ul>

<p>These three elements of the technology are discussed in detail in the sections that follow.</p>

<center><h3>Natural Language Processing</h3></center>

<p>The Syntactica engine, the linguistic processing technology at the heart of SWAPI, relies
exclusively on Natural Language Processing for textual analysis.  It does not use word frequency
counts or any other form of statistical analysis of textual composition.  Instead, syntactic rules
and semantic weights are used to determine the significant concepts within the text.  Each word
in these concepts is checked against Syntacticas primary lexicon of 130,000+ words and
assigned a preliminary semantic value.  Then the syntax of each concept is analyzed to determine
the relative importance of its constituent elements.  Finally, all this semantic and syntactical
information is combined to determine the overall importance of the concept.</p>

<p>The term nuclear power plants, for instance, would receive roughly twice as much value if it
were the primary subject of a sentence as opposed to a direct object.  It would receive even less
value if it appeared in a subordinated clause, and less still if in some sort of parenthetic
statement.  The following examples illustrate the importance of using this contextual information
when evaluating content.</p>

<p><i><b>As a subject:</b></i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Nuclear power plants in the Northeast are responsible for 80% of Canadas acid rain.</p>

<p><i><b>As an object:</b></i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Stricter environmental laws regulating radioactive waste have affected nuclear power
plants throughout the U.S.<p>

<p><i><b>As a parenthetic element:</b></i><br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Large-scale public works projects in the Soviet Union, such as dams, airports, and
nuclear power plants, have inevitably been plagued by shoddy workmanship and inferior
materials.</p>

<p>Clearly, the importance of the term nuclear power plants varies considerably with its context.
The Syntactica engine is designed to recognize this contextual difference and to take it into
account when determining which elements in a document are most significant for summarizing
its meaning .  The analysis emphasizes ideas, not isolated words, and this is what most clearly
separates Syntactica processing from the search engine approach.  No matter how complex the
statistical algorithm or how complicated the matrix, inverted indexes are simply lists of words.</p>


<center><h3>Hypertext Linking</h3></center>

<p>By the end of the analysis process, SWAPI has extracted the information it needs to build an
index, a concept index, a summary, and a table of contents for the processed text as well as
locators (primarily byte-offset) that point to the places in the text where the output entries
originated.  In other words, if the first example sentence above caused an index entry Nuclear
power plants to be generated, SWAPI would also have the byte-offset of the first character in
that term and would therefore be able to locate the precise segment of text that generated the
entry.  This information is used to enable the hypertext linkage between the various output
entries and their source locations in the original text.</p>

<p>SWAPI assigns a unique code to each output entry, the final letter of which indicates whether the
entry belongs to the index, concept index, summary, or table of contents.  Using the byte-offset,
SWAPI then writes a fully formatted destination anchor (which includes this code as a name
attribute) in the original text to indicate the location of the term (or concept, etc.) that generated
the entry.  In the above example, the destination anchor might appear as:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;a name=2222222222i&gt;Nuclear power plants in the Northeast are responsible . . .</p>

<p>The corresponding source anchor would appear in the index, and might look like this:</p>

<p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&lt;a href=filename.txt#2222222222i&gt;Nuclear power plants&lt;/a&gt;</p>

<p>All the application engineer needs to do is add the destination filename to the source anchor and
the hypertext link will be complete.  Each entry in the index (or concept index, etc.) will become
a source anchor and will be linked to the location in the original text that generated it.</p>

<p>Depending on the options selected, SWAPI will also generate the source and destination anchors
needed for circular or horizontal linking.  These options are described in detail later in this
document.</p>


<center><h3>Creation of Output Pages</h3></center>

<p>For the application engineer who prefers to work at the file level, SWAPI will create 5 files, one
for each of the primary outputsindex, concept index, summary, and table of contentsand a
fifth file containing a copy of the original text with the destination anchors already inserted.  The
primary output files can be generated as raw data, relying on the application engineer to format
the output as he or she chooses, or they can be generated in preformatted HTML, ready for the
browser.  The following paragraphs describe this preformatted output.</p>

<p><i><b>Index:</b></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;The index is an alphabetized list of key terms hyperlinked to the location where they
occur in the original text.  (In fact, it is a copy of the original text, but this will be transparent to
your end-user.)  At the top of the page is an alphabetical navigation bar which allows the user to
jump to the desired section of the index.  Below the alphabetical bar is another navigational bar
which allows the user to jump to other views (concept index, summary, table of contents) if
you have created these views.</p>

<p>In order to make the index as efficient as possible for the end-user, SWAPI attempts to ensure
that each entry is unique.  Duplicate entries waste the end-users time because while they appear
to be the same in the index, they point to different places in the text.  Four example, an index
might include four entries for tax reform,  potentially confronting the user with a choice such
as:</p>


<a name="here1"></a>
<a href="#here1"><ul>Tax code<br>
Tax reform<br>
Tax reform<br>
Tax reform<br>
Tax reform<br>
Tesla, Nikola<br></ul>
</a>


<p>An end-user interested in the history of tax reform legislation would have to follow each of the
above links and view the original document(s) in order to determine if any of these entries
pertain to the subject.  In order to avoid this situation, SWAPI automatically displays an abstract
of the full phrase for any duplicate entries.</p>

<a name="here2"></a>
<ul><a href="#here2">Tax code</a><br>
Tax reform<br>
<ul><a href="#here2">Tax reform</a> long overdue<br>
Legislature votes on key <a href="#here2">tax reform</a> proposals<br>
Reviewing <a href="#here2">tax reform</a> of the 1980s<br>
Speaker calls <a href="#here2">tax reform</a> smoke and mirrors<br></ul>
<a href="#here2">Tesla, Nikola</a></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<p><b><i>Concept index:</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The concept index is an alphabetized list of key terms, each of which is followed
by an abstract of the phrase in which it occurred.  This allows the end-user to immediately see
the context in which every term is used.  If the above index terms appeared in a concept index, it
might look like the following:</p>

<a name="spoof"></a>
<ul><a href="#spoof">Tax code</a><br>
<ul>Representative Harris offers last-minute amendment to tax code</ul></ul>

<ul><a href="#spoof">Tax reform</a><br>
<ul>Tax reform long overdue</ul></ul>

<ul><a href="#spoof">Tax reform</a><br>
<ul>Legislature votes on key tax reform proposals</ul></ul>

<ul><a href="#spoof">Tax reform</a><br>
<ul>Reviewing tax reform of the 1980s</ul></ul>

<ul><a href="#spoof">Tax reform</a><br>
<ul>Speaker calls tax reform smoke and mirrors</ul></ul>

<ul><a href="#spoof">Tesla, Nikola</a><br>
<ul>Croatian-born Nikola Tesla instrumental in acceptance of
alternating current</ul></ul>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Summary:</b></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;The summary is just that, a full-text summarizing of the texts most significant ideas
presented in sequence, with the original texts structure maintained.  Each paragraph of the
summary is hot-linked to the originating paragraph in the text.  Headings can, at the engineers
option, be included, and when included they are also hot-linked to the original text.</p>

<p>&nbsp;</p>
<p><b><i>Table of Contents:</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;The table of contents is a presentation of the headings in outline form to
render the texts overall structure and scope.  Headings are all hot-linked, and successive heading
levels are represented by successive indents:<p>

<a name="spoof2"></a>
<p><a href="#spoof2">
<ul>General Trade Agreements<br>
<ul>Preface<br>
Textiles<br>
<ul>Cotton products<br>
Man-made fabrics<br></ul>
General Manufactured Goods</a></ul></ul>
<p>&nbsp;</p>


<center><h3>API Access</h3></center>

<p>SWAPI provides two level of API access: the stream level I/O option provides the programmer
with the greatest flexibility; the file level I/O option provides the programmer the simplest
access.  At the stream level, the programmer passes a buffer to SWAPI, which processes the
buffer and returns it to the calling program.  The calling program can collect the processed data
at this time or wait until all buffers have been processed.  All the linguistic analysis is done at
this level and all the hyperlinks are written, but the output is not formatted.  At the file level, the
programmer passes an HTML file list to SWAPI, which processes the files and returns them to
the calling program, passing back HTML files that are pre-formatted (according to the options
set by the programmer).  The calling program can do additional output formatting if required.</p>
<hr width="25%">
<p>&nbsp;</p>
<a name="options"><h2>SWAPI Options</h2>

<p>The following options are available at both the stream and the file level.</p>

<p><b><i>Types of output:</b></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;The engineer can select any or all of SWAPIs output typesindex, concept
index, summary, and table of contents.</p>

<p><b><i>Output level:</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Each form of output can be separately adjusted for its degree of
comprehensiveness.</p>

<p><b><i>Circular links:</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Circular links provide another means of handling duplicate entries in an index.
When a key term is indexed multiple times, circular links allow the end-user to jump from the
index (where the key term is listed only once) to the first instance of the term, from the first
instance to the second instance, and so on through each significant use of the term in the text,
until finally the last instance of the term is linked back to the index, completing the circle.
Circular links can be established for entries in the index or the concept index.</p>

<p><b><i>Horizontal links:</b></i>&nbsp;&nbsp;Horizontal links allow the end-user to jump from a key term in the index to the
place where that term appears in the summary, and from the summary on to the full text if
desired.</p>

<p><b><i>Personal names:</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Personal names can be indexed, or suppressed from indexing.</p>

<P><b><i>Geographical names:</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Recognized geographical names can be indexed, or suppressed from
indexing.</p>

<p><b><i>User-defined control list:</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;Syntacticas output can be refined by the use of  user-defined control
lists which allow the user to set the relative indexing importance of any words they choose.
Control lists are especially helpful when indexing documents from very technical fields.</p>

<p><b><i>Compound words:</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;In addition to its standard word-by-word analysis of the text, Syntactica can
be instructed to look for compound words (e.g., control tower, hot dog).  This is not a statistical
count of frequency and proximity, however; only compounds in the main lexicon or in a user-
defined control list will be recognized.</p>

<p><b><i>Unknown words:</i></b>&nbsp;&nbsp;SWAPI can be instructed to create a database consisting of the words found in
the text which are not in SWAPIs internal lexicon.  This database can then be opened in
LexEdit, a lexicon maintenance utility provided with SWAPI, and the words properly identified
for reprocessing.  (It should be noted here that Syntactica includes a fairly large section of code
for disambiguating and handling unknown words, so that the presence of unknown words will
not generally cause any major problems in the output.  Nonetheless, identifying and properly
classifying those unknown words will assure more accurate parsing of the text.)</p>

<a name="enhance"><h2>Projected Enhancements</h2></a>

<p>Over the last two years Iconovex has divided its development efforts between improving access
to and output from our APIs, on the one hand, and building applications which make use of those
APIs.  These applications have twice won Byte Magazines Best of Comdex award 
AnchorPage as Best Development Software (Spring, 1995), and EchoSearch as Best New
Internet Product (Spring, 1996).  These products are both based on SWAPI technology, yet make
distinctly different uses of it, thereby demonstrating its flexibility.</p>

<p>Further development and refinement of SWAPI technologyboth in its Natural Language
Processing and in the hypertext tools through which the language output is controlled and
presentedcontinues to be central to Iconovexs future business plans.  In the course of the next
year we plan to make significant improvements in the following areas:</p>
<ul>
<li><i>speed and footprint:</i>  Over the last six months we have reduced the size of the core
linguistic engine by over 50% while increasing its speed tenfold.  We are still
working on both optimizations, but especially on increasing speed.
<li><I>main lexicon:</i>  The lexicon at the heart of our language processing contains
approximately 130,000 entries.  We can reasonably hope to increase this by 10,000
to 40,000 entries over the next year, a great many of them compound words.  This
will help to increase the accuracy of our parsing as well as our evaluation of
significance for indexing and summarizing purposes.
<li><i>linguistic analysis:</i>  Increasing the sophistication of our linguistic analysis is an
ongoing process.  We currently have detailed specifications for the next six months
of development and broader, more general specifications for the year following that.
While our principal goal is simply to improve overall analysis, we will specifically
be targeting improvement of analysis over a wider range of document formats and
subject matters.
<li><i>hypertext editing:</i>  Over the next 6  9 months we will be adding hypertext editing
tools which will allow easier pre-process and post-process control over the final
output.  Pre-process tools will include an exclusion zone editor which will allow the
user to mark sections of text as exempt from indexing.  Post-processing tools will
include an entry editor which will make adding, deleting, or altering individual
entries easier and less time consuming.
<li><i>keyword search:</i>  We will shortly be adding a keyword search function to SWAPI
which will make our output searchable as well as browsable.  A query form will be
presented to the user, through which he or she can enter terms to be searched for.  A
stemmer will then be applied to those terms to derive their base terms and all of the
inflected forms.  All of these terms will then be matched against a hierarchical
lexical database in order to find related words, which will then be added to the
original query terms.  Finally, this expanded set of query terms will be run against a
keyword database built from all the significant terms in the index and concept index
and the user will be presented with a qualified index (or concept index) in which all
of the displayed entries are directly related to his or her query terms.
</ul>

<a name="products"><h2>Iconovex Products that Use SWAPI</h2></a>

<p>Three of Iconovexs current products are built on SWAPI and can serve as examples of the uses
to which the technology can be put.  Potential uses, of course, are limited only by the size and
scope of a developers imagination.</p>

<p><b><i>EchoSearch</i></b> uses SWAPIs linguistic analysis to turn its multi-threaded, multi-search
capabilities into intelligent searching.  Using Javas multi-threading, EchoSearch takes a users
query, submits it to multiple search engines at once, downloads the hit list from each of the
engines, and then proceeds to download the documents themselves.  But, what gives EchoSearch
its extra edge is the linguistic analysis it does after downloading the documents.  EchoSearch
analyzes and indexes the entire document suite, and then filters the resulting index with the
query terms.  But the result is not a simple list of index entries reading multiple sclerosis.  Any
good string-matching algorithm could do that.  Using SWAPIs more sophisticated analysis,
EchoSearch presents an index of all the significant terms which were found in concepts related to
multiple sclerosis.  These, then, are qualified index entries; the researcher can browse the index
knowing that all the terms listed are in some way related to the search query.</p>

<p>In a recent trial run, for instance, the query multiple sclerosis returned an index which
included, among other things, the index terms aluminum and mercury, both of which led
back to an article which included the phrase:</p>

<blockquote>. . . a prominent theory relates heavy metals like mercury, lead and
aluminum as the agents that might replace normal molecules in the myelin
sheaths, leading to an onslaught of free radical damage which destroys the
myelin sheaths, resulting in MS.</blockquote>


<p><b><i>AnchorPage</i></b> is a server-side product that makes all four of SWAPIs primary outputs available
to the user, typically the Webmaster of a site with a large volume of text that needs to be
organized and made accessible to users.  As HTML increasingly becomes the de facto standard
on corporate Intranets, AnchorPage will serve the same purpose in that environment.  At present,
AnchorPage is being used as the primary access vehicle for a catalog of scientific books,
corporate employee handbooks, and OSHA regulations.</p>

<p><b><i>WebAnchor</i></b> is primarily a client-side organizational tool for word processed or online
documents, though it is also being used on some corporate Intranets as a server product.
WebAnchor provides only the basic indexing output (with hyperlinking, of course).  On the
client side, it can be used by individual users on their PCs to index documents they have created
within a word processor, downloaded from the net (thus providing them with a way of efficiently
finding the facts they are after without having to read through a lot of unrelated information), or
to supply indexes for HTML documents they have created.  Since all the major online services
now provide some space for individual home pages, and most universities are beginning to do so,
we expect that this latter use of WebAnchor will become much more common.  The individual
who writes a lengthy report, a thesis, a dissertation, or a professional article and wishes to
publish it on the Web will be able to publish it with a hyperlinked index with virtually no extra
effort on his or her part.</p>
<hr width="25%">
<p>&nbsp;</p>



<a name="advantages"><h2>Advantages of the SWAPI Approach</h2></a>

<p>SWAPI offers a unique blend of technologies perfectly suited to the
Information Age.  It is ideal whether you are developing software for the
Internet or for corporate intranets, for a Webmaster trying to make
information available or an end-user trying to find that information.
SWAPI is a fast, reliable, and accurate way to turn today's continual
stream of electronic data into organized and accessible information.</p>

<p>For server-side products, SWAPI can make it possible to promptly
publish information that is <i>meaningfully</i> indexed and fully
hyperlinked.  Not only does this make that information more readily
accessible than through a search engine run against an inverted index, it
makes user access to that information considerably less demanding on server
resources.</p>

<p>For client-side products, SWAPI can provide the ability to sort through
undifferentiated masses of data, determine the significant concepts, and
gain instant access to those concepts through hypertext links. SWAPI finds
the facts, not just the words.</p>

<P>
</B></EM>
<OL>
<LI><b>Q:</b>  Is this a search engine like Yahoo?<br>
<b>A:</b>  No.  AnchorPage is a complement to a search engine in that we
&quot;intelligently&quot; analyze documents and then search engines can be
used against our &quot;smart&quot; indexes.
<P>
<LI><b>Q:</b>  Is this an HTML authoring tool?<br>
<b>A:</b>  No.  We help organize HTML pages once they are created so that the
information is easier to access for users of your site.
<P>
<LI><b>Q:</b>  Does this product run on my server?<br>
<b>A:</b>  No, AnchorPage does not reside on the server.  Each person who
will be using AnchorPage to organize information must have a copy on their
machine.
<P>
<LI><b>Q:</b>  How can I get AnchorPage to generate only 1 segment per document I
want processed?<br>
<b>A:</b>  Set the segment size very high.  For example, set it at 30000.
<P>
<LI><b>Q:</b>  How can I get AnchorPage to generate only 1 segment for all the
documents I want processed?<br>
<b>A:</b>  Set the segment size to 0.
<P>
<LI><b>Q:</b>  Can you get reference page numbers using AnchorPage?<br>
<b>A:</b>  You can identify document names, but due to the dynamic nature of
hypertext, page numbers become obsolete.

<BR><A NAME="INTRO"><H2>Introduction</h2><H3>Automate and Improve your Web
Publishing!</H3>AnchorPage is the ONLY automatic indexing, abstracting and
hyperlinking software for the Web. It saves site maintenance time by
automatically indexing, abstracting and hyperlinking the key concepts
and phrases in your HTML documents.<br>AnchorPage will also improve your
site by
introducing truly "webbed" information and <a href="#CDN">Content-Driven
Navigation</a> to your visitors. Because your AnchorPaged documents
have been inter/intra-linked, visitors to your site are not only linked
"to" your documents; they can follow links "within" and
"between" the documents. <p>
AnchorPage extracts the significant phrases and concepts from
each of your World Wide Web documents, <u><em>automatically</em></u>
inserts hypertext anchors for each of those phrases and concepts,
and produces four <a href="#NAVVIEWS"><i>Navigational Views</i></A> of the
document; a
Table of Contents view, Phrase view, Concept view, and Abstract view.
Each entry in these Navigational Views is hyperlinked to its
occurrence in the original document.
<p><a href="#MENU"><IMG SRC="UP.GIF" ALT=ARROW> Return to Menu</a>
<pre>



</pre>
<A NAME="AUTO">
<h2><b>Fully Automatic, Completely Customizable</b></h2>
<p>

<p>
The AnchorPage process can be divided into three distinct phases:  1)
parsing the document, 2) placing hypertext anchors in the document,
and 3) building navigational pages that link to these anchors.  Each
of these phases is fully automatic, yet each allows you to tailor
the output to suit your own needs and preferences.
<p>
You control AnchorPage's determination of what constitutes a significant
concept or phrase through a simple Selection Threshold setting.
You can also direct AnchorPage to give more or less weight to
specific terms and phrases by building a control list with LexEdit,
a lexicon utility provided with AnchorPage.
<p>
You control which Navigational Views are created and the nature of
the hypertext links between them.  You can also create circular
links within the presentation document so that your user can jump
through the document following a single concept as it develops.
<p>
We provide alternate templates so that you can easily change the
appearance of the final pages that will appear on your server.
Each of these templates can be customized, or you can substitute
pages of your own design.

<p><A NAME="NAVVIEWS">
<h2>What are <i>Navigational Views</i>?</h2>
<p>

Navigational Views represent different entry points into a document.
The <a href="#toc">Table of Contents View</a> presents the document
headings and
subheadings in outline form.  The <a href="#abs">Abstract View</a> presents
abstracts of the
significant concepts in the order in which they appear in the original
document.
<a href="#conc">The Concept View</a> presents the significant concepts in
context and alphabetized according
to the keywords they contain.  <a href="#phr">The Phrase View</a> is an
alphabetical
listing of the keywords and key phrases drawn from the concepts.
These Navigational Views can then be linked to each other and to
the Presentation page, a view of the document in its presentation
form.
<p>
The mini-paragraphs below illustrate the different Navigational
Views with a small sampling of actual AnchorPage entries for an article on
the Cold War taken from Microsoft <i>Encarta</i> Encyclopedia.

<p><a name="CDN"><center><h2>What is <i>Content-Driven
Navigation</i>?</h2></CENTER>
<b><i>Content-Driven Navigation</i></b> is a new and exciting way to browse
web sites. Browsing a web site usually involves either
investigating different directories by traversing from
document to document or it involves using a search engine to look for
something in particular. Both methods are effective and will, more
often than not, bring you to an interesting document or keyword. However;
once you've been brought <b>to</b> the document, you are left to download or
scroll through it on your own. AnchorPage introduces<b> <i>Content-Driven
Navigation</i></b> to let you travel <b>within</b> and <b>throughout</b> a
document (or suite of
documents). You are now able to trace a concept, phrase or abstract,
weaving in and out of truly "webbed" information. You can enter the
<a href="#abs">Abstract View</a> of a document and quickly evaluate
whether or not you'd like to delve deeper; enter the <a
href="#conc">Concept View</a> and determine whether the
keyword you're looking for exists in the context you're looking for it
in. Examine the back-of-the-book index <a href="#phr">Phrase View</a>
to be immediately hyperlinked to a specific term. The <a
href="#toc">Table of Contents View</a> offers you immediate
access to all of the headings of the document; a familiar and welcome
way of viewing the main sections of information. All
four of the <a href="#NAVVIEWS">Navigational Views</a> that comprise
<b><I>Content-Driven Navigation</b></i> represent separate entry points
to your documents' content yet they are intertwined through hypertext to
offer complete exploration <b>within</b> and <b>throughout</b> the
documents' content. <p><a href="#MENU"><IMG SRC="UP.GIF" ALT=ARROW>

<p><a name="ADMIN"> <center><h2>Features
and Benefits</h2> <p> <h3>For the Web Site Administrator</h3></center>
<p>

<ul>
<li><b>AnchorPage is fast.</b>   For example, it analyzed a 600K document
on a 66MHz PC in just 9-1/2 minutes! This makes it possible to process
entire document databases overnight.  New documents can be added in a
matter of minutes, which means that a server using AnchorPage can always
have the most current and up-to-date information on-line in value-added
form with no extra administrative overhead.
<li><b>The process is fully automatic.</b>   Once the administrator
has set his or her preferred options, the entire process  from
analyzing the documents to placing hypertext links to producing
the navigational pages the end user will see is fully automatic.
<li><b>The administrator controls the look as well as the
content of the final product.</b>   The site administrator can
choose any or all of the four Navigational Views to present.  The
amount of detail in those Views can be set at six different
levels.  The format of the Synopsis pages can also be
customized to reflect the administrators preferences.
<li><b>Documents can be processed individually or in suites.</b>
Documents can be processed individually, producing Navigational Views
for each document, or in suites, producing integrated Navigational
Views for the entire suite.
<li><b>Entries can be tailored to emphasize different
interests and priorities.</b>    LexEdit, a utility provided with
AnchorPage, allows the administrator to alter the analysis performed
on documents through the use of control lists of terms he or she
may consider of special importance.
<li><b>Files can be located anywhere on your system.</b>
Easy-to-use file selection windows allow the administrator to
choose files anywhere on the server to assemble a suite of documents
for processing.
<li><b>Documents are segmented for faster download times.</b>
All of AnchorPage's output pages; the four Navigational Views and
the Presentation View of the original document, can be segmented
to allow faster download times for your users and fuller control
over the complete document for you.  Segmentation is completely
adjustable, allowing you to specify whatever size segment you think
most suitable for your documents and your users' needs.
<li><b>No modification to your existing pages is necessary.</b>
AnchorPage forms a seamless link between your document menu page
and the actual documents, but doesn't otherwise affect the structure
or organization of your server.  You need not rewrite your homepage, or
any other pages, to get the full benefit.
<li><b>Satisfied users make for a popular Web site.</b>
News travels fast on the Web, especially news of a good site with
readily accessible information.  When you make it possible for
users to find what they want quickly, easily, and reliably, you
assure not only that they will revisit your site, but also that
they will tell others about it.
<li><b>Browser included.</b>   A Windows-compatible browser
is included for easy viewing and testing of navigational pages and
their hypertext links.
<li><b>Converts RTF files.</b>  AnchorPage also includes <B>RTFact</b>,
an easy-to-use program which converts RTF files to HTML format.
</ul>

<P><A NAME="ENDUSER">
<center><h2>Features and Benefits</h2>
<p>
<h3>For the Web Site End-User</h3></center>
<p>

<ul>
<li><b>Users find the right document every time.</b>
With AnchorPage Navigational Views, users can scan a table of contents,
significant words and phrases, significant concepts, even abstracts
before deciding which documents they want to view or download.
Users will no longer be forced to rely on a list of nondescript
titles as the basis for selecting documents.
<li><b>Users save reading time and downloading time.</b>
Navigational pages can be retrieved in a fraction of the time it would
take to retrieve the full document, and users can skim or search
on those pages quickly and easily, getting straight to
the essence of any document's contents.  No more time (or money)
wasted downloading documents that prove unusable.
<li><b>Timely documents are available in a timely fashion.</b>
Because AnchorPage is fast and automatic, administrators will
be able to place online the most timely documents fully indexed and
hyperlinked within hours of their availability.  Users
will appreciate, and come to rely upon, this speedy access to
up-to-date information.

<hr>
<p>
<H3><a href="CRYPTO/HOME.HTM">The Recommendation of the NAS Regarding 
Cryptography</a></H3 <P>
Even as you read this, Congress is debating the laws governing and effecting
cryptography, particularly in as much as it relates to the Internet and
electronic commerce, making this a issue of much concern for many members
of the internet community.  Congress commissioned the NAS (National Academy
of Sciences) to study the issue of cryptography and make some sort of
recommendation as to how Congress should proceed; the NAS turned the issue
over to the National Research Council of its Computer Science and
Telecommunications Board, and here is the preliminary, pre-publication
result.
<p>

 you can visit the <A HREF="http://www.nas.edu"><I>NAS Home Page.</I></A>

<title>Court's Decision on the Communications Decency Act</title>
<body>
<h2>Court's Decision on the Communications Decency Act</h2>
<hr>
<p>
Recently (June 12, 1996), a three-judge panel in Philadelphia handed down
a ruling on the case of the American Civil Liberties Union vs. Janet Reno,
where the ACLU, among many others, had challenged the constitutionality
of the controversial "Communications Decency Act" that was part of the
Telecommunications Reform Bill.  The judges ruled that the "CDA" was
<b>unconstitutional</b> and ordered it struck down.  Presented here is their
written ruling; regardless of which side you take in this issue, it's
interesting reading.  The issue is by no means closed; the goverment is
expected to appeal the decision to the Supreme Court.
<p>
<h3><a href="CDA/CDADEC.HTM">The Court's Decision Regarding the
Communications Decency Act</a>.</H3>  The full text of the decision, 
one document.  Note: this is a <em>big</em> file (256K). <p>
<h3><a href="CDA/HOME.HTM">The Court's Decision Regarding the

<li>All Selectivity levels were set at 3, except for Phrase, which was set at 2.

<h3>ICONOVEX'S ECHOSEARCH WINS BYTE MAGAZINE'S BEST OF COMDEX AWARD</h3>
</center>
<P>

<B><I>Marks Second Straight Spring Comdex Win</B></I><B>
<P>

<P>

</B><B></B>Chicago, IL -- June 5, 1996 -- Byte Magazine today announced that
<B> Iconovex Corporation</B> has won its second straight Best of Comdex/
Spring Award.  The award was presented to Iconovex, recognizing its new
product, <B>EchoSearch, </B>as Best Internet Product.  At Spring Comdex 1995
in Atlanta, GA, Iconovex's <B>AnchorPage</B> won the same award in the Best
Development Software category.  Iconovex Corporation is a subsidiary of
Innovex, Inc. (NASDAQ: INVX), a leading producer of lead wire assemblies for
the thin film disk drive market.
<P>

EchoSearch is an intelligent desktop-based search engine tool for browsers
of the Web that significantly improves the speed and accuracy of searches.
A simple, yet powerful tool, EchoSearch is ideal for <I>all</I> users
searching the Internet or a corporate Intranet for information.  EchoSearch
is one of the first truly &quot;full blown&quot; Java applications.  It
makes use of the programming language's multi-threading capabilities,
enabling users to simultaneously query multiple search engines.  Unlike
other search engines, EchoSearch features an intelligent back-end that can
index and accurately summarize the documents gathered, avoiding the
necessity of the user downloading entire sets of documents in order to
ascertain the relevance to the query.
<P>

&quot;We are quite excited that EchoSearch was recognized for its
innovative technology by such a distinguished, highly regarded publication,
&quot; says Bernardo Sotomayor, vice president and general manager of
Iconovex. &quot;We are fortunate in having made the decision two years ago
to embrace the Web, and the Internet in general, as our primary target
platforms.&quot;
<P>

Byte's Best of COMDEX awards program has become a time honored tradition in
the computer industry after eight years of presentations.  In evaluating
products, Byte editors search out
innovative new products that show strong potential to influence and impact
the computer industry worldwide.
<P>

&quot;Byte Magazine reaches a large number of technology professionals that
are constantly searching  and sifting through the wealth of information that
is available online,&quot; adds Sotomayor.  &quot;These users are in need of
a tool that can help them sort through and find relevant information.
EchoSearch addresses this need with a tool that will not only find
information, but synthesize and distill it as well.&quot;
<P>

EchoSearch will be available in July, 1996 for a suggested retail price of $
49.95.  For additional information, contact Iconovex Corporation at 800-94
3-0292, on the Web at http://www.iconovex.com, or via E-mail at fyi@
iconovex.com.  EchoSearch joins the highly acknowledged Iconovex product
line, which includes AnchorPage&#174;, WebAnchor&#153;, and SWAPI&#153;, all
of which are based on Syntactica&#174;, Iconovex's proprietary indexing and
abstracting engine.

<head><title>Upcoming EchoSearch Features</title></head> <BODY
background="SPOTS.GIF">
<center><h1>Upcoming Features</h1></center> <HR>
<p>We are currently working on the following enhancements and new features
for EchoSearch.  Most, if not all, of these additions will be included in
version 2.0, due out the first quarter of 1997.</p> <ul
type="circ">
<li>Frames added to output pages so that the navigational window and
summarization window will be visible at all times.</li></ul> <p>
<center><table cellpadding=4 cols=3><td><font=-1>Navigation<br>

Window</font><br>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<img
src="4LEFT.GIF"></td></tr></table></center>
<b>1.) Navigation Window</b>  This window contains icons that allow you to
choose which view to use in displaying the output (Qualified Results,
Concepts, Summaries, or Index).  There is also an AZ navigation bar that
allows you to jump to the entries for any given letter.<br><b>2.)
Summarization Window</b>  This window displays the various types of output
and acts as your starting point for clicking through the results.  Just click
on any hotlinked term or concept and you will be taken to that term or
concept in the document.<br><b>3.) Document Window</b>  This window
displays the original document (minus the graphics).  After you click on
a term or concept in the Summarization window, the Document window will
display the document with the term or concept you have chosen at the
top of the frame.<ul type="circ">
 <p><li>Improved document summaries. The summaries of
the documents most relevant to your query are listed first.</li> <p>
<li>Better document and session management, including incremental additions
to sessions (i.e., allowing users to include an additonal number of documents
to an existing session).</li> <p><li>Allow queries to be scheduled.</li> <p>
<li>Bookmarks can be transfered between EchoSearch and your browser and vice
versa.</li> <p> <li>Enable EchoSearch to use subscriber search engines
(Britanica Online, Electric Library) as well as public ones, with username
and password supplied by user.</li><p> <li>Intermediate results are generated
so output can be viewed while results are still being generated.  In other
words, EchoSearch will show you the processed results for the first couple of
documents while it continues to download and process remaining
documents.</li><p> <li>Improved advanced search capabilities.</li>

looking for the documents that <I>might</I> contain the information you want.
You won't need to point your browser at those documents, one after another,
to check their content. EchoSearch uses multiple search engines
simultaneously, in about the same time it would take you to use only one
engine, to build a complete hit list. Then it simultaneously downloads and
analyzes those documents and presents you with a list of concepts related to
your query. Find the concept you're interested in, click on it, and you are
instantly taken to the relevant portion of the relevant document.</P>

<UL> <LI>EchoSearch is <I>accurate</I>
because its unique, proprietary engine actually filters hits from popular
search engines according to the <I>meaning</I> (concept, phrase or summary)
you are searching for.</LI>
<p>
<LI>Your searches take less time because rather than having to go to each
individual URL that came up as a hit, you just go through the index view
generated by EchoSearch and select from the entries that closely match your
query.  This eliminates wasting time with hits that have little relevance to
you.
</LI>

way you search!</font></b>

This trial run of EchoSearch was done on the query <i>Magellan
+Venus</b>.  Below is the main screen. Search terms are entered in the <b><i>Search for</b></i> box.
Boolean operators, as used in <i>+Venus</i> below, can easily be added to
queries through the <B><I>Advanced Search</b></i> dialog. For multiple words,
you would enclose the query in quotes (i.e., "<i>search engines</i>"). The
<b><i>Return documents</b></i> box allows you to enter the number of
documents that you want EchoSearch to return for any given query. <p> To see some of the
EchoSearch screens and to learn about how EchoSearch processes, click

<h3><b>Upgrade Questions</b></h3>
<p><b>Q: How to I upgrade to a more recent version of EchoSearch?</b>
<p><B>A:</b> If you have not yet registered your copy of EchoSearch, you
must do so to become eligible for online upgrades.  If you do have a
<b>registered</b> copy of EchoSearch and you have version <b>1.04 or
higher</b>, you must upgrade from within EchoSearch. For step-by-step
instructions, go to <A HREF="ESORDER.HTM#ONUPGRADE">How to Upgrade Your Copy
of EchoSearch</a>. If you own a registered copy of EchoSearch 1.03 or
older and wish to upgrade, click <a href="ESORDER.HTM#OLD">here</a>.<p> <br>

<H3><B>General EchoSearch Questions</B></H3>

<A ID="E11E15" NAME="E11E15"></A>
<P><B>Q: I am running Windows 95 and am getting Invalid Page Faults (or
General Protection Faults) when running EchoSearch for a long time, or when
I run a large search and download many documents.  Is there anything I can
do?</B> <P><B>A:</B> Microsoft has an update for Windows 95 that resolves a
memory leak which occurs when opening and closing a Socket using the Windows
Sockets API.  This update is called the Kernel32 Update.
<P>Visit the <a
href="http://www.microsoft.com/windows/software/krnlupd.htm">Windows 95
Updates page</a> for more information and to download this Kernel32 Update.
<B>Note: </B>You will need to have your Internet connection open in order to
view this page or to download this file. <p>
</td></tr></table> <B>Q: Is there any way I can
speed up the analysis step?</B> <P><B>A:</B> EchoSearch will be able to
process documents retrieved from a search more quickly if you close any other
applications before EchoSearch begins download and analysis.

<P><B>Q: I am getting frequent &quot;Error&quot; Status Messages from a search
engines.  Why?</B><A ID="E16E74" NAME="E16E74"></A>
<P><B>A: </B>If you
are receiving repeated &quot;Error&quot; messages from a search engine, or if
the search engine repeatedly responds with &quot;Done&quot; almost
immediately for different queries, you should see if an updated driver is
available for that engine. You can retrieve search engine updates and
additions from the Iconovex Web site at any time by choosing <B>Update
</B><B>Now </B>(on the Search Engines dialog).

<P><b>A: </b>If you are getting an &quot;Error&quot; message from a search
engine <i>clone</i> that you created, you may have indicated the wrong search
query URL.  Verify that the URL in the <b>Enter URL to which query is
submitted</b> box is correct.<p>
<b>Q: Can EchoSearch use my Intranet version of a search engine?</b>
<p><b>A: </b>Currently EchoSearch only supports AltaVista's Intranet search
engine.  Refer to <a href="CLONES.HTM">Search Engines Clone page</a> for
information on clones supported by EchoSearch.  Instructions on how to add
search engine clones is also available in the online help.  If you would like
to see a clone of a search engine supported by EchoSearch added to
EchoSearch's search engine list, send us your request using the <a
href="SENGINE.HTM">Search Engine Request form</a>.

<A ID="E11E24" NAME="E11E24"></A>
<P><B>Q: Why did I get a "Network Error" during downloading?</B><A ID="E16E76"
NAME="E16E76"></A>
<P><B>A: </B>When EchoSearch is unable to download a document, it
will be displayed as a network error in the Progress: Download and Analysis
dialog.  You can view the document URLs that returned network errors in the
statistics file.  To open the statistics file, open your search results and
click on the <B>Statistics </B>link at the top of the page.

<A NAME="E15E171"></A>
<P><B>Q: I repeat a search that I've run earlier and I get different results. Why?</B>
<A NAME="E15E172"></A>
<P><B>A:</B> Identical queries submitted to the same set of search engines will
sometimes return a different set of document hits, depending on the breadth of your
query and the number of hits you requested. Generally speaking, if you request a
large number of documents for a narrow topic (50 documents on &quot;Grand Marais&quot;)
you will get fairly consistent results with each repeated query because there are
fewer than 50 documents available on Grand Marais, and you will get the same set of
documents returned each time. If you request a small number of documents for a broad
subject (10 documents on &quot;basketball&quot;), you are likely to get rather
different results with searches because each search engine may list hundreds of
documents on basketball, and the document set you get will depend entirely on which
search engine responds most quickly to the query.

<p>
<b>Q:  On my machine, Netscape runs just fine, but EchoSearch claims it
can't connect to any of the search engines whenever I try to do a search.</b>
<p>
<b>A:</b>  If you're using EchoSearch at work, it's possible that your
machine at work is using a <i>Proxy Server</i>.  EchoSearch can
compensate for this, however; contact your systems administrator and find
out if you're using a proxy server, and if so what its <b>IP
address</b> and <b>port number</b> are.  Once you have this
information, click on the "Options" menu, and select the
item "Network Settings."  In this dialog box, check the "user
proxy server" box.  Enter the IP address and port number of the proxy
server in the appropriate blanks and click <b>OK</b>.  That should
take care of the problem.

<H3><B>General Output Questions</B></H3>


<A NAME="E15E175"></A>
<P><B>Q: Sometimes the links on the Qualified Results (or Index page or
Concept page) take me to the right part of the document, </B><B>but the
actual words I clicked on aren't at the top of the browser page. Why aren't
the words I'm looking for always right at </B><B>the top of the browser page?</B>

<A NAME="E15E176"></A>
<P><B>A:</B> Most often this occurs because the words you're looking for are
near the end of the document. As long as the document fills at least one
screen, the browser will not display any empty space after the end of the
document (that is, the last line in the document must always be at the
bottom of the last screenful in the browser). If the term you are looking
for is anywhere in the last screenful of the document, the browser will not
allow the line containing that term to be brought to the top of the display,
but will simply show the last full screen of the document.

<A
NAME="E15E177"></A> <P><B>Q: Why are there duplicate entries in my EchoSearch
output?</B> <A NAME="E15E178"></A> <P><B>A:</B> EchoSearch detects duplicate
documents by matching the URLs, and it eliminates these duplicates from the
search engines' hit list. However, some documents may be found in more than
one place on the Web, in which case each separate location will have a
separate URL. EchoSearch has no way of detecting this. The result will be
duplicate entries, one entry for each copy of the document.

<A NAME="E15E179"></A> <P><B>Q: Why do I get entries in
the Concept View and Qualified Results where words are repeated over and
over?</B>

<A NAME="E15E180"></A> <P><B>A:</B> In an effort to increase the
likelihood that a document will be considered a &quot;hit&quot; by search
engines, some Webmasters may include text that has nothing but keywords
repeated over and over again. When an author has used this method of
attracting search engines, coined &quot;spamdexing,&quot; you will often find
strange entries in your search results, where a word or phrase is repeated
over and over. If you then click on one of these entries, you may jump to a
paragraph that is unrelated to the entry or to a paragraph that appears
&quot;empty&quot;, because the original text was hidden by the author so that
it would not be visible in a browser (to locate the entry in the original
document, use the &quot;View Source&quot; or similar option to view the HTML
source and then use the &quot;Find&quot; feature, often <b>CTRL + F</b>). <A
NAME="E15E181"></A> <P>While we do our best to filter out this kind of
material, we cannot filter it out completely without the risk of eliminating
truly valid index entries contained in spamedexed documents. <A
NAME="E15E182"></A> <P>Some authors also use spamdexing in their document
titles. This will not cause problems in the index or concept outputs, but may
return some strange entries in the Summary view because EchoSearch simply
takes the title of the document (however long or ridiculous it might be) and
sticks it at the top of the summary. <A NAME="E11E7"></A> <A
NAME="BROWSER"></A> <BR><BR> <H3>Browser-related Questions</H3>

<P><B>Q: Why do some of my EchoSearch links not work even though I have
loaded Netscape 2.0 over my Netscape 1.2?</B></p>

<P><B>A:</B> Netscape Navigator 2.0 creates a new directory when it is
loaded called C:\Netscape\Programs.  The browser resides in this directory.
Netscape 2.0 will not overwrite a previous version of Netscape that resides
in the C:\Netscape directory.  You must specify the Netscape 2.0 browser that
resides in the C:\Netscape\Programs directory for your EchoSearch links to
work properly.

<P><B>Q: Why do I get the message &quot;Netscape is unable to locate
the server&quot; when I click on "View Original Document"?</B>
<p><B>A: </B>You may have been disconnected from your Internet connection.
If you are trying to view a document facsimile, your browser is most likely
attempting to display the ad for the sponsor of the search engine that
located the document.  In this case it is not necessary to reestablish your
connection; just "Stop" loading the page in your browser or click
<B>Cancel</B> when prompted to reconnect.

<P><B>A: (Windows 95)</B> If you are using
Windows 95 Dial-Up Networking, check your network settings. Go to the Control
Panel and double-click on &quot;Network.&quot; Highlight &quot;Dial-up
Adapter&quot; and click &quot;Properties.&quot;  On the Bindings tab, you
should only have ONE entry, &quot;TCP/IP.&quot;

<p><b>A: (Windows 95)</b> You also might not have a
16550 compatible UART (the chip that controls the modem connection). If you
do not, choose Start-Settings-Control Panel. Double-click on the Modems icon.
Select your modem and click &quot;Properties.&quot; Select the Connection tab
and then select &quot;Port Settings.&quot;  Uncheck the &quot;Use FIFO
buffers&quot; box.  Click <B>OK</B> three times to exit.

<p><b>Q: Why didn't my browser automatically come up when EchoSearch was
done processing?</b>
<p><b>A: </b>When Windows NT users are running EchoSearch with Netscape 2.0
minimized or in the background, the Netscape 2.0 window will not automatically
become the active window after EchoSearch has finished processing; users must
manually select the Netscape window.  Windows 95 users will not experience
this problem.  This problem will not occur for Windows NT if they are using
Netscape Navigator 2.01.</p>

<p>
<b>Q: EchoSearch runs just fine, but when it finishes, and I click on the
button to launch my browser to view the results, I get a long error
message that tells me that my browser can't find the file
"c:\Iconovex\EchoSearch\{whatever other pathname is involved}."  What's
wrong?</b>
<p>
<b>A:</b> The most likely answer is that you are using a 16-bit browser,
whereas EchoSearch requires a 32-bit browser (32-bit browsers are, on the
whole, the only browsers that can recognize long filenames, and
EchoSearch uses long filenames routinely); just because you're running
Windows 95, don't assume that all the software you're using is 32-bit.
Try downloading and installing the 32-bit version of your favorite browser
(don't worry; most such downloads are free).

<H3><B>Internet Access Provider Questions</B></H3>

<P><B>Q: How do I use EchoSearch with my Internet Access Provider?</B>
<p><B>A:</B> Refer to the Connect.html file that was installed with
EchoSearch or read <a href="Connect.html">&quot;Instructions for Using EchoSearch with Online
Service Providers.&quot;</a><p>
<B>Q: If I am using an Online Service Provider, do I need to stay
connected the whole time EchoSearch is running?</B><p>
<B>A:</B> No.  You may disconnect <EM>after </EM>EchoSearch has downloaded
all of the requested documents.  All of the analysis is done offline.  You may
also view the results offline, including the facsimile of the original document
EchoSearch has created on your hard drive.  However, if the facsimile contains
external links (links to URLs out on the Web) and you wish to follow those links,
or you wish to view the original document, you will need to reestablish your
connection.
<P>
<B>Q: Why did EchoSearch connect to the wrong service provider?</B><p>
<B>A: (Windows 95)</B> If you have multiple service providers set up on your
system (e.g., CompuServe and Microsoft Network), you may have another
provider set up to establish your Internet connection.  Right-click on the
Internet icon on your desktop and select &quot;Properties&quot; (or open it
in Control Panel).  On the Options tab, check &quot;Autodial&quot; and select
the provider you want to use for your Internet connection.

<P> <B>Q: Why
doesn't EchoSearch disconnect from my Online Service Provider when I close
EchoSearch and/or my browser?</B><p> <B>A: </B>Some network connections, like
Windows 95 dial-up networking, require you to manually disconnect from the
network.

<A NAME="QUALIFIED"></A>


<H3><B>Qualified Results
Questions</B></H3> <A NAME="E15E191"></A> <P>

<B>Q: My Qualified Results page
has all sorts of entries that do not seem to be directly related to my query.
Why is this?</B> <A NAME="E15E192"></A>
<P><B>A:</B> There are several
possible reasons for this. If you include small, non-essential words in your
query (of, the, and) and they are not part of a larger phrase set off by
quotes, this can cause your Qualifed Results to contain all sorts of
irrelevant matter. For instance, the query<p> battle of +&quot;Wounded
Knee&quot;<p> will draw all sorts of irrelevant matter into the Qualified
Results that would not be drawn in if the query were <p>battle +&quot;Wounded
Knee&quot;<p> or <p>&quot;battle of Wounded Knee&quot;. <A
NAME="E15E193"></A> <P>It is also possible that synonyms from your query
terms are causing unrelated items in your Qualified Results. If the query you
used was <p>battle +&quot;Wounded Knee&quot;<p> the Qualified Results might
contain an entry for the &quot;fight against poverty&quot; because
&quot;fight&quot; is a synonym of battle. This would not happen if the query
was submitted as <p>&quot;battle of Wounded Knee&quot;<p> because there is no
synonym for the entire expression. <A NAME="E15E194"></A>

<P><B>Q: Nothing appears on the Qualified Results page. Why? </B>
<A NAME="E15E14"></A>
<P><B>A:</B> This may happen when you enter a compound search term and choose the
Index View for your Qualified Results. Some compounds are listed in reverse order
in the index. For example, if you entered &quot;Abraham Lincoln&quot; for your
query, the index might list it as &quot;Lincoln, Abraham,&quot; causing it not to
appear in the index the way you actually entered it. You can alleviate this problem
by entering the terms as separate queries or use the Concept View (recommended)
for your Qualified results. If you enter the terms as separate queries, you might
want to boost the number of documents that you retrieve.
<A NAME="E15E15"></A>
<P><B>A: </B>Another possibility is that in your search query you used punctuation
within quotation marks, for example:
<A NAME="E15E16"></A>
<P>&quot;Boulder, Colorado&quot;
<A NAME="E15E17"></A>
<P>&quot;John F. Kennedy&quot;
<A NAME="E15E18"></A>
<P>It is preferable to avoid using punctuation within quotation marks, e.g.,
enter the query as:
<A NAME="E15E19"></A>
<P>+Boulder +Colorado
<A NAME="E15E20"></A>
<P>+John +Kennedy
<A NAME="E15E21"></A>

<A NAME="INDEX"></A>

<H3><B>Index
View Questions</B></H3>

<A NAME="E15E187"></A> <P><B>Q: My index has lots of
misspellings and run-together words like &quot;andthe&quot; or
&quot;forthe.&quot; Why did EchoSearch index &quot;andthe&quot;
</B><B>anyway?  </B>
<A NAME="E15E188"></A> <P><B>A:</B> If there are lots of misspellings and
run-together words in the output, it probably means that you ran across one
of those all-too-common documents on the Web that someone threw up in a hurry
without spellchecking. If there are mistakes in the original, there will be
mistakes in all our output; we do not presume to rewrite the original in any
way. Why would we index words like &quot;andthe&quot;? Because we accept the
original document in good faith, we assume the author has intended this word,
and since we don't recognize it, we assume it is probably a technical term
beyond the scope of our lexicon. We also assume that a technical term beyond
the scope of our lexicon is something that should be indexed.
<BR><BR>
<A NAME="TOC"></A>

<H3><B>Table of Contents Questions</B></H3>

<P><B>Q: My Table of Contents view didn't show any headings for a document even though the document itself contains headings. </B><B>Why?</B>
<A NAME="E15E197"></A>
<P><B>A:</B> The Table of Contents view only displays headings that are properly marked with HTML heading tags. Authors will sometimes use other stylistic devices (larger fonts or bold or italics) to give text the appearance of headings, but EchoSearch wi






ll not consider these headings and will not display them in the Table of Contents view.
<A NAME="E15E198"></A>
<P>

<A NAME="FACSIMILE"></A>

<H3><B>Facsimile Questions</B></H3>

<P><B>Q: Some of the text on my facsimile page has disappeared or some of the links lead me to blank documents. Other output </B><B>looks just plain screwy. Why is this happening?</B>
<A NAME="E15E184"></A>
<P><B>A:</B> This problem may have to do with an outdated driver for one of
the search engines. Many search engines make changes to their service,
causing erratic and unusual results in EchoSearch. This problem may be
resolved by updating your search engine drivers. In order to update your
search engines, do the following:

<OL> <LI>Establish your connection to the
World Wide Web. </LI> <LI>Open EchoSearch. </LI> <LI>From the <B>Options
</B>menu select <B>Search Engines</B>.<B> </B></LI> <LI>On the Search Engines
dialog click on the <B>Update Now </B>button. </LI> <LI>The download should
be very brief, and at the end of the process you will be asked to click on
<B>OK </B>to save the updates. Click <B>OK </B>and you're done.</LI> </OL> <A
NAME="E15E185"></A> <P><B>Q: Clicking on the &quot;View Original
Document&quot; link on one of the output pages does not work. Why?</B> <A
NAME="E15E186"></A> <P><B>A:</B> You are most likely using an Online Service
Provider and have either been disconnected from the network, or you chose to
disconnect earlier. You must reestablish your Internet connection in order to
view the original document on the Web.

<P><b>Q: My facsimile pages all have broken links on them where the images
should be</b>
<P><b>A: </b>In order to save time, EchoSearch creates text-only facsimiles
of the original documents.  The broken links are only markers to let you
know that the original document has some image there.   If you wish to see
the images, simply go to the top of the fasimile page and click on the
"View original document" link.  The original document with all its images
intact will be displayed in your browser.

<title>Distinctions between WebAnchor and AnchorPage</title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<h3>Distinctions between WebAnchor and AnchorPage</h3>
<hr>
<p>

<b>WebAnchor</b> is designed to help explorers of the Web organize
and create a hypertext, back-of-the-book-style index of all the documents
that they might download and collect on their own machines.
If you are researching a particular topic and have downloaded a number
of web pages that you <u>think</u> might be useful to you, but you haven't
had time to examine them all closely, you can use <b>WebAnchor</b> to
build an index of the pages to get a quick, clear look at the overall
contents.  Since the index is standard HTML output, it may also
be used to create the same type of index for a Web site.
You are limited only to this one type of output, however.  In contrast,
<b>AnchorPage</b> not only creates a simple back-of-the-book-style index, but
also offers a Concept View, a Table of Contents View, and an Abstract/
Summary view.  This is designed to help Webmasters organize a very
large, content-heavy site.
<p>
<b>WebAnchor</b> is a tool that will create your own personal
Web of information for your desktop; it can even convert
your word-processed documents (once you save them as RTF format)
into HTML and automatically index and hyperlink them together.
<p>
<b>AnchorPage</b> is designed to assist in the organization of an entire
web site, or a web site's collection of documents; <b>WebAnchor</b>, while it can
be used in a similar fashion (with less detailed results) is more for the
use of the Web traveller who needs to organize what he or she finds.

<OL>
<LI><b>Q:</b>  How is this product different from AnchorPage?<br>
<b>A:</b>  WebAnchor only offers the Phrase View of a document where AnchorPage
offers the Phrase, Concept, Table of Contents, and Abstract views.  WebAnchor
is also an end-user product.
<p>
<LI><b>Q:</b>  Can I use WebAnchor to index an entire website?<br>
<b>A:</b>  Yes.  WebAnchor can take an entire website and create a fully-hyperlinked
index listing the important terms and phrases contained within the site.
<p>
<LI><b>Q:</b> Can WebAnchor index information across networks (LANs/WANs)?<br>
<b>A:</b> No.  WebAnchor will take any HTML documents that you have on a given
PC and index that information only.
<p>
<LI><b>Q:</b> Is WebAnchor a search engine?<br>
<b>A:</b> No.  WebAnchor creates static indexes of information that you would, in
turn, publish on a Web site.
<p>
<LI><b>Q:</b> Does WebAnchor reside on a server?<br>
<b>A:</b> No.  Each person who uses WebAnchor to index and organize information
must have a copy on his/her machine.

<center><h2>Frequently Asked Questions</h2></center>
<P>

<P>
<OL>
<LI><b>Q:</b>  How can I purchase one of your products?<br>
<b>A:</b>  Call us at 1-800-943-0292, fill out the contact information on our
web site at http://www.iconovex.com, or email us at sales@iconovex.com.
<p>
<LI><b>Q:</b>  How can I become a BETA tester?<br>
<b>A:</b>  BETA versions of our software are usually available for downloading
from our Web site, usually under the &quot;What's New&quot; category.  You
could also email us at fyi@iconovex.com.  Be sure to include your name, email address,
regular address, and your phone number.
<p>
<LI><b>Q:</b>  What are the minimum system requirements needed to run your products?<br>
<b>A:</b>  For Windows 3.1x, most of our products require a 486 CPU, 8 MB RAM, 10
MB available disk space, and Win32s 1.3x.  For Windows NT, most products require
a minimum of 16 MB RAM.  For Windows 95, most products require a minimum of 8
MB RAM.
<p>
<LI><b>Q:</b>  How does the software decide which words it will include in the
index?<br>
<b>A:</b>  Iconovex uses a linguistic analysis engine that &quot;reads&quot;
electronic documents and can identify important words, word phrases, and ideas.
The output is based on word meaning rather than word frequency.  Controls such as
Level of Detail and user lexicons allow you, the user, to influence the indexing
decisions.
<p>
<LI><b>Q:</b>  Where do I get upgrades?<br>
<b>A:</b>  Upgrades and how to get them are announced on our Web site.  If you
have any further question regarding upgrades, you can call us at 1-800-943-0292.
<p>
<LI><b>Q:</b>  Which product(s) do I use to produce an online index?<br>
<b>A:</b>  AnchorPage and WebAnchor process HTML documents, allowing users to
create online indexes for these documents.  AnchorPage and WebAnchor, however, do
not convert existing index entries in RTF documents.
<p>
<LI><b>Q:</b>  Which product(s) do I use to produce an index for a word processed
document?<br>
<b>A:</b>  Indexicon works as an add-on for both MS Word and WordPerfect.
Back-of-the-book style indexes can be produced in minutes where manual indexing
would take hours.  Users can implement the Entry Editor and/or use &quot;control
lists&quot; to improve the quality of the output.
<p>
<LI><b>Q:</b>  Do I need Win32s to run any of the programs?<br>
<b>A:</b>  If you are using one of our 32-bit applications with a 16-bit operating
system (such as Windows 3.1x), you will need to install Win32s in order to run the
program.  Win32s can be downloaded from the Iconovex website at
http://www.iconovex.com/TECHSUPP.HTM or from the Microsoft site at http://www.microsoft.com.

<h3>ICONOVEX'S ECHOSEARCH WINS BYTE MAGAZINE'S BEST OF COMDEX AWARD</h3>
</center>
<P>

<B><I>Marks Second Straight Spring Comdex Win</B></I><B>
<P>

<P>

</B><B></B>Chicago, IL -- June 5, 1996 -- Byte Magazine today announced that
<B> Iconovex Corporation</B> has won its second straight Best of Comdex/
Spring Award.  The award was presented to Iconovex, recognizing its new
product, <B>EchoSearch, </B>as Best Internet Product.  At Spring Comdex 1995
in Atlanta, GA, Iconovex's <B>AnchorPage</B> won the same award in the Best
Development Software category.  Iconovex Corporation is a subsidiary of
Innovex, Inc. (NASDAQ: INVX), a leading producer of lead wire assemblies for
the thin film disk drive market.
<P>

EchoSearch is an intelligent desktop-based search engine tool for browsers
of the Web that significantly improves the speed and accuracy of searches.
A simple, yet powerful tool, EchoSearch is ideal for <I>all</I> users
searching the Internet or a corporate Intranet for information.  EchoSearch
is one of the first truly &quot;full blown&quot; Java applications.  It
makes use of the programming language's multi-threading capabilities,
enabling users to simultaneously query multiple search engines.  Unlike
other search engines, EchoSearch features an intelligent back-end that can
index and accurately summarize the documents gathered, avoiding the
necessity of the user downloading entire sets of documents in order to
ascertain the relevance to the query.
<P>

&quot;We are quite excited that EchoSearch was recognized for its
innovative technology by such a distinguished, highly regarded publication,
&quot; says Bernardo Sotomayor, vice president and general manager of
Iconovex. &quot;We are fortunate in having made the decision two years ago
to embrace the Web, and the Internet in general, as our primary target
platforms.&quot;
<P>

Byte's Best of COMDEX awards program has become a time honored tradition in
the computer industry after eight years of presentations.  In evaluating
products, Byte editors search out
innovative new products that show strong potential to influence and impact
the computer industry worldwide.
<P>

&quot;Byte Magazine reaches a large number of technology professionals that
are constantly searching  and sifting through the wealth of information that
is available online,&quot; adds Sotomayor.  &quot;These users are in need of
a tool that can help them sort through and find relevant information.
EchoSearch addresses this need with a tool that will not only find
information, but synthesize and distill it as well.&quot;
<P>

EchoSearch will be available in July, 1996 for a suggested retail price of $
49.95.  For additional information, contact Iconovex Corporation at 800-94
3-0292, on the Web at http://www.iconovex.com, or via E-mail at fyi@
iconovex.com.  EchoSearch joins the highly acknowledged Iconovex product
line, which includes AnchorPage&#174;, WebAnchor&#153;, and SWAPI&#153;, all
of which are based on Syntactica&#174;, Iconovex's proprietary indexing and
abstracting engine.

<h2>Iconovex Corp. Introduces EchoSearch Web Software</h2>
<P>

<B><I>The First Truly Intelligent Desktop Search Tool</B></I></center>
<P>

<P>

<I>Bloomington, MN - </I>Iconovex Corporation, makers of software
that understands ideas, announces <B>EchoSearch</B>, an intelligent
desktop-based search engine tool for browsers of the Web that significantly
improves the speed and accuracy of their searches. A simple, yet powerful
tool, <B>EchoSearch </B>is ideal for all users searching the Internet or a
corporate Intranet for information.
<P>

&quot;With the wealth of information available today online, millions of
users of the Internet and corporate Intranets need a tool to help sort
through and find relevant information,&quot; states Bernardo Sotomayor, vice
president and general manager of Iconovex.  &quot;<B>EchoSearch</B>
addresses the needs of those users, with a tool that will not only find
information, but synthesize and distill it.&quot;
<P>

Making use of Java's multi-threading capabilities, <B>EchoSearch</B> enables
users to simultaneously query multiple search engines.  Unlike other Web
search tools, <B>EchoSearch</B> features an intelligent back-end that can
index and accurately summarize the documents that are gathered in response
to the query.
<P>

Once the complete hit list has been built, <B>EchoSearch </B>again uses Java
's multi-threading capabilities to simultaneously download the documents AND
to process them linguistically, extracting the important phrases and ideas.
The resulting indexes and
summaries are then matched against the user's original query and the user is
presented with a condensed view that contains only the most relevant
entries.  These entries are then hyperlinked to their occurrences in the
original documents.
<P>

After viewing search results, a user has the option of refining the original
search by returning to the <B>EchoSearch </B>interface and clicking on the
&quot;<I>Refine Search</I>&quot; button. When this alternative is selected,
the program then displays another subset view of the refined query on the
initial global views (documents/hits that were found the first time).
<P>

&quot;Today's typical search engine is only capable of returning document
names and maybe the first sentence or two, thereby leaving end-users with
the time-consuming task of examining each hit individually,&quot; adds
Sotomayor. &quot;Our <B>EchoSearch </B>software takes searching to the
document content level by automatically collecting the summaries and indexes
that match the original query, thus improving both the speed and accuracy of
the search.&quot;
<P>

<B>EchoSearch </B>will be available July 1, 1996 for a suggested retail
price of  <B>$49.95</B>.  For additional information contact Iconovex
Corporation at 800-943-0292, on the Web at http://www.iconovex.com, or via

<H2>ANNOUNCING WEBANCHOR</H2>


</B><B><I>Iconovex's Latest Addition to Its 
Suite of Organizational Tools</center>

<P>

</B></I>
<P>

<I>April 29, 1996 </I><I></I><I> </I>Bloomington, MN  <B>Iconovex
Corporation</B>, makers of software that understands ideas, has announced
the release of <B>WebAnchor</B>  an organizational tool that creates
hyperlinked back-of-the-book style indexes for RTF or HTML formatted
documents found on the World Wide Web, Local Area Networks, and your
desktop.  WebAnchor creates a personal Web of ideas for end-users, making it
easy to navigate through content-rich documents and access desired
information quickly.  For less than $50, users can quickly organize large
amounts of information within a hypertext environment.
<P>

WebAnchor analyzes RTF or HTML documents, generates an index that organizes
the information in those documents, and then automatically creates hypertext
links from the index to the original documents so that the information is
instantly accessible.  WebAnchor, which is based on Iconovex's proprietary
parsing technology, uses syntactical rules and semantic weight-in-context
not statistical analysis based on word frequency  to analyze written text
and extract the significant words, phrases and ideas.  The amount of
information contained in the index can be controlled through a simple Level
of Detail setting, making it possible to create fully detailed indexes for
individual documents or a high-level overview index of an entire Web site.

<P>


The big advantage WebAnchor offers is organization.  For the 10 million Web
browsers today, there is now a way to take HTML documents downloaded off the
Web, as well as documents on a personal computer, and organize them with an
index.  Instead of spending hours reading online, users can download
documents to their hard drive and let WebAnchor create a hyperlinked index
for quick and easy document navigation.
<P>

WebAnchor also offers advantages to Web developers, lessening the burden of
maintaining and linking information on both large and small web sites.  Web
site users will be able to jump directly from the familiar, intuitive form
of a back-of-the-book index to the source documents without having to
traverse intermediate menus or use a search engine with Boolean operators
and rules on capitalization to remember.  In addition, WebAnchor may also be
used to create a fully indexed and hyperlinked online help system.
<P>

&quot;We provide a fully automatic tool that will be indispensable for Web
users and developers,&quot; says Bart Davis, product marketing manager for
Iconovex.  &quot;WebAnchor creates an index from which the user can jump to
important terms and concepts in the source documents, saving valuable time.
&quot;
<P>

WebAnchor joins the Iconovex product line which includes <B>Syntactica&#174;
</B>,<B> </B>the
</B>proprietary indexing and summary engine which is the basis for <B>
Indexicon&#174;, </B>Iconovex's automatic indexing software for word
processors, and <B>AnchorPage&#174;</B>, the only automatic indexing,
summarizing, and hyperlinking software for corporate Intranets and External
Web sites.
<P>

WebAnchor is available through premier resellers and distributors with a s
uggested retail price of $49.95.  Direct orders can also be made by
contacting the Iconovex Corporation at (800) 943-0292, by email at fyi@
iconovex.com or on the Web at http://www.iconovex.com.  ICONOVEX Corporation
is a software development company and wholly-owned subsidiary of INNOVEX,
Inc. (NASDAQ: INVX), the world's largest manufacturer of lead-wire
assemblies for the thin-film disk drive market.

<h2>NEW SYNTACTICA WEB API (SWAPI) FROM ICONOVEX CORP.</h2>
<P>

<B><I>Versatile, Easy-to-use API Enables Internet Software
Developers to <br>Quickly Create Web Applications</B></I></center>

<p>
<I>Bloomington, MN - </I>Iconovex Corporation, makers of software
that understands ideas, presents <B>Syntactica Web API (SWAPI)</B>, a
revolutionary technology that now enables Internet software developers to
prototype or develop new navigational tools in just a matter of days.
Featuring a very high level API that is based on Syntactica, Iconovex's
proprietary parsing and linguistic analysis engine, <B>SWAPI </B>is a
complete software development tool kit that offers developers unparalleled
ease-of-use and flexibility in creating both proof-of-concepts and complete
applications.
<P>

<B>SWAPI </B>is a C-language interface to a library that enables client
applications to perform linguistic analysis of HTML data and then
automatically hyperlink the various forms of linguistic output back to the
original source data. Hyperlinking is accomplished using standard HTML 2.0
conventions, and can be read by any HTML 2.0 compliant browser.  In
addition, <B>SWAPI </B>is capable of processing both ASCII and RTF file
formats.
<P>

&quot;<B>SWAPI </B>was developed so that software developers can create a
proof-of-concept within days instead of weeks or months,&quot; states Bart
Davis, product marketing manager for Iconovex.  '<B>SWAPI </B>will give
software developers the best tool available to automatically extract
significant phrases and ideas in their Internet/Intranet applications.&quot;

<P>


Four related, yet distinct linguistic outputs can be generated through <B>
SWAPI </B><B></B><B> </B>indexes, concepts, summary, and headings (table of
contents).  The developer's application can potentially request any
combination or all of the outputs simultaneously, and each output can be
adjusted individually for level of detail.
<P>

Indexes are the key words and phrases of the document in alphabetical order,
<I> not</I> a simple inverted word list. Concepts begin with the same
information as indexes (concept heads), and then expand that information to
offer a quick glimpse at the context in which the key words or phrases are
used (concept bodies).  The summary is a sequential presentation of the
significant ideas in a document rendered in the language of the original
text; headings provide a table of contents view of the document.
<P>

<B>SWAPI </B>also supports circular links, optional hypertext links that are
created within the source document that allow the browser to jump from one
instance of an index entry to the next instance of that index entry. Plus,
SWAPI Client Applications can operate in either File mode or Stream mode.
In File mode, the client specifies the HTML data as a set of files to be
processed and SWAPI supplies the processed data in set of files; in Stream
mode the client specifies the HTML data as a stream of bytes and SWAPI
supplies the processed data as a stream of bytes.
<P>

<B>SWAPI </B>is currently supported on Windows NT/95, Windows 3.x, Solaris
2.x, and Solaris 2.x for 80x86.  And, Macintosh support is planned for later
in 1996.

<P>

For additional <B>SWAPI</B> information or a price quotation, software
developers can contact Iconovex Corporation at 800-943-0292, or via E-mail
at fyi@iconovex.com.  SWAPI joins the highly acclaimed Iconovex product
line, which includes <B>AnchorPage</B><B></B><B> for Windows</B>, <B>
Syntactica</B><B></B>, the proprietary indexing engine which is the basis
for both SWAPI and the AnchorPage program, and <B>Indexicon</B><B></B>, the
only fully automatic indexing tool for word processors.

<B>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
<P><CENTER>
<i>ICONOVEX OFFERS HYPERTEXT INDEXING SOFTWARE FOR THE WEB AT A NEW LOWER 
PRICE </i></CENTER> <P>
<I></B>
	Bloomington, MN </I>--  ICONOVEX Corporation, leaders in automatic
	indexing and software, today announced it has lowered the price
	of its award winning <b>AnchorPage&#174;</b> software.  The new price
	of AnchorPage of $295, reduced from $895, offers a lower entry
	level price point for companies looking to organize the
	information found on their Web sites and corporate intranets by
	content.  AnchorPage is the only fully automatic hypertext
	indexing and abstracting software for use on Internet and
	corporate Webs.  This hypertext indexing is the foundation for
	<i><b>Content-Driven Navigation (CDN).</i></b>  Using CDN,
	users of a Web site will no longer have to aimlessly browse for
	information.  CDN provides a way for users to locate
	information, by content, quickly and easily and it increases
	the usability of that information.<p>  "With the tremendous
	expansion in the interest of the AnchorPage product and the
	idea of Content Driven Navigation, we have decided to lower the
	price of the software in order to increase its distribution,"
	says Bernardo Sotomayor, vice president and general manager of
	Iconovex.  "The lower price point will not only expand
	AnchorPage's market share, but also continue in increasing the
	acceptance of CDN as the standard for locating information both
	on the World Wide Web and internal corporate Web sites."<p>
	AnchorPage is unique in its use of true linguistic analysis to
	extract the significant phrases, concepts, and ideas from HTML
	documents.  By applying the rules of the English language and
	analyzing the individual words in their context, AnchorPage is
	able to "read" and understand HTML documents and provide
	concise synopses of the information contained within.  The
	software then automatically creates four different navigational
	views of the information (Table of Contents, Phrase, Concept,
	and Abstract Views).  These views are then hyperlinked from the
	index/abstract entry to its occurrence in the source text.<p>
	"AnchorPage is a true breakthrough in the way information will
	 be viewed on the Web," adds Sotomayor. "The current method of
finding information involves downloading and reading entire documents
on-line to find what you're searching for -- a very time consuming
chore.  A site that has been <b>AnchorPage'd</b> will provide visitors with
hyper-linked indexes of the relevant, significant phrases and concepts
from the information found at the site.  It is a content-driven search
of the site."  <p>Web site administrators decrease the system resources
	used by search engines while delivering content-rich
	information faster and easier.  They gain time savings by not
	having to manually read, index and abstract the text of their
	documents and then create all of the HTML tags.<p>  Included with
	AnchorPage are <B>RTFact&#153;</B> - a powerful RTF to HTML converter, and
	<b>LexEDIT&#153;</b> - a utility that allows users to customize the
	indexing output.  AnchorPage is available through premiere
	resellers and distributors, direct by contacting Iconovex
	Corporation at 800-943-0292, or by email at <A 
HREF="mailto:fyi@iconovex.com">fyi@iconovex.com</a>.
	You can also find both <a href="ANCHORPG.HTM">AnchorPage 
Demonstrations</a> and a <a href="/THEBEST.HTM">Listing of other sites 
using AnchorPage to their advantage</a>. AnchorPage joins the Iconovex 
product
	line, which includes <b>Syntactica&#174;</b>, the proprietary
	indexing engine which is the basis for the AnchorPage program
	and <b>Indexicon&#174;</b>, the only fully automatic indexing tool
	for word processors. <p> Iconovex Corporation is a software
	development company and wholly-owned subsidiary of Innovex,

     <center><H3>INTERLEAF AND ICONOVEX ANNOUNCE TECHNOLOGY AND
     MARKETING PARTNERSHIP</H3></center>
<P><BLOCKQUOTE>
        <I>Bloomington, MN</I> -- Iconovex Corporation, the leader in
	automatic indexing software, and Interleaf, Inc., the leader in
	document management and publishing, have announced a technology
	partnership and a marketing agreement for all World Wide Web
	servers and for corporations using webs to distribute
	information internally.  The companies are working together,
	using complementary technologies to address the critical
	problem of building corporate webs and Internet World Wide Web
	sites that are well organized, manageable and easy to use.<p>
	The Interleaf-Iconovex partnership provides turn-key publishing
	solutions for all World Wide Web servers.  The companies are
	working together, using complementary technology to solve the
	problems of Internet publishing, navigation and information
	retrieval on the Web.  Interleaf's <b><i>Cyberleaf&#174;</i></b> and
     Iconovex's <b><i>AnchorPage&#153;</i></b> are two of the hottest
     products available in the fast-growing market for Web publishing
     and navigation software.<p>  Interleaf's product, Cyberleaf 1.0
     for UNIX, was released in February of 1995.  Cyberleaf is a
     software package that streamlines the process of publishing
     information on the World Wide Web.  It contains push-button
	technology that automatically transforms documents created with
	popular word processing applications into Internet-ready webs
	of information, without requiring users to learn tedious HTML
	code.  Cyberleaf goes beyond document conversion by also
	providing a complete Web production environment, including
	functionality for hyperlinking between various file types and
	for managing and updating multiple webs.<p>  Iconovex has
	recently introduced a new product called AnchorPage, the first
	title in a new line of software for the World Wide Web.
	AnchorPage is the only fully automatic hypertext indexing
	software for the Web.  This hypertext indexing is the
	foundation for <i><b>Content-Driven Navigation (CDN)</i></b>.
	Using CDN, users of a Web site will no longer have to aimlessly
	browse for information.  CDN provides a way for users to locate
	information, by content, on the Web quickly and easily.
	AnchorPage was the winner of a Byte Best of Comdex award in the
	Best New Development Software category at Spring Comdex 1995 in
	Atlanta, GA.  <p>
        "Enabling our customers to get the right information to the
	right person at the right time is our mission," says Bill
	Zoellick, director of business development at Interleaf.  "Web
	sites are an ideal way to do that, but only if they are a well
	structured publication rather than a collection of pages.  The
	combination of these two products allows customers to achieve
	that goal."    "<p>We feel that the partnership between
	Iconovex and Interleaf will be quite significant for all World
	Wide Web servers and people navigating the Web," adds Thomas
	Haley, Chairman and CEO of Innovex Corporation, Iconovex's
	parent company.  "We are collaborating to expand the reach of
	our resources, disseminate information on our technologies to
	the marketplace, and provide Web administrators with the best
	tools to create higher quality Web sites for the end user."
	<p>Cyberleaf is now available at a price of $1495 for Digital
	Equipment, Hewlett-Packard, IBM and Sun workstations.
	Cyberleaf 2.0 for Windows NT will be available during 1995.
	Cyberleaf is available through all distribution channels, VARs,
	Access Graphics and Merisel, direct from Interleaf by calling
	(800) 955-5323, or through email at i-direct@ileaf.com.
	<p>AnchorPage sells for $895 and is currently compatible with
	Windows. During the third quarter of 1995, Iconovex will
	release versions of AnchorPage for Solaris 2.4, Windows NT and
	Windows 95.  AnchorPage is available through premiere
	resellers, distributors or direct by contacting Iconovex
	Corporation at (800) 943-0292, or email at fyi@iconovex.com.
	<p>Interleaf (NASDAQ: LEAF), the leading worldwide supplier of
	document management solutions, provides a suite of software and
	services that automate information-intensive business
	processes.  Interleaf's integrated product line includes
	advanced software for electronic document preparation,

</H2><P><EM>Sites with information, software, and more. Some have multiple
links to other useful sites.</EM>

<P><A href="http://WWW.Stars.com/">The Web Developer's Virtual Library</A>

<BLOCKQUOTE>An excellent, comprehensive collection of links, tools, applications,
useful sites and collections of graphics for Web page development.  Get
ready to spend some time exploring here; there's a lot to cover, but it's
well laid-out.

</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<A href="http://netvet.wustl.edu/hotlist.htm">Ken Boschert's Hotlist</A>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This is a <B>colossal</B> collection of Internet, Web, and HTML
related sites, put together by Ken Boschert, DVM, at Washington
University.  It's a bit overwhelming at times, but there are many extremely
useful links.

</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<A HREF="http://www.ski.mskcc.org:80/browserwatch/">BrowserWatch</a>
<BLOCKQUOTE>A good place to keep up on the latest version of a large 
number of popular Web browsers.  This site keeps up-to-date records of 
the latest versions and, in some cases, brief reviews and rumors about 
different browsers.

</BLOCKQUOTE><P>


<A name="2"></A>
<H2>HTML Documentation

</H2><P><EM>Specifications, descriptions, backgrounds.</EM>

<P><A HREF=http://www.iconovex.com/HTML.HTM>What is
HTML?</A><!-- Remember to change this to d| -->

<BLOCKQUOTE>A very brief description and simple abstract of HTML.

</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<P><A href="http://www.w3.org/hypertext/WWW/MarkUp/MarkUp.html">
Overview of HTML</A>

<BLOCKQUOTE>A large, rather technical overview from the Internet Engineering
Task Force (IETF). It describes the original purpose of HTML and gives some
of the original designs and schematics of HTML version 1.

</BLOCKQUOTE><P><A href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/html/rfc1866.txt">HTML 2.0</A><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>A large (about 120k) text file that gives all the technical
schematics for HTML version 2.

</BLOCKQUOTE><P><A href="http://www.hpl.hp.co.uk/people/dsr/html3/CoverPage.html">HTML
3.0</A><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The cover page to a hypertext document giving the specifications
for HTML version 3.

</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<img src="NEW_TINY.GIF"><a 
href="http://www.w3.org/pub/WWW/MarkUp/Wilbur">HTML 3.2 at a glance</a><br>
<blockquote>Fresh from the presses of the World Wide Web Consortium, here 
is an overview of the latest specifications of the latest "official" 
version of HTML (relief for those of us who were wondering which way 
Netscape was going to go and which way Microsoft was going to 
go).</blockquote><p>

<A href="http://home.netscape.com/assist/net_sites/index.html">Netscape's
General Information Site</A><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>A good general site for documentation, editors, and instruction
about HTML. There are some good utilities here, under "Developers' Tools,"
including GIF converters, and MapEdit and WebMap (two handy utilities for
creating image-maps).

</BLOCKQUOTE><P><A HREF=http://www.iconovex.com/ISOCHART.HTM>Character
Chart</A><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This is a rather handy table that gives the HTML code values
for a number of slightly non-standard ASCII characters (you never know when
you might want to include a &#165;, a &reg;, or a &Ccedil; in your document).

</BLOCKQUOTE><P><A name="3"></A>

<H2>HTML Tools

</H2><P><EM>Converters, editors, viewers, and the like.</EM>

<P>

<P><A href="http://www.yahoo.com/Computers/World_Wide_Web/HTML_Editors/MS_Windows/">HTML
Editors</A><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>A nice collection of HTML editors for many platforms, and more
links to other collections.

</BLOCKQUOTE><P><A
href="http://WWW.Stars.com/Vlib/Providers/HTML_Editors.html">Windows
Editors</A><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>A collection of HTML editors specifically for Windows, from The
Web Developer's Virtual Library. Most are shareware or freeware.

</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<A href="http://www.microsoft.com/msoffice/freestuf/msword/download/ia/ia1z/default.htm">
Microsoft's Internet Assistant for Word 6.0a&reg; </A>

<BLOCKQUOTE>This is Microsoft's addition for MS Word&reg; , turning it into
an HTML browser/editor. You do need Word 6.0a, but if you only have 6.0,
this page also can lead you to the patch/upgrade program for 6.0a. Be warned:
this site can be hard to get to; you may get mysterious error messages that
are simply roundabout ways of saying "too busy, try later."

</BLOCKQUOTE><P>
<A href="http://wp.novell.com/elecpub/inttoc.htm">Internet Publisher for
WordPerfect for Windows&reg; 6.1</A>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Not to be outdone, Novell has released Internet Publisher, which
allows
you to view and edit HTML files in WordPerfect for Windows (although you
may have to deal with WP's new "Envoy" format as an interim step).

</BLOCKQUOTE><P>


<P><A href="http://www.yahoo.com/Computers/World_Wide_Web/HTML_Converters/">A
Collection of Converters at the Yahoo site</A>

<BLOCKQUOTE>A large collection of programs useful for converting documents
from many different sources into HTML documents. Yahoo is also an excellent
starting point for general Web browsing.

</BLOCKQUOTE><P><A HREF=http://www.iconovex.com/HTMLCON.ZIP>HTMLCON.ZIP</A>

<BLOCKQUOTE>A simple DOS utility that can change HTML files into straight
ASCII text; this can be useful, as most Web Browsers only allow you to save
documents in HTML form.

</BLOCKQUOTE>

<a href="http://www.tucows.com/">Ultimate Collection of Winsock Software</a>
<BLOCKQUOTE>As the name might suggest, a sizeable collection of Winsock 
utilities.  Lots of good shareware related to web browsing and 
creating/enhancing HTML.
</BLOCKQUOTE>


<H2><A name="4">HTML Discussion Groups and Style Guides</A>

</H2><P><EM>Newsgroups, discussion centers, the IETF (Internet Engineering
Task Force).</EM>

<P><A href="http://www.ics.uci.edu/pub/ietf/html">The IETF HTML Working
Page</A>

<BLOCKQUOTE>These are some of the people who determine Internet Protocols
and the way we see the Web. Here are a number of discussion documents, including
notes from their conferences.

</BLOCKQUOTE><P><A href="http://info.med.yale.edu/caim/StyleManual_Top.HTML">Web
Style Manual</A>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The Center for Advanced Instructional Media at Yale has put together
this manual for designing WWW pages. While it can offer a number of insights,
it is <U>not</U> an instruction manual for HTML (although the
<STRONG>resources</STRONG> link on this page can point you to such manuals).

</BLOCKQUOTE><P><A href="http://www.utoronto.ca/webdocs/HTMLdocs/NewHTML/intro.html">A
Manual of HTML</A>

<BLOCKQUOTE>A hyper-text book, in effect a comprehensive collection of documents,
of varying age, found at the University of Toronto. It covers many aspects
of HTML and writing solid HTML documents. Some good advice and also a nice
collection of helper applications and tools.

</BLOCKQUOTE><P><A href="http://oneworld.wa.com/htmldev/devpage/dev-page4.html">Papers
and Conferences</A><BR>

<BLOCKQUOTE>A collection of papers and conferences about HTML and the World
Wide Web in general. There's also a link back to OneWorld Information Services,
a nice jumping-off point for Web information and Web page development.

</BLOCKQUOTE><P>

<H2><A name="5">HTML Validators</A></h2>
<i>Sites that check your web pages, some just spellcheck, others make 
sure you're using good HTML code.  Note: most on-line validators are 
very strict and "literal-minded."  Sometimes they may tag 
something as "wrong," but it will still work, it just doesn't 
adhere perfectly to the rules of HTML.</i><p> 
<a href="http://www2.imagiware.com/RxHTML/">Dr. HTML</a>
<blockquote>A powerful on-line HTML validation site that allows you to 
type in a URL and then select the aspects of your web page that you wish to 
test (table structure, spelling, check the hyperlinks).</blockquote><p>

<a href="http://www.goldendome.net/Tools/WebSter/">WebSter's Dictionary</a>
<blockquote>Purely an on-line spellchecker, but a good one.  Just enter 
the URL of the page you want to check, and it generates a form 
with any suspect words, and suggestions for alternate spellings.</blockquote>

<HTML><HEAD><TITLE>The Net Magazine Review</title></head><body>
<h1>The Net</h1><hr> 
<blockquote><I>Taken from "Blue Grrl's"
review found in the September 1995 issue of 
<B>The Net</B></i><UL><h2>software/<br>hardware</h2><p>&#160;&#160;..As we 
noted then 
(August issue of "The Net"), AnchorPage-built sites let those who 
log onto them search for what they're looking for and quickly find it. 
Now, after I've subjected it to a full-fledged test, I have to say that 
AnchorPage delivers on its promise (and I was even using a beta 
version).<br>&#160;&#160;<B>Yes it's amazing. Revolutionary. Extraordinary. 
Exceptional. If you run a Web site that's fat with text-based 
information, you absolutely need to write out a check for $895. Now. I 
kid you not.</B><br>&#160;&#160;O.K., so what does this miracle software do? 
It reads a document, analyzes the test by sorting which items (you can 
control these values) are most significant, and then creates a table of 
comtents, a "concept" page, and an "abstract." Amazingly enough, it 
works. It's also fully automatic; fast (300 words per second); and gives 
you the power to customize priorities.<BR>. . .<BR>&#160;&#160;The program 
seemed a 
bit menacing to me at first, but a brief look at the manual and a little 
trial and error got me off and running pretty quickly. The software comes 
with some samples, which are also found at the Web site, I recommend that 
you take a long, hard look at these samples; they'll help you understand 
the concept much faster than any manual could. Also, Iconovex is so sure 
of its product that if you send in an HTML or RTF document via disk or 
e-mail, it will run it through AnchorPage and send it back to you, fully 
indexed, so you'll see first hand the miracles of this intelligent 
document handling. Give it a whirl. It is worth it.

Yamada<br>San Mateo, Calif.<hr>Information on the Internet typically

The company's AnchorPage software categorizes and indexes text documents 
for use on the World Wide Web. According to the company, the software 
relies on its ability to recognize and understand words and phrases in 
context, then automatically creates lists of those words and builds 
hyperlinks to the exact location in the text where they can be 
found.<br><b>. . .</b><BR>(emphasis added --ed.)</ul>*Excerpted with

at a rate of about 300 words per second, contain entries based
on keywords or phrases similar to a book index, which is then
used to automatically create hyperlinks between elements of the

<I>Bloomington, MN -- July 7, 1995 --</I>  ICONOVEX Corporation, leaders in
automatic indexing software, today began shipping <B>AnchorPage</B>, the
first title in a new line of software for the World Wide Web.  AnchorPage is
the only fully automatic hypertext indexing software for the World Wide Web.
This hypertext indexing is the foundation for <B><I>Content-Driven

site will no longer have to aimlessly browse for information.  CDN provides
a way for users to locate information, by content, on the Web quickly and
easily.<P>AnchorPage is built from ICONOVEX's <A 
HREF="/SYNTAC.HTM"><B>Syntactica&#174;</B>
engine</A> that incorporates the linguistic, semantic and syntactic rules 
of the
English language to &quot;read&quot; HTML documents.  AnchorPage then
extracts the significant phrases and concepts and automatically creates the
HTML links from those phrases and concepts to their occurrences within the
source document.  Finally, AnchorPage generates four <I>Content-Driven
Navigation</I> views of the documents (Table of Contents, Abstract, Phrase,
and Concept views). 
<P>&quot;AnchorPage is a true breakthrough in the way information will be
viewed on the World Wide Web,&quot; states Robert Griggs, Vice President of
Sales and Marketing for ICONOVEX.  &quot;The current method of finding
information involves downloading and reading the entire document(s) on-line
to find what you're searching for -- a very time-consuming chore.  A site
that has been <B>AnchorPaged</B> will provide visitors with hyperlinked
indexes of the significant phrases and concepts from the information found
at the site.  It is a content-driven search of that site.&quot;
<P>Web site administrators gain time savings by not having to manually read,
index and abstract the text of their documents and then create all of the
HTML tags.  AnchorPage makes delivering information on the Web faster and
more reliable.<P> During the 3rd quarter of 1995, <A 
HREF="/ICONOVEX.HTM">ICONOVEX</A> will release
AnchorPage for Solaris 2.4 (UNIX), Windows NT and the new Windows '95

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE

<CENTER><H3>INNOVEX JOINS FORCES WITH JDL TECHNOLOGIES TO DISTRIBUTE AWARD
        WINNING ANCHORPAGE SOFTWARE</H3></CENTER>

August 4, 1995--Hopkins, MN--Innovex Inc. (NASDAQ: INVX) today announced
that its wholly-owned subsidiary, Iconovex, has reached an agreement with
JDL Technologies, Inc., whereby JDL Technologies will be the sole distributor
of Innovex's AnchorPage technology to the K-12 education market.
        <p>
JDL Technologies provides sophisticated and affordable networking and
Internet solutions exclusively to the education market and is the
exclusive distributor of such products as Netscape Communications
products for the education market.
        <p>
AnchorPage, the first title in a new
line of software for the World Wide Web, is the only fully automatic
hyperlinking and indexing software for the World Wide Web.  This hypertext
indexing is the foundation for Content-Driven Navigation (CDN).  Using
CDN, users of a Web site will no longer have to aimlessly browse for
information.  CDN provides a way for users to locate information, by
content, on the Web quickly and easily.  AnchorPage was the winner of
Byte Magazine's Best of Comdex Award for Best New Development Software at
Spring Comdex in April, 1995.
        <p>  "This product is a very powerful, robust
tool for educators to use in creating and maintaining World Wide Web
sites for their schools," says Tom Lapping, President of JDL
Technologies.  "When AnchorPage is used in conjunction with products like
the Netscape server software, educators can provide their colleagues with
secure, instantaneous, rich environments on the Web.  We are excited
about working with individual schools and
school districts and helping them solve their document access problems
with this breakthrough product."
        <p>During the third quarter of 1995,
Iconovex will release AnchorPage for Solaris 2.4 (UNIX), Windows NT and
the new Windows '95 operating system platforms.  With the great response 
and acceptance of the AnchorPage technology, this broadening of the
platform base will continue the accelerated growth of AnchorPage.
<p>AnchorPage is a Windows application that requires Microsoft Windows 
3.1 or
Windows for Workgroups 3.1 or later.  It processes HTML documents and
requires 8 MB of RAM to function efficiently.

<center><B>AnchorPage</b></center><p>FOR IMMEDIATE 
RELEASE<center><h3>ANNOUNCING JOINT
TECHNOLOGY PARTNERSHIP WITH CORNERSTONE IMAGING, INC.</h3></center><P>
Bloomington, MN.  ICONOVEX Corporation, the leader in automatic
indexing software, announces the integration of its Syntactica
technology into Cornerstone Imaging's powerful Input<I>Accel</i> technology
platform.  Iconovex joins a large group of providers of technology
to this open integration platform used in the document capture
process.<P>
 The Input<I>Accel</I> process is an open integration platform
for the peripherals, engines, and products used in the document
capture process, including image enhancement engines, OCR/ICR
engines, data entry technologies and now <B>Syntactica</B>.  Because
Input<I>Accel</I> provides a straightforward way to connect these
technologies, it is now easier for System Integrators to develop
production document capture systems.  The Input<I>Accel</I> platform
also provides a standardized interface that image-enabled application
developers can use to easily add new document capture functions
to their products.<P>
 With the integration of Syntactica's textual analysis of documents 
processed by Input <I>Accel</I>, the information in a document
or documents is now automatically and electronically indexed,
concept-indexed, and abstracted. The text is transformed into
intelligent and  referenceable documents with the information
contained organized internally, identified, and made retrievable
like never before.<P>
 Syntactica's fast conceptual analysis of text documents, up to
300 words per second, produces any or all of the three outputs:
Concept, Abstract and Phrase indexes.  Syntactica breaks text
down into phrases, using semantic and syntactic analysis to rank
the phrases and produce indexes at the level of detail specified
by the user.<P>
 Syntactica's semantic decisions are based on an extensive lexicon,
or word list.  Specialty lexicons, such as a legal lexicon, can
also be added to enhance the output when processing technical
documents.<P>
 With the joining of these technologies, both companies see user
benefits that will accelerate the implementation and acceptance
of this unique and open platform.
<P>
 Cornerstone Imaging, Inc. is the technology and market leader
in document imaging display products and has recently announced
the Input<i>Accel</i> document capture product.  Cornerstone Imaging,
Inc. is a publicly held company traded on the NASDAQ National
Market under the symbol CRNR.<P>
 ICONOVEX Corporation is a software development company and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of INNOVEX, Inc., the world's leading
manufacturer of lead-wire assemblies for the thin film disk drive
market.

FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<P>
<center><h3>ICONOVEX'S ANCHORPAGE WINS BYTE'S "BEST OF COMDEX"
AWARD</h3></center> <P>
 Atlanta, GA, April 26, 1995.  Byte Magazine announced Iconovex
Corporation as the winner of the 1995 Best of Comdex/Spring Award
in the category of  Best Development Software for their new software
program, AnchorPage.<P>
 The AnchorPage program extracts the significant phrases and concepts
from either a single World Wide Web document or a collection of
such documents and automatically inserts hypertext anchors for
each of these phrases and concepts.  Its fast conceptual analysis
of HTML documents produces any or all of four synopses: Concept,
Abstract and Phrase Pages, as well as a Table of Contents Page.
 The entries within these synopsis pages become &quot;hot words&quot;
with automatic links to the passages in the documents from which
they were generated.  This allows readers to quickly and easily
skim any of the AnchorPage-generated synopses for items of interest
and to call up the pertinent document with the click of a mouse.
<P> &quot;We are very excited that AnchorPage was recognized for
its innovative technology by such a distinguished, highly regarded
publication, &quot; says Robert Griggs, Vice President of Sales
and Marketing for Iconovex.<P> Byte's &quot;Best of Comdex&quot; awards
program is a time-honored tradition in the computer industry after seven
years of presentations.  In evaluating products, Byte editors seek out
innovative new products that show strong potential to influence and
impact the computer industry worldwide.<P>
 &quot;We have a really strong core development group that has
worked together on this project since its inception,&quot; states
Bernardo Sotomayor, Vice President and General Manager of Iconovex.
&quot;That close team effort has just begun to pay off with 
AnchorPage.&quot;<P>
 AnchorPage sells for $295 and is available through a select group
of resellers and integrators.  It can be ordered direct by calling
Iconovex Corporation at 800-943-0292, through e-mail at Compuserve 74064,440
and FYI@iconovex.com or by accessing their Web site at 
http://www.iconovex.com.
Sales, technical inquiries and product information requests may be directed
to the above numbers or to Iconovex Corporation at 7900 Xerxes Ave.
South, Suite 550, Bloomington, MN  55431.
<P> AnchorPage joins the ICONOVEX product line which includes Syntactica,
Indexicon, and LexEdit. Syntactica's linguistic analysis is the
basis for the AnchorPage program and its core technology is available
for developers in an API.  Indexicon is Iconovex's automatic indexing
software program for word processors, and  LexEdit is an add-on
tool that allows users to create personal word lists for all of
Iconovex's programs.
<P> Iconovex Corporation is a software development company and a
wholly-owned subsidiary of INNOVEX, Inc., the world's leading
manufacturer of lead-wire assemblies for the thin film disk drive
market.

<center><b>AnchorPage</b></center><p>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE
<center><h3>ICONOVEX ANNOUNCES FULL PRODUCT COMPATIBILITY WITH NETSCAPE
COMMUNICATIONS</h3></center> <P>
Bloomington, MN.  ICONOVEX Corporation, the leader in automatic
indexing software, announces the compatibility of <B>AnchorPage</B>,
an automatic hypertext anchoring program which inserts HTML tags
into document databases for the World Wide Web, with Netscape
Communication's Mosaic Netsite Communications Server and the Mosaic
Netsite Commerce Server.<P>
 ICONOVEX and Netscape Communications are committed to providing
the highest level of integration of their respective technologies,
thus bringing the greatest amount of service, performance and
utilization to WWW servers who are using Netsite server software
and AnchorPage.<P>
 AnchorPage's fast conceptual analysis of text documents produces
any or all of four synopses: Concept, Abstract and Phrase Pages, as well
as a Table of Contents Page.  The entries within these synopsis
pages become &quot;hot words&quot; with automatic links to the
passages in the documents from which they were generated.  This 
hypertext linkage allows a reader to quickly skim any of the
AnchorPage-generated synopses for items of interest and to call up the
pertinent document with the click of a mouse.<P>
 &quot;AnchorPage is a true breakthrough
in the way information is found on and accessed from Web servers,&quot;
states Robert Griggs, Vice President of Sales and Marketing for
Iconovex. &quot;The current method involves manual insertion of
HTML tags on the part of a server administrator to create hypertext
links.  Because of time constraints and the increasing volume
of information posted on servers, most documents have links only
to their titles.  AnchorPage links you to the key phrases and
concepts within those documents.&quot;<P>
 AnchorPage makes retrieving information on the World Wide Web
faster and more reliable.  Once a Web site uses AnchorPage to
link all of its documents, users of that Web site will be able
to view synopsis pages of the documents they think may be relevant
to their search, retrieving them in a fraction of the time it
would take to download the entire document.  They can scan the
phrases, concepts, abstracts or table of contents for relevant
information, and upon finding it, click on the appropriate entry
and retrieve the section of the document from which the entry was
generated.<P>
&quot;AnchorPage's real-time HTML tag generation allows publishers
to post documents faster while reducing administration costs,&quot;
states Griggs.  &quot;Easy access to the most recent information
will make any Web site more profitable.&quot;<P>
 Anchor Page is a Windows application that requires Microsoft
Windows 3.1 or Windows for Workgroups 3.1 or later.  It fully
automates concept extraction and hypertext anchoring of HTML documents
and requires 8 MB of RAM to function efficiently.  It can create
hypertext links between documents (as between a home page and
a document) or between related entries within a document.  The
user can select multiple documents to process at once and can
choose any or all four possible outputs:  Table of contents, Phrase
page, Concept page, and Abstract page.  These four output forms
can also be horizontally linked such that an entry in the phrase
page can contain a hypertext link to the related concept entry,
which can also be linked to the related abstract entry.  This  
gives Web servers a full set of options in designing the access
and entry points to the documents in their database.<P>
 AnchorPage joins the ICONOVEX product line which includes Syntactica,
the core technology, available for developers in an API. Syntactica's
linguistic analysis is the basis for the AnchorPage program. Indexicon
is ICONOVEX's  automatic indexing software program for word processors,
and finally LexEdit, an add on tool that allows users to create
personal word lists for Indexicon.<P>
AnchorPage sells for $895 and is available direct by calling
ICONOVEX Corporation at 800-943-0292, accessing their Web site
at <strong>http://www.iconovex.com</strong>, or through e-mail at 
Compuserve 74$
Technical inquiries and product information requests may be
directed to the above numbers or to  ICONOVEX Corporation at

<h3>Initial Release</h3>
<H2><CENTER>AnchorPage</CENTER></H2>
FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE<P>
<CENTER><H2>NEW SOFTWARE AUTOMATICALLY INSERTS HYPERTEXT ANCHORS
INTO DOCUMENTS FOR THE WEB</CENTER> </H2><P>
Bloomington, MN. ICONOVEX Corporation, the leader in automatic
indexing software, announces the release of <B>AnchorPage</B>,
an automatic hypertext anchoring program which inserts HTML tags
into document databases on the World Wide Web.<P>
AnchorPage's fast conceptual analysis of text documents produces

This hypertext linkage allows a reader to skim quickly through
any of the AnchorPage-generated synopses for items of interest
and to call up the pertinent document with the click of a mouse.<P>
&quot;AnchorPage will completely change the way information
is found on and accessed from Web servers by using conceptual navigation,
&quot; states Robert Griggs, Vice President of Sales and Marketing for
Iconovex. &quot;The current method involves manual insertion of HTML
tags on the part of a server administrator to create hypertext links.
Because of time constraints and the increasing volume of information posted
on servers, most documents have links only to their titles. AnchorPage
links you to the key phrases and concepts within those documents.&quot;
<P>
AnchorPage makes retrieving information on the World Wide Web
faster and more reliable. Once a Web site uses AnchorPage to link

and upon finding it, click on the appropriate entry and retrieve
the section of the document from which the entry was generated. 
<P>
&quot;AnchorPage's fully automatic HTML tag generation allows publishers
to post documents faster while keeping administrative overhead at a 
minimum,&qu$
states Sotomayor. &quot;Easy access to the most recent information
will make any Web site more profitable.&quot;
<P>
On the Web, one often finds home pages with vague or undifferentiated
titles in their list of contents. For example:
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<strong><I>Welcome to the Web</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>An Introduction to the Web</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>The Web First-Time User's Guide</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Navigating the Web</I>
</BLOCKQUOTE></strong><P>
Faced with a selection like this, the user is forced to pick at
random, suffer a long wait for the document to be transferred,
and hope for the best. But on Web sites hyperlinked with AnchorPage,
the user will be able to quickly retrieve the synopsis pages of
the document in question and then decide whether the whole document
is worth retrieving.<P>
A Concept Page contains a document's key concepts rotated around
the most significant term in the concept, alphabetized according 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<I>Navigating the Web</I>
to those significant terms. For example, a legal document processed
by AnchorPage contains the following entries on the Concept Page:<P>
<I><B>PROFIT</B></I><P><I>Limited royalties, working interests,
production payments, net <B>PROFIT</B> interests or other interests in
minerals or other natural resources</I><P>
<I>Personal <B>PROFIT</B> or advantage to affiliated or subsidiary
company or association being personal profit to corporate trustee</I>
<P><I><B>PROFIT</B> resulting from change in form of principal </I>

the related abstract entry. This gives Web servers a full set
of options in designing the access and entry points to the documents
in their database.<P>

<P>CIVIL ACTION  No. 96-1458</P>
<P>Before: Sloviter, Chief Judge, United States Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit; Buckwalter and Dalzell, Judges, United States District Court for the
Eastern District of Pennsylvania</P>
<P>June 11, 1996</P>
<P>ADJUDICATION ON MOTIONS FOR PRELIMINARY INJUNCTION</P>
<H1>I.</H1>
<H1>INTRODUCTION</H1>
<H1>Procedural Background</H1>
<P>Before us are motions for a preliminary injunction filed by plaintiffs who
challenge on constitutional grounds provisions of the Communications Decency Act
of 1996 (CDA or &quot;the Act&quot;), which constitutes Title V of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, signed into law by the President on February 8,
1996.(1)  Telecommunications Act of 1996, Pub. L. No. 104-104, &#167; 502, 110
Stat. 56, 133-35.  Plaintiffs include various organizations and individuals who,
inter alia, are associated with the computer and/or communications industries,
or who publish or post materials on the Internet, or belong to various citizen
groups.  See ACLU Complaint (&#182;&#182; 7-26), ALA First Amended Complaint (&#182;&#182;
3, 12-33).  </P>
<P>The defendants in these actions are Janet Reno, the Attorney General of the
United States, and the United States Department of Justice.  For convenience, we
will refer to these defendants as the Government.  Plaintiffs contend that the
two challenged provisions of the CDA that are directed to communications over
the Internet which might be deemed &quot;indecent&quot; or &quot;patently
offensive&quot; for minors, defined as persons under the age of eighteen,
infringe upon rights protected by the First Amendment and the Due Process Clause
of the Fifth Amendment.</P>
<P>Plaintiffs in Civil Action Number 96-963, in which the lead plaintiff is the
American Civil Liberties Union (the ACLU),(2) filed their action in the United

States District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania on the day the
Act was signed, and moved for a temporary restraining order to enjoin
enforcement of these two provisions of the CDA.  On February 15, 1996, following
an evidentiary hearing, Judge Ronald L. Buckwalter, to whom the case had been
assigned, granted a limited temporary restraining order, finding in a Memorandum
that 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(a)(1)(B) (&quot;the indecency provision&quot; of the
CDA) was unconstitutionally vague.  On the same day, Chief Judge Dolores K.
Sloviter, Chief Judge of the United States Court of Appeals for the Third
Circuit, having been requested by the parties and the district court to convene
a three-judge court, pursuant to &#167; 561(a) of the CDA, appointed such a
court consisting of, in addition to Judge Buckwalter, Judge Stewart Dalzell of
the same district, and herself, as the circuit judge required by 28 U.S.C. &#167;
2284.</P>
<P>After a conference with the court, the parties entered into a stipulation,
which the court approved on February 26, 1996, wherein the Attorney General
agreed that:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>she will not initiate any investigations or prosecutions for violations of
47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(d) for conduct occurring after enactment of this provision
until the three-judge court hears Plaintiffs' Motion for Preliminary Injunction
. . . and has decided the motion.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The Attorney General's commitment was qualified to the extent that:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>her full authority to investigate or prosecute any violation of &#167;
223(a)(1)(B), as amended, and &#167; 223(d) as to conduct which occurs or
occurred during any period of time after enactment of these provisions
(including for the period of time to which this stipulation applies) should the
Court deny plaintiffs' motion or, if the motion is granted, should these
provisions ultimately be upheld.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Stipulation, &#182; 4, in C.A. No. 96-963.</P>
<P>Shortly thereafter, the American Library Association, Inc. (the ALA) and
others(3) filed a similar action at C.A. No. 96-1458.  On February 27, 1996,
Chief Judge Sloviter, again pursuant to &#167; 561(a) of the CDA and upon
request, convened the same three-judge court pursuant to 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2284.
The actions were consolidated pursuant to Fed. R. Civ. P. 42(a), &quot;for all
matters relating to the disposition of motions for preliminary injunction in
these cases, including the hearing on such motions.&quot;</P>
<P>The parties were afforded expedited discovery in connection with the motions
for preliminary injunction, and they cooperated with Judge Dalzell, who had been
assigned the case management aspects of the litigation.  While the discovery was
proceeding, and with the agreement of the parties, the court began receiving
evidence at the consolidated hearings which were conducted on March 21 and 22,
and April 1, 12 and 15, 1996.  In order to expedite the proceedings, the parties
worked closely with Judge Dalzell and arranged to stipulate to many of the
underlying facts and to place much of their cases in chief before the court by
sworn declarations, so that the hearings were largely devoted to
cross-examination of certain of the witnesses whose declarations had been filed.
 The parties submitted proposed findings of fact and post-hearing memoranda on
April 29, and the court heard extensive oral argument on May 10, 1996.(4)</P>
<H1>Statutory Provisions at Issue</H1>
<P>Plaintiffs focus their challenge on two provisions of section 502 of the CDA
which amend 47 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 223(a) and 223(d).</P>
<P>Section 223(a)(1)(B) provides in part that any person in interstate or
foreign communications who, &quot;by means of a telecommunications device,&quot;(5)
&quot;knowingly . . . makes, creates, or solicits&quot; and &quot;initiates the
transmission&quot; of &quot;any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image or
other communication which is obscene or indecent, knowing that the recipient of
the communication is under 18 years of age,&quot; &quot;shall be criminally
fined or imprisoned.&quot; (emphasis added).  </P>
<P>Section 223(d)(1) (&quot;the patently offensive provision&quot;), makes it a
crime to use an &quot;interactive computer service&quot;(6) to &quot;send&quot;
or &quot;display in a manner available&quot; to a person under age 18, &quot;any
comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other communication that, in
context, depicts or describes, in terms patently offensive as measured by
contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory activities or organs,
regardless of whether the user of such service placed the call or initiated the
communication.&quot; </P>
<P>Plaintiffs also challenge on the same grounds the provisions in &#167;
223(a)(2) and &#167; 223(d)(2), which make it a crime for anyone to &quot;knowingly
permit[] any telecommunications facility under [his or her] control to be used
for any activity prohibited&quot; in &#167;&#167; 223(a)(1)(B) and 223(d)(1).
The challenged provisions impose a punishment of a fine, up to two years
imprisonment, or both for each offense.  </P>
<P>Plaintiffs make clear that they do not quarrel with the statute to the
extent that it covers obscenity or child pornography, which were already
proscribed before the CDA's adoption.  See 18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1464-65
(criminalizing obscene material); id. &#167;&#167; 2251-52 (criminalizing child
pornography); see also New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982); Miller v.
California, 413 U.S. 15 (1973).</P>
<P>Plaintiffs in the ACLU action also challenge the provision of the CDA that
criminalizes speech over the Internet that transmits information about abortions
or abortifacient drugs and devices, through its amendment of 18 U.S.C. &#167;
1462(c).  That section now prohibits the sending and receiving of information
over the Internet by any means regarding &quot;where, how, or of whom, or by
what means any [drug, medicine, article, or thing designed, adapted, or intended
for producing abortion] may be obtained or made&quot;.  The Government has
stated that it does not contest plaintiffs' challenge to the enforceability of
the provision of the CDA as it relates to 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1462(c).(7) </P>
<P>As part of its argument that the CDA passes constitutional muster, the
Government cites the CDA's &quot;safe harbor&quot; defenses in new &#167; 223(e)
of 47 U.S.C., which provides:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(e) <B>Defenses</B></P>
<P>In addition to any other defenses available by law:</P>
<P>(1) No person shall be held to have violated subsection (a) or (d) of this
section solely for providing access or connection to or from a facility, system,
or network not under that person's control, including transmission, downloading,
intermediate storage, access software, or other related capabilities that are
incidental to providing such access or connection that does not include the
creation of the content of the communication.</P>
<P>(2) The defenses provided by paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not be
applicable to a person who is a conspirator with an entity actively involved in
the creation or knowing distribution of communications that violate this
section, or who knowingly advertises the availability of such communications.</P>
<P>(3) The defenses provided in paragraph (1) of this subsection shall not be
applicable to a person who provides access or connection to a facility, system,
or network engaged in the violation of this section that is owned or controlled
by such person.</P>
<P>(4) No employer shall be held liable under this section for the actions of
an employee or agent unless the employee's or agent's conduct is within the
scope of his or her employment or agency and the employer (A) having knowledge
of such conduct, authorizes or ratifies such conduct, or (B) recklessly
disregards such conduct.</P>
<P>(5) It is a defense to a prosecution under subsection (a)(1)(B) or (d) of
this section, or under subsection (a)(2) of this section with respect to the use
of a facility for an activity under subsection (a)(1)(B) that a person --</P>
<P>(A) has taken, in good faith, reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions
under the circumstances to restrict or prevent access by minors to a
communication specified in such subsections, which may involve any appropriate
measures to restrict minors from such communications, including any method which
is feasible under available technology; or</P>
<P>(B) has restricted access to such communication by requiring use of a
verified credit card, debit account, adult access code, or adult personal
identification number.</P>
<P>(6) The [Federal Communications] Commission may describe measures which are
reasonable, effective, and appropriate to restrict access to prohibited
communications under subsection (d) of this section.  Nothing in this section
authorizes the Commission to enforce, or is intended to provide the Commission
with the authority to approve, sanction, or permit, the use of such measures.
The Commission shall have no enforcement authority over the failure to utilize

such measures. . . .</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<H1>II.</H1>
<H1>FINDINGS OF FACT</H1>
<P>All parties agree that in order to apprehend the legal questions at issue in
these cases, it is necessary to have a clear understanding of the exponentially
growing, worldwide medium that is the Internet, which presents unique issues
relating to the application of First Amendment jurisprudence and due process
requirements to this new and evolving method of communication.  For this reason
all parties insisted on having extensive evidentiary hearings before the
three-judge court. The court's Findings of fact are made pursuant to Fed. R.
Civ. P. 52(a).  The history and basic technology of this medium are not in
dispute, and the first forty-eight paragraphs of the following Findings of fact
are derived from the like-numbered paragraphs of a stipulation(8) the parties
filed with the court.(9)</P>
<H1>The Nature of Cyberspace</H1>
<H1>The Creation of the Internet and the Development of Cyberspace</H1>
<OL>
<LI> The Internet is not a physical or tangible entity, but rather a giant
network which interconnects innumerable smaller groups of linked computer
networks.  It is thus a network of networks.  This is best understood if one
considers what a linked group of computers -- referred to here as a &quot;network&quot;
-- is, and what it does.  Small networks are now ubiquitous (and are often
called &quot;local area networks&quot;).  For example, in many United States
Courthouses, computers are linked to each other for the purpose of exchanging
files and messages (and to share equipment such as printers).  These are
networks.
</LI>
<LI>  Some networks are &quot;closed&quot; networks, not linked to other
computers or networks.  Many networks, however, are connected to other networks,
which are in turn connected to other networks in a manner which permits each
computer in any network to communicate with computers on any other network in
the system.  This global Web of linked networks and computers is referred to as

the Internet.
</LI>
<LI>  The nature of the Internet is such that it is very difficult, if not
impossible, to determine its size at a given moment.  It is indisputable,
however, that the Internet has experienced extraordinary growth in recent years.
 In 1981, fewer than 300 computers were linked to the Internet, and by 1989, the
number stood at fewer than 90,000 computers.  By 1993, over 1,000,000 computers
were linked.  Today, over 9,400,000 host computers worldwide, of which
approximately 60 percent located within the United States, are estimated to be
linked to the Internet.  This count does not include the personal computers
people use to access the Internet using modems.  In all, reasonable estimates
are that as many as 40 million people around the world can and do access the
enormously flexible communication Internet medium.  That figure is expected to
grow to 200 million Internet users by the year 1999.
</LI>
<LI>  Some of the computers and computer networks that make up the Internet are
owned by governmental and public institutions, some are owned by non-profit
organizations, and some are privately owned.  The resulting whole is a
decentralized, global medium of communications -- or &quot;cyberspace&quot; --
that links people, institutions, corporations, and governments around the world.
 The Internet is an international system.  This communications medium allows any
of the literally tens of millions of people with access to the Internet to
exchange information.  These communications can occur almost instantaneously,
and can be directed either to specific individuals, to a broader group of people
interested in a particular subject, or to the world as a whole.

</LI>
<LI>  The Internet had its origins in 1969 as an experimental project of the
Advanced Research Project Agency (&quot;ARPA&quot;), and was called ARPANET.

This network linked computers and computer networks owned by the military,
defense contractors, and university laboratories conducting defense-related
research.  The network later allowed researchers across the country to access
directly and to use extremely powerful supercomputers located at a few key
universities and laboratories.  As it evolved far beyond its research origins in
the United States to encompass universities, corporations, and people around the
world, the ARPANET came to be called the &quot;DARPA Internet,&quot; and finally
just the &quot;Internet.&quot;
</LI>
<LI>  From its inception, the network was designed to be a decentralized,
self-maintaining series of redundant links between computers and computer
networks, capable of rapidly transmitting communications without direct human
involvement or control, and with the automatic ability to re-route
communications if one or more individual links were damaged or otherwise
unavailable.  Among other goals, this redundant system of linked computers was
designed to allow vital research and communications to continue even if portions
of the network were damaged, say, in a war.
</LI>
<LI>  To achieve this resilient nationwide (and ultimately global)
communications medium, the ARPANET encouraged the creation of multiple links to
and from each computer (or computer network) on the network.  Thus, a computer
located in Washington, D.C., might be linked (usually using dedicated telephone
lines) to other computers in neighboring states or on the Eastern seaboard.
Each of those computers could in turn be linked to other computers, which
themselves would be linked to other computers.
</LI>
<LI>  A communication sent over this redundant series of linked computers could
travel any of a number of routes to its destination.  Thus, a message sent from
a computer in Washington, D.C., to a computer in Palo Alto, California, might
first be sent to a computer in Philadelphia, and then be forwarded to a computer
in Pittsburgh, and then to Chicago, Denver, and Salt Lake City, before finally
reaching Palo Alto.  If the message could not travel along that path (because of
military attack, simple technical malfunction, or other reason), the message
would automatically (without human intervention or even knowledge) be re-routed,
perhaps, from Washington, D.C. to Richmond, and then to Atlanta, New Orleans,
Dallas, Albuquerque, Los Angeles, and finally to Palo Alto.  This type of
transmission, and re-routing, would likely occur in a matter of seconds.
</LI>
<LI> Messages between computers on the Internet do not necessarily travel
entirely along the same path.  The Internet uses &quot;packet switching&quot;
communication protocols that allow individual messages to be subdivided into
smaller &quot;packets&quot; that are then sent independently to the destination,
and are then automatically reassembled by the receiving computer.  While all
packets of a given message often travel along the same path to the destination,
if computers along the route become overloaded, then packets can be re-routed to
less loaded computers.
</LI>
<LI> At the same time that ARPANET was maturing (it subsequently ceased to
exist), similar networks developed to link universities, research facilities,
businesses, and individuals around the world.  These other formal or loose
networks included BITNET, CSNET, FIDONET, and USENET.  Eventually, each of these
networks (many of which overlapped) were themselves linked together, allowing
users of any computers linked to any one of the networks to transmit
communications to users of computers on other networks.  It is this series of
linked networks (themselves linking computers and computer networks) that is
today commonly known as the Internet.
</LI>
<LI>  No single entity -- academic, corporate, governmental, or non-profit --
administers the Internet.  It exists and functions as a result of the fact that
hundreds of thousands of separate operators of computers and computer networks
independently decided to use common data transfer protocols to exchange
communications and information with other computers (which in turn exchange
communications and information with still other computers).  There is no
centralized storage location, control point, or communications channel for the
Internet, and it would not be technically feasible for a single entity to
control all of the information conveyed on the Internet.
</LI></OL>
<H1>How Individuals Access the Internet</H1>
<P>12. Individuals have a wide variety of avenues to access cyberspace in
general, and the Internet in particular.  In terms of physical access, there are
two common methods to establish an actual link to the Internet.  First, one can
use a computer or computer terminal that is directly (and usually permanently)
connected to a computer network that is itself directly or indirectly connected
to the Internet.  Second, one can use a &quot;personal computer&quot; with a &quot;modem&quot;
to connect over a telephone line to a larger computer or computer network that
is itself directly or indirectly connected to the Internet.  As detailed below,
both direct and modem connections are made available to people by a wide variety
of academic, governmental, or commercial entities.</P>
<P>13. Students, faculty, researchers, and others affiliated with the vast
majority of colleges and universities in the United States can access the
Internet through their educational institutions.  Such access is often via
direct connection using computers located in campus libraries, offices, or
computer centers, or may be through telephone access using a modem from a
student's or professor's campus or off-campus location.  Some colleges and
universities install &quot;ports&quot; or outlets for direct network connections
in each dormitory room or provide access via computers located in common areas
in dormitories.  Such access enables students and professors to use information
and content provided by the college or university itself, and to use the vast
amount of research resources and other information available on the Internet
worldwide.</P>
<P>14.  Similarly, Internet resources and access are sufficiently important to
many corporations and other employers that those employers link their office
computer networks to the Internet and provide employees with direct or modem
access to the office network (and thus to the Internet).  Such access might be
used by, for example, a corporation involved in scientific or medical research
or manufacturing to enable corporate employees to exchange information and ideas
with academic researchers in their fields.</P>
<P>15.  Those who lack access to the Internet through their schools or
employers still have a variety of ways they can access the Internet.  Many
communities across the country have established &quot;free-nets&quot; or
community networks to provide their citizens with a local link to the Internet
(and to provide local-oriented content and discussion groups).  The first such

community network, the Cleveland Free-Net Community Computer System, was
established in 1986, and free-nets now exist in scores of communities as diverse
as Richmond, Virginia, Tallahassee, Florida, Seattle, Washington, and San Diego,
California.  Individuals typically can access free-nets at little or no cost via
modem connection or by using computers available in community buildings.
Free-nets are often operated by a local library, educational institution, or
non-profit community group.</P>
<P>16.  Individuals can also access the Internet through many local libraries.
Libraries often offer patrons use of computers that are linked to the Internet.
In addition, some libraries offer telephone modem access to the libraries'
computers, which are themselves connected to the Internet.  Increasingly,

patrons now use library services and resources without ever physically entering
the library itself.  Libraries typically provide such direct or modem access at
no cost to the individual user.  </P>
<P>17.  Individuals can also access the Internet by patronizing an increasing
number of storefront &quot;computer coffee shops,&quot; where customers -- while
they drink their coffee -- can use computers provided by the shop to access the
Internet.  Such Internet access is typically provided by the shop for a small
hourly fee. </P>
<P>18.  Individuals can also access the Internet through commercial and
non-commercial &quot;Internet service providers&quot; that typically offer modem
telephone access to a computer or computer network linked to the Internet.  Many
such providers -- including the members of plaintiff Commercial Internet
Exchange Association -- are commercial entities offering Internet access for a
monthly or hourly fee.  Some Internet service providers, however, are non-profit
organizations that offer free or very low cost access to the Internet.  For
example, the International Internet Association offers free modem access to the
Internet upon request.  Also, a number of trade or other non-profit associations
offer Internet access as a service to members. </P>
<P>19.  Another common way for individuals to access the Internet is through
one of the major national commercial &quot;online services&quot; such as America
Online, CompuServe, the Microsoft Network, or Prodigy.  These online services
offer nationwide computer networks (so that subscribers can dial-in to a local
telephone number), and the services provide extensive and well organized content
within their own proprietary computer networks.  In addition to allowing access
to the extensive content available within each online service, the services also
allow subscribers to link to the much larger resources of the Internet.  Full
access to the online service (including access to the Internet) can be obtained
for modest monthly or hourly fees.  The major commercial online services have
almost twelve million individual subscribers across the United States.</P>
<P>20.  In addition to using the national commercial online services,
individuals can also access the Internet using some (but not all) of the
thousands of local dial-in computer services, often called &quot;bulletin board
systems&quot; or &quot;BBSs.&quot;  With an investment of as little as $2,000.00
and the cost of a telephone line, individuals, non-profit organizations,
advocacy groups, and businesses can offer their own dial-in computer &quot;bulletin
board&quot; service where friends, members, subscribers, or customers can
exchange ideas and information.  BBSs range from single computers with only one
telephone line into the computer (allowing only one user at a time), to single
computers with many telephone lines into the computer (allowing multiple
simultaneous users), to multiple linked computers each servicing multiple
dial-in telephone lines (allowing multiple simultaneous users).  Some (but not
all) of these BBS systems offer direct or indirect links to the Internet.  Some
BBS systems charge users a nominal fee for access, while many others are free to
the individual users. </P>
<P>21. Although commercial access to the Internet is growing rapidly, many
users of the Internet -- such as college students and staff -- do not
individually pay for access (except to the extent, for example, that the cost of
computer services is a component of college tuition).  These and other Internet
users can access the Internet without paying for such access with a credit card
or other form of payment.</P>
<H1>Methods to Communicate Over the Internet</H1>
<P>22.  Once one has access to the Internet, there are a wide variety of
different methods of communication and information exchange over the network.

These many methods of communication and information retrieval are constantly
evolving and are therefore difficult to categorize concisely.  The most common
methods of communications on the Internet (as well as within the major online
services) can be roughly grouped into six categories: </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(1) one-to-one messaging (such as &quot;e-mail&quot;), </P>
<P>(2) one-to-many messaging (such as &quot;listserv&quot;),</P>
<P>(3) distributed message databases (such as &quot;USENET newsgroups&quot;),
</P>
<P>(4) real time communication (such as &quot;Internet Relay Chat&quot;), </P>
<P>(5) real time remote computer utilization (such as &quot;telnet&quot;), and
</P>
<P>(6) remote information retrieval (such as &quot;ftp,&quot; &quot;gopher,&quot;
and the &quot;World Wide Web&quot;).  </P></BLOCKQUOTE></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Most of these methods of communication can be used to transmit text, data,
computer programs, sound, visual images (i.e., pictures), and moving video
images.</P>
<P>23.  One-to-one messaging.  One method of communication on the Internet is
via electronic mail, or &quot;e-mail,&quot; comparable in principle to sending a
first class letter.  One can address and transmit a message to one or more other
people.  E-mail on the Internet is not routed through a central control point,
and can take many and varying paths to the recipients.  Unlike postal mail,
simple e-mail generally is not &quot;sealed&quot; or secure, and can be accessed
or viewed on intermediate computers between the sender and recipient (unless the
message is encrypted).</P>
<P>24.  One-to-many messaging.  The Internet also contains automatic mailing
list services (such as &quot;listservs&quot;), [also referred to by witnesses as
&quot;mail exploders&quot;] that allow communications about particular subjects
of interest to a group of people.  For example, people can subscribe to a &quot;listserv&quot;
mailing list on a particular topic of interest to them.  The subscriber can
submit messages on the topic to the listserv that are forwarded (via e-mail),
either automatically or through a human moderator overseeing the listserv, to
anyone who has subscribed to the mailing list.  A recipient of such a message
can reply to the message and have the reply also distributed to everyone on the
mailing list.  This service provides the capability to keep abreast of
developments or events in a particular subject area.  Most listserv-type mailing
lists automatically forward all incoming messages to all mailing list
subscribers.  There are thousands of such mailing list services on the Internet,
collectively with hundreds of thousands of subscribers.  Users of &quot;open&quot;
listservs typically can add or remove their names from the mailing list
automatically, with no direct human involvement.  Listservs may also be &quot;closed,&quot;
i.e., only allowing for one's acceptance into the listserv by a human moderator.</P>
<P>25.  Distributed message databases.  Similar in function to listservs -- but
quite different in how communications are transmitted -- are distributed message
databases such as &quot;USENET newsgroups.&quot;  User-sponsored newsgroups are
among the most popular and widespread applications of Internet services, and
cover all imaginable topics of interest to users.  Like listservs, newsgroups
are open discussions and exchanges on particular topics.  Users, however, need
not subscribe to the discussion mailing list in advance, but can instead access
the database at any time.  Some USENET newsgroups are &quot;moderated&quot; but
most are open access.  For the moderated newsgroups,(10) all messages to the
newsgroup are forwarded to one person who can screen them for relevance to the
topics under discussion.  USENET newsgroups are disseminated using ad hoc, peer
to peer connections between approximately 200,000 computers (called USENET &quot;servers&quot;)
around the world.  For unmoderated newsgroups, when an individual user with
access to a USENET server posts a message to a newsgroup, the message is
automatically forwarded to all adjacent USENET servers that furnish access to
the newsgroup, and it is then propagated to the servers adjacent to those
servers, etc.  The messages are temporarily stored on each receiving server,
where they are available for review and response by individual users.  The
messages are automatically and periodically purged from each system after a time
to make room for new messages.  Responses to messages, like the original
messages, are automatically distributed to all other computers receiving the
newsgroup or forwarded to a moderator in the case of a moderated newsgroup.  The
dissemination of messages to USENET servers around the world is an automated
process that does not require direct human intervention or review. </P>
<P>26. There are newsgroups on more than fifteen thousand different subjects.
In 1994, approximately 70,000 messages were posted to newsgroups each day, and
those messages were distributed to the approximately 190,000 computers or
computer networks that participate in the USENET newsgroup system.  Once the
messages reach the approximately 190,000 receiving computers or computer
networks, they are available to individual users of those computers or computer
networks.  Collectively, almost 100,000 new messages (or &quot;articles&quot;)
are posted to newsgroups each day.</P>
<P>27.  Real time communication.  In addition to transmitting messages that can
be later read or accessed, individuals on the Internet can engage in an
immediate dialog, in &quot;real time&quot;, with other people on the Internet.
In its simplest forms, &quot;talk&quot; allows one-to-one communications and &quot;Internet
Relay Chat&quot; (or IRC) allows two or more to type messages to each other that
almost immediately appear on the others' computer screens.  IRC is analogous to
a telephone party line, using a computer and keyboard rather than a telephone.
With IRC, however, at any one time there are thousands of different party lines
available, in which collectively tens of thousands of users are engaging in
conversations on a huge range of subjects.  Moreover, one can create a new party
line to discuss a different topic at any time.  Some IRC conversations are &quot;moderated&quot;
or include &quot;channel operators.&quot;</P>
<P>28. In addition, commercial online services such as America Online,
CompuServe, the Microsoft Network, and Prodigy have their own &quot;chat&quot;
systems allowing their members to converse.</P>
<P>29.  Real time remote computer utilization.  Another method to use
information on the Internet is to access and control remote computers in &quot;real
time&quot; using &quot;telnet.&quot;  For example, using telnet, a researcher at
a university would be able to use the computing power of a supercomputer located
at a different university.  A student can use telnet to connect to a remote
library to access the library's online card catalog program.  </P>
<P>30.  Remote information retrieval.  The final major category of
communication may be the most well known use of the Internet -- the search for
and retrieval of information located on remote computers.  There are three
primary methods to locate and retrieve information on the Internet.  </P>
<P>31. A simple method uses &quot;ftp&quot; (or file transfer protocol) to list
the names of computer files available on a remote computer, and to transfer one
or more of those files to an individual's local computer.  </P>
<P>32. Another approach uses a program and format named &quot;gopher&quot; to
guide an individual's search through the resources available on a remote
computer.  </P>
<H1>The World Wide Web</H1>
<P>33. A third approach, and fast becoming the most well-known on the Internet,
is the &quot;World Wide Web.&quot;  The Web utilizes a &quot;hypertext&quot;
formatting language called hypertext markup language (HTML), and programs that &quot;browse&quot;
the Web can display HTML documents containing text, images, sound, animation and
moving video.  Any HTML document can include links to other types of information
or resources, so that while viewing an HTML document that, for example,
describes resources available on the Internet, one can &quot;click&quot; using a
computer mouse on the description of the resource and be immediately connected
to the resource itself.  Such &quot;hyperlinks&quot; allow information to be
accessed and organized in very flexible ways, and allow people to locate and
efficiently view related information even if the information is stored on
numerous computers all around the world.</P>
<P>34. Purpose.  The World Wide Web (W3C) was created to serve as the platform
for a global, online store of knowledge, containing information from a diversity
of sources and accessible to Internet users around the world.  Though
information on the Web is contained in individual computers, the fact that each
of these computers is connected to the Internet through W3C protocols allows all
of the information to become part of a single body of knowledge.  It is
currently the most advanced information system developed on the Internet, and
embraces within its data model most information in previous networked
information systems such as ftp, gopher, wais, and Usenet.  </P>
<P>35. History.  W3C was originally developed at CERN, the European Particle
Physics Laboratory, and was initially used to allow information sharing within
internationally dispersed teams of researchers and engineers.  Originally aimed
at the High Energy Physics community, it has spread to other areas and attracted
much interest in user support, resource recovery, and many other areas which
depend on collaborative and information sharing.  The Web has extended beyond
the scientific and academic community to include communications by individuals,
non-profit organizations, and businesses.</P>
<P>36. Basic Operation.  The World Wide Web is a series of documents stored in
different computers all over the Internet.  Documents contain information stored
in a variety of formats, including text, still images, sounds, and video.  An
essential element of the Web is that any document has an address (rather like a
telephone number).  Most Web documents contain &quot;links.&quot;  These are
short sections of text or image which refer to another document.  Typically the
linked text is blue or underlined when displayed, and when selected by the user,
the referenced document is automatically displayed, wherever in the world it
actually is stored.  Links for example are used to lead from overview documents
to more detailed documents, from tables of contents to particular pages, but
also as cross-references, footnotes, and new forms of information structure.
</P>
<P>37. Many organizations now have &quot;home pages&quot; on the Web.  These
are documents which provide a set of links designed to represent the
organization, and through links from the home page, guide the user directly or
indirectly to information about or relevant to that organization.  </P>
<P>38. As an example of the use of links, if these Findings were to be put on a
World Wide Web site, its home page might contain links such as those:  </P>
<UL>
<LI>THE NATURE OF CYBERSPACE
</LI>
<LI>CREATION OF THE INTERNET AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF CYBERSPACE
</LI>
<LI>HOW PEOPLE ACCESS THE INTERNET
</LI>

<LI>METHODS TO COMMUNICATE OVER THE INTERNET
</LI></UL>
<P>39. Each of these links takes the user of the site from the beginning of the
Findings to the appropriate section within this Adjudication.  Links may also
take the user from the original Web site to another Web site on another computer
connected to the Internet.  These links from one computer to another, from one
document to another across the Internet, are what unify the Web into a single
body of knowledge, and what makes the Web unique.  The Web was designed with a
maximum target time to follow a link of one tenth of a second.</P>
<P>40. Publishing.  The World Wide Web exists fundamentally as a platform
through which people and organizations can communicate through shared
information.  When information is made available, it is said to be &quot;published&quot;
on the Web.  Publishing on the Web simply requires that the &quot;publisher&quot;
has a computer connected to the Internet and that the computer is running W3C
server software.  The computer can be as simple as a small personal computer
costing less than $1500 dollars or as complex as a multi-million dollar
mainframe computer.  Many Web publishers choose instead to lease disk storage
space from someone else who has the necessary computer facilities, eliminating
the need for actually owning any equipment oneself.  </P>
<P>41. The Web, as a universe of network accessible information, contains a
variety of documents prepared with quite varying degrees of care, from the
hastily typed idea, to the professionally executed corporate profile.  The power
of the Web stems from the ability of a link to point to any document, regardless
of its status or physical location.  </P>
<P>42. Information to be published on the Web must also be formatted according
to the rules of the Web standards.  These standardized formats assure that all
Web users who want to read the material will be able to view it.  Web standards
are sophisticated and flexible enough that they have grown to meet the
publishing needs of many large corporations, banks, brokerage houses, newspapers
and magazines which now publish &quot;online&quot; editions of their material,
as well as government agencies, and even courts, which use the Web to
disseminate information to the public.  At the same time, Web publishing is
simple enough that thousands of individual users and small community
organizations are using the Web to publish their own personal &quot;home pages,&quot;
the equivalent of individualized newsletters about that person or organization,
which are available to everyone on the Web.  </P>
<P>43. Web publishers have a choice to make their Web sites open to the general
pool of all Internet users, or close them, thus making the information
accessible only to those with advance authorization.  Many publishers choose to
keep their sites open to all in order to give their information the widest
potential audience.  In the event that the publishers choose to maintain
restrictions on access, this may be accomplished by assigning specific user
names and passwords as a prerequisite to access to the site.  Or, in the case of
Web sites maintained for internal use of one organization, access will only be
allowed from other computers within that organization's local network.(11)</P>
<P>44. Searching the Web.  A variety of systems have developed that allow users
of the Web to search particular information among all of the public sites that
are part of the Web.  Services such as Yahoo, Magellan, Altavista, Webcrawler,
and Lycos are all services known as &quot;search engines&quot; which allow users
to search for Web sites that contain certain categories of information, or to
search for key words.  For example, a Web user looking for the text of Supreme
Court opinions would type the words &quot;Supreme Court&quot; into a search
engine, and then be presented with a list of World Wide Web sites that contain
Supreme Court information.  This list would actually be a series of links to
those sites.  Having searched out a number of sites that might contain the
desired information, the user would then follow individual links, browsing
through the information on each site, until the desired material is found.  For
many content providers on the Web, the ability to be found by these search
engines is very important.  </P>
<P>45. Common standards.  The Web links together disparate information on an
ever-growing number of Internet-linked computers by setting common information
storage formats (HTML) and a common language for the exchange of Web documents
(HTTP).  Although the information itself may be in many different formats, and
stored on computers which are not otherwise compatible, the basic Web standards
provide a basic set of standards which allow communication and exchange of
information.  Despite the fact that many types of computers are used on the Web,
and the fact that many of these machines are otherwise incompatible, those who &quot;publish&quot;
information on the Web are able to communicate with those who seek to access
information with little difficulty because of these basic technical standards.
</P>
<P>46. A distributed system with no centralized control.  Running on tens of
thousands of individual computers on the Internet, the Web is what is known as a
distributed system.  The Web was designed so that organizations with computers
containing information can become part of the Web simply by attaching their
computers to the Internet and running appropriate World Wide Web software.  No
single organization controls any membership in the Web, nor is there any single
centralized point from which individual Web sites or services can be blocked
from the Web.  From a user's perspective, it may appear to be a single,
integrated system, but in reality it has no centralized control point.  </P>
<P>47. Contrast to closed databases.  The Web's open, distributed,
decentralized nature stands in sharp contrast to most information systems that
have come before it.  Private information services such as Westlaw, Lexis/Nexis,
and Dialog, have contained large storehouses of knowledge, and can be accessed
from the Internet with the appropriate passwords and access software.  However,
these databases are not linked together into a single whole, as is the World
Wide Web.  </P>
<P>48. Success of the Web in research, education, and political activities.
The World Wide Web has become so popular because of its open, distributed, and
easy-to-use nature.  Rather than requiring those who seek information to
purchase new software or hardware, and to learn a new kind of system for each
new database of information they seek to access, the Web environment makes it
easy for users to jump from one set of information to another.  By the same
token, the open nature of the Web makes it easy for publishers to reach their
intended audiences without having to know in advance what kind of computer each

potential reader has, and what kind of software they will be using.  </P>
<H1>Restricting Access to Unwanted On-Line Material(12)</H1>
<H1>PICS</H1>
<P>49. With the rapid growth of the Internet, the increasing popularity of the
Web, and the existence of material online that some parents may consider
inappropriate for their children, various entities have begun to build systems
intended to enable parents to control the material which comes into their homes
and may be accessible to their children.  The World Wide Web Consortium launched
the PICS (&quot;Platform for Internet Content Selection&quot;) program in order
to develop technical standards that would support parents' ability to filter and
screen material that their children see on the Web.  </P>
<P>50. The Consortium intends that PICS will provide the ability for third
parties, as well as individual content providers, to rate content on the
Internet in a variety of ways.  When fully implemented, PICS-compatible World
Wide Web browsers, Usenet News Group readers, and other Internet applications,
will provide parents the ability to choose from a variety of rating services, or
a combination of services.</P>
<P>51. PICS working group [PICS-WG] participants include many of the major
online services providers, commercial internet access providers, hardware and
software companies, major internet content providers, and consumer
organizations.  Among active participants in the PICS effort are:  </P>

<P>52. Membership in the PICS-WG includes a broad cross-section of companies
from the computer, communications, and content industries, as well as trade
associations and public interest groups.  PICS technical specifications have
been agreed to, allowing the Internet community to begin to deploy products and
services based on the PICS-standards.</P>
<P>53. Until a majority of sites on the Internet have been rated by a PICS
rating service, PICS will initially function as a &quot;positive&quot; ratings
system in which only those sites that have been rated will be displayed using
PICS compatible software.  In other words, PICS will initially function as a
site inclusion list rather than a site exclusion list.  The default
configuration for a PICS compatible Internet application will be to block access
to all sites which have not been rated by a PICS rating service, while allowing
access to sites which have a PICS rating for appropriate content.(14)</P>
<H1>Software</H1>
<P>54. For over a year, various companies have marketed stand alone software
that is intended to enable parents and other adults to limit the Internet access
of children.  Examples of such software include:  Cyber Patrol, CYBERsitter, The
Internet Filter, Net Nanny, Parental Guidance, SurfWatch, Netscape Proxy Server,
and WebTrack.  The market for this type of software is growing, and there is
increasing competition among software providers to provide products.</P>
<H1>Cyber Patrol</H1>
<P>55. As more people, particularly children, began to use the Internet,
Microsystems Software, Inc. decided to develop and market Internet software
intended to empower parents to exercise individual choice over what material
their children could access.  Microsystems' stated intent is to develop a

product which would give parents comfort that their children can reap the
benefits of the Internet while shielding them from objectionable or otherwise
inappropriate materials based on the parents' own particular tastes and values.
Microsystems' product, Cyber Patrol, was developed to address this need.</P>
<P>56. Cyber Patrol was first introduced in August 1995, and is currently
available in Windows and Macintosh versions.  Cyber Patrol works with both
direct Internet Access providers (ISPs, e.g., Netcom, PSI, UUnet), and
Commercial Online Service Providers (e.g., America Online, Compuserv, Prodigy,
Microsoft).  Cyber Patrol is also compatible with all major World Wide Web
browsers on the market (e.g., Netscape, Navigator, Mosaic, Prodigy's Legacy and
Skimmer browsers, America Online, Netcom's NetCruiser, etc.).  Cyber Patrol was
the first parental empowerment application to be compatible with the PICS
standard.  In February of 1996, Microsystems put the first PICS ratings server
on the Internet.  </P>
<P>57. The CyberNOT list contains approximately 7000 sites in twelve
categories.  The software is designed to enable parents to selectively block
access to any or all of the twelve CyberNOT categories simply by checking boxes
in the Cyber Patrol Headquarters (the Cyber Patrol program manager).  These
categories are:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Violence/Profanity:  Extreme cruelty, physical or emotional acts against any
animal or person which are primarily intended to hurt or inflict pain.  Obscene
words, phrases, and profanity defined as text that uses George Carlin's seven
censored words more often than once every fifty messages or pages. </P>
<P>Partial Nudity:  Full or partial exposure of the human anatomy except when
exposing genitalia.</P>
<P>Nudity:  Any exposure of the human genitalia.</P>
<P>Sexual Acts (graphic or text):  Pictures or text exposing anyone or anything
involved in explicit sexual acts and lewd and lascivious behavior, including
masturbation, copulation, pedophilia, intimacy and involving nude or partially
nude people in heterosexual, bisexual, lesbian or homosexual encounters.  Also
includes phone sex ads, dating services, adult personals, CD-ROM and videos.</P>
<P>Gross Depictions (graphic or text):  Pictures or descriptive text of anyone
or anything which are crudely vulgar, deficient in civility or behavior, or
showing scatological impropriety.  Includes such depictions as maiming, bloody
figures, indecent depiction of bodily functions.</P>
<P>Racism/Ethnic Impropriety:  Prejudice or discrimination against any race or
ethnic culture.  Ethnic or racist jokes and slurs.  Any text that elevates one
race over another.</P>
<P>Satanic/Cult:  Worship of the devil; affinity for evil, wickedness.  Sects
or groups that potentially coerce individuals to grow, and keep, membership.</P>
<P>Drugs/Drug Culture:  Topics dealing with the use of illegal drugs for
entertainment.  This would exclude current illegal drugs used for medicinal
purposes (e.g., drugs used to treat victims of AIDS).  Includes substances used

for other than their primary purpose to alter the individual's state of mind
such as glue sniffing.</P>
<P>Militant/Extremist:  Extremely aggressive and combative behaviors,
radicalism, advocacy of extreme political measures.  Topics include extreme
political groups that advocate violence as a means to achieve their goal.</P>
<P>Gambling:  Of or relating to lotteries, casinos, betting, numbers games,

on-line sports or financial betting including non-monetary dares.</P>
<P>Questionable/Illegal:  Material or activities of a dubious nature which may
be illegal in any or all jurisdictions, such as illegal business schemes, chain
letters, software piracy, and copyright infringement.</P>
<P>Alcohol, Beer &amp; Wine:  Material pertaining to the sale or consumption of
alcoholic beverages.  Also includes sites and information relating to tobacco
products.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>58. Microsystems employs people to search the Internet for sites containing
material in these categories.  Since new sites are constantly coming online,
Microsystems updates the CyberNOT list on a weekly basis.  Once installed on the
home PC, the copy of Cyber Patrol receives automatic updates to the CyberNOT
list over the Internet every seven days.  </P>
<P>59. In February of 1996, Microsystems signed a licensing arrangement with
CompuServe, one of the leading commercial online services with over 4.3 million
subscribers.  CompuServe provides Cyber Patrol free of charge to its
subscribers.  Microsystems the same month signed a licensing arrangement with
Prodigy, another leading commercial online service with over 1.4 million
subscribers.  Prodigy will provide Cyber Patrol free of charge of its
subscribers.  </P>
<P>60. Cyber Patrol is also available directly from Microsystems for $49.95,
which includes a six month subscription to the CyberNOT blocked sites list
(updated automatically once every seven days).  After six months, parents can
receive six months of additional updates for $19.95, or twelve months for $29.95<I>.</I>
 Cyber Patrol Home Edition, a limited version of Cyber Patrol, is available free
of charge on the Internet.  To obtain either version, parents download a seven
day demonstration version of the full Cyber Patrol product from the Microsystems
Internet World Wide Web Server.  At the end of the seven day trial period, users
are offered the opportunity to purchase the complete version of Cyber Patrol or
provide Microsystems some basic demographic information in exchange for
unlimited use of the Home Edition.  The demographic information is used for
marketing and research purposes.  Since January of 1996, over 10,000
demonstration copies of Cyber Patrol have been downloaded from Microsystems' Web
site.</P>
<P>61. Cyber Patrol is also available from Retail outlets as NetBlocker Plus.
NetBlocker Plus sells for $19.95, which includes five weeks of updates to the
CyberNOT list.  </P>

<P>62. Microsystems also sells Cyber Patrol into a growing market in schools.
As more classrooms become connected to the Internet, many teachers want to
ensure that their students can receive the benefit of the Internet without
encountering material they deem educationally inappropriate.  </P>
<P>63. Microsystems is working with the Recreational Software Advisory Council
(RSAC), a non-profit corporation which developed rating systems for video games,
to implement the RSAC rating system for the Internet.  </P>
<P>64. The next release of Cyber Patrol, expected in second quarter of this
year, will give parents the ability to use any PICS rating service, including
the RSAC rating service, in addition to the Microsystems CyberNOT list.  </P>
<P>65. In order to speed the implementation of PICS and encourage the
development of PICS-compatible Internet applications, Microsystems maintains a
server on the Internet which contains its CyberNOT list.  The server provides
software developers with access to a PICS rating service, and allows software
developers to test their products' ability to interpret standard PICS labels.
Microsystems is also offering its PICS client test program for Windows free of
charge.  The client program can be used by developers of PICS rating services to
test their services and products.  </P>
<H1>SurfWatch</H1>
<P>66. Another software product, SurfWatch, is also designed to allow parents
and other concerned users to filter unwanted material on the Internet.
SurfWatch is available for both Apple Macintosh, Microsoft Windows, and
Microsoft Windows 95 Operating Systems, and works with direct Internet Access
Providers (e.g., Netcom, PSI, UUnet, AT&amp;T, and more than 1000 other Internet
Service Providers).  </P>
<P>67. The suggested retail price of SurfWatch Software is $49.95, with a
street price of between $20.00 and $25.00.  The product is also available as
part of CompuServe/Spry Inc.'s Internet in a Box for Kids, which includes access
to Spry's Kids only Internet service and a copy of SurfWatch.  Internet in a Box
for Kids retails for approximately $30.00.  The subscription service, which
updates the SurfWatch blocked site list automatically with new sites each month,
is available for $5.95 per month or $60.00 per year.  The subscription is
included as part of the Internet in a Box for Kids program, and is also provided
as a low-cost option from Internet Service Providers.  </P>
<P>68. SurfWatch is available at over 12,000 retail locations, including
National stores such as Comp USA, Egghead Software, Computer City, and several
national mail order outlets.  SurfWatch can also be ordered directly from its
own site on the World Wide Web, and through the Internet Shopping Network.</P>
<P>69.  Plaintiffs America Online (AOL), Microsoft Network, and Prodigy all
offer parental control options free of charge to their members.  AOL has
established an online area designed specifically for children.  The &quot;Kids
Only&quot; parental control feature allows parents to establish an AOL account
for their children that accesses only the Kids Only channel on America
Online.(15)     </P>
<P>70.  AOL plans to incorporate PICS-compatible capability into its standard
Web browser software, and to make available to subscribers other PICS-compatible
Web browsers, such as the Netscape software.  </P>
<P>71. Plaintiffs CompuServe and Prodigy give their subscribers the option of
blocking all access to the Internet, or to particular media within their
proprietary online content, such as bulletin boards and chat rooms. </P>
<P>72. Although parental control software currently can screen for certain
suggestive words or for known sexually explicit sites, it cannot now screen for
sexually explicit images unaccompanied by suggestive text unless those who
configure the software are aware of the particular site.    </P>
<P>73. Despite its limitations, currently available user-based software
suggests that a reasonably effective method by which parents can prevent their
children from accessing sexually explicit and other material which parents may
believe is inappropriate for their children will soon be widely available.</P>
<H1>Content on the Internet</H1>
<P>74. The types of content now on the Internet defy easy classification.  The
entire card catalogue of the Carnegie Library is on-line, together with
journals, journal abstracts, popular magazines, and titles of compact discs.
The director of the Carnegie Library, Robert Croneberger, testified that on-line
services are the emerging trend in libraries generally.  Plaintiff Hotwired
Ventures LLC organizes its Web site into information regarding travel, news and
commentary, arts and entertainment, politics, and types of drinks.  Plaintiff
America Online, Inc., not only creates chat rooms for a broad variety of topics,
but also allows members to create their own chat rooms to suit their own tastes.
 The ACLU uses an America Online chat room as an unmoderated forum for people to
debate civil liberties issues.  Plaintiffs' expert, Scott Bradner,(16) estimated
that 15,000 newsgroups exist today, and he described his own interest in a
newsgroup devoted solely to Formula 1 racing cars.  America Online makes 15,000
bulletin boards available to its subscribers, who post between 200,000 and
250,000 messages each day.  Another plaintiffs' expert, Harold Rheingold,
participates in &quot;virtual communities&quot; that simulate social
interaction.  It is no exaggeration to conclude that the content on the Internet
is as diverse as human thought.  </P>
<P>75. The Internet is not exclusively, or even primarily, a means of
commercial communication.  Many commercial entities maintain Web sites to inform
potential consumers about their goods and services, or to solicit purchases, but
many other Web sites exist solely for the dissemination of non-commercial
information.  The other forms of Internet communication -- e-mail, bulletin
boards, newsgroups, and chat rooms -- frequently have non-commercial goals.  For
the economic and technical reasons set forth in the following paragraphs, the
Internet is an especially attractive means for not-for-profit entities or public
interest groups to reach their desired audiences.  There are examples in the
parties' stipulation of some of the non-commercial uses that the Internet
serves.  Plaintiff Human Rights Watch, Inc., offers information on its Internet
site regarding reported human rights abuses around the world.  Plaintiff
National Writers Union provides a forum for writers on issues of concern to
them.  Plaintiff Stop Prisoner Rape, Inc., posts text, graphics, and statistics
regarding the incidence and prevention of rape in prisons.  Plaintiff Critical
Path AIDS Project, Inc., offers information on safer sex, the transmission of
HIV, and the treatment of AIDS.  </P>
<P>76. Such diversity of content on the Internet is possible because the
Internet provides an easy and inexpensive way for a speaker to reach a large
audience, potentially of millions.  The start-up and operating costs entailed by
communication on the Internet are significantly lower than those associated with
use of other forms of mass communication, such as television, radio, newspapers,
and magazines.  This enables operation of their own Web sites not only by large
companies, such as Microsoft and Time Warner, but also by small, not-for-profit
groups, such as Stop Prisoner Rape and Critical Path AIDS Project.  The
Government's expert, Dr. Dan R. Olsen,(17) agreed that creation of a Web site
would cost between $1,000 and $15,000, with monthly operating costs depending on
one's goals and the Web site's traffic.  Commercial online services such as
America Online allow subscribers to create Web pages free of charge.  Any
Internet user can communicate by posting a message to one of the thousands of
newsgroups and bulletin boards or by engaging in an on-line &quot;chat&quot;,
and thereby reach an audience worldwide that shares an interest in a particular
topic. </P>
<P>77.  The ease of communication through the Internet is facilitated by the
use of hypertext markup language (HTML), which allows for the creation of &quot;hyperlinks&quot;
or &quot;links&quot;.  HTML enables a user to jump from one source to other
related sources by clicking on the link.  A link might take the user from Web
site to Web site, or to other files within a particular Web site.  Similarly, by
typing a request into a search engine, a user can retrieve many different
sources of content related to the search that the creators of the engine have
collected.  </P>
<P>78.  Because of the technology underlying the Internet, the statutory term &quot;content
provider,&quot;(18) which is equivalent to the traditional &quot;speaker,&quot;
may actually be a hybrid of speakers.  Through the use of HTML, for example,
Critical Path and Stop Prisoner Rape link their Web sites to several related
databases, and a user can immediately jump from the home pages of these
organizations to the related databases simply by clicking on a link.  America
Online creates chat rooms for particular discussions but also allows subscribers
to create their own chat rooms.  Similarly, a newsgroup gathers postings on a
particular topic and distributes them to the newsgroup's subscribers.  Users of
the Carnegie Library can read on-line versions of Vanity Fair and Playboy, and
America Online's subscribers can peruse the New York Times, Boating, and other
periodicals.  Critical Path, Stop Prisoner Rape, America Online and the Carnegie
Library all make available content of other speakers over whom they have little
or no editorial control. </P>
<P>79.  Because of the different forms of Internet communication, a user of the
Internet may speak or listen interchangeably, blurring the distinction between &quot;speakers&quot;
and &quot;listeners&quot; on the Internet.  Chat rooms, e-mail, and newsgroups
are interactive forms of communication, providing the user with the opportunity
both to speak and to listen.  </P>
<P>80. It follows that unlike traditional media, the barriers to entry as a
speaker on the Internet do not differ significantly from the barriers to entry
as a listener.  Once one has entered cyberspace, one may engage in the dialogue
that occurs there.  In the argot of the medium, the receiver can and does become
the content provider, and vice-versa.</P>
<P>81. The Internet is therefore a unique and wholly new medium of worldwide
human communication.</P>
<H1>Sexually Explicit Material On the Internet</H1>
<P>82. The parties agree that sexually explicit material exists on the
Internet.  Such material includes text, pictures, and chat, and includes
bulletin boards, newsgroups, and the other forms of Internet communication, and
extends from the modestly titillating to the hardest-core.  </P>
<P>83. There is no evidence that sexually-oriented material is the primary type
of content on this new medium.  Purveyors of such material take advantage of the
same ease of access available to all users of the Internet, including
establishment of a Web site. </P>
<P>84. Sexually explicit material is created, named, and posted in the same
manner as material that is not sexually explicit.  It is possible that a search
engine can accidentally retrieve material of a sexual nature through an
imprecise search, as demonstrated at the hearing.  Imprecise searches may also
retrieve irrelevant material that is not of a sexual nature.  The accidental
retrieval of sexually explicit material is one manifestation of the larger
phenomenon of irrelevant search results. </P>
<P>85. Once a provider posts content on the Internet, it is available to all
other Internet users worldwide.  Similarly, once a user posts a message to a
newsgroup or bulletin board, that message becomes available to all subscribers
to that newsgroup or bulletin board.  For example, when the UCR/California
Museum of Photography posts to its Web site nudes by Edward Weston and Robert
Mapplethorpe to announce that its new exhibit will travel to Baltimore and New
York City, those images are available not only in Los Angeles, Baltimore, and
New York City, but also in Cincinnati, Mobile, or Beijing -- wherever Internet
users live.  Similarly, the safer sex instructions that Critical Path posts to
its Web site, written in street language so that the teenage receiver can
understand them, are available not just in Philadelphia, but also in Provo and
Prague.  A chat room organized by the ACLU to discuss the United States Supreme
Court's  decision in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation would transmit George Carlin's
seven dirty words to anyone who enters.  Messages posted to a newsgroup
dedicated to the Oklahoma City bombing travel to all subscribers to that
newsgroup.  </P>
<P>86.  Once a provider posts its content on the Internet, it cannot prevent
that content from entering any community.  Unlike the newspaper, broadcast
station, or cable system, Internet technology necessarily gives a speaker a
potential worldwide audience.  Because the Internet is a network of networks (as
described above in Findings 1 through 4), any network connected to the Internet
has the capacity to send and receive information to any other network.  Hotwired
Ventures, for example, cannot prevent its materials on mixology from entering
communities that have no interest in that topic.  </P>
<P>87.  Demonstrations at the preliminary injunction hearings showed that it
takes several steps to enter cyberspace.  At the most fundamental level, a user
must have access to a computer with the ability to reach the Internet (typically
by way of a modem).  A user must then direct the computer to connect with the
access provider, enter a password, and enter the appropriate commands to find
particular data.  On the World Wide Web, a user must normally use a search
engine or enter an appropriate address.  Similarly, accessing newsgroups,
bulletin boards, and chat rooms requires several steps.</P>
<P>88. Communications over the Internet do not &quot;invade&quot; an
individual's home or appear on one's computer screen unbidden.  Users seldom
encounter content &quot;by accident.&quot;   A document's title or a description
of the document will usually appear before the document itself takes the step
needed to view it, and in many cases the user will receive detailed information
about a site's content before he or she need take the step to access the
document.  Almost all sexually explicit images are preceded by warnings as to
the content.  Even the Government's witness, Agent Howard Schmidt, Director of
the Air Force Office of Special Investigation, testified that the &quot;odds are
slim&quot; that a user would come across a sexually explicit site by accident.
</P>
<P>89. Evidence adduced at the hearing showed significant  differences between
Internet communications and communications received by radio or television.
Although content on the Internet is just a few clicks of a mouse away from the
user,  the receipt of information on the Internet requires a series of
affirmative steps more deliberate and directed than merely turning a dial.  A
child requires some sophistication and some ability to read to retrieve material
and thereby to use the Internet unattended.  </P>
<H1>Obstacles to Age Verification on the Internet</H1>
<P>90.  There is no effective way to determine the identity or the age of a
user who is accessing material through e-mail, mail exploders, newsgroups or
chat rooms.  An e-mail address provides no authoritative information about the
addressee, who may use an e-mail &quot;alias&quot; or an anonymous remailer.
There is also no universal or reliable listing of e-mail addresses and
corresponding names or telephone numbers, and any such listing would be or
rapidly become incomplete.  For these reasons, there is no reliable way in many
instances for a sender to know if the e-mail recipient is an adult or a minor.
The difficulty of e-mail age verification is compounded for mail exploders such
as listservs, which automatically send information to all e-mail addresses on a
sender's list.  Government expert Dr. Olsen agreed that no current technology
could give a speaker assurance that only adults were listed in a particular mail
exploder's mailing list.  </P>
<P>91.  Because of similar technological difficulties, individuals posting a
message to a newsgroup or engaging in chat room discussions cannot ensure that
all readers are adults, and Dr. Olsen agreed.  Although some newsgroups are
moderated, the moderator's control is limited to what is posted and the
moderator cannot control who receives the messages.  </P>
<P>92.  The Government offered no evidence that there is a reliable way to
ensure that recipients and participants in such fora can be screened for age.
The Government presented no evidence demonstrating the feasibility of its
suggestion that chat rooms, newsgroups and other fora that contain material
deemed indecent could be effectively segregated to &quot;adult&quot; or &quot;moderated&quot;
areas of cyberspace.  </P>
<P>93.  Even if it were technologically feasible to block minors' access to
newsgroups and similar fora, there is no method by which the creators of
newsgroups which contain discussions of art, politics or any other subject that
could potentially elicit &quot;indecent&quot; contributions could limit the
blocking of access by minors to such &quot;indecent&quot; material and still
allow them access to the remaining content, even if the overwhelming majority of
that content was not indecent.</P>
<P>94.  Likewise, participants in MUDs (Multi-User Dungeons) and  MUSEs
(Multi-User Simulation Environments) do not know whether the other participants
are adults or minors.  Although MUDs and MUSEs require a password for permanent
participants, they need not give their real name nor verify their age, and there
is no current technology to enable the administrator of these fantasy worlds to
know if the participant is an adult or a minor.  </P>
<P>95.  Unlike other forms of communication on the Internet, there is
technology by which an operator of a World Wide Web server may interrogate a
user of a Web site.  An HTML document can include a fill-in-the-blank &quot;form&quot;
to request information from a visitor to a Web site, and this information can be
transmitted back to the Web server and be processed by a computer program,
usually a Common Gateway Interface (cgi) script.  The Web server could then

grant or deny access to the information sought.  The cgi script is the means by
which a Web site can process a fill-in form and thereby screen visitors by
requesting a credit card number or adult password.</P>
<P>96.  Content providers who publish on the World Wide Web via one of the
large commercial online services, such as America Online or CompuServe, could
not use an online age verification system that requires cgi script because the
server software of these online services available to subscribers cannot process
cgi scripts.  There is no method currently available for Web page publishers who
lack access to cgi scripts to screen recipients online for age.</P>
<H1>The Practicalities of the Proffered Defenses</H1>
<P>Note:  The Government contends the CDA makes available three potential
defenses to all content providers on the Internet:  credit card verification,
adult verification by password or adult identification number, and &quot;tagging&quot;.</P>
<H1>Credit Card Verification </H1>
<P>97.  Verification(19) of a credit card number over the Internet is not now
technically possible.  Witnesses testified that neither Visa nor Mastercard
considers the Internet to be sufficiently secure under the current technology to
process transactions in that manner.  Although users can and do purchase
products over the Internet by transmitting their credit card number, the seller
must then process the transaction with Visa or Mastercard off-line using phone
lines in the traditional way.  There was testimony by several witnesses that
Visa and Mastercard are in the process of developing means of credit card
verification over the Internet.  </P>
<P>98. Verification by credit card, if and when operational, will remain
economically and practically unavailable for many of the non-commercial
plaintiffs in these actions.  The Government's expert &quot;suspect[ed]&quot;
that verification agencies would decline to process a card unless it accompanied
a commercial transaction.  There was no evidence to the contrary.  </P>
<P>99. There was evidence that the fee charged by verification agencies to
process a card, whether for a purchase or not, will preclude use of the

credit-card verification defense by many non-profit, non-commercial Web sites,
and there was no evidence to the contrary.  Plaintiffs' witness Patricia Nell
Warren, an author whose free Web site allows users to purchase gay and lesbian
literature, testified that she must pay $1 per verification to a verification
agency.  Her Web site can absorb this cost because it arises in connection with
the sale of books available there.  </P>
<P>100. Using credit card possession as a surrogate for age, and requiring use
of a credit card to enter a site, would impose a significant economic cost on
non-commercial entities.  Critical Path, for example, received 3,300 hits daily
from February 4 through March 4, 1996.  If Critical Path must pay a fee every
time a user initially enters its site, then, to provide free access to its
non-commercial site, it would incur a monthly cost far beyond its modest
resources.  The ACLU's Barry Steinhardt testified that maintenance of a credit
card verification system for all visitors to the ACLU's Web site would require
it to shut down its Web site because the projected cost would exceed its budget.
</P>
<P>101. Credit card verification would significantly delay the retrieval of
information on the Internet.  Dr. Olsen, the expert testifying for the
Government, agreed that even &quot;a minute is [an] absolutely unreasonable
[delay] . . . [P]eople will not put up with a minute.&quot;  Plaintiffs' expert
Donna Hoffman similarly testified that excessive delay disrupts the &quot;flow&quot;
on the Internet and stifles both &quot;hedonistic&quot; and &quot;goal-directed&quot;
browsing. </P>
<P>102.  Imposition of a credit card requirement would completely bar adults
who do not have a credit card and lack the resources to obtain one from
accessing any blocked material.  At this time, credit card verification is
effectively unavailable to a substantial number of Internet content providers as
a potential defense to the CDA.</P>
<H1>Adult Verification by Password </H1>
<P>103.  The Government offered very limited evidence regarding the operation
of existing age verification systems, and the evidence offered was not based on
personal knowledge.  AdultCheck and Verify, existing systems which appear to be
used for accessing commercial pornographic sites, charge users for their
services.  Dr. Olsen admitted that his knowledge of these services was derived
primarily from reading the advertisements on their Web pages.  He had not
interviewed any employees of these entities, had not personally used these
systems, had no idea how many people are registered with them, and could not
testify to the reliability of their attempt at age verification.  </P>
<P>104.  At least some, if not almost all, non-commercial organizations, such
as the ACLU, Stop Prisoner Rape or Critical Path AIDS Project, regard charging
listeners to access their speech as contrary to their goals of making their
materials available to a wide audience free of charge.  </P>
<P>105.  It would not be feasible for many non-commercial organizations to
design their own adult access code screening systems because the administrative
burden of creating and maintaining a screening system and the ongoing costs
involved is beyond their reach.  There was testimony that the costs would be
prohibitive even for a commercial entity such as HotWired, the online version of
Wired magazine.  </P>
<P>106.  There is evidence suggesting that adult users, particularly casual Web
browsers, would be discouraged from retrieving information that required use of
a credit card or password.  Andrew Anker testified that HotWired has received
many complaints from its members about HotWired's registration system, which

requires only that a member supply a name, e-mail address and self-created
password.  There is concern by commercial content providers that age
verification requirements would decrease advertising and revenue because
advertisers depend on a demonstration that the sites are widely available and
frequently visited.  </P>
<P>107.  Even if credit card verification or adult password verification were
implemented, the Government presented no testimony as to how such systems could
ensure that the user of the password or credit card is in fact over 18.  The
burdens imposed by credit card verification and adult password verification
systems make them effectively unavailable to a substantial number of Internet
content providers.</P>
<H1> The Government's &quot;Tagging&quot; Proposal</H1>
<P>108. The feasibility and effectiveness of &quot;tagging&quot; to restrict
children from accessing &quot;indecent&quot; speech, as proposed by the
Government has not been established.  &quot;Tagging&quot; would require content
providers to label all of their &quot;indecent&quot; or &quot;patently offensive&quot;
material by imbedding a string of characters, such as &quot;XXX,&quot; in either
the URL or HTML.  If a user could install software on his or her computer to
recognize the &quot;XXX&quot; tag, the user could screen out any content with
that tag.  Dr. Olsen proposed a &quot;-L18&quot; tag, an idea he developed for
this hearing in response to Mr. Bradner's earlier testimony that certain tagging
would not be feasible.</P>
<P>109. The parties appear to agree that it is technologically feasible -- &quot;trivial&quot;,
in the words of plaintiffs' expert -- to imbed tags in URLs and HTML, and the
technology of tagging underlies both plaintiffs' PICS proposal and the
Government's &quot;-L18&quot; proposal.</P>
<P>110. The Government's tagging proposal would require all content providers
that post arguably &quot;indecent&quot; material to review all of their online
content, a task that would be extremely burdensome for organizations that
provide large amounts of material online which cannot afford to pay a large
staff to review all of that material.  The Carnegie Library would be required to
hire numerous additional employees to review its on-line files at an extremely
high cost to its limited budget.  The cost and effort would be substantial for
the Library and frequently prohibitive for others.  Witness Kiroshi Kuromiya
testified that it would be impossible for his organization, Critical Path, to
review all of its material because it has only one full and one part-time
employee.  </P>
<P>111.  The task of screening and tagging cannot be done simply by using
software which screens for certain words, as Dr. Olsen acknowledged, and we find
that determinations as to what is indecent require human judgment.  </P>
<P>112.  In lieu of reviewing each file individually, a content provider could
tag its entire site but this would prevent minors from accessing much material
that is not &quot;indecent&quot; under the CDA.  </P>
<P>113.  To be effective, a scheme such as the -L18 proposal would require a
worldwide consensus among speakers to use the same tag to label &quot;indecent&quot;
material.  There is currently no such consensus, and no Internet speaker
currently labels its speech with the -L18 code or with any other
widely-recognized label.</P>
<P>114. Tagging also assumes the existence of software that recognizes the tags
and takes appropriate action when it notes tagged speech.  Neither commercial
Web browsers nor user-based screening software is currently configured to block
a -L18 code.  Until such software exists, all speech on the Internet will
continue to travel to whomever requests it, without hindrance.  Labelling speech
has no effect in itself on the transmission (or not) of that speech.  Neither
plaintiffs nor the Government suggest that tagging alone would shield minors
from speech or insulate a speaker from criminal liability under the CDA. It
follows that all speech on any topic that is available to adults will also be
available to children using the Internet (unless it is blocked by screening
software running on the computer the child is using).  </P>
<P>115. There is no way that a speaker can use current technology to know if a
listener is using screening software.  </P>
<P>116. Tags can not currently activate or deactivate themselves depending on
the age or location of the receiver.  Critical Path, which posts on-line safer
sex instructions, would be unable to imbed tags that block its speech only in
communities where it may be regarded as indecent.  Critical Path, for example,
must choose either to tag its site (blocking its speech in all communities) or
not to tag, blocking its speech in none. </P>
<H1>The Problems of Offshore Content and Caching</H1>
<P>117. A large percentage, perhaps 40% or more, of content on the Internet
originates outside the United States.  At the hearing, a witness demonstrated
how an Internet user could access a Web site of London (which presumably is on a
server in England), and then link to other sites of interest in England.  A user
can sometimes discern from a URL that content is coming from overseas, since
InterNIC allows a content provider to imbed a country code in a domain name.(20)
 Foreign content is otherwise indistinguishable from domestic content (as long
as it is in English), since foreign speech is created, named, and posted in the
same manner as domestic speech.  There is no requirement that foreign speech
contain a country code in its URL.  It is undisputed that some foreign speech
that travels over the Internet is sexually explicit.</P>
<P>118. The use of &quot;caching&quot; makes it difficult to determine whether
the material originated from foreign or domestic sources.  Because of the high
cost of using the trans- Atlantic and trans-Pacific cables, and because the high
demand on those cables leads to bottleneck delays, content is often &quot;cached&quot;,
or temporarily stored, on servers in the United States.  Material from a foreign
source in Europe can travel over the trans-Atlantic cable to the receiver in the
United States, and pass through a domestic caching server which then stores a
copy for subsequent retrieval.  This domestic caching server, rather than the
original foreign server, will send the material from the cache to the subsequent
receivers, without placing a demand on the trans-oceanic cables.  This shortcut
effectively eliminates most of the distance for both the request and the
information and, hence, most of the delay.  The caching server discards the
stored information according to its configuration (e.g., after a certain time or
as the demand for the information diminishes).  Caching therefore advances core
Internet values:  the cheap and speedy retrieval of information.</P>
<P>119. Caching is not merely an international phenomenon.  Domestic content
providers store popular domestic material on their caching servers to avoid the
delay of successive searches for the same material and to decrease the demand on
their Internet connection.  America Online can cache the home page of the New
York Times on its servers when a subscriber first requests it, so that
subsequent subscribers who make the same request will receive the same home
page, but from America Online's caching service rather than from the New York
Times's server.(21)  </P>
<P>120. Put simply, to follow the example in the prior paragraph, America
Online has no control over the content that the New York Times posts to its Web
site, and the New York Times has no control over America Online's distribution
of that content from a caching server.</P>
<H1>Anonymity</H1>
<P>121. Anonymity is important to Internet users who seek to access sensitive
information, such as users of the Critical Path AIDS Project's Web site, the
users, particularly gay youth, of Queer Resources Directory, and users of Stop
Prisoner Rape (SPR).  Many members of SPR's mailing list have asked to remain
anonymous due to the stigma of prisoner rape.  </P>
<H1>Plaintiffs' Choices Under the CDA</H1>
<P>122. Many speakers who display arguably indecent content on the Internet
must choose between silence and the risk of prosecution.  The CDA's defenses --
credit card verification, adult access codes, and adult personal identification
numbers -- are effectively unavailable for non-commercial, not-for-profit
entities.</P>
<P>123.  The plaintiffs in this action are businesses, libraries,
non-commercial and not-for-profit organizations, and educational societies and
consortia.  Although some of the material that plaintiffs post online -- such as
information regarding protection from AIDS, birth control or prison rape -- is
sexually explicit and may be considered &quot;indecent&quot; or &quot;patently
offensive&quot; in some communities, none of the plaintiffs is a commercial
purveyor of what is commonly termed &quot;pornography.&quot;  </P>
<H1>III.</H1>
<H1>CONCLUSIONS OF LAW</H1>
<P>Plaintiffs have established a reasonable probability of eventual success in
the litigation by demonstrating that &#167;&#167; 223(a)(1)(B) and 223(a)(2) of
the CDA are unconstitutional on their face to the extent that they reach
indecency.  Sections 223(d)(1) and 223(d)(2) of the CDA are unconstitutional on
their face.  Accordingly, plaintiffs have shown irreparable injury, no party has
any interest in the enforcement of an unconstitutional law, and therefore the
public interest will be served by granting the preliminary injunction.  Elrod v.
Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373-74 (1976); Hohe v. Casey, 868 F.2d 69, 72 (3d Cir.),
cert. denied, 493 U.S. 848 (1989); Acierno v. New Castle County, 40 F.3d 645,
653 (3d Cir. 1994).  The motions for preliminary injunction will therefore be
granted.</P>
<P>The views of the members of the Court in support of these conclusions
follow.</P>
<HR>
<P>SLOVITER, Chief Judge, Court of Appeals for the Third Circuit:</P>
<H1>A.</H1>
<H1>Statutory Provisions</H1>

<P>As noted in Part I, Introduction, the plaintiffs' motion for a preliminary
injunction is confined to portions of two provisions of the Communications
Decency Act of 1996, &#167; 223(a) and &#167; 223(d), which they contend violate
their First Amendment free speech and Fifth Amendment due process rights.  To
facilitate reference, I set forth those provisions in full.  Section 223(a), the
&quot;indecency&quot; provision, subjects to criminal penalties of imprisonment
of no more than two years or a fine or both anyone who:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>1) in interstate or foreign communications . . . </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(B) by means of a telecommunications device </P>
<P>knowingly --  </P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(i) makes, creates, or solicits, and</P>
<P>(ii) initiates the transmission of, </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>any comment, request, suggestion, proposal, image, or other communication
which is obscene or indecent, knowing that the recipient of the communication is
under 18 years of age, regardless of whether the maker of such communication
placed the call or initiated the communication; . . . </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(2) knowingly permits any telecommunications facility under his control to
be used for any activity prohibited by paragraph (1) with the intent that it be
used for such activity.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(emphasis added).</P>
<P>The term &quot;telecommunications device&quot; is specifically defined not
to include &quot;the use of an interactive computer service,&quot; as that is
covered by section 223(d)(1).</P>
<P>Section 223(d), the &quot;patently offensive&quot; provision, subjects to
criminal penalties anyone who:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(1) in interstate or foreign communications knowingly--</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(A) uses an interactive computer service to send to a specific person or
persons under 18 years of age, or</P>
<P>(B) uses any interactive computer service to display in a manner available
to a person under 18 years of age, any comment, request, suggestion, proposal,
image or other communication that, in context, depicts or describes, in terms
patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or
excretory activities or organs, regardless of whether the use of such service
placed the call or initiated the communication; or </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(2) knowingly permits any telecommunications facility under such person's
control to be used for an activity prohibited by paragraph (1) with the intent
that it be used for such activity.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(emphasis added).</P>
<P>Two aspects of these provisions stand out.  First, we are dealing with
criminal provisions, subjecting violators to substantial penalties.  Second, the
provisions on indecent and patently offensive communications are not parallel.</P>
<P>The government uses the term &quot;indecent&quot; interchangeably with &quot;patently
offensive&quot; and advises that it so construes the statute in light of the
legislative history and the Supreme Court's analysis of the word &quot;indecent&quot;
in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978).  However,  the CDA does not
define &quot;indecent.&quot;  Notwithstanding Congress' familiarity with
Pacifica, it enacted &#167; 223(a), covering &quot;indecent&quot;
communications, without any language confining &quot;indecent&quot; to
descriptions or depictions of &quot;sexual or excretory activities or organs,&quot;
language it included in the reference to &quot;patently offensive&quot; in &#167;
223(d)(1)(B).  Nor does &#167; 223(a) contain the phrase &quot;in context,&quot;
which the government believes is relevant.  </P>
<P>The failure to define &quot;indecent&quot; in &#167; 223(a) is thus arguably
a negative pregnant and subject to &quot;the rule of construction that an
express statutory requirement here, contrasted with statutory silence there,
shows an intent to confine the requirement to the specified instance.&quot;
Field v. Mans, 116 S.Ct. 437, 442 (1995).  See also Gozlon-Peretz v. United
States, 498 U.S. 395, 404 (1991) (&quot;'[W]here Congress includes particular
language in one section of a statute but omits it in another section of the same
Act, it is generally presumed that Congress acts intentionally and purposely in
the disparate inclusion or exclusion'&quot;) (quoting Russello v. United States,
464 U.S. 16, 23 (1983)).  </P>
<P>Plaintiffs note the difference but do not press this as a basis for
distinguishing between the two sections in their preliminary injunction
arguments and therefore I will also use the words interchangeably for this
purpose, leaving open the issue for consideration at the final judgment stage if
it becomes relevant.</P>
<H1>B.</H1>
<H1>Preliminary Injunction Standard</H1>
<P>To obtain a preliminary injunction, plaintiffs must establish that they are
likely to prevail on the merits and that they will suffer irreparable harm if
injunctive relief is not granted.  We also must consider whether the potential
harm to the defendant from issuance of a temporary restraining order outweighs
possible harm to the plaintiffs if such relief is denied, and whether the
granting of injunctive relief is in the public interest.  See Campbell Soup Co.
v. ConAgra, Inc., 977 F.2d 86, 90-91 (3d Cir. 1992); Bradley v. Pittsburgh Bd.
of Educ., 910 F.2d 1172, 1175 (3d Cir. 1990).</P>
<P>In a case in which the injury alleged is a threat to First Amendment
interests, the finding of irreparable injury is often tied to the likelihood of
success on the merits.  In Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347 (1976), the Supreme
Court emphasized that &quot;the loss of First Amendment freedoms, for even
minimal periods of time, unquestionably constitutes irreparable injury.&quot;
Id. at 373 (citing New York Times Co. v. United States, 403 U.S. 713 (1971)).</P>
<P>Subjecting speakers to criminal penalties for speech that is
constitutionally protected in itself raises the spectre of irreparable harm.
Even if a court were unwilling to draw that conclusion from the language of the
statute itself, plaintiffs have introduced ample evidence that the challenged
provisions, if not enjoined, will have a chilling effect on their free
expression.  Thus, this is not a case in which we are dealing with a mere
incidental inhibition on speech, see Hohe v. Casey, 868 F.2d 69, 73 (3d Cir.),
cert. denied, 493 U.S. 848 (1989), but with a regulation that directly penalizes
speech.</P>
<P>Nor could there be any dispute about the public interest factor which must
be taken into account before a court grants a preliminary injunction.  No long
string of citations is necessary to find that the public interest weighs in
favor of having access to a free flow of constitutionally protected speech.
See, e.g., Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 114 S. Ct. 2445, 2458
(1994); Virginia Bd. of Pharmacy v. Virginia Citizens Consumer Council, 425 U.S.
748, 763-65 (1976).  </P>
<P>Thus, if plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of success on the merits, they
will have shown the irreparable injury needed to entitle them to a preliminary
injunction.</P>
<H1>C.</H1>
<H1>Applicable Standard of Review</H1>
<P>The CDA is patently a government-imposed content-based restriction on

speech, and the speech at issue, whether denominated &quot;indecent&quot; or &quot;patently
offensive,&quot; is entitled to constitutional protection.  See Sable

Communications of California, Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115, 126 (1989).  As such,
the regulation is subject to strict scrutiny, and will only be upheld if it is
justified by a compelling government interest and if it is narrowly tailored to
effectuate that interest.  Sable, 492 U.S. at 126; see also Turner Broadcasting,
114 S. Ct. at 2459 (1994).  &quot;[T]he benefit gained [by a content-based
restriction] must outweigh the loss of constitutionally protected rights.&quot;
Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. at 363.</P>
<P>The government's position on the applicable standard has been less than
pellucid but, despite some references to a somewhat lesser burden employed in
broadcasting cases, it now appears to have conceded that it has the burden of
proof to show both a compelling interest and that the statute regulates least
restrictively.  Tr. of Preliminary Injunction Hearing at 121 (May 10, 1996).  In
any event, the evidence and our Findings of Fact based thereon show that
Internet communication, while unique, is more akin to telephone communication,
at issue in Sable, than to broadcasting, at issue in Pacifica, because, as with
the telephone, an Internet user must act affirmatively and deliberately to
retrieve specific information online.  Even if a broad search will, on occasion,
retrieve unwanted materials, the user virtually always receives some warning of
its content, significantly reducing the element of surprise or &quot;assault&quot;
involved in broadcasting.  Therefore, it is highly unlikely that a very young
child will be randomly &quot;surfing&quot; the Web and come across &quot;indecent&quot;

or &quot;patently offensive&quot; material.  </P>
<P>Judge Dalzell's separate opinion fully explores the reasons for the
differential treatment of radio and television broadcasting for First Amendment
purposes from that accorded other means of communication.  It follows that to
the extent the Court employed a less than strict scrutiny standard of review in
Pacifica and other broadcasting cases, see, e.g., Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v.
FCC, 395 U.S. 367 (1969), there is no reason to employ a less than strict
scrutiny standard of review in this case.</P>
<H1>D.</H1>
<H1>The Nature of the Government's Interest</H1>
<P>The government asserts that shielding minors from access to indecent
materials is the compelling interest supporting the CDA.  It cites in support
the statements of the Supreme Court that &quot;[i]t is evident beyond the need
for elaboration that a State's interest in `safeguarding the physical and
psychological well-being of a minor' is `compelling,'&quot;  New York v. Ferber,
458 U.S. 747, 757 (1982)(quoting Globe Newspaper Co. v. Superior Court, 457 U.S.
596, 607 (1982)), and &quot;there is a compelling interest in protecting the
physical and psychological well-being of minors.  This interest extends to
shielding minors from the influence of literature that is not obscene by adult
standards.&quot;  Sable, 492 U.S at 126.  It also cites the similar quotation
appearing in Fabulous Assoc., Inc. v. Pennsylvania Public Utility Comm'n, 896
F.2d 780, 787 (3d Cir. 1990). </P>
<P>Those statements were made in cases where the potential harm to children
from the material was evident.  Ferber involved the constitutionality of a
statute which prohibited persons from knowingly promoting sexual performances by
children under 16 and distributing material depicting such performances.  Sable
and Fabulous involved the FCC's ban on &quot;dial-a-porn&quot; (dealing by
definition with pornographic telephone messages).  In contrast to the material
at issue in those cases, at least some of the material subject to coverage under
the &quot;indecent&quot; and &quot;patently offensive&quot; provisions of the
CDA may contain valuable literary, artistic or educational information of value
to older minors as well as adults.  The Supreme Court has held that &quot;minors
are entitled to a significant measure of First Amendment protection, and only in
relatively narrow and well-defined circumstances may government bar public
dissemination of protected materials to them.&quot;  Erznoznik v. City of
Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205, 212-213 (1975)(citations omitted).  </P>
<P>In Erznoznik, the Court rejected an argument that an ordinance prohibiting

the display of films containing nudity at drive-in movie theatres served a
compelling interest in protecting minor passersby from the influence of such
films.  The Court held that the prohibition was unduly broad, and explained that
&quot;[s]peech that is neither obscene as to youths nor subject to some other
legitimate proscription cannot be suppressed solely to protect the young from
ideas or images that a legislative body thinks unsuitable for them.&quot;  422
U.S. at 213-14.  As Justice Scalia noted in Sable, &quot;[t]he more pornographic
what is embraced within the . . .  category of `indecency,' the more reasonable
it becomes to insist upon greater assurance of insulation from minors.&quot;
Sable, 492 U.S. at 132 (Scalia, J., concurring).  It follows that where
non-pornographic, albeit sexually explicit, material also falls within the sweep
of the statute, the interest will not be as compelling.  </P>
<P>In part, our consideration of the government's showing of a &quot;compelling
interest&quot; trenches upon the vagueness issue, discussed in detail in Judge
Buckwalter's opinion but equally pertinent to First Amendment analysis.
Material routinely acceptable according to the standards of New York City, such
as the Broadway play Angels in America which concerns homosexuality and AIDS
portrayed in graphic language, may be far less acceptable in smaller, less
cosmopolitan communities of the United States.  Yet the play garnered two Tony
Awards and a Pulitzer prize for its author, and some uninhibited parents and
teachers might deem it to be material to be read or assigned to eleventh and

twelfth graders.  If available on the Internet through some libraries, the text
of the play would likely be accessed in that manner by at least some students,
and it would also arguably fall within the scope of the CDA.</P>
<P>There has been recent public interest in the female genital mutilation
routinely practiced and officially condoned in some countries.  News articles
have been descriptive, and it is not stretching to assume that this is a subject
that occupies news groups and chat rooms on the Internet.  We have no assurance
that these discussions, of obvious interest and relevance to older teenage
girls, will not be viewed as patently offensive - even in context - in some
communities.</P>
<P>Other illustrations abound of non-obscene material likely to be available on
the Internet but subject to the CDA's criminal provisions.  Photographs
appearing in National Geographic or a travel magazine of the sculptures in India
of couples copulating in numerous positions, a written description of a brutal
prison rape, or Francesco Clemente's painting &quot;Labirinth,&quot; see Def.
Exh. 125, all might be considered to &quot;depict or describe, in terms patently
offensive as measured by contemporary community standards, sexual or excretory
activities or organs.&quot;  47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(d)(1).  But the government has
made no showing that it has a compelling interest in preventing a
seventeen-year-old minor from accessing such images.  </P>
<P>By contrast, plaintiffs presented testimony that material that could be
considered indecent, such as that offered by Stop Prisoner Rape or Critical Path
AIDS project, may be critically important for certain older minors.  For
example, there was testimony that one quarter of all new HIV infections in the
United States is estimated to occur in young people between the ages of 13 and
20, an estimate the government made no effort to rebut.  The witnesses believed
that graphic material that their organizations post on the Internet could help
save lives, but were concerned about the CDA's effect on their right to do so.</P>
<P>The government counters that this court should defer to legislative
conclusions about this matter.  However, where First Amendment rights are at
stake, &quot;[d]eference to a legislative finding cannot limit judicial inquiry.&quot;
Sable, 492 U.S. at 129 (quoting Landmark Communications, Inc. v. Virginia, 435
U.S. 829, 843 (1978)).  &quot;[W]hatever deference is due legislative findings
would not foreclose our independent judgment of the facts bearing on an issue of
constitutional law.&quot;  Id. </P>
<P>Moreover, it appears that the legislative &quot;findings&quot; the

government cites concern primarily testimony and statements by legislators about

the prevalence of obscenity, child pornography, and sexual solicitation of
children on the Internet.  Similarly, at the hearings before us the government
introduced exhibits of sexually explicit material through the testimony of Agent
Howard Schmidt, which consisted primarily of the same type of hard-core
pornographic materials (even if not technically obscene) which concerned
Congress and which fill the shelves of &quot;adult&quot; book and magazine
stores.  Plaintiffs emphasize that they do not challenge the Act's restrictions
on speech not protected by the First Amendment, such as obscenity, child
pornography or harassment of children.  Their suit is based on their assertion,
fully supported by their evidence and our findings, that the CDA reaches much
farther.</P>
<P>I am far less confident than the government that its quotations from earlier
cases in the Supreme Court signify that it has shown a compelling interest in
regulating the vast range of online material covered or potentially covered by
the CDA.  Nonetheless, I acknowledge that there is certainly a compelling
government interest to shield a substantial number of minors from some of the
online material that motivated Congress to enact the CDA, and do not rest my
decision on the inadequacy of the government's showing in this regard.</P>
<H1>E.</H1>
<H1>The Reach of the Statute</H1>
<P>Whatever the strength of the interest the government has demonstrated in
preventing minors from accessing &quot;indecent&quot; and &quot;patently
offensive&quot; material online, if the means it has chosen sweeps more broadly
than necessary and thereby chills the expression of adults, it has overstepped
onto rights protected by the First Amendment.  Sable, 492 U.S. at 131.  </P>
<P>The plaintiffs argue that the CDA violates the First Amendment because it
effectively bans a substantial category of protected speech from most parts of
the Internet.  The  government responds that the Act does not on its face or in
effect ban indecent material that is constitutionally protected for adults.
Thus one of the factual issues before us was the likely effect of the CDA on the
free availability of constitutionally protected material.  A wealth of
persuasive evidence, referred to in detail in the Findings of Fact, proved that
it is either technologically impossible or economically prohibitive for many of
the plaintiffs to comply with the CDA without seriously impeding their posting
of online material which adults have a constitutional right to access.</P>
<P>With the possible exception of an e-mail to a known recipient, most content
providers cannot determine the identity and age of every user accessing their
material.  Considering separately content providers that fall roughly into two
categories, we have found that no technology exists which allows those posting
on the category of newsgroups, mail exploders or chat rooms to screen for age.
Speakers using those forms of communication cannot control who receives the
communication, and in most instances are not aware of the identity of the
recipients.  If it is not feasible for speakers who communicate via these forms

of communication to conduct age screening, they would have to reduce the level
of communication to that which is appropriate for children in order to be
protected under the statute.   This would effect a complete ban even for adults
of some expression, albeit &quot;indecent,&quot; to which they are
constitutionally entitled, and thus would be unconstitutional under the holding
in Sable, 492 U.S. at 131.</P>
<P>Even as to content providers in the other broad category, such as the World
Wide Web, where efforts at age verification are technically feasible through the
use of Common Gateway Interface (cgi) scripts (which enable creation of a
document that can process information provided by a Web visitor), the Findings
of Fact show that as a practical matter, non-commercial organizations and even
many commercial organizations using the Web would find it prohibitively
expensive and burdensome to engage in the methods of age verification proposed
by the government, and that even if they could attempt to age verify, there is
little assurance that they could successfully filter out minors.</P>
<P>The government attempts to circumvent this problem by seeking to limit the
scope of the statute to those content providers who are commercial
pornographers, and urges that we do likewise in our obligation to save a
congressional enactment from facial unconstitutionality wherever possible.  But
in light of its plain language and its legislative history, the CDA cannot
reasonably be read as limited to commercial pornographers.  A court may not
impose a narrowing construction on a statute unless it is &quot;readily
susceptible&quot; to such a construction.  Virginia v. American Booksellers

Ass'n, 484 U.S. 383, 397 (1988).  The court may not &quot;rewrite a . . . law to

conform it to constitutional requirements.&quot;  Id.  Although we may prefer an

interpretation of a statute that will preserve the constitutionality of the
statutory scheme, United State v. Clark, 445 U.S. 23, 27 (1980), we do not have
license to rewrite a statute to &quot;create distinctions where none were
intended.&quot;  American Tobacco Co. v. Patterson, 456 U.S. 63, 72 n.6 (1982);
see also Consumer Party v. Davis, 778 F.2d 140, 147 (3d Cir. 1985).  The Court
has often stated that &quot;absent a clearly expressed legislative intention to
the contrary, [statutory] language must ordinarily be regarded as conclusive.&quot;
 Escondido Mut. Water Co. v. La Jolla Band of Mission Indians, 466 U.S. 765, 772
(1984)(quoting North Dakota v. United States, 460 U.S. 300, 312 (1983)).</P>
<P>It is clear from the face of the CDA and from its legislative history that
Congress did not intend to limit its application to commercial purveyors of
pornography.  Congress unquestionably knew how to limit the statute to such
entities if that was its intent, and in fact it did so in provisions relating to
dial-a-porn services.  See 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(b)(2)(A) (criminalizing making
any indecent telephone communication &quot;for commercial purposes&quot;).  It
placed no similar limitation in the CDA.  Moreover, the Conference Report makes
clear that Congress did not intend to limit the application of the statute to
content providers such as those which make available the commercial material
contained in the government's exhibits, and confirms that Congress intended &quot;content
regulation of both commercial and non-commercial providers.&quot;  Conf. Rep. at
191.  See also, 141 Cong. Rec. S8089 (daily ed. June 9, 1995) (Statement of
Senator Exon).     </P>
<P>The scope of the CDA is not confined to material that has a prurient
interest or appeal, one of the hallmarks of obscenity, because Congress sought
to reach farther.  Nor did Congress include language that would define &quot;patently
offensive&quot; or &quot;indecent&quot; to exclude material of serious value.
It follows that to narrow the statute in the manner the government urges would
be an impermissible exercise of our limited judicial function, which is to
review the statute as written for its compliance with constitutional mandates.
 </P>
<P>I conclude inexorably from the foregoing that the CDA reaches speech subject
to the full protection of the First Amendment, at least for adults.(1)  In
questions of the witnesses and in colloquy with the government attorneys, it
became evident that even if &quot;indecent&quot; is read as parallel to &quot;patently
offensive,&quot; the terms would cover a broad range of material from
contemporary films, plays and books showing or describing sexual activities
(e.g., Leaving Las Vegas) to controversial contemporary art and photographs
showing sexual organs in positions that the government conceded would be
patently offensive in some communities (e.g., a Robert Mapplethorpe photograph
depicting a man with an erect penis). </P>
<P>We have also found that there is no effective way for many Internet content
providers to limit the effective reach of the CDA to adults because there is no
realistic way for many providers to ascertain the age of those accessing their
materials.  As a consequence, we have found that &quot;[m]any speakers who
display arguably indecent content on the Internet must choose between silence
and the risk of prosecution.&quot;  Such a choice, forced by sections 223(a) and
(d) of the CDA, strikes at the heart of speech of adults as well as minors.</P>
<H1>F.</H1>
<H1>Whether CDA is Narrowly Tailored</H1>
<P>In the face of such a patent intrusion on a substantial category of
protected speech for adults, there is some irony in considering whether the
statute is narrowly tailored or, as sometimes put, whether Congress has used the
least restrictive means to achieve a compelling government interest.  See Sable,
492 U.S. at 126.  It would appear that the extent of the abridgement of the
protected speech of adults that it has been shown the CDA would effect is too
intrusive to be outweighed by the government's asserted interest, whatever its
strength, in protecting minors from access to indecent material.  Nonetheless,
the formulation of the inquiry requires that we consider the government's
assertion that the statute is narrowly drafted, and I proceed to do so.  </P>
<P>In this case, the government relies on the statutory defenses for its
argument of narrow tailoring.  There are a number of reasons why I am not
persuaded that the statutory defenses can save the CDA from a conclusion of
facial unconstitutionality.</P>
<P>First, it is difficult to characterize a criminal statute that hovers over
each content provider, like the proverbial sword of Damocles, as a narrow
tailoring.  Criminal prosecution, which carries with it the risk of public
obloquy as well as the expense of court preparation and attorneys' fees, could
itself cause incalculable harm.  No provider, whether an individual, non-profit
corporation, or even large publicly held corporation, is likely to willingly
subject itself to prosecution for a miscalculation of the prevalent community
standards or for an error in judgment as to what is indecent.  A successful
defense to a criminal prosecution would be small solace indeed.</P>
<P>Credit card and adult verification services are explicitly referred to as
defenses in &#167; 223(e)(5)(B) of the CDA.  As is set forth fully in the
detailed Findings of Fact, these defenses are not technologically or
economically feasible for most providers.  </P>
<P>The government then falls back on the affirmative defense to prosecution
provided in &#167; 223(e)(5)(A) for a person who &quot;has taken, in good faith,
reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions under the circumstances to
restrict or prevent access by minors to a communication specified in such
subsections . . . including any method which is feasible under available
technology.&quot;  The government emphasizes that &quot;effective&quot; does not
require 100% restriction, and that this defense is &quot;open-ended&quot; and
requires only reasonable efforts based on current technology.</P>
<P>But, as the evidence made clear, there is no such technology at this time.
The government proffered as one option that would constitute a valid affirmative
defense under &#167; 223(e)(5)(A) a &quot;tagging&quot; scheme conceived by Dr.
Olsen in response to this lawsuit whereby a string of characters would be
imbedded in all arguably indecent or patently offensive material.  Our Findings
of Fact set forth fully the reasons why we found that the feasibility and
effectiveness of tagging in the manner proposed by the government has not been
established.  All parties agree that tagging alone does nothing to prevent
children from accessing potentially indecent material, because it depends upon
the cooperation of third parties to block the material on which the tags are
embedded.  Yet these third parties, over which the content providers have no
control, are not subject to the CDA.  I do not believe a statute is narrowly
tailored when it subjects to potential criminal penalties those who must depend
upon third parties for the effective operation of a statutory defense.</P>
<P>Most important, the government's &quot;tagging&quot; proposal is purely
hypothetical and offers no currently operative defense to Internet content
providers.  At this time, there is no agreed-upon &quot;tag&quot; in existence,
and no web browsers or user-based screening systems are now configured to block
tagged material.  Nor, significantly, has the government stipulated that a
content provider could avoid liability simply by tagging its material.   </P>
<P>Third, even if the technology catches up, as the government confidently
predicts, there will still be a not insignificant burden attached to effecting a
tagging defense, a burden one should not have to bear in order to transmit
information protected under the constitution.  For example, to effect tagging
content providers must review all of their material currently published online,
as well as all new material they post in the future, to determine if it could be
considered &quot;patently offensive&quot; in any community nationwide.  This
would be burdensome for all providers, but for the many not-for-profit entities
which currently post thousands of Web pages, this burden would be one impossible
to sustain.</P>
<P>Finally, the viability of the defenses is intricately tied to the clarity of
the CDA's scope.  Because, like Judge Buckwalter, and for many of the reasons he
gives, I believe that &quot;indecent&quot; and &quot;patently offensive&quot;
are inherently vague, particularly in light of the government's inability to
identify the relevant community by whose standards the material will be judged,
I am not persuaded by the government that the statutory defenses in &#167;
223(e) provide effective protection from the unconstitutional reach of the
statute.</P>
<P>Minors would not be left without any protection from exposure to patently
unsuitable material on the Internet should the challenged provisions of the CDA
be preliminarily enjoined. Vigorous enforcement of current obscenity and child
pornography laws should suffice to address the problem the government identified
in court and which concerned Congress.  When the CDA was under consideration by
Congress, the Justice Department itself communicated its view that it was not
necessary because it was prosecuting online obscenity, child pornography and
child solicitation under existing laws, and would continue to do so.(2)  It
follows that the CDA is not narrowly tailored, and the government's attempt to

defend it on that ground must fail.</P>
<H1>G.</H1>
<H1>Preliminary Injunction</H1>
<P>When Congress decided that material unsuitable for minors was available on
the Internet, it could have chosen to assist and support the development of
technology that would enable parents, schools, and libraries to screen such
material from their end.  It did not do so, and thus did not follow the example
available in the print media where non-obscene but indecent and patently
offensive books and magazines abound.  Those responsible for minors undertake
the primary obligation to prevent their exposure to such material.  Instead, in
the CDA Congress chose to place on the speakers the obligation of screening the
material that would possibly offend some communities. </P>
<P>Whether Congress' decision was a wise one is not at issue here.  It was
unquestionably a decision that placed the CDA in serious conflict with our most
cherished protection - the right to choose the material to which we would have
access.  </P>
<P>The government makes what I view as an extraordinary argument in its brief.
It argues that blocking technology needed for effective parental control is not
yet widespread but that it &quot;will imminently be in place.&quot; Government's
Post-hearing Memorandum at 66.  It then states that if we uphold the CDA, it &quot;will
likely unleash the 'creative genius' of the Internet community to find a myriad
of possible solutions.&quot;  I can imagine few arguments less likely to
persuade a court to uphold a criminal statute than one that depends on future
technology to cabin the reach of the statute within constitutional bounds.</P>
<P>The government makes yet another argument that troubles me.  It suggests
that the concerns expressed by the plaintiffs and the questions posed by the
court reflect an exaggerated supposition of how it would apply the law, and that
we should, in effect, trust the Department of Justice to limit the CDA's
application in a reasonable fashion that would avoid prosecution for placing on
the Internet works of serious literary or artistic merit.  That would require a
broad trust indeed from a generation of judges not far removed from the attacks
on James Joyce's Ulysses as obscene.  See United States v. One Book Entitled
Ulysses, 72 F.2d 705 (2d Cir. 1934); see also Book Named &quot;John Cleland's
Memoirs of a Woman of Pleasure&quot; v. Attorney General of Mass., 383 U.S. 413
(1966).  Even if we were to place confidence in the reasonable judgment of the
representatives of the Department of Justice who appeared before us, the
Department is not a monolithic structure, and individual U.S. Attorneys in the
various districts of the country have or appear to exercise some independence,
as reflected by the Department's tolerance of duplicative challenges in this
very case.</P>
<P>But the bottom line is that the First Amendment should not be interpreted to
require us to entrust the protection it affords to the judgment of prosecutors.
Prosecutors come and go. Even federal judges are limited to life tenure.  The
First Amendment remains to give protection to future generations as well.  I
have no hesitancy in concluding that it is likely that plaintiffs will prevail
on the merits of their argument that the challenged provisions of the CDA are
facially invalid under both the First and Fifth Amendments.  </P>
<HR>
<P>BUCKWALTER, District Judge</P>
<H1>A.</H1>
<P>I believe that plaintiffs should prevail in this litigation.  </P>
<P>My conclusion differs in part from my original memorandum filed in
conjunction with the request for a Temporary Restraining Order.  As part of the
expedited review (per &#167; 561 of the CDA), and in contrast to the limited
documentation available to me at the time of the T.R.O. hearing, we have now

gathered voluminous evidence presented by way of sworn declarations, live
testimony, demonstrative evidence, and other exhibits.(1)  Based upon our
findings of fact derived from careful consideration of that evidence, I now
conclude that this statute is overbroad and does not meet the strict scrutiny
standard in Sable Communications of California, Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115
(1989).</P>
<P>More specifically, I now find that current technology is inadequate to
provide a safe harbor to most speakers on the Internet.  On this issue, I concur
in Chief Judge Sloviter's opinion.  In addition, I continue to believe that the
word &quot;indecent&quot; is unconstitutionally vague, and I find that the terms
&quot;in context&quot; and &quot;patently offensive&quot; also are so vague as
to violate the First and Fifth Amendments.</P>
<P>It is, of course, correct that statutes that attempt to regulate the content
of speech presumptively violate the First Amendment.  <I>See e.g.</I> R.A.V. v.
City of Saint Paul, 505 U.S. 377, 381 (1992).  That is as it should be.  The
prohibition against Government's regulation of speech cannot be set forth any
clearer than in the language of the First Amendment itself.  I suspect, however,
that it may come as a surprise to many people who have not followed the
evolution of constitutional law that, by implication at least, the First
Amendment provides that Congress shall make no law abridging the freedom of
speech <I>unless that law advances a compelling governmental interest</I>.(2)
Our cherished freedom of speech does not cover as broad a spectrum as one may
have gleaned from a simple reading of the Amendment.(3)  </P>
<P>First Amendment jurisprudence has developed into a study of intertwining
standards and applications, perhaps as a necessary response to our ever-evolving
culture and modes of communication.(4)  </P>
<P>Essentially, my concerns are these:  above all, I believe that the
challenged provisions are so vague as to violate both the First and Fifth
Amendments, and in particular that Congress' reliance on Pacifica is misplaced.
In addition, I believe that technology as it currently exists -- and it bears
repeating that we are at the preliminary injunction phase only -- cannot provide
a safe harbor for most speakers on the Internet, thus rendering the statute
unconstitutional under a strict scrutiny analysis.  I refer to Chief Judge
Sloviter's more detailed analysis of this issue. </P>
<P>While I believe that our findings of fact clearly show that as yet no
defense is technologically feasible, and while I also have found the present Act
to be unconstitutionally vague, I believe it is too early in the development of
this new medium to conclude that other attempts to regulate protected speech
within the medium will fail a challenge.  That is to say that I specifically do
not find that any and all statutory regulation of protected speech on the
Internet could not survive constitutional scrutiny.  Prior cases have
established that government regulation to prevent access by minors to speech
protected for adults, even in media considered the vanguard of our First
Amendment protections, like print, may withstand a constitutional challenge.
<I> See e.g.</I> Ginsberg v. New York, 390 U.S. 629, 635 (1968) (&quot;`Material
which is protected for distribution to adults is not necessarily
constitutionally protected from restriction upon its dissemination to children.'&quot;)
(quoting Bookcase Inc. v. Broderick, 18 N.Y.2d 71, 75, 271 N.Y.S.2d 947, 952,
218 N.E.2d 668, 671 (1966), <I>appeal dismissed, sub nom</I> Bookcase, Inc. v.
Leary, 385 U.S. 12 (1966)).  It should be noted that those restrictions that
have been found constitutional were sensitive to the unique qualities of the
medium at which the restriction was aimed.  </P>
<H1>B.</H1>
<P>This statute, all parties agree, deals with protected speech, the
preservation of which has been extolled by court after court in case after case
as the keystone, the bulwark, the very heart of our democracy. What is more, the
CDA attempts to regulate protected speech through criminal sanctions, thus
implicating not only the First but also the Fifth Amendment of our Constitution.
 The concept of due process is every bit as important to our form of government
as is free speech.  If free speech is at the heart of our democracy, then surely
due process is the very lifeblood of our body politic; for without it, democracy
could not survive.  Distilled to its essence, due process is, of course, nothing
more and nothing less than fair play.  If our citizens cannot rely on fair play
in their relationship with their government, the stature of our government as a
shining example of democracy would be greatly diminished.  I believe that an
exacting or strict scrutiny of a statute which attempts to criminalize protected
speech requires a word by word look at that statute to be sure that it clearly
sets forth as precisely as possible what constitutes a violation of the statute.</P>

<P>The reason for such an examination is obvious.  If the Government is going
to intrude upon the sacred ground of the First Amendment and tell its citizens
that their exercise of protected speech could land them in jail, the law
imposing such a penalty must clearly define the prohibited speech not only for
the potential offender but also for the potential enforcer.  Kolender, 461 U.S.

<P>In dealing with issues of vagueness and due process over the years, the
Supreme Court has enunciated many notable principles.  One concern with vague
laws relates to the issue of notice.  The older cases have used phrases such as
&quot;a statute which either forbids or requires the doing of an act in terms so
vague that men of common intelligence must necessarily guess at its meaning and
differ as to its application violates the first essential of due process of law,&quot;
 Connally v. General Const. Co., 269 U.S. 385, 391 (1926) (citations omitted); &quot;it
will not do to hold an average man to the peril of indictment for the unwise
exercise of his . . . knowledge involving so many factors of varying effect that
neither the person to decide in advance nor the jury to try him after the fact
can safely and certainly judge the result,&quot; Cline v. Frink Dairy Co., 274
U.S. 445, 465 (1927); and &quot;[n]o one may be required at peril of life,
liberty or property to speculate as to the meaning of penal statutes.  All are
entitled to be informed as to what the State commands or forbids,&quot; Lanzetta
v. New Jersey, 306 U.S. 451, 453 (1939).  Second, the Court has said that laws
must provide precise standards for those who apply them to prevent arbitrary and
discriminatory enforcement, because &quot;[w]hen the legislature fails to
provide such minimal guidelines, a criminal statute may permit `a standardless
sweep [that] allows policemen, prosecutors, and juries to pursue their personal
predilections.'&quot;  Kolender, 461 U.S. at 358 (citing Goguen, 415 U.S. at
575).  Finally, when First Amendment concerns have been implicated, a stricter
standard of examination for vagueness is imperative.  &quot;[T]his court has
intimated that stricter standards of permissible statutory vagueness may be
applied to a statute having a potentially inhibiting effect on speech; a man may
the less be required to act at his peril here, because the free dissemination of
ideas may be the loser.&quot;  Smith v. California, 361 U.S. 147, 151 (1959).
<I>See also</I> Hoffman Estates, 455 U.S. at 499 (&quot;[P]erhaps the most
important factor affecting the clarity that the Constitution demands of a law is
whether it threatens to inhibit the exercise of constitutionally protected
rights.  If, for example, the law interferes with the right of free speech . . .
, a more stringent vagueness test should apply.&quot;) (citations omitted).</P>
<P>A case which sums up vagueness as it relates to due process as succinctly as
any other is Grayned v. City of Rockford.  Here the court said:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>It is a basic principle of due process that an enactment is void for
vagueness if its prohibitions are not clearly defined.  Vague laws offend
several important values.  First, because we assume that man is free to steer

between lawful and unlawful conduct, we insist that laws give the person of
ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is prohibited, so
that he may act accordingly.  Vague laws may trap the innocent by not providing
fair warning.  Second, if arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement is to be
prevented, laws must provide explicit standards for those who apply them.  A
vague law impermissibly delegates basic policy matters to policemen, judges, and
juries for resolution on an <I>ad hoc</I> and subjective basis, with the
attendant dangers of arbitrary and discriminatory application.  Third, but
related, where a vague statute &quot;abut[s] upon sensitive areas of basic First
Amendment freedoms,&quot; it &quot;operates to inhibit the exercise of [those]
freedoms.&quot;  Uncertain meanings inevitably lead citizens to &quot;'steer far
wider of the unlawful zone' . . . than if the boundaries of the forbidden areas
were clearly marked.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108-109 (citations omitted).  </P>
<P>At the same time, in considering the vagueness issue, as the Government
correctly points out, &quot;[C]ondemned to the use of words, we can never expect
mathematical certainty from our language.&quot; Grayned, 408 U.S. at 110.  <I>See
also </I>Hoffman Estates, 455 U.S. 489; Hynes v. Mayor &amp; Council of Oradell,
425 U.S. 610 (1976); Goguen, 415 U.S. 566.   In addition, it will always be true
that the fertile legal &quot;imagination can conjure hypothetical cases in which
the meaning of [disputed] terms will be in nice question.&quot;  American
Communications Assn. v. Douds, 339 U.S. 382, 412 (1950).  Thus, as I considered
the vagueness issue I have kept in mind the observation of Justice Holmes,
denying a challenge to vagueness in Nash v. United States, 229 U.S. 373 (1913).
To Justice Holmes, &quot;the law is full of instances where a man's fate depends
on his estimating rightly, that is, as the jury subsequently estimates it, some
matter of degree.  If his judgment is wrong, not only may he incur a fine or a
short imprisonment . . ., he may incur the penalty of death.&quot;  Nash, 229
U.S. at 377.  Even more recently the court has stated that &quot;due process
does not require `impossible standards' of clarity.&quot;  Kolender, 461 U.S. at
361, (quoting United States v. Petrillo, 332 U.S. 1, 7-8 (1947)).  It is with
all of these principles in mind, as they interplay with the unique features of
the Internet, that I have reached my conclusion.</P>
<P>The fundamental constitutional principle that concerns me is one of simple
fairness, and that is absent in the CDA.  The Government initially argues that &quot;indecent&quot;
in this statute is the same as &quot;patently offensive.&quot;  I do not agree
that a facial reading of this statute supports that conclusion.  The CDA does
not define the term &quot;indecent,&quot; and the FCC has not promulgated
regulations defining indecency in the medium of cyberspace.   If &quot;indecent&quot;
and &quot;patently offensive&quot; were intended to have the same meaning,
surely section (a) could have mirrored section (d)'s language.(5)  Indecent in
this statute is an undefined word which, standing alone, offers no guidelines
whatsoever as to its parameters.  Interestingly, another federal crime gives a
definition to indecent entirely different from that proposed in the present
case.(6)  While not applicable here, this example shows the indeterminate nature
of the word and the need for clear definition, particularly in a statute which
infringes upon protected speech.  Although the use of different terms in &#167;
223(a) and (d) suggests that Congress intended that the terms have different
meanings, the Conference Report indicates an intention to treat &#167; 223(a) as
containing the same language as &#167; 223(d).  Conf. Rep. at 188-89 (&quot;The
conferees intend that the term indecency . . . has the same meaning as
established in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978) and [Sable] and &quot;New
section 223(d)(1) codifies the definition of indecency from [Pacifica] . . . .
The precise contours of the definition of indecency have varied . . . .  The
essence of the phrase -- patently offensive descriptions of sexual and excretory
activities -- has remained constant, however.&quot;).  Therefore, I will
acknowledge that the term indecency is &quot;reasonably susceptible&quot; to the
definition offered in the Conference Report and might therefore adopt such a
narrowing construction if it would thereby preserve the constitutionality of the
statute.  <I>See</I> Virginia v. American Booksellers Association, 484 U.S.
383, 397 (1988);  Erznoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205 (1975).
Accepting these terms as synonymous, however, provides no greater help to a
speaker attempting to comply with the CDA.  Contrary to the Government's
suggestion, Pacifica does not answer the question of whether the terms pass
constitutional muster in the present case.  In Pacifica, the Court did not
consider a vagueness challenge to the term &quot;indecent,&quot; but considered
only whether the Government had the authority to regulate the particular
broadcast at issue -- George Carlin's Monologue entitled &quot;Filthy Words.&quot;
 In finding in the affirmative, the Court emphasized that its narrow holding
applied only to broadcasting, which is &quot;uniquely accessible to children,
even those too young to read.&quot;  438 U.S. at 749.  Thus, while the Court
sanctioned the FCC's time restrictions on a radio program that repeatedly used

vulgar language, the Supreme Court did not hold that use of the term &quot;indecent&quot;
in a statute applied to other media, particularly a criminal statute, would be
on safe constitutional ground.</P>
<P>The Supreme Court more recently had occasion to consider a statute banning &quot;indecent&quot;
material in the dial-a-porn context in Sable, 492 U.S. 115, and found that a
complete ban on such programming violated the First Amendment because it was not
narrowly tailored to serve the purpose of limiting children's access to
commercial pornographic telephone messages.  Once again, the Court did not
consider a challenge to the term &quot;indecent&quot; on vagueness grounds, and
indeed has never directly ruled on this issue.</P>
<P>Several other courts have, however, upheld the use of the term in statutes
regulating different media.  For example, in Information Providers' Coalition v.
FCC, 928 F.2d 866 (9th Cir. 1991), the Ninth Circuit Court of Appeals considered
whether the term &quot;indecent&quot; in the 1989 Amendment to the
Communications Act regulating access to telephone dial-a-porn services and the
FCC's implementing regulations was void for vagueness.  The FCC had defined &quot;indecent&quot;
as &quot;the description or depiction of sexual or excretory activities or
organs in a patently offensive manner as measured by contemporary community
standards for the telephone medium.&quot;  928 F.2d at 874.  Although
recognizing that the Supreme Court had never explicitly ruled on a vagueness
challenge to the term, the court read Sable and Pacifica as having implicitly
accepted the use of this definition of &quot;indecent.&quot;  The court further
stated that the FCC's definition of &quot;indecent&quot; was no less imprecise
than was the definition of &quot;obscenity&quot; as announced in Miller v.
California, 413 U.S. 15, 25 (1973), and thus concluded that &quot;indecent&quot;
as pertained to dial-a-porn regulations must survive a vagueness challenge.
<I>See also</I> Dial Information Services v. Thornburgh, 938 F.2d 1535 (2d Cir.
1991), (upholding the use of &quot;indecent&quot; in the same amendment to the
Communications Act and FCC regulations.); Action for Children's Television v.
FCC, 932 F.2d 1504, 1508 (D.C.Cir. 1991) (rejecting vagueness challenge to &quot;indecency&quot;
provision in broadcast television regulations).(7)</P>
<P>Notably, however, in these telephone and cable television cases the FCC had
defined indecent as patently offensive by reference to contemporary community
standards for that particular medium.  <I>See, e.g.</I>, Pacifica, 438 U.S. at
732 (defining &quot;indecent&quot; by reference to terms &quot;patently
offensive as measured by contemporary community standards for the broadcast
medium&quot;); Dial Information Services, 938 F.2d at 1540 (defining indecency
by reference to contemporary community standards for the telephone medium).
Here, the provision is not so limited.  In fact, there is no effort to conform
the restricting terms to the medium of cyberspace, as is required under Pacifica
and its progeny.</P>
<P>The Government attempts to save the &quot;indecency&quot; and &quot;patently
offensive&quot; provisions by claiming that the provisions would only be used to
prosecute pornographic works which, when considered &quot;in context&quot; as
the statute requires, would be considered &quot;indecent&quot; or &quot;patently
offensive&quot; in any community.  The Government thus contends that plaintiffs'
fears of prosecution for publishing material about matters of health, art,
literature or civil liberties are exaggerated and unjustified.  The Government's
argument raises two issues:  first is the question of which &quot;community
standards&quot; apply in cyberspace, under the CDA; and second is the
proposition that citizens should simply rely upon prosecutors to apply the
statute constitutionally.</P>
<P>Are the contemporary community standards to be applied those of the vast
world of cyberspace, in accordance with the Act's apparent intent to establish a
uniform national standard of content regulation?  The Government offered no
evidence of any such national standard or nationwide consensus as to what would
be considered &quot;patently offensive&quot;.  On the contrary, in supporting
the use of the term &quot;indecent&quot; in the CDA, the Government suggests
that, in part, this term was chosen as a means of insulating children from

material not restricted under current obscenity laws.  This additional term is
necessary, the Government states, because &quot;whether something rises to the
level of obscene is a legal conclusion that, by definition, may vary from
community to community.&quot;  Govt. Brief at 31.  In support of its argument,
the Government points to the Second Circuit's decision in United States v.
Various Articles of Obscene Merchandise, Schedule No. 2102, 709 F.2d 132, 134,
137 (2d Cir. 1983), which upheld the district court's conclusion that &quot;detailed
portrayals of genitalia, sexual intercourse, fellatio, and masturbation&quot;
including the film &quot;Deep Throat&quot; and other pornographic films and
magazines, are not obscene in light of the community standards prevailing in New
York City.&quot;  What this argument indicates is that as interpretations of
obscenity ebb and flow throughout various communities, restrictions on indecent
material are meant to cover a greater or lesser quantity of material not reached
by each community's obscenity standard.  It follows that to do this, what
constitutes indecency must be as open to fluctuation as the obscenity standard
and cannot be rigidly constructed as a single national standard if it is meant
to function as the Government has suggested.  As Justice Scalia stated, &quot;[t]he
more narrow the understanding of what is `obscene,' . . . the more pornographic
what is embraced within the residual category of `indecency.'&quot;  Sable, 492
U.S. at 132 (Scalia, J. concurring).  This understanding is consistent with the
case law, in which the Supreme Court has explained that the relevant community
is the one where the information is accessed and where the local jury sits.
<I>See</I> Sable, 492 U.S. at 125; Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87
(1974); Miller, 413 U.S. at 30 (&quot;[O]ur nation is simply too big and too
diverse for this Court to reasonably expect that such standards [of what is
patently offensive] could be articulated for all 50 states in a single
formulation.&quot;).  However, the Conference Report with regard to the CDA
states that the Act is &quot;intended to establish a uniform national standard
of content regulation.&quot;  Conf. Rep. at 191.  This conflict inevitably
leaves the reader of the CDA unable to discern the relevant &quot;community
standard,&quot; and will undoubtedly cause Internet users to &quot;steer far
wider of the unlawful zone&quot; than if the community standard to be applied
were clearly defined.  The chilling effect on the Internet users' exercise of
free speech is obvious.  <I>See</I> Baggett v. Bullitt, 377 U.S. 360, 372
(1964).  This is precisely the vice of vagueness.</P>
<P>In addition, the Government's argument that the challenged provisions will
be applied only to &quot;pornographic&quot; materials, and will not be applied
to works with serious value is without support in the CDA itself.  Unlike in the
obscenity context, indecency has not been defined to exclude works of serious
literary, artistic, political or scientific value, and therefore the
Government's suggestion that it will not be used to prosecute publishers of such
material is without foundation in the law itself.  The Government's claim that
the work must be considered patently offensive &quot;in context&quot; does

nothing to clarify the provision, for it fails to explain which context is
relevant.  &quot;Context&quot; may refer to, among other things, the nature of
the communication as a whole, the time of day it was conveyed, the medium used,
the identity of the speaker, or whether or not it is accompanied by appropriate
warnings.  <I>See e.g.</I>, Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 741 n.16, n.17 (referring to &quot;the
context of the whole book,&quot; and to the unique interpretation of the First
Amendment &quot;in the broadcasting context&quot;).</P>
<P>The thrust of the Government's argument is that the court should trust
prosecutors to prosecute only a small segment of those speakers subject to the
CDA's restrictions, and whose works would reasonably be considered &quot;patently
offensive&quot; in every community.  Such unfettered discretion to prosecutors,
however, is precisely what due process does not allow.  &quot;It will not do to
say that a prosecutor's sense of fairness and the Constitution would prevent a
successful . . . prosecution for some of the activities seemingly embraced
within the sweeping statutory definitions.  The hazard of being prosecuted . . .
nevertheless remains . . . .  Well-intentioned prosecutors and judicial
safeguards do not neutralize the vice of a vague law.&quot;  Baggett, 377 U.S.
at 373-74; <I>see also</I> Keyishian v. Board of Regents, 385 U.S. 589, 599
(1967)(&quot;[i]t is no answer&quot; to a vague law for the Government &quot;to
say that the statute would not be applied in such a case.&quot;).  And we cannot
overlook the vagaries of politics.  What may be, figuratively speaking, one
administration's pen may be another's sword.</P>
<P>The evidence and arguments presented by the Government illustrate the
possibility of arbitrary enforcement of the Act.  For example, one Government
expert opined that any of the so-called &quot;seven dirty words&quot; used in
the Carlin monologue would be subject to the CDA and therefore should be &quot;tagged,&quot;
as should paintings of nudes displayed on a museum's web site.  The Government
has suggested in its brief, however, that the Act should not be so applied.
<I>See</I> Govt. Brief at 37 (suggesting that &quot;seven dirty words&quot; if
used &quot;in the context of serious discussions&quot;<B> </B>would not be
subject to the Act).  Even Government counsel was unable to define &quot;indecency&quot;
with specificity.  The Justice Department attorney could not respond to numerous
questions from the court regarding whether, for example, artistic photographs of
a nude man with an erect penis, depictions of Indian statues portraying
different methods of copulation, or the transcript of a scene from a
contemporary play about AIDS could be considered &quot;indecent&quot; under the
Act.  </P>
<P>Plaintiffs also argue that section 223(e)(5)(A) of the CDA, offering a
defense for speakers who take &quot;good faith, reasonable, effective and
appropriate actions under the circumstances to restrict or prevent access by
minors to a communication&quot; covered by the Act, is unconstitutionally vague
because it fails to specify what would constitute an effective defense to
prosecution.  The plain language of the safe harbor provision indicates an
effort to ensure that the statute limits speech in the least restrictive means
possible by taking into account emerging technologies in allowing for any and
all &quot;reasonable, effective and appropriate&quot; approaches to restricting
minors' access to the proscribed material.  But, the statute itself does not
contain any description of what, other than credit card verification and adult
identification codes -- which we have established remain unavailable to most
content providers -- will protect a speaker from prosecution.  Significantly,
although the FCC is authorized to specify measures that might satisfy this
defense, the FCC's views will not be definitive but will only &quot;be admitted
as evidence of good faith efforts&quot; that the defendant has met the
requirements of the defense.  47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(e)(6).  Thus, individuals
attempting to comply with the statute presently have no clear indication of what
actions will ensure that they will be insulated from criminal sanctions under
the CDA.           </P>
<H1>C.</H1>
<P>The consequences of posting indecent content are severe.(8)  I recognize
that people must make judgments each and every day, many times in the most
intimate of relationships and that an error in judgment can have serious
consequences.  It is also true that where those consequences involve penal
sanctions, a criminal law or statute has more often than not carefully defined
the proscribed conduct.  It is not so much that the accused needs these precise
definitions, as it has been said he or she rarely reads the law in advance.
What is more important is that the enforcer of statutes must be guided by clear
and precise standards.  In statutes that break into relatively new areas, such
as this one, the need for definition of terms is greater, because even commonly
understood terms may have different connotations or parameters in this new
context.(9)   Words cannot define conduct with mathematical certainty, and
lawyers, like the bright and intelligent ones now before us, will most certainly
continue to devise ways by which to challenge them.  This rationale, however,
can neither support a finding of constitutionality nor relieve legislators from
the very difficult task of carefully drafting legislation tailored to its goal
and sensitive to the unique characteristics of, in this instance, cyberspace.</P>
<HR>
<P>DALZELL, District Judge</P>
<H1>A. Introduction</H1>
<P>I begin with first principles:  As a general rule, the Constitution forbids
the Government from silencing speakers because of their particular message.
R.A.V. v. City of Saint Paul, 112 S. Ct. 2538, 2542 (1992).  &quot;Our political
system and cultural life rest upon this ideal.&quot;  Turner Broadcasting Sys.
v. FCC, 114 S. Ct. 2445, 2458 (1994).  This general rule is subject only to &quot;narrow
and well-understood exceptions&quot;.  Id.  A law that, as here, regulates
speech on the basis of its content, is &quot;presumptively invalid&quot;.
R.A.V., 112 S. Ct. at 2542.</P>
<P>Two of the exceptions to this general rule deal with obscenity (commonly
understood to include so-called hardcore pornography), Miller v. California, 413
U.S. 15 (1973), and child pornography, New York v. Ferber, 458 U.S. 747 (1982).
The Government can and does punish with criminal sanction people who engage in
these forms of speech.  18 U.S.C. &#167;&#167; 1464-65 (criminalizing obscene
material); id. &#167;&#167; 2251-52 (criminalizing child pornography).  Indeed,
the Government could punish these forms of speech on the Internet even without
the CDA.  E.g., United States v. Thomas, 74 F.3d 701, 704-05 (6th Cir. 1995)
(affirming obscenity convictions for the operation of a computer bulletin
board).  </P>
<P>The Government could also completely ban obscenity and child pornography
from the Internet.  No Internet speaker has a right to engage in these forms of
speech, and no Internet listener has a right to receive them.  Child pornography
and obscenity have &quot;no constitutional protection, and the government may
ban [them] outright in certain media, or in all.&quot;  Alliance for Community
Media v. FCC, 56 F.3d 105, 112 (D.C. Cir. 1995) (citing R.A.V., 112 S. Ct. at
2545), cert. granted sub nom. Denver Area Educ. Telecommunications Consortium,
116 S. Ct. 471 (1996); see also Ferber, 458 U.S. at 756.  As R.A.V. notes, &quot;'the
freedom of speech' referred to by the First Amendment does not include a freedom
to disregard these traditional limitations.&quot;  R.A.V., 112 S. Ct. at 2543.</P>
<P>The cases before us, however, are not about obscenity or child pornography.
Plaintiffs in these actions claim no right to engage in these forms of speech in
the future, nor does the Government intimate that plaintiffs have engaged in
these forms of speech in the past.</P>
<P>This case is about &quot;indecency&quot;, as that word has come to be
understood since the Supreme Court's decisions in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation,
438 U.S. 726 (1976), and Sable Communications v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115 (1989).  The
legal difficulties in these actions arise because of the special place that
indecency occupies in the Supreme Court's First Amendment jurisprudence.  While
adults have a First Amendment right to engage in indecent speech, Sable, 492
U.S. at 126; see also Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 747-48, the Supreme Court has also
held that the Government may, consistent with the Constitution, regulate
indecency on radio and television, and in the &quot;dial-a-porn&quot; context,
as long as the regulation does not operate as a complete ban.  Thus, any
regulation of indecency in these areas must give adults access to indecent
speech, which is their right.</P>
<P>The Government may only regulate indecent speech for a compelling reason,
and in the least restrictive manner.  Sable, 492 U.S. at 126.  &quot;It is not
enough to show that the Government's ends are compelling; the means must be
carefully tailored to achieve those ends.&quot;  Id.  This &quot;most exacting
scrutiny&quot;, Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2459, requires the Government to &quot;demonstrate
that the recited harms are real, not merely conjectural, and that the regulation
will in fact alleviate these harms in a direct and material way.&quot;  United
States v. National Treasury Employees Union, 115 S. Ct. 1003, 1017 (1995)
(citing Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 1017).  Thus, although our analysis here must
balance ends and means, the scales tip at the outset in plaintiffs' favor.  This
is so because &quot;[r]egulations which permit the Government to discriminate on
the basis of the content of the message cannot be tolerated under the First
Amendment.&quot;  Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v. Members of the New York State
Crime Victims Board, 502 U.S. 105, 116 (1991) (citation omitted).  </P>
<P>The Government argues that this case is really about pornography on the
Internet.  Apart from hardcore and child pornography, however, the word
pornography does not have a fixed legal meaning.  When I use the word
pornography in my analysis below, I refer to for-profit purveyors of sexually
explicit, &quot;adult&quot; material similar to that at issue in Sable.  See 492
U.S. at 118.  Pornography is normally either obscene or indecent, as Justice
Scalia noted in his concurrence in Sable.  Id. at 132.  I would avoid using such
an imprecise (and overbroad) word, but I feel compelled to do so here, since
Congress undoubtedly had such material in mind when it passed the CDA.  See S.
Rep. No. 230, 104th Cong., 2d Sess. 187-91 (1996), reprinted in 1996
U.S.C.C.A.N. 10, 200-05 [hereinafter Senate Report].  Moreover, the Government
has defended the Act before this court by arguing that the Act could be
constitutionally applied to such material.</P>
<P>Plaintiffs have, as noted, moved for a preliminary injunction.  The
standards for such relief are well-settled.  Plaintiffs seeking preliminary
injunctive relief must show (1) &quot;[a] reasonable probability of eventual
success in the litigation&quot; and (2) &quot;irreparabl[e] injur[y] pendente
lite&quot; if relief is not granted.  Acierno v. New Castle County, 40 F.2d 645,
653 (3d Cir. 1994).  We must also consider, if appropriate, (3) &quot;the
possibility of harm to other interested persons from the grant or denial of the
injunction&quot;, and (4) &quot;the public interest&quot;.  Id.; see also
Opticians Ass'n v. Independent Opticians, 920 F.2d 187, 192 (3d Cir. 1990).</P>
<P>In a First Amendment challenge, a plaintiff who meets the first prong of the
test for a preliminary injunction will almost certainly meet the second, since
irreparable injury normally arises out of the deprivation of speech rights, &quot;for
even minimal periods of time&quot;.  Elrod v. Burns, 427 U.S. 347, 373-74
(1976); Hohe v. Casey, 868 F.2d 69, 72 (3d Cir.), cert. denied, 493 U.S. 848
(1989).  Of course, neither the Government nor the public generally can claim an
interest in the enforcement of an unconstitutional law.  Thus, I focus my legal
analysis today primarily on whether plaintiffs have shown a likelihood of
success on their claim that the CDA is unconstitutional.  The issues of
irreparable harm to plaintiffs, harm to third parties, and the public interest
all flow from that determination.(1)</P>
<P>Plaintiffs' challenge here is a &quot;facial&quot; one.  A law that
regulates the content of speech is facially invalid if it does not pass the &quot;most
exacting scrutiny&quot; that we have described above, or if it would &quot;penalize
a substantial amount of speech that is constitutionally protected&quot;.
Forsyth County v. Nationalist Movement, 112 S. Ct. 2395, 2401 (1992).  This is
so even if some applications would be &quot;constitutionally unobjectionable&quot;.
 Id.; see also National Treasury Employees Union v. United States, 990 F.2d
1271, 1279-80 (D.C. Cir. 1993) (Randolph, J., concurring), aff'd, 115 S. Ct.
1003 (1995).  Sometimes facial challenges require an inquiry into a party's &quot;standing&quot;
(i.e., whether a party may properly challenge a law as facially invalid).  See,
e.g., Ferber, 458 U.S. at 767-79.  At other times a facial challenge requires
only an inquiry into the law's reach.  See, e.g., R.A.V., 112 S. Ct. at 2547.(2)
 As I describe it in part C below, I have no question that plaintiffs here have
standing to challenge the validity of the CDA, and, indeed, the Government has
not seriously challenged plaintiffs' standing to do so.  See, e.g., Virginia v.
American Booksellers Assoc., 484 U.S. 383, 392 (1988).  Thus, the focus is
squarely on the merits of plaintiffs' facial challenge.(3)</P>
<P>I divide my legal analysis below into three parts.  In Part B, I examine the
traditional definition of indecency and relate it to the provisions of the CDA
at issue in this action.  From this analysis I conclude that &#167; 223(a) and &#167;
223(d) of the CDA reach the same kind of speech.  My analysis also convinces me
that plaintiffs are unlikely to succeed in their claim that the CDA is
unconstitutionally vague.  In Part C, I address the Government's argument that
plaintiffs are not the CDA's target, nor would they likely face prosecution
under the Act.  Here, I conclude that plaintiffs could reasonably fear
prosecution under the Act, even if some of their fears border on the farfetched.
 In Part D, I consider the legal implications of the special attributes of
Internet communication, as well as the effect that the CDA would have on these
attributes.  In this Part I conclude that the disruptive effect of the CDA on
Internet communication, as well as the CDA's broad reach into protected speech,
not only render the Act unconstitutional but also would render unconstitutional
any regulation of protected speech on this new medium.</P>
<H1>B.  Defining Indecency</H1>
<P>Although no court of appeals has ever to my knowledge upheld a vagueness
challenge to the meaning of &quot;indecency&quot;, several recent cases have
grappled with the elusive meaning of that word in the context of cable
television and &quot;dial-a-porn&quot;.  Alliance for Community Media v. FCC, 56
F.3d 105 (D.C. Cir. 1995), cert. granted, 116 S. Ct. 471 (1996); Dial
Information Serv. Corp. v. Thornburgh, 938 F.2d 1535 (2d Cir. 1991), cert.
denied, 502 U.S. 1072 (1992); Information Providers Coalition for Defense of the
First Amendment v. FCC, 928 F.2d 866 (9th Cir. 1991).</P>
<P>In Alliance for Community Media, 56 F.3d at 123-25, for example, the
District of Columbia Court of Appeals addressed prohibitions on indecent
programming on certain cable television channels.  That court noted that the FCC
has codified the meaning of &quot;'indecent' programming&quot; on cable
television as &quot;programming that describes or depicts sexual or excretory
activities or organs in a patently offensive manner as measured by contemporary
community standards for the cable medium.&quot;  Id. at 112 (citing what is now
47 C.F.R. &#167; 76.701(g)).</P>
<P>The FCC took a similar approach to the definition of &quot;indecency&quot;
in the &quot;dial-a-porn&quot; medium.(4)  In Dial Information Services, 938
F.2d at 1540, the Second Circuit quoted the FCC's definition of indecent
telephone communications in that context:</P>
<P>[I]n the dial-a-porn context, we believe it is appropriate to define
indecency as the description or depiction of sexual or excretory activities or
organs in a patently offensive manner as measured by contemporary community
standards for the telephone medium.</P>
<P>Id. at 1540 (citation omitted); see also Information Providers' Coalition
for Defense of the First Amendment v. FCC, 928 F.2d 866, 876 (9th Cir. 1991).</P>
<P>These three cases recognize that the FCC did not define &quot;indecency&quot;
for cable and dial-a-porn in a vacuum.  Rather, it borrowed from the Supreme
Court's decision in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978).  In that
case (which I describe in greater detail below), the Supreme Court established
the rough outline from which the FCC fashioned its three-part definition.  For
the first two parts of the test, the Supreme Court emphasized the &quot;importance
of context&quot; in examining arguably indecent material.  Id. at 747 n.25.  &quot;Context&quot;
in the Pacifica opinion includes consideration of both the particular medium
from which the material originates and the particular community that receives
the material.  Id. at 746 (assuming that the Carlin monologue &quot;would be
protected in other contexts&quot;); id. at 748-51 (discussing the attributes of
broadcast); see also Information Providers' Coalition, 928 F.2d at 876
(discussing the &quot;content/context dichotomy&quot;).  Second, the opinion
limits its discussion to &quot;patently offensive sexual and excretory language&quot;,
Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 747, and this type of content has remained the FCC's
touchstone.  See, e.g., Alliance for Community Media, 56 F.3d at 112.(5)</P>
<P>We have quoted from the CDA extensively above and I will only briefly
rehearse that discussion here.  Section 223(a) of the CDA criminalizes &quot;indecent&quot;
speech on the Internet.  This is the &quot;indecency&quot; provision.  Section
223(d) of the CDA addresses speech that, &quot;in context, depicts or describes,
in terms patently offensive as measured by contemporary community standards,
sexual or excretory activities or organs&quot;.  This is the &quot;patently
offensive&quot; provision.  The foregoing discussion leads me to conclude that
these two provisions describe the same kind of speech.  That is, the use of &quot;indecent&quot;
in &#167; 223(a) is shorthand for the longer description in &#167; 223(d).
Conversely, the longer description in &#167; 223(d) is itself the definition of &quot;indecent&quot;
speech.  I believe Congress could have used the word &quot;indecent&quot; in
both &#167; 223(a) and &#167; 223(d), or it could have used the &quot;patently
offensive&quot; description of &#167; 223(d) in &#167; 223(a), without a change
in the meaning of the Act.  I do not believe that Congress intended that this
distinction alone would change the reach of either section of the CDA.(6)</P>
<P>The CDA's legislative history confirms this conclusion.  There, the
conference committee explicitly noted that &#167; 223(d) &quot;codifies the
definition of indecency from FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978). .
. .  The conferees intend that the term indecency (and the rendition of the
definition of that term in new section 502) has the same meaning as established
in FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978) and Sable Communications of
California, Inc. v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115 (1989).&quot;  Senate Report at 188,
reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 201-02.  The legislative history makes clear
that Congress did not intend to create a distinction in meaning when it used the
generic term &quot;indecency&quot; in &#167; 223(a) and the definition of that
term in &#167; 223(d).(7)</P>
<P>There is no doubt that the CDA requires the most stringent review for
vagueness, since it is a criminal statute that &quot;threatens to inhibit the
exercise of constitutionally protected rights&quot;.  Colautti v. Franklin, 439
U.S 379, 391 (1979); see also Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 358 n.8 (1983);
Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108-09.  My analysis here nevertheless leads ineluctably to
the conclusion that the definition of indecency is not unconstitutionally vague.
 The Miller definition of obscenity has survived such challenges, see, e.g.,
Hamling v. United States, 418 U.S. 87, 118-19 (1974); Fort Wayne Books, Inc. v.
Indiana, 489 U.S. 46, 57 (1989), and the definition of indecency contains a
subset of the elements of obscenity.  If the Miller test &quot;give[s] the
person of ordinary intelligence a reasonable opportunity to know what is
prohibited, so that he may act accordingly&quot;, Grayned v. City of Rockford,
408 U.S. 104, 108 (1972), the omission of parts of that test does not warrant a
contrary conclusion.  See Dial Information Services, 938 F.2d at 1541-42.
Similarly, since the definition of indecency arose from the Supreme Court itself
in Pacifica, we may fairly imply that the Court did not believe its own
interpretation to invite &quot;arbitrary and discriminatory enforcement&quot; or
&quot;abut upon sensitive areas of basic First Amendment freedoms&quot;.
Grayned, 408 U.S. at 108-109 (citations and alterations omitted).  Sable, while
not explicitly addressing the issue of vagueness, reinforces this conclusion.
See Information Providers' Coalition, 928 F.2d at 875-76 (citing Sable, 492 U.S.
at 126-27).  It follows, then, that plaintiffs' vagueness challenge is not
likely to succeed on the merits and does not support preliminary injunctive
relief.</P>
<P>The possible interpretations of the defenses in &#167; 223(e) do not alter
this conclusion.  As a matter of statutory construction, &#167; 223(e)(5)(B)
could not be clearer.  This section, which imports the dial-a-porn defenses into
the CDA, creates &quot;specific and objective&quot; methods to avoid liability.
See Roberts v. United States Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 629 (1984).  Section
223(e)(5)(A) is more suspect, since it arguably &quot;fail[s] to describe with
sufficient particularity what a suspect must do in order to satisfy&quot; it.
Kolender 461 U.S. at 361.(8)  Yet even though the defenses in both sections are
unavailable to many Internet users, their unavailability does not render the
liability provisions vague.  Rather, their unavailability just transforms &#167;
223(a) and &#167; 223(d) into a total ban, in violation of Butler v. Michigan,
352 U.S. 380, 383 (1957), and Sable, 492 U.S. at 127, 131.  I am sensitive to
plaintiffs' arguments that the statute, as written, does not create safe harbors
through which all Internet users may shield themselves from liability.
Transcript of May 10, 1996, at 37-38.  Here again, however, the absence of safe
harbors relates to the (over)breadth of a statute, and not its vagueness.  See
Sable, 492 U.S. at 127, 131.</P>
<H1>C.  Plaintiffs' Likelihood of Prosecution Under the Act</H1>
<P>The Government has consistently argued that the speech of many of the
plaintiffs here is almost certainly not indecent.  They point, for example, to
the educational and political content of plaintiffs' speech, and they also
suggest that the occasional curse word in a card catalogue will probably not
result in prosecution.  See Senate Report at 189, reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N.
at 203 (&quot;Material with serious redeeming value is quite obviously intended
to edify and educate, not to offend.&quot;).  In this section I address that
argument.</P>
<P>I agree with the Government that some of plaintiffs' claims are somewhat
exaggerated, but hyperbolic claims do not in themselves weigh in the
Government's favor.  In recent First Amendment challenges, the Supreme Court has
itself paid close attention to extreme applications of content-based laws.  </P>
<P>In Simon &amp; Schuster, Inc. v. Members of the New York State Crimes Victim
Board, 502 U.S. 105 (1991), the Court addressed the constitutionality of a law
that required criminals to turn over to their victims any income derived from
books, movies, or other commercial exploitation of their crimes.  Id. at 504-05.
 In its opinion, the Court evaluated the argument of an amicus curiae that the
law's reach could include books such as The Autobiography of Malcolm X, Civil
Disobedience, and Confessions of Saint Augustine, and authors such as Emma
Goldman, Martin Luther King, Jr., Sir Walter Raleigh, Jesse Jackson, and
Bertrand Russell.  Id. at 121-22.  The Court credited the argument even while
recognizing that it was laced with &quot;hyperbole&quot;:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The argument that [the] statute . . . would prevent publication of all of
these works is hyperbole -- some would have been written without compensation --
but the . . . law clearly reaches a wide range of literature that does not
enable a criminal to profit from his crime while a victim remains uncompensated.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Id. at 122.  If a content-based law &quot;can produce such an outcome&quot;,
id. at 123 (emphasis added), then Simon &amp; Schuster allows us to consider
those outcomes in our analysis.</P>
<P>Even more recently, in United States v. National Treasury Employees Union,
115 S. Ct. 1003 (1995), the Court addressed the constitutionality of a law that
banned federal employees from accepting honoraria for publications unrelated to
their work.  Id. at 1008.  The Court noted that the law would reach &quot;literary
giants like Nathaniel Hawthorne and Herman Melville, . . . Walt Whitman, . . .
and Bret Harte&quot;.  Id. at 1012.  This concern resurfaced later in the
opinion, see id. at 1015 (&quot;[W]e cannot ignore the risk that [the ban] might
deprive us of the work of a future Melville or Hawthorne.&quot;), even though a
footnote immediately renders this concern at least hyperbolic:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>These authors' familiar masterworks would survive the honoraria ban as
currently administered.  Besides exempting all books, the [regulations
implementing the ban] protect fiction and poetry from the ban's coverage,
although the statute's language is not so clear.  But some great artists deal in
fact as well as fiction, and some deal in both.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Id. n.16 (citations omitted).</P>
<P>Here, even though it is perhaps unlikely that the Carnegie Library will ever
stand in the dock for putting its card catalogue online, or that the Government
will hale the ACLU into court for its online quiz of the seven dirty words, we
cannot ignore that the Act could reach these activities.  The definition of
indecency, like the definition of obscenity, is not a rigid formula.  Rather, it
confers a large degree of autonomy to individual communities to set the bounds
of decency for themselves.  Cf. Sable, 492 U.S. at 125-26.  This is as it should
be, since this flexibility recognizes that ours is a country with diverse
cultural and historical roots.  See, e.g., Hamling, 418 U.S. at 104 (&quot;A
juror is entitled to draw on his own knowledge of the views of the average
person in the community or vicinage from which he comes for making the required
determination, just as he is entitled to draw on his knowledge of the
propensities of a 'reasonable' person in other areas of the law.&quot;).</P>
<P>Putting aside hyperbolic application, I also have little doubt that some
communities could well consider plaintiffs' speech indecent, and these
plaintiffs could -- perhaps should -- have a legitimate fear of prosecution.  In
Action for Children's Television v. FCC, 58 F.3d 654 (D.C. Cir. 1995), the
District of Columbia Court of Appeals summarized three broadcasts that the FCC
found indecent in the late 1980s:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>The offending morning broadcast . . . contained &quot;explicit references to
masturbation, ejaculation, breast size, penis size, sexual intercourse, nudity,
urination, oral-genital contact, erections, sodomy, bestiality, menstruation and
testicles.&quot;  The remaining two were similarly objectionable.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>Id. at 657 (citing In re Infinity Broadcasting Corp., 3 FCC R. 930, 932
(1987)).  In Infinity Broadcasting, one of the broadcasts that the FCC found
indecent was an excerpt of a play about AIDS, finding that the excerpts &quot;contained
the concentrated and repeated use of vulgar and shocking language to portray
graphic and lewd depictions of excretion, anal intercourse, ejaculation,
masturbation, and oral-genital sex&quot;.  3 FCC R. at 934.(9)  To the FCC, even
broadcasts with &quot;public value . . . addressing the serious problems posed
by AIDS&quot; can be indecent if &quot;that material is presented in a manner
that is patently offensive&quot;.  Id. (emphasis in original).(10)  </P>
<P>Yet, this is precisely the kind of speech that occurs, for example, on
Critical Path AIDS Project's Web site, which includes safer sex instructions
written in street language for easy comprehension.  The Web site also describes
the risk of HIV transmission for particular sexual practices.  The FCC's
implication in In the Matter of King Broadcasting Co., 5 FCC R. 2971 (1990),
that a &quot;candid discussion[] of sexual topics&quot; on television was decent
in part because it was &quot;not presented in a pandering, titillating or vulgar
manner&quot; would be unavailing to Critical Path, other plaintiffs, and some
amici.  These organizations want to pander and titillate on their Web sites, at
least to a degree, to attract a teen audience and deliver their message in an
engaging and coherent way.(11)</P>
<P>In In re letter to Merrell Hansen, 6 FCC R. 3689 (1990), the FCC found
indecent a morning discussion between two announcers regarding Jim Bakker's
alleged rape of Jessica Hahn.  Id.  Here, too, the FCC recognized that the
broadcast had public value.  Id. (noting that the broadcast concerned &quot;an
incident that was at the time 'in the news'&quot;).  Yet, under the FCC's
interpretation of Pacifica, &quot;the merit of a work is 'simply one of the many
variables' that make up a work's context&quot;.  Id. (citation omitted).</P>
<P>One of the plaintiffs here, Stop Prisoner Rape, Inc., has as its core
purpose the issue of prison rape.  The organization creates chat rooms in which
members can discuss their experiences.  Some amici have also organized Web sites
dedicated to survivors of rape, incest, and other sexual abuse.  These Web sites
provide fora for the discussion and contemplation of shared experiences.  The
operators of these sites, and their participants, could legitimately fear
prosecution under the CDA.</P>
<P>With respect to vulgarity, the Government is in a similarly weak position.
In Pacifica, the Supreme Court held that multiple repetition of expletives could
be indecent.  Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 750.  Although the FCC did not follow this
rationale with respect to a broadcast of &quot;a bona fide news story&quot; on
National Public Radio, Letter to Mr. Peter Branton, 6 FCC R. 610 (1991), aff'd
on other grounds sub nom. Branton v. FCC, 993 F.2d 906, 908 (D.C. Cir. 1993),
the ACLU, a plaintiff here, could take little comfort from that administrative
decision.  It would need to discern, for example, whether a chat room that it
organized to discuss the meaning of the word fuck was more like the Carlin
monologue or more like a National Public Radio broadcast.(12)  Plaintiffs'
expert would have found expletives indecent in a community consisting only of
himself,(13) and his views undoubtedly -- and reasonably -- reflect the view of
many people.  </P>
<P>In sum, I am less confident than the Government that societal mores have
changed so drastically since Pacifica that an online equivalent of the Carlin
monologue, or the Carlin monologue itself online, would pass muster under the
CDA.  Under existing precedent, plaintiffs' fear of prosecution under the Act is
legitimate, even though they are not the pornographers Congress had in mind when
it passed the CDA.(14)   Cf. City of Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 459 (1987).
My discussion of the effect and reach of the CDA, therefore, applies both to
plaintiffs' hyperbolic concerns and to their very real ones.</P>
<H1>D.  A Medium-Specific Analysis</H1>
<P>The Internet is a new medium of mass communication.(15)  As such, the
Supreme Court's First Amendment jurisprudence compels us to consider the special
qualities of this new medium in determining whether the CDA is a constitutional
exercise of governmental power.  Relying on these special qualities, which we
have described at length in our Findings of fact above, I conclude that the CDA
is unconstitutional and that the First Amendment denies Congress the power to
regulate protected speech on the Internet.  This analysis and conclusions are
consistent with Congress's intent to avoid tortuous and piecemeal review of the
CDA by authorizing expedited, direct review in the Supreme Court &quot;as a
matter of right&quot; of interlocutory, and not merely final, orders upholding
facial challenges to the Act.  See &#167; 561(b) of the Telecommunications Act
of 1996.(16)</P>
<H1>1.  The Differential Treatment of Mass Communication Media</H1>
<P>Nearly fifty years ago, Justice Jackson recognized that &quot;[t]he moving
picture screen, the radio, the newspaper, the handbill, the sound truck and the
street corner orator have differing natures, values, abuses and dangers.  Each .
. . is a law unto itself&quot;.  Kovacs v. Cooper, 336 U.S. 77, 97 (1949)
(Jackson, J., concurring).  The Supreme Court has expressed this sentiment time
and again since that date, and differential treatment of the mass media has
become established First Amendment doctrine.  See, e.g., Turner Broadcasting
Sys., Inc. v. FCC, 114 S. Ct. 2445, 2456 (1994) (&quot;It is true that our cases
have permitted more intrusive regulation of broadcast speakers than of speakers
in other media.&quot;); Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 748 (&quot;We have long recognized
that each medium of expression presents special First Amendment problems.&quot;);
City of Los Angeles v. Preferred Communications, Inc., 476 U.S. 488, 496 (1974)
(&quot;Different communications media are treated differently for First
Amendment purposes.&quot;) (Blackmun, J., concurring); Metromedia, Inc. v. City
of San Diego, 453 U.S. 490, 500-01 (1981) (plurality opinion) (&quot;This Court
has often faced the problem of applying the broad principles of the First
Amendment to unique forums of expression.&quot;).  Thus, the Supreme Court has
established different rules for print, Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo,
418 U.S. 241 (1974), broadcast radio and television, see, e.g., Red Lion
Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367 (1969), cable television, Turner, 114 S.
Ct. at 2456-57, and even billboards, Metromedia, 453 U.S. at 501, and drive-in
movie theaters, Erzoznik v. City of Jacksonville, 422 U.S. 205 (1975).</P>
<P>This medium-specific approach to mass communication examines the underlying
technology of the communication to find the proper fit between First Amendment
values and competing interests.  In print media, for example, the proper fit
generally forbids governmental regulation of content, however minimal.
Tornillo, 418 U.S. at 258.  In other media (billboards, for example), the proper
fit may allow for some regulation of both content and of the underlying
technology (such as it is) of the communication.  Metromedia, 453 U.S. at 502.</P>
<P>Radio and television broadcasting present the most expansive approach to
medium-specific regulation of mass communication.  As a result of the scarcity
of band widths on the electromagnetic spectrum, the Government holds broad
authority both to parcel out the frequencies and to prohibit others from
speaking on the same frequency:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>As a general matter, there are more would-be broadcasters than frequencies
available in the electromagnetic spectrum.  And if two broadcasters were to
attempt to transmit over the same frequency in the same locale, they would
interfere with one another's signals, so that neither could be heard at all.
The scarcity of broadcast frequencies thus required the establishment of some
regulatory mechanism to divide the electromagnetic spectrum and assign specific
frequencies to particular broadcasters.  </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2456 (citing FCC v. League of Women Voters, 468 U.S.
364 (1984)).</P>
<P>This scarcity also allows the Government to regulate content even after it
assigns a license:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In addition, the inherent physical limitation on the number of speakers who
may use the broadcast medium has been thought to require some adjustment in
traditional First Amendment analysis to permit the Government to place limited
content restraints, and impose certain affirmative obligations, on broadcast
licensees.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Id. at 2457 (citing Red Lion, 395 U.S. at 390-95; National Broadcasting Co.
v. United States, 319 U.S. 190 (1943)).  </P>
<P>The broadcasting cases firmly establish that the Government may force a
licensee to offer content to the public that the licensee would otherwise not
offer, thereby assuring that radio and television audiences have a diversity of
content.  In broadcasting, &quot;[i]t is the right of the public to receive
suitable access to social, political, esthetic, moral, and other ideas and
experiences which is crucial&quot;.  Red Lion, 395 U.S. at 390; see also CBS,
Inc. v. FCC, 453 U.S. 367, 395 (1981) (&quot;A licensed broadcaster is 'granted
the free and exclusive use of a limited and valuable part of the public domain;
when he accepts that franchise it is burdened by enforceable public
obligations.'&quot;) (citation omitted); Columbia Broadcasting Sys., Inc. v.
Democratic Nat'l Comm., 412 U.S. 94, 110-11 (1973).  These content restrictions
include punishing licensees who broadcast inappropriate but protected speech at
an impermissible time.  Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 750-51.</P>
<P>In this case, the Government relies on the Pacifica decision in arguing that
the CDA is a constitutional exercise of governmental power.  Since the CDA
regulates indecent speech, and since Pacifica authorizes governmental regulation
of indecent speech (so the Government's argument goes), it must follow that the
CDA is a valid exercise of governmental power.  That argument, however, ignores
Pacifica's roots as a decision addressing the proper fit between broadcasting
and the First Amendment.  The argument also assumes that what is good for
broadcasting is good for the Internet.</P>
<H1> 2.  The Scope of the Pacifica Decision</H1>
<P>In FCC v. Pacifica Foundation, 438 U.S. 726 (1978), the Supreme Court first
decided whether the Government had the power to regulate indecent speech.  Id.
at 729.  In Pacifica, a radio listener complained about the broadcast of George
Carlin's &quot;Filthy Words&quot; monologue at 2:00 p.m. on a Tuesday afternoon.
 Id. at 729-30.  The Carlin monologue was replete with &quot;the words you couldn't
say on the public . . . airwaves . . . , ever&quot;, and the listener
had tuned in while driving with his young son in New York.  Id.  The FCC issued
a declaratory order, holding that it could have subjected the Pacifica
Foundation (owner of the radio station) to an administrative sanction.  Id. at
730.  In its order the FCC also described the standards that it would use in the
future to regulate indecency in the broadcast medium.  Id. at 731.  The Supreme
Court upheld the FCC's decision and confirmed the power of that agency to
regulate indecent speech.  Id. at 750-51.</P>
<P>The rationale of Pacifica rested on three overlapping considerations.
First, using as its example the Carlin monologue before it, the Court weighed
the value of indecent speech and concluded that such speech &quot;lie[s] at the
periphery of First Amendment concerns.&quot;  Id. at 743.  Although the Court
recognized that the FCC had threatened to punish Pacifica based on the content
of the Carlin monologue, id. at 742, it found that the punishment would have
been permissible because four-letter words &quot;offend for the same reasons
that obscenity offends.&quot;  Id. at 746 (footnote omitted).  The Court then
described the place of four-letter words &quot;in the hierarchy of first
amendment values&quot;:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Such utterances are no essential part of any exposition of ideas, and are of
such slight social value as a step to truth that any benefit that may be derived
from them is clearly outweighed by the social interest in order and morality.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Id. at 746 (citing Chaplinsky v. New Hampshire, 315 U.S. 568, 572 (1942)).
</P>
<P>Second, the Court recognized that &quot;broadcasting . . . has received the
most limited First Amendment protection.&quot;  Id. at 748.  The Government may
regulate broadcast consistent with the Constitution, even though the same
regulation would run afoul of the First Amendment in the print medium.  Id.
(comparing Red Lion Broadcasting Co. v. FCC, 395 U.S. 367 (1969) with Miami
Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241 (1974)).  This is so because
broadcasting has a &quot;uniquely pervasive presence in the lives of all
Americans&quot; and &quot;is uniquely accessible to children, even those too
young to read.&quot;  Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 748-49.</P>
<P>Third, the Court found the FCC's sanction -- an administrative sanction --
to be an appropriate means of regulating indecent speech.  At the outset of the
opinion, the Court disclaimed that its holding was a &quot;consider[ation of]
any question relating to the possible application of &#167; 1464 as a criminal
statute.&quot;  Id. at 739 n.13.  Later in the opinion, the Court &quot;emphasize[d]
the narrowness of [its] holding&quot;, and explicitly recognized that it had not
held that the Carlin monologue would justify a criminal prosecution.  Id. at
750.  Instead, the Court allowed the FCC to regulate indecent speech with
administrative penalties under a &quot;nuisance&quot; rationale -- &quot;like a
pig in the parlor instead of the barnyard.&quot;  Id. at 750 (citation omitted).</P>
<P>Time has not been kind to the Pacifica decision.  Later cases have eroded
its reach, and the Supreme Court has repeatedly instructed against overreading
the rationale of its holding.</P>
<P>First, in Bolger v. Young Drug Products Corp., 463 U.S. 60 (1983), the
Supreme Court refused to extend Pacifica to a law unrelated to broadcasting.  In
that case, a federal law prohibited the unsolicited mailing of contraceptive
advertisements.  Id. at 61.  The Government defended the law by claiming an
interest in protecting children from the advertisements.  The Court rejected
this argument as overbroad:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>In [Pacifica], this Court did recognize that the Government's interest in
protecting the young justified special treatment of an afternoon broadcast heard
by adults as well as children.  At the same time, the majority &quot;emphasize[d]
the narrowness of our holding&quot;, explaining that broadcasting is &quot;uniquely
pervasive&quot; and that it is &quot;uniquely accessible to children, even those
too young to read.&quot;  The receipt of mail is far less intrusive and
uncontrollable.  Our decisions have recognized that the special interest of the
Federal Government in regulation of the broadcast media does not readily
translate into a justification for regulation of other means of communication.
</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Id. at 74 (citations and footnotes omitted) (emphasis in original) see also
id. at 72 (&quot;[T]he 'short, though regular, journey from mail box to trash
can . . . is an acceptable burden, at least so far as the Constitution is
concerned.'&quot;) (citation omitted) (alterations in original).</P>
<P>Second, in Sable Communications v. FCC, 492 U.S. 115 (1989), the Supreme
Court again limited Pacifica.  In that case, the Court considered the validity
of a ban on indecent &quot;dial-a-porn&quot; communications.  Id. at 117-18.(17)
 As in Bolger, the Government argued that Pacifica justified a complete ban of
that form of speech.  The Supreme Court disagreed, holding instead that
Pacifica's &quot;emphatically narrow&quot; holding arose out of the &quot;unique
attributes of broadcasting&quot;.  Id. at 127.  The Court held that the ban was
unconstitutional.  Id. at 131.</P>
<P>Sable narrowed Pacifica in two ways.  First, the Court implicitly rejected
Pacifica's nuisance rationale for dial-a-porn, holding instead that the
Government could only regulate the medium &quot;by narrowly drawn regulations
designed to serve those interests without unnecessarily interfering with First
Amendment freedoms&quot;.  Id. at 126 (citation omitted).  Under this strict
scrutiny, &quot;[i]t is not enough to show that the Government's ends are
compelling; the means must be carefully tailored to achieve those ends.&quot; 
Id.; see also Fabulous Assoc. v. Pennsylvania Pub. Util. Comm., 896 F.2d 780,
784-85 (3d Cir. 1990). </P>
<P>Second, the Court concluded that the law, like a law it had struck down in
1957, &quot;denied adults their free speech rights by allowing them to read only
what was acceptable for children&quot;.  Sable, 492 U.S. at 126 (citing Butler
v. Michigan, 352 U.S. 380 (1957)).  Thus, any regulation of dial-a-porn would
have to give adults the opportunity to partake of that medium.  Id.  This
conclusion echoes Bolger.  See Bolger, 463 U.S. at 74 (&quot;The level of
discourse reaching a mailbox simply cannot be limited to that which would be
suitable for a sandbox.&quot;).(18)</P>
<P>Finally, in Turner Broadcasting System, Inc. v. FCC, 114 S. Ct. 2445 (1994),
the Supreme Court implicitly limited Pacifica once again when it declined to
adopt the broadcast rationale for the medium of cable television.  The Court
concluded that the rules for broadcast were &quot;inapt&quot; for cable because
of the &quot;fundamental technological differences between broadcast and cable
transmission&quot;.  Id. at 2457.</P>
<P>The legal significance to this case of Turner's refusal to apply the
broadcast rules to cable television cannot be overstated.  Turner's holding
confirms beyond doubt that the holding in Pacifica arose out of the scarcity
rationale unique to the underlying technology of broadcasting, and not out of
the end product that the viewer watches.  That is, cable television has no less
of a &quot;uniquely pervasive presence&quot; than broadcast television, nor is
cable television more &quot;uniquely accessible to children&quot; than
broadcast.  See Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 748-49.  From the viewer's perspective,
cable and broadcast television are identical:  moving pictures with sound from a
box in the home.  Whether one receives a signal through an antenna or through a
dedicated wire, the end result is just television in either case.  In declining
to extend broadcast's scarcity rationale for cable, the Supreme Court also
implicitly limited Pacifica, the holding of which flows directly from that
rationale.(19)</P>
<P>Turner thus confirms that the analysis of a particular medium of mass
communication must focus on the underlying technology that brings the
information to the user.  In broadcast, courts focus on the limited number of
band widths and the risk of interference with those frequencies.  See, e.g.,
Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2456-57.  In cable, courts focus on the number of
channels, the different kinds of cable operators, and the cost to the consumer. 
Id. at 2452. </P>
<P>I draw two conclusions from the foregoing analysis.  First, from the Supreme
Court's many decisions regulating different media differently, I conclude that
we cannot simply assume that the Government has the power to regulate protected
speech over the Internet, devoting our attention solely to the issue of whether
the CDA is a constitutional exercise of that power.  Rather, we must also decide
the validity of the underlying assumption as well, to wit, whether the
Government has the power to regulate protected speech at all.  That decision
must take into account the underlying technology, and the actual and potential
reach, of that medium.  Second, I conclude that Pacifica's holding is not
persuasive authority here, since plaintiffs and the Government agree that
Internet communication is an abundant and growing resource.  Nor is Sable
persuasive authority, since the Supreme Court's holding in that case addressed
only one particular type of communication (dial-a-porn), and reached no
conclusions about the proper fit between the First Amendment and telephone
communications generally.  Again, plaintiffs and the Government here agree that
the Internet provides content as broad as the imagination.</P>
<P><B>3.  The Effect of the CDA and the Novel Characteristics of Internet
Communication</B></P>
<P>Over the course of five days of hearings and many hundreds of pages of
declarations, deposition transcripts, and exhibits, we have learned about the
special attributes of Internet communication.  Our Findings of fact -- many of
them undisputed -- express our understanding of the Internet.  These Findings
lead to the conclusion that Congress may not regulate indecency on the Internet
at all.  </P>
<P>Four related characteristics of Internet communication have a transcendent
importance to our shared holding that the CDA is unconstitutional on its face. 
We explain these characteristics in our Findings of fact above, and I only
rehearse them briefly here.  First, the Internet presents very low barriers to
entry.  Second, these barriers to entry are identical for both speakers and
listeners.  Third, as a result of these low barriers, astoundingly diverse
content is available on the Internet.  Fourth, the Internet provides significant
access to all who wish to speak in the medium, and even creates a relative
parity among speakers.</P>
<P>To understand how disruptive the CDA is to Internet communication, it must
be remembered that the Internet evolved free of content-based considerations. 
Before the CDA, it only mattered how, and how quickly, a particular packet of
data travelled from one point on the Internet to another.  In its earliest
incarnation as the ARPANET, the Internet was for many years a private means of
access among the military, defense contractors, and defense-related researchers.
 The developers of  the technology focused on creating a medium designed for the
rapid transmittal of the information through overlapping and redundant
connections, and without direct human involvement.  Out of these considerations
evolved the common transfer protocols, packet switching, and the other
technology in which today's Internet users flourish.  The content of the data
was, before the CDA, an irrelevant consideration.</P>
<P>It is fair, then, to conclude that the benefits of the Internet to private
speakers arose out of the serendipitous development of its underlying
technology.  As more networks joined the &quot;network of networks&quot; that is
the Internet, private speakers have begun to take advantage of the medium.  This
should not be surprising, since participation in the medium requires only that
networks (and the individual users associated with them) agree to use the common
data transfer protocols and other medium-specific technology.  Participation
does not require, and has never required, approval of a user's or network's
content.</P>
<P>After the CDA, however, the content of a user's speech will determine the
extent of participation in the new medium.  If a speaker's content is even
arguably indecent in some communities, he must assess, inter alia, the risk of
prosecution and the cost of compliance with the CDA.  Because the creation and
posting of a Web site allows users anywhere in the country to see that site,
many speakers will no doubt censor their speech so that it is palatable in every
community.  Other speakers will decline to enter the medium at all.  Unlike
other media, there is no technologically feasible way for an Internet speaker to
limit the geographical scope of his speech (even if he wanted to), or to &quot;implement[]
a system for screening the locale of incoming&quot; requests.  Sable 492 U.S. at
125.</P>
<P>The CDA will, without doubt, undermine the substantive, speech-enhancing
benefits that have flowed from the Internet. Barriers to entry to those speakers
affected by the Act would skyrocket, especially for non-commercial and
not-for-profit information providers.  Such costs include those attributable to
age or credit card verification (if possible), tagging (if tagging is even a
defense under the Act(20)), and monitoring or review of one's content. </P>
<P>The diversity of the content will necessarily diminish as a result.  The
economic costs associated with compliance with the Act will drive from the
Internet speakers whose content falls within the zone of possible prosecution. 
Many Web sites, newsgroups, and chat rooms will shut down, since users cannot
discern the age of other participants.  In this respect, the Internet would
ultimately come to mirror broadcasting and print, with messages tailored to a
mainstream society from speakers who could be sure that their message was likely
decent in every community in the country.</P>
<P>The CDA will also skew the relative parity among speakers that currently
exists on the Internet.  Commercial entities who can afford the costs of
verification, or who would charge a user to enter their sites, or whose content
has mass appeal, will remain unaffected by the Act.  Other users, such as
Critical Path or Stop Prisoner Rape, or even the ACLU, whose Web sites before
the CDA were as equally accessible as the most popular Web sites, will be
profoundly affected by the Act.  This change would result in an Internet that
mirrors broadcasting and print, where economic power has become relatively
coterminous with influence.</P>
<P>Perversely, commercial pornographers would remain relatively unaffected by
the Act, since we learned that most of them already use credit card or adult
verification anyway.  Commercial pornographers normally provide a few free
pictures to entice a user into proceeding further into the Web site.  To proceed
beyond these teasers, users must provide a credit card number or adult
verification number.  The CDA will force these businesses to remove the teasers
(or cover the most salacious content with cgi scripts), but the core, commercial
product of these businesses will remain in place. </P>
<P>The CDA's wholesale disruption on the Internet will necessarily affect adult
participation in the medium.  As some speakers leave or refuse to enter the
medium, and others bowdlerize their speech or erect the barriers that the Act
envisions, and still others remove bulletin boards, Web sites, and newsgroups,
adults will face a shrinking ability to participate in the medium.  Since much
of the communication on the Internet is participatory, i.e., is a form of
dialogue, a decrease in the number of speakers, speech fora, and permissible
topics will diminish the worldwide dialogue that is the strength and signal
achievement of the medium.</P>
<P>It is no answer to say that the defenses and exclusions of &#167; 223(e)
mitigate the disruptive forces of the Act.  We have already found as facts that
the defenses either are not available to plaintiffs here or would impose
excessive costs on them.  These defenses are also unavailable to participants in
specific forms of Internet communication.</P>
<P>I am equally dubious that the exclusions of &#167; 223(e) would provide
significant relief from the Act.  The &quot;common carrier&quot; exclusion of &#167;
223(e)(1), for example, would not insulate America Online from liability for the
content it provides to its subscribers.  It is also a tricky question whether an
America Online chat room devoted to, say, women's reproductive health, is or is
not speech of the service itself, since America Online, at least to some extent,
&quot;creat[es] the content of the communication&quot; simply by making the room
available and assigning it a topic.  Even if America Online has no liability
under this example, the service might legitimately choose not to provide fora
that led to the prosecution of its subscribers.  Similarly, it is unclear
whether many caching servers are devoted &quot;solely&quot; to the task of &quot;intermediate
storage&quot;.  The &quot;vicarious liability&quot; exclusion of &#167;
223(e)(4) would not, for example, insulate either a college professor or her
employer from liability for posting an indecent online reading assignment for
her freshman sociology class.</P>
<P>We must of course give appropriate deference to the legislative judgments of
Congress.  See Sable, 492 U.S. at 129; Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2472-73 (Blackmun,
J., concurring).  After hearing the parties' testimony and reviewing the
exhibits, declarations, and transcripts, we simply cannot in my view defer to
Congress's judgment that the CDA will have only a minimal impact on the
technology of the Internet, or on adult participation in the medium.  As in
Sable, &quot;[d]eference to a legislative finding cannot limit judicial inquiry
when First Amendment rights are at stake.&quot;  Sable, 492 U.S. at 129
(citation omitted).  Indeed, the Government has not revealed Congress's &quot;extensive
record&quot; in addressing this issue, Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2472 (Blackmun, J.,
concurring), or otherwise convinced me that the record here is somehow factually
deficient to the record before Congress when it passed the Act.  </P>
<H1> 4.  Diversity and Access on the Internet</H1>
<P>Nearly eighty years ago, Justice Holmes, in dissent, wrote of the ultimate
constitutional importance of the &quot;free trade in ideas&quot;:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>[W]hen men have realized that time has upset many fighting faiths, they may
come to believe even more than they believe the very foundations of their own
conduct that the ultimate good desired is better reached by free trade in ideas
-- that the best test of truth is the power of the thought to get itself
accepted in the competition of the market . . . .</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Abrams v. United States, 250 U.S. 616, 630 (1919) (Holmes, J., dissenting). 
</P>
<P>For nearly as long, critics have attacked this much-maligned &quot;marketplace&quot;
theory of First Amendment jurisprudence as inconsistent with economic and
practical reality.  Most marketplaces of mass speech, they charge, are dominated
by a few wealthy voices.  Miami Herald Publishing Co. v. Tornillo, 418 U.S. 241,
248-50 (1974).  These voices dominate -- and to an extent, create -- the
national debate.  Id.  Individual citizens' participation is, for the most part,
passive.  Id. at 251.  Because most people lack the money and time to buy a
broadcast station or create a newspaper, they are limited to the role of
listeners, i.e., as watchers of television or subscribers to newspapers.  Id.</P>
<P>Economic realities limit the number of speakers even further.  Newspapers
competing with each other and with (free) broadcast tend toward extinction, as
fixed costs drive competitors either to consolidate or leave the marketplace. 
Id. at 249-50.  As a result, people receive information from relatively few
sources:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>The elimination of competing newspapers in most of our large cities, and the
concentration of control of media that results from the only newspaper's being
owned by the same interests which own a television station and a radio station,
are important components of this trend toward concentration of control of
outlets to inform the public.</P>
<P>The result of these vast changes has been to place in a few hands the power
to inform the American people and shape public opinion.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Id. at 249.</P>
<P>The Supreme Court has also recognized that the advent of cable television
has not offered significant relief from this problem.  Although the number of
cable channels is exponentially greater than broadcast, Turner, 114 S. Ct. at
2452, cable imposes relatively high entry costs, id. at 2451-52 (noting that the
creation of a cable system requires &quot;[t]he construction of [a] physical
infrastructure&quot;).</P>
<P>Nevertheless, the Supreme Court has resisted governmental efforts to
alleviate these market dysfunctions.  In Tornillo, the Supreme Court held that
market failure simply could not justify the regulation of print, 418 U.S. at
258, regardless of the validity of the criticisms of that medium, id. at 251. 
Tornillo invalidated a state &quot;right-of-reply&quot; statute, which required
a newspaper critical of a political candidate to give that candidate equal time
to reply to the charges.  Id. at 244.  The Court held that the statute would be
invalid even if it imposed no cost on a newspaper, because of the statute's
intrusion into editorial discretion:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A newspaper is more than a passive receptacle or conduit for news, comment,
and advertising.  The choice of material to go into a newspaper, and the
decisions made as to limitations on the size and content of the paper, and
treatment of public issues and public officials -- whether fair or unfair --
constitute the exercise of editorial control and judgment.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Id. at 258.</P>
<P>Similarly, in Turner, the Supreme Court rejected the Government's argument
that market dysfunction justified deferential review of speech regulations for
cable television.  Even recognizing that the cable market &quot;suffers certain
structural impediments&quot;, Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2457, the Court could not
accept the Government's conclusion that this dysfunction justified
broadcast-type standards of review, since &quot;the mere assertion of
dysfunction or failure in a speech market, without more, is not sufficient to
shield a speech regulation from the First Amendment standards applicable to
nonbroadcast media.&quot;  Id. at 2458.  &quot;[L]aws that single out the press,
or certain elements thereof, for special treatment 'pose a particular danger of
abuse by the State,' and so are always subject to at least some degree of
heightened First Amendment scrutiny.&quot;  Id. (citation omitted).(21)  The
Court then eloquently reiterated that government-imposed, content-based speech
regulations are generally inconsistent with &quot;[o]ur political system and
cultural life&quot;:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>At the heart of the First Amendment lies the principle that each person
should decide for him or herself the ideas and beliefs deserving of expression,
consideration, and adherence.  Our political system and cultural life rest upon
this ideal.  Government action that stifles speech on account of its message, or
that requires the utterance of a particular message favored by the Government,
contravenes this essential right.  Laws of this sort pose the inherent risk that
the Government seeks not to advance a legitimate regulatory goal, but to
suppress unpopular ideas or information or manipulate the public debate through
coercion rather than persuasion.  These restrictions &quot;rais[e] the specter
that the Government may effectively drive certain ideas or viewpoints from the
marketplace.&quot;</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Id. (citation omitted).</P>
<P>Both Tornillo and Turner recognize, in essence, that the cure for market
dysfunction (government-imposed, content-based speech restrictions) will almost
always be worse than the disease.  Here, however, I am hard-pressed even to
identify the disease.  It is no exaggeration to conclude that the Internet has
achieved, and continues to achieve, the most participatory marketplace of mass
speech that this country -- and indeed the world -- has yet seen.  The
plaintiffs in these actions correctly describe the &quot;democratizing&quot;
effects of Internet communication:  individual citizens of limited means can
speak to a worldwide audience on issues of concern to them.  Federalists and
Anti-Federalists may debate the structure of their government nightly, but these
debates occur in newsgroups or chat rooms rather than in pamphlets.  Modern-day
Luthers still post their theses, but to electronic bulletin boards rather than
the door of the Wittenberg Schlosskirche.  More mundane (but from a
constitutional perspective, equally important) dialogue occurs between aspiring
artists, or French cooks, or dog lovers, or fly fishermen.</P>
<P>Indeed, the Government's asserted &quot;failure&quot; of the Internet rests
on the implicit premise that too much speech occurs in that medium, and that
speech there is too available to the participants.  This is exactly the benefit
of Internet communication, however.  The Government, therefore, implicitly asks
this court to limit both the amount of speech on the Internet and the
availability of that speech.  This argument is profoundly repugnant to First
Amendment principles.</P>
<P>My examination of the special characteristics of Internet communication, and
review of the Supreme Court's medium-specific First Amendment jurisprudence,
lead me to conclude that the Internet deserves the broadest possible protection
from government-imposed, content-based regulation.  If &quot;the First Amendment
erects a virtually insurmountable barrier between government and the print media&quot;,
Tornillo, 418 U.S. at 259 (White, J., concurring), even though the print medium
fails to achieve the hoped-for diversity in the marketplace of ideas, then that
&quot;insurmountable barrier&quot; must also exist for a medium that succeeds in
achieving that diversity.  If our Constitution &quot;prefer[s] 'the power of
reason as applied through public discussion'&quot;, id. (citation omitted), &quot;[r]egardless
of how beneficent-sounding the purposes of controlling the press might be&quot;,
id., even though &quot;occasionally debate on vital matters will not be
comprehensive and . . . all viewpoints may not be expressed&quot;, id. at 260, a
medium that does capture comprehensive debate and does allow for the expression
of all viewpoints should receive at least the same protection from intrusion. 
</P>
<P>Finally, if the goal of our First Amendment jurisprudence is the &quot;individual
dignity and choice&quot; that arises from &quot;putting the decision as to what
views shall be voiced largely into the hands of each of us&quot;, Leathers v.
Medlock, 499 U.S. 439, 448-49 (1991) (citing Cohen v. California, 403 U.S. 15,
24 (1971)), then we should be especially vigilant in preventing content-based
regulation of a medium that every minute allows individual citizens actually to
make those decisions.  Any content-based regulation of the Internet, no matter
how benign the purpose, could burn the global village to roast the pig.  Cf.
Butler, 352 U.S. at 383.</P>
<H1> 5.  Protection of Children from Pornography</H1>
<P>I accept without reservation that the Government has a compelling interest
in protecting children from pornography.  The proposition finds one of its
clearest expressions in Mill, who recognized that his exposition regarding
liberty itself &quot;is meant to apply only to human beings in the maturity of
their faculties&quot;:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>We are not speaking of children or of young persons below the age which the

law may fix as that of manhood or womanhood.  Those who are still in a state to
require being taken care of by others must be protected against their own
actions as well as against external injury.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>John Stuart Mill, On Liberty 69 (Gertrude Himmelfarb ed., Penguin Books
1982) (1859), cited in Harry Kalven Jr., A Worthy Tradition 54 (Jamie Kalven ed.
1988).</P>
<P>This rationale, however, is as dangerous as it is compelling.  Laws
regulating speech for the protection of children have no limiting principle, and
a well-intentioned law restricting protected speech on the basis of its content
is, nevertheless, state-sponsored censorship.  Regulations that &quot;drive
certain ideas or viewpoints from the marketplace&quot; for children's benefit,
Simon &amp; Schuster, 502 U.S. at 116, risk destroying the very &quot;political
system and cultural life&quot;, Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2458, that they will
inherit when they come of age.</P>
<P>I therefore have no doubt that a Newspaper Decency Act, passed because
Congress discovered that young girls had read a front page article in the New
York Times on female genital mutilation in Africa, would be unconstitutional. 
Tornillo, 418 U.S. at 258.  Nor would a Novel Decency Act, adopted after
legislators had seen too many pot-boilers in convenience store book racks, pass
constitutional muster.  Butler, 352 U.S. at 383.  There is no question that a
Village Green Decency Act, the fruit of a Senator's overhearing of a ribald
conversation between two adolescent boys on a park bench, would be
unconstitutional.  Perry Education Ass'n v. Perry Local Educators' Ass'n, 460
U.S. 37, 45 (1983).  A Postal Decency Act, passed because of constituent
complaints about unsolicited lingerie catalogues, would also be

unconstitutional.  Bolger, 463 U.S. at 73.  In these forms of communication,
regulations on the basis of decency simply would not survive First Amendment
scrutiny.  </P>
<P>The Internet is a far more speech-enhancing medium than print, the village
green, or the mails.  Because it would necessarily affect the Internet itself,
the CDA would necessarily reduce the speech available for adults on the medium. 
This is a constitutionally intolerable result.</P>
<P>Some of the dialogue on the Internet surely tests the limits of conventional
discourse.  Speech on the Internet can be unfiltered, unpolished, and
unconventional, even emotionally charged, sexually explicit, and vulgar -- in a
word, &quot;indecent&quot; in many communities.  But we should expect such
speech to occur in a medium in which citizens from all walks of life have a
voice.  We should also protect the autonomy that such a medium confers to
ordinary people as well as media magnates.</P>
<P>Moreover, the CDA will almost certainly fail to accomplish the Government's
interest in shielding children from pornography on the Internet.  Nearly half of
Internet communications originate outside the United States, and some percentage
of that figure represents pornography.  Pornography from, say, Amsterdam will be
no less appealing to a child on the Internet than pornography from New York
City, and residents of Amsterdam have little incentive to comply with the
CDA.(22)</P>
<P>My analysis does not deprive the Government of all means of protecting
children from the dangers of Internet communication.  The Government can
continue to protect children from pornography on the Internet through vigorous
enforcement of existing laws criminalizing obscenity and child pornography.  See
United States v. Thomas, 74 F.3d 701, 704-05 (6th Cir. 1995).  As we learned at
the hearing, there is also a compelling need for public education about the
benefits and dangers of this new medium, and the Government can fill that role
as well.  In my view, our action today should only mean that the Government's
permissible supervision of Internet content stops at the traditional line of
unprotected speech.</P>
<P>Parents, too, have options available to them.  As we learned at the hearing,
parents can install blocking software on their home computers, or they can
subscribe to commercial online services that provide parental controls.  It is
quite clear that powerful market forces are at work to expand parental options
to deal with these legitimate concerns.  More fundamentally, parents can
supervise their children's use of the Internet or deny their children the
opportunity to participate in the medium until they reach an appropriate age. 
See Fabulous, 896 F.2d at 788-89 (noting that &quot;our society has
traditionally placed&quot; these decisions &quot;on the shoulders of the parent&quot;).</P>
<P><B>E.</B>  <B>Conclusion</B></P>
<P>Cutting through the acronyms and argot that littered the hearing testimony,
the Internet may fairly be regarded as a never-ending worldwide conversation. 
The Government may not, through the CDA, interrupt that conversation.  As the
most participatory form of mass speech yet developed, the Internet deserves the
highest protection from governmental intrusion.</P>
<P>True it is that many find some of the speech on the Internet to be
offensive, and amid the din of cyberspace many hear discordant voices that they
regard as indecent.  The absence of governmental regulation of Internet content
has unquestionably produced a kind of chaos, but as one of plaintiffs' experts
put it with such resonance at the hearing:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>What achieved success was the very chaos that the Internet is.  The strength

of the Internet is that chaos.(23)  </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Just as the strength of the Internet is chaos, so the strength of our
liberty depends upon the chaos and cacophony of the unfettered speech the First
Amendment protects. </P>
<P>For these reasons, I without hesitation hold that the CDA is
unconstitutional on its face.</P>

<P>The eight counts of the amended complaint in this action focus on the CDA's
amendment to 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223, and do not challenge the CDA's amendment of

18 U.S.C. &#167; 1462(c).</P>
<P>(4)In addition, we have received briefs of amici curiae supporting and

<P>(5)The Act does not define &quot;telecommunications device&quot;.  By Order
dated February 27, 1996, we asked the parties to address whether a modem is a &quot;telecommunications
device&quot;.  Plaintiffs and the Government answered in the affirmative, and we
agree that the plain meaning of the phrase and the legislative history of the
Act strongly support their conclusion.  &quot;Telecommunications&quot; under 47
U.S.C. &#167; 153(48) means &quot;the transmission, between or among points
specified by the user, of information of the user's choosing, without change in
the form of content of the information as sent and received.&quot;  The plain
meaning of &quot;device&quot; is &quot;something that is formed or formulated by
design and usu[ally] with consideration of possible alternatives, experiment,
and testing.&quot;  Webster's Third New International Dictionary, 618 (1986). 
Clearly, the sponsors of the CDA thought it would reach individual Internet
users, many of whom still connect through modems.  See, e.g., 141 Cong. Rec.
S8329-46 (daily ed. June 14, 1995) (statements of Sen. Exon and Sen. Coats).</P>
<P>The resolution of the tension between the scope of &quot;telecommunications
device&quot; and the scope of &quot;interactive computer service&quot; as
defined in 47 U.S.C. &#167; 230(a)(2), see infra note 6, must await another day.
 It is sufficient for us to conclude that the exclusion of &#167; 223(h)(1)(B)
is probably a narrow one (as the Government has argued), insulating an
interactive computer service from criminal liability under the CDA but not
insulating users who traffic in indecent and patently offensive materials on the
Internet through those services.</P>
<P>(6)The statute at &#167; 509 amends 47 U.S.C. to add &#167; 230(e)(2), which
defines such a service as &quot;any information service, system, or access
software provider that provides or enables computer access by multiple users to
a computer server, including specifically a service or system that provides
access to the Internet and such systems operated or services offered by
libraries or educational institutions.&quot;</P>
<P>(7)In the Government's Opposition to plaintiffs' motion for a temporary
restraining order in C.A. No. 96-963, it notes &quot;the Department has a
longstanding policy that previous such provisions are unconstitutional and will
not be enforced&quot;, and that both President Clinton and General Reno &quot;have
made th[e] point clear&quot; that no one will be prosecuted under &quot;the
abortion-related provision of newly-amended 18 U.S.C. &#167; 1462(c).&quot; 
Opposition at 19, n.11 (February 14, 1996).  In view of this &quot;longstanding
policy&quot;, the Government contends there is no realistic fear of prosecution
and, so the argument goes, no need for equitable relief.  Id.  In their
post-hearing brief, the ACLU plaintiffs inform us that in view of the
Government's statement, &quot;they do not seek a preliminary injunction against

the enforcement of &#167; 1462(c).&quot;  Post-Trial Brief of ACLU Plaintiffs at

2 n.2.</P>
<P>(8)The court again expresses its appreciation to the parties for their
cooperative attitude in evolving the stipulation.</P>
<P>(9)The Government has not by motion challenged the standing of any plaintiff
in either case, and we harbor no doubts of our own on that point,
notwithstanding the Government's suggestion in a footnote of its post-hearing
brief.  See Defendants' Post-Hearing Memorandum at 37 n.46 (&quot;Plaintiffs'
assertions as to the speech at issue are so off-point as to raise standing
concerns.&quot;).  Descriptions of these plaintiffs, as well as of the nature
and content of the speech they contend is or may be affected by the CDA, are set
forth in paragraphs 70 through 356 at pages 30 through 103 of the parties'
stipulation filed in these actions.  These paragraphs will not be reproduced
here, but will be deemed adopted as Findings of the court.</P>
<P>(10)It became clear from the testimony that moderated newsgroups are the
exception and unmoderated newsgroups are the rule.</P>
<P>(11)The evidence adduced at the hearings provided detail to this paragraph
of the parties' stipulation.  See Findings 95 to 107.</P>
<P>(12)Testimony adduced at the hearing suggests that market forces exist to
limit the availability of material on-line that parents consider inappropriate
for their children.  Although the parties sharply dispute the efficacy of
so-called &quot;parental empowerment&quot; software, there is a sufficiently
wide zone of agreement on what is available to restrict access to unwanted sites
that the parties were able to enter into twenty-one paragraphs of stipulated
facts on the subject, which form the basis of paragraphs 49 through 69 of our
Findings of fact.  Because of the rapidity of developments in this field, some

of the technological facts we have found may become partially obsolete by the
time of publication of these Findings.</P>
<P>(13)This membership is constantly growing, according to the testimony of
Albert Vezza, Chairman of the World Wide Web Consortium.  See also Defendants'
Ex. D-167.</P>
<P>(14)See also Defendants' Ex. D-174 and the testimony of Mr. Vezza.</P>
<P>(15) From this point, our Findings are, unless noted, no longer based upon
the parties' stipulation, but upon the record adduced at the hearings.  </P>
<P>(16)Mr. Bradner is a member of the Internet Engineering Task Force, the
group primarily responsible for Internet technical standards, as well as other
Internet-related associations responsible for, among other things, the
prevailing Internet Protocols.  He is also associated with Harvard University.</P>
<P>(17)Dr. Olsen chairs the Computer Science Department at Brigham Young
University in Provo, Utah, and is the recently-appointed Director of the Human
Computer Interaction Institute at Carnegie-Mellon University in Pittsburgh,
Pennsylvania.</P>
<P>(18)The term &quot;information content provider&quot; is defined in &#167;
509 of the CDA, at the new 47 U.S.C. &#167; 230(e)(3), as &quot;any person or
entity that is responsible, in whole or in part, for the creation or development
of information provided through the Internet or any other interactive computer
service.&quot;</P>
<P>(19)By &quot;verification&quot;, we mean the method by which a user types in
his or her credit card number, and the Web site ensures that the credit card is
valid before it allows the user to enter the site.</P>
<P>(20)InterNIC is a naming organization, not a regulator of content.  InterNIC
and two other European organizations maintain a master list of domain names to
ensure that no duplication occurs.  Creators of Web sites must register their
domain name with InterNIC, and the agency will instruct the creator to choose
another name if the new Web site has the name of an already-existing site. 
InterNIC has no control over content on a site after registration.</P>
<P>(21)This paragraph and the preceding paragraph also illustrate that a
content provider might store its own material or someone else's on a caching
server.  The goal -- saving money and time -- is the same in both cases.</P>
<H2>Notes (Judge Sloviter)</H2>
<P>(1)It also probably covers speech protected by the First Amendment for some
minors a well, because it fails to limit its reach to that which is harmful for
minors, an issue which it is not necessary to decide in light of the other
conclusions reached.</P>
<P>(2)See 141 Cong. Rec. S8342 (daily ed. June 14, 1995) (letter from Kent
Markus, Acting Assistant Attorney General, U.S. Department of Justice, to
Senator Leahy).</P>
<H2>Notes (Judge Buckwalter)</H2>
<P>(1)If by virtue of the statute's authorization of expedited review of its
constitutionality, &quot;on its face,&quot; 47 U.S.C. &#167;561(a), we were
strictly limited to looking at the words of the statute, I would stand by my
T.R.O. opinion.  However, in light of the procedures which are required by 47
U.S.C. &#167; 561(a) and 28 U.S.C. &#167; 2284, and were followed by this court
in establishing an extensive record in this case, to ignore the evidence
presented would be to ignore what an action for injunctive relief is all about.</P>
<P>Section 561 reads as follows:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&#167; 561.  EXPEDITED REVIEW.</P>
<P>(a) THREE-JUDGE DISTRICT COURT HEARING -- Notwithstanding any other
provision of law, any civil action challenging the constitutionality, on its
face, of this title or any amendment made by this title, or any provision
thereof, shall be heard by a district court of 3 judges convened pursuant to the
provisions of section 2284 of title 28, United States Code.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Section 2284 states, in relevant part:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>&#167; 2284.  <B>Three-judge court; when required; composition; procedure</B>
 </P>
<P>(b) In any action required to be heard and determined by a district court of
three judges under subsection (a) of this section, the composition and procedure
of the court shall be as follows:  . . .</P>
<P>(3) A single judge may conduct all proceedings except the trial . . . . He
may grant a temporary restraining order on a specific finding, based on evidence
submitted, that specified irreparable damages will result if the order is not
granted, which order, unless previously revoked by the district judge, shall
remain in force only until the hearing and determination by the district court
of three judges of an application for a preliminary injunction. . . . </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>(2)Justice Kennedy argues in his opinion in Simon &amp; Schuster v. New York
Crime Victims Bd., 502 U.S. 105, 120 (1991), that &quot;[t]he regulated content
has the full protection of the First Amendment and this, I submit, is itself a
full and sufficient reason for holding the statute unconstitutional.  In my view
it is both unnecessary and incorrect to ask whether the state can show that the
statute 'is necessary to serve a compelling state interest and is narrowly drawn
to achieve that end.'&quot;  In the present case, there is no disagreement that
indecent and patently offensive speech have the full protection of the First
Amendment.</P>
<P>(3)Not only has speech been divided up and given values -- with some types
of speech given little or no protection (obscenity, fighting words, possibly
commercial speech) -- but also, by court decisions over the years, it has been
decided that the content of speech can indeed be regulated provided that the
regulation will directly and materially advance a compelling government
interest, and that it is narrowly tailored to accomplish that interest in the
least restrictive manner.  However, any content-based restriction must survive
this most exacting scrutiny.  Sable, 492 U.S. 115; Texas v. Johnson, 491 U.S.
397 (1989).</P>
<P>(4)The plaintiffs have made facial challenges to the disputed provisions of
the CDA on grounds of both vagueness and overbreadth.  The approach taken and
language used in evaluating a statute under each of these doctrines commingles,
and frequently is treated as a single approach.  &quot;We have traditionally
viewed vagueness and overbreadth as logically related and similar doctrines.&quot;
 Kolender v. Lawson, 461 U.S. 352, 358 n.8 (1983) (citing Keyishian v. Board of
Regents, 385 U.S. 589, 609, (1967); NAACP v. Button, 371 U.S. 415, 433 (1963)). 
Even in cases where the court attempts to distinguish these two doctrines, it
acknowledges some interplay between them.  <I>See e.g.</I> Village of Hoffman
Estates v. Flipside, Hoffman Estates, Inc., 455 U.S. 489, 494, and n. 6 (1982).</P>
<P>In addition, when discussing overbreadth, one cannot avoid reference to the
same language used to describe and apply the strict scrutiny standard to
constitutionally protected activities.  <I>See e.g.</I> Sable, 492 U.S. at 131;
Roberts v. Jaycees, 468 U.S. 609, 623 (1984).  While there are occasional
attempts to argue for clear distinctions among these doctrines, <I>see e.g.</I>
Kolender, 461 U.S. at 369 (White, J., Rehnquist, J. dissenting), such bright
lines simply have not been, and most likely cannot be, drawn in this area.</P>
<P>(5)Comparing a different portion of each of these two provisions suggests
that different terms are not to be read to mean the same thing.  As written,
section (a) pertains to telecommunications devices, and section (d) to
interactive computer services.  While we have not entirely resolved the tension
between these definitions at this stage, it has been established that these
terms are not synonymous, but are in fact intended to denote different
technologies.  This, together with the rule of statutory construction set forth
in Chief Judge Sloviter's opinion, seems to suggest on the face of the statute
that indecent and patently offensive also are not to be read as synonymous.</P>
<P>(6)18 U.S.C. &#167;1461 states, &quot;The term `indecent' as used in this
section includes matter of a character tending to incite arson, murder or
assassination.&quot;</P>
<P>(7)Although the Supreme Court may rule on the vagueness question in the
context of cable television regulation in Alliance for Community Media v. FCC,
56 F.3d 105 (D.C. Cir. 1995), currently pending on certiorari before the Court,
we will not defer adjudication of this issue as the constitutionality of the
term in the cable context may not be determinative of its use in cyberspace.</P>
<P>(8)Each intentional act of posting indecent content for display shall be
considered a separate violation of this subsection and carries with it a fine, a
prison term of up to two years, or both.  47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(a),(d) and Conf.
Rep. at 189.</P>
<P>(9)As I have noted, the unique nature of the medium cannot be overemphasized
in discussing and determining the vagueness issue.  This is not to suggest that
new technology should drive constitutional law.  To the contrary, I remain of
the belief that our fundamental constitutional principles can accommodate any
technological achievements, even those which, presently seem to many to be in
the nature of a miracle such as the Internet.</P>
<H2>Notes (Judge Dalzell)</H2>
<P>(1)By Order dated March 13, 1996, we asked the parties to submit their views
on questions regarding allocation of the burdens of proof in these cases.  Since
I believe that the outcome of these cases is clear regardless of the allocation
of proof between the parties, none of my conclusions in this opinion requires me
to choose between the arguments that the parties have presented to us.</P>
<P>(2)Although I do not believe the statue is unconstitutionally vague, I agree
with Judge Buckwalter that the Government's promise not to enforce the plain
reach of the law cannot salvage its overbreadth.  Even accepting the
Government's argument that prosecution of non-obscene pornography would be a &quot;legitimate
application&quot; of the CDA, City of Houston v. Hill, 482 U.S. 451, 459 (1987),
it is clear that the Act would &quot;make unlawful a substantial amount of
constitutionally protected conduct&quot;, id.  As in Hill, the Government's
circular reasoning -- that the law is constitutional because prosecutors would
only apply it to those against whom it could constitutionally be applied -- must
fail.  See id. at 464-67.</P>
<P>(3)Plaintiffs have argued that we may consider their challenge under the
standards governing both &quot;facial&quot; and &quot;as-applied&quot;
challenges.  That is, they suggest that we may pass judgment on the decency of
the plaintiffs' speech, even if we are unable to conclude that the act is
facially unconstitutional.  Surely this procedural confusion arises out of the
three opinions of the D.C. Circuit in National Treasury Employees Union v.
United States, 990 F.3d 1271, 1279-80 (D.C. Cir. 1993), aff'd, 115 S. Ct. 1003.</P>
<P>I doubt that we could undertake an as-applied inquiry, since we do not know
the exact content of plaintiffs' speech.  Indeed, it is impossible to know the
exact content of some plaintiffs' speech, since plaintiffs themselves cannot
know that content.  America Online, for example, cannot know what its
subscribers will spontaneously say in chat rooms or post to bulletin boards.  In
any event, I need not address this issue, in the light of our disposition today.</P>
<P>(4)&quot;Dial-a-porn&quot; is a shorthand description of &quot;sexually
oriented prerecorded telephone messages&quot;.  Sable, 492 U.S. at 117-18.</P>
<P>(5)In turn, Pacifica's definition of indecency has its roots in the Supreme
Court's obscenity jurisprudence.  Indecency includes some but not all of the
elements of obscenity.  See, e.g., Alliance for Community Media, 56 F.3d at
113-14 n.4.</P>
<P>(6)The reach of the two provisions is not coterminous, however.  As we
explain in the introduction to this Adjudication, &#167; 223(a) reaches the
making, creation, transmission, and initiation of indecent speech.  Section
223(d) arguably reaches more broadly to the &quot;display&quot; of indecent
speech.  I conclude here only that both sections refer to the identical type of
proscribed speech.</P>
<P>(7)At oral argument, counsel for the Government candidly recognized that &quot;there's
nothing quite like this statute before&quot;, and that the CDA's novelty raised
some &quot;legislative craftsmanship problem[s]&quot;.  Transcript of May 10,
1996, at 81-82.  I believe that my analysis here makes sense in the light of the
legislative history and the jurisprudence on which Congress relied in enacting
the CDA.  See Senate Report at 188, reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 201-02.</P>
<P>(8)The counterargument is that &#167; 223(e)(5)(A), when read together with &#167;
223(e)(6), merely confers jurisdiction on the FCC to prescribe the &quot;reasonable,
effective, and appropriate actions&quot; that count as defenses.  Congress
employed a similar scheme for dial-a-porn.  See Dial Information Servs., 938
F.2d at 1539 (citing 47 U.S.C. &#167; 223(b)(3)); Information Providers'
Coalition, 928 F.2d at 871.</P>
<P>(9)The play was &quot;critically acclaimed and long-running in Los Angeles
area theaters&quot;.  Infinity Broadcasting, 3 FCC R. at 932.</P>
<P>(10)Analytically, it makes sense that indecent speech has public value. 
After all, indecent speech is nevertheless protected speech, see, e.g., Sable,
492 U.S. at 126, and it must therefore have some public value that underlies the
need for protection.  Obscenity, by contrast, has no public value, id. at 124,
and thus has no protection from proscription.</P>
<P>(11)Internet technology undercuts the Government's argument that the &quot;in
context&quot; element of &#167;&#167; 223(a) and 223(d) would insulate
plaintiffs such as Critical Path from liability.  See, e.g., Transcript of May
10, 1996, at 89-91.  A user who clicks on a link in the Critical Path database
(see Findings 33, 77-78) might travel to a highly graphic page in a larger HTML
document.  The social value of that page, in context, might be debatable, but
the use of links effectively excerpts that document by eliminating content
unrelated to the link.</P>
<P>(12)Moreover, because of the technology of Internet relay chat, it would
need to make this determination before it organized the chat room, since it
could not pre-screen the discussion among the participants.  Thus, it would need
to predict, in advance, what the participants were likely to say.  The
participants would need to make a similar determination, unaided (I expect) by
First Amendment lawyers.</P>
<P>(13)Testimony of April 12, 1996, at 235-36.</P>
<P>(14)In this section I do not imply that the FCC has jurisdiction to process
Internet complaints in the same manner as it does for broadcast.  The extent of
the FCC's jurisdiction under the CDA is a sticky question not relevant here. 
See Senate Report at 190-91, reprinted in 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 204.  Because the
administrative decisions cited above arose out of citizens' complaints to the
FCC, however, they provide a kind of surrogate insight into the kinds of speech
that citizens have charged as indecent in the past.</P>
<P>(15)See Finding of fact 81.  See also Symposium, Emerging Media:  Technology
and the First Amendment, 104 Yale L.J. 1613 (1995).</P>
<P>(16)A narrow holding for this new medium also will not eliminate the chill
to plaintiffs, who could well stifle the extent of their participation in this
new medium while awaiting a future iteration of the CDA.  Such a holding would
also lead Congress to believe that a rewritten CDA (using, for example, a &quot;harmful
to minors&quot; standard, see Senate Report at 189, reprinted in 1996
U.S.C.C.A.N. at 202) would pass constitutional muster.  In my view, a holding
consistent with the novel qualities of this medium provides Congress with prompt
and clear answers to the questions that the CDA asks.</P>
<P>(17)The history of dial-a-porn regulation both before and after Sable is
tortuous, and involves the intervention of all three branches of government.  I
will not rehearse that history here, deferring instead to the other courts that
have recounted it. See, e.g., Sable, 492 U.S. at 118-23; Dial Information Serv.,
938 F.2d at 1537-40; Information Providers Coalition, 928 F.2d at 870-73.</P>
<P>(18)Sable is arguably not a decision about mass communication.  Unlike Red
Lion, Tornillo, or Turner, the Court in Sable reached no conclusions about the
proper fit between the First Amendment and governmental regulation of the
telephone.  The case also includes no discussion of the technology of the
telephone generally.  The plaintiff in that case, a purveyor of dial-a-porn,
challenged the statute only with respect to that type of content.  Sable, 492
U.S. at 117-18.  Thus, the Court's opinion discussed only the &quot;dial-in
services&quot;.  Id. at 128.  Since every telephone call at issue was, by
definition, dial-a-porn, every telephone call was, by definition, either obscene
or indecent.  Id. at 132 (Scalia, J., concurring).</P>
<P>Here, however, plaintiffs represent forty-seven different speakers
(including educational associations and consortia) who provide content to the
Internet on a broad range of topics.  The limited reach of the Sable holding
renders it inapt to the Internet communications of the plaintiffs in these
actions.</P>
<P>(19)I note here, too, that we have found as a fact that operation of a
computer is not as simple as turning on a television, and that the assaultive
nature of television, see Pacifica, 438 U.S. at 748-49, is quite absent in
Internet use.  See Findings 87-89.  The use of warnings and headings, for
example, will normally shield users from immediate entry into a sexually
explicit Web site or newsgroup message.  See Finding 88.  The Government may
well be right that sexually explicit content is just a few clicks of a mouse
away from the user, but there is an immense legal significance to those few
clicks.</P>
<P>(20)In a May 3, 1996 letter to a three-judge court in the Southern District
of New York, John C. Keeney, Acting Assistant Attorney General in the Criminal
Division of the Department of Justice, has advised that tagging would be &quot;substantial
evidence&quot; in support of a &#167; 223(e)(5)(A) defense:</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Under present technology, non-commercial content providers can take steps to
list their site[s] in URL registries of covered sites, register their site[s]
with the marketplace of browsers and blocking software (including listing an IP
address), place their material in a directory blocked by screening software, or
take other similarly effective affirmative steps to make their site[s] known to
the world to allow the site[s] to be blocked.  Under present technology, it is
the position of the Department of Justice that, absent extraordinary
circumstances, such efforts would constitute substantial evidence that a content
provider had taken good faith, reasonable, effective, and appropriate actions
under the circumstances to restrict or prevent access by minors to the covered
material.  The same would be true for tagging by content providers coupled with
evidence that the tag would be screened by the marketplace of browsers and
blocking software.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Letter of May 3, 1996 from Acting Assistant Attorney General John C. Keeney
to Hons. Denise L. Cote, Leonard B. Sand, and Jose A. Cabranes, attached to
Defendants' Motion for Leave to File Supplemental Statement.  On May 8, 1996,
the Government moved to file the Kenney letter in this action, and we granted
the motion as unopposed the next day.</P>
<P>The letter certainly raises more questions than it answers.  I wonder, for
example, whether it is consistent with the plain language of the Act simply for
content providers to &quot;make their site[s] known to the world&quot; and
thereby &quot;to allow [them] to be blocked&quot;, even though this form of
notice alone would not reduce the availability of indecent content.  Cf. Senate
Report at 178, 1996 U.S.C.C.A.N. at 201 (noting that &#167; 223(d) &quot;applies
to content providers who post indecent material for online display without
taking precautions that shield that material from minors&quot;).  It is also an
unanswered question whether the Keeney letter would eliminate any of the CDA's
chill, since the Government acknowledged that the letter would not prohibit a
United States Attorney from taking a contrary position in a particular
prosecution.  See Defendants' May 9, 1996 Response to the May 8, 1996 Order of
Court.  The letter also fails to mention how users who participate in chat
rooms, newsgroups, listservs, and e-mail might take advantage of &#167;
223(e)(5)(A).  Finally, it is undisputed that neither PICS nor the hypothetical
&quot;-L18&quot; tag are available to speakers using the World Wide Web today,
whom the Government has explicitly reserved its right to prosecute should the
CDA ultimately be found constitutional.  See Stipulation and Order of February
26, 1996, quoted supra.</P>
<P>(21)Turner examined certain &quot;must-carry&quot; provisions under an
intermediate scrutiny, since those laws imposed incidental burdens on speech but
did not directly regulate content.  Turner, 114 S. Ct. at 2469.  The Court
remanded the case to the district court without passing on the constitutionality
of the must-carry provisions.  Id. at 2472.</P>
<P>(22)Arguably, a valid CDA would create an incentive for overseas
pornographers not to label their speech. If we upheld the CDA, foreign
pornographers could reap the benefit of unfettered access to American audiences.
 A valid CDA might also encourage American pornographers to relocate in foreign
countries or at least use anonymous remailers from foreign servers.</P>
<P>(23)Testimony of March 22, 1996, at 167.</P>

<!-- RTFact 1.3 Iconovex Corporation 1995 -->

<BODY bgcolor="FFCC99">
<center><h1>EchoSearch Release Notes</h1></center>
<hr>
<center><b><br>Check out what's new for latest version of
EchoSearch! <br>Or see what has been updated, added, or fixed in previous
releases.</b></center><br>

<BR><BR><BR>
<h2>Release Notes for Version 1.07</h2>

<h3>Added Features</h3>
<ol>
<li>Automatic detection of proxy information.

Proxy server information is now automatically detected from the system
registry and applied in the Network Settings dialog (Options menu).  A
"Defaults" button has been added to this dialog that can be used to get
the proxy information from the default browser.

<li>Search engines can now be cloned.

Using the clone feature, other versions of a supported search engine type
can be added to EchoSearch, for example, an Intranet or European version
of a search engine.  At this time, only AltaVista can be cloned.
EchoSearch includes three AltaVista clones: US, Australia, and Europe.
</ol>

<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ol>

<li>Due to an increased number of problems reported with EchoSearch 1.06,
which used the Java Just In Time (JIT) compiler, we have switched back
to Sun's regular Java runtime.
</ol>

<h3>Online Services</h3>
EchoSearch will not work with any online services that do NOT support a
32-bit winsock (WSOCK32.DLL).  Services such as AOL and Prodigy are
currently working on 32-bit support.  Services that allow the use of a
32-bit winsock, such as Netcom and CompuServe, will run EchoSearch without
difficulty.  For additional information on using EchoSearch with these
type of services, see the CONNECT.TXT file.
<h3>Known Problems</h3>
<b><i>Web Browsers:</b></i><br>
Only 32-bit browsers are capable of supporting the long filenames used by
EchoSearch.  We recommend using Netscape 2.0 or better or Internet Explorer
3.0 or better to view EchoSearch search results.
<P>
<b><i>Spamdexing:</b></i>           <br>
In an effort to increase the likelihood that a document will be considered
a &quot;hit&quot; by search engines, some Webmasters may include text that
has
nothing but keywords repeated over and over again.  When an author has
used this method of attracting search engines, coined &quot;spamdexing,
&quot; you will often find strange entries in the Concept view and Qualified Results
where a word or phrase is repeated over and over.  If you then click on
one of these entries, you may jump to a paragraph that is unrelated to the
entry or to an &quot;empty&quot; paragraph, because the original text was
hidden by the author so that it would not be visible in a browser (to locate the
entry in the original document, use the &quot;View Source&quot; or similar
option to view the HTML source and then use the &quot;Find&quot; feature, often CTRL +
F).
<P>
While we do our best to filter out this kind of material, we cannot filter
it out completely without the risk of eliminating truly valid index entries
contained in spamdexed documents.
<p>
Sometimes authors may include spamdexing in
 the title of the document. In such cases the summary view will display the
 titles as the author has written them.
<P>
<b><i>Netscape Navigator 2.0 With Windows NT:</b></i>    <br>
When Windows NT users are running EchoSearch with Netscape 2.0 minimized
or in the background, the Netscape 2.0 window will not automatically
become the active window after EchoSearch has finished processing; users
must manually select the Netscape window.  Windows 95 users will not
experience this problem.  This problem will not occur for Windows NT
users if they are using Netscape Navigator 2.01.
<P>
<b><i>Entering Invalid Searches:</b></i>                     <br>
EchoSearch does not do any semantic testing of search queries to ensure
that they are valid.  You could, for instance, enter a query which
specified both that &quot;motorcycles&quot; must be included and that &quot;
motorcycles&quot;
must not be included.
<P>
<b><i>Uninstall Leaves Remnants:</b></i><br>
The uninstall program will occassionally be unable to remove the java
folder and will therefore leave the iconovex\java directory intact.  You
can remove this directory manually from the DOS prompt or reboot the
computer and re-run the uninstall program.
<P>
<b><i>Unvisited Links Appear Visited:</b></i> <br>
Because EchoSearch uses the same filenames for each run, it is possible
that on your second or third query in the same session you will begin to
see links marked as &quot;visited&quot; that you know you haven't yet
clicked on.
<P>
If this becomes a problem, you can probably clear the visited links
through your browser.  For instance, in Netscape Navigator, choose
Options-&gt;General Preferences-&gt;Appearance and click on the &quot;Expire
now&quot;
button.

<BR><BR>
<hr>
<h4><b>If this is the first version of EchoSearch you have used,
please read the release notes below for previous versions of
EchoSearch.</h4></b>
<hr>
<BR><BR>

<h2>Release Notes for Version 1.06</h2>

<h3>Added Features</h3>
<ol>
<li>Searches can now be performed based on speed or based on relevance.  The
default is "speed."  Using this option, hits will be collected as they
are returned from the search engines, regardless of how each search engine
has rated the hits.  With the speed option, you will obtain more hits
from the faster search engines and you may get different results when
running the same query at another time.  Using the relevance option,
EchoSearch will divide the number of hits you requested among all the
engines to obtain an approximately equal number of hits from each engine.
With the relevance option, it will take longer to collect hits, because
EchoSearch will wait for the slower engines to "connect" and return their
hits.
<li>Automatic detection of registered browser. When EchoSearch is run for the
first time, it will look in the Windows registry for the name and the
location of the registered browser. This will be displayed in the Select
Browser dialog.
<li>Just-in-Time compiler.  EchoSearch now ships with the Java Just-in-Time
(JIT) compiler.  This should improve the overall speed of EchoSearch.
<li>Document descriptions now include the size and the date (if available)
of the document, as provided by each search engine.</ol>
<h3>Bug Fixes</h3>
<ol>
<li>The installation program now installs mfc30.dll in the
Iconovex\java\bin directory. This will fix the problem for NT 4.0 users.
<li>Framed documents are now handled properly.
<li>Kernel32.dll update.  Microsoft has released a Kernel32.dll update for
Windows 95 that resolves a memory leak which occurs when opening and
closing a Socket using the Windows Sockets API.  If you are getting
GPFs or IPFs when running EchoSearch, it may be because of this memory
leak.  See the online help for more information on obtaining this update.
</ol>

After
you hit <b><i>Search</b></i>, EchoSearch will send your request to seven
search engines simultaneously and begin returning successful result until it
reaches the number that you requested.  When you submit an advanced query,
EchoSearch will only submit your query to the search engines that support
such queries. This insures a more relevant document set.  Lycos and
Webcrawler, shown on the screen below as "Unsupported," do not allow the
"must include" operator. <p>

Choosing <b><i>Options  Search Engines</b></i> on EchoSearch's main
screen will bring up the dialog shown below.  All of the search engines used
by EchoSearch are listed here. You can select or deselect any of the search
engines for any particular query.  We have selected to obtain hits based
on <i>speed</i> (fastest return) rather than on <i>relevance</i> (equal number
of hits from each search engine).  On this screen, you can designate how
often you would like EchoSearch to automatically check for, and download as

<b>DISCLAIMER:</b> The instructions in this file are provided as a courtesy
to EchoSearch users.  Iconovex is not liable for any damages suffered
as a result of using or modifying these instructions.
<P>

<b>A NOTE ABOUT INTERNET SERVICE PROVIDERS:</b> You must be able to connect
to the Internet using the Windows 32-bit winsock, WSOCK32.DLL. If you attempt
to use EchoSearch with a 16-bit connection, EchoSearch will either display
an error when it trys to update the search engine drivers and connect to
the search engines or it will only be able to connect to one search
engine (and will eventually not work at all).  If you need help beyond
the instructions provided in this file, please contact your ISP (see
<a href="#contact">Contact Information</a>).
<p>
<b>A NOTE ABOUT BROWSERS:</b> In order to view EchoSearch output, you will
need a browser that supports long filenames, e.g., Internet Explorer (version
3.0 or greater recommended) or the 32-bit version of Netscape Navigator
(version 3.0 or greater recommended). The default browsers distributed with
many online services *do not* currently support long filenames. If your
provider does not use a 32-bit browser, you will need to obtain Internet
Explorer or the 32-bit Netscape to use with EchoSearch. You can still use
the default browser for your other Internet activities if you are using
these online services.  If you need help beyond the instructions provided
in this file, please contact your ISP (see <a href="#contact">Contact
Information</a>). <P>

<P>
America Online has released the 32-bit/Windows 95 version 3.0 of its
software, which includes Internet Explorer 3.0.  Version 3.0 for Windows
3.1 will NOT work with EchoSearch.
<p>
<center>      Instructions for Using EchoSearch with America Online 3.0
<p>    -------------------------------------------------------------
</center>
<p>
In order to run EchoSearch with America Online, you will need to open
and "connect" to America Online BEFORE you begin a search. EchoSearch
will use this connection to perform its searches.  While you can perform
other activities online while EchoSearch is running, be aware that this may
slow EchoSearch's searching and processing speed. Also remember that
EchoSearch will not automatically close your connection to America Online
when you close EchoSearch.

<a name="cserve"><h3>CompuServe</h3>

<P>
CompuServe is now shipping version 3.0.1 for Windows 95 of their
software. Internet Explorer 3.0 is also included.  Version 3.0.1 for
Windows 3.1 will NOT work with EchoSearch.
<p>

<center>        Instructions for Using EchoSearch with CompuServe 3.0.1
<p>    -------------------------------------------------------------
</center>
<p>
In order to run EchoSearch with CompuServe, you will need to open and
"connect" to CompuServe BEFORE you begin a search. EchoSearch will use
this connection to perform its searches. While you can perform other
activities online while EchoSearch is running, be aware that this may slow
EchoSearch's searching and processing speed. Also remember that EchoSearch
will not automatically close your connection to CompuServe when you close
EchoSearch.
<p>
 <center><h4>Instructions for Using Windows 95 and CompuServe 2.01
 </center></h4>
<p>
If you have not yet received the new version and you are using Windows 95,
you can set up a dial-up connection to CompuServe, using the Windows 95
dialer. See the instructions below. You will also need to obtain a copy
of Internet Explorer or Netscape in order to view EchoSearch output.
<p>
 The following instructions are a variance of two
posts made on a CompuServe forum (CIMNETMO.TXT, submitted by Robin Johansen,
and CIMNET3.TXT, submitted by Marcel Farge).

<P> <P> <b><center>READ THESE
NOTES BEFORE YOU START ANYTHING!!!</b></center> <P>

<b>NOTE 1:</b>
<P>
This document assumes that you already have WinCim 2.0.1 on a PC using
Windows 95 and that you wish to install Netscape as an alternate Internet
browser using CompuServe as the service provider. It also assumes that you
have installed the Internet Jumpstart kit available on Microsoft PLUS and
that you have run the &quot;Internet Setup Wizard&quot; which this install
provides.
<P>

<b>NOTE 2:</b>
<P>
For experienced Windows 95 users who have not already installed the
Internet Jumpstart kit from Microsoft PLUS, you can save yourself some
time and aggravation in having to install the required system elements
in a piecemeal fashion by making sure that you have the following on
your system. These elements can be added using the &quot;Add/Remove Programs
facility in Control Panel:
<P>
* Dial-up Adaptor<br>
* TCP/IP<br>
* Dial-up Scripting Tool<br>
* Client for Microsoft Windows<br>
<P>
<b>NOTE 3:</b>
<P>
As an alternative to installing software from Microsoft PLUS -
Microsoft's Internet Explorer can be downloaded FREE (GO WINCON) as
MSIE20.EXE.  This file contains the Internet Explorer AND the Internet
Jumpstart Kit - with Internet Setup Wizard (i.e., &quot;Internet Tools&quot;).
Running MSIE20.EXE will install all of this. CAUTION - Internet Explorer
*might* cause a problem - see Section G below - &quot;ANOTHER PROBLEM
SOMETIMES ENCOUNTERED&quot;.
<P>
As of 8/2/96, there is a beta version of Internet Explorer 3.0, however,
these instructions have not been tested with that version.
<p>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<P>
<h3>SECTION A</h3>
<P>
<b>FIRST STEPS</b>
<P>
Before setting up the Win95 dialer, watch for two traps:
<P>
<b>TRAP # 1:</b> Multiple winsocks
<P>
Unfortunately there are several winsock.dll files about which are not
all equal - you must sort this out as follows:
<P>

1). Open Windows Explorer<br>
2). Highlight &quot;My Computer&quot;<br>
3). Click on &quot;Tools&quot; - Click on &quot;Find&quot; - Click on &quot;
Files or Folders...&quot;<br>
4). In the &quot;Named&quot; box enter &quot;winsock.dll&quot; (without
quotation marks)<br>
5). Check &quot;Include subfolders&quot;<br>
6). Click &quot;Find Now&quot;<br>
<P>
This will tell you what winsock.dll files you have installed.
<P>
You MUST HAVE the winsock.dll (133K dated 11/28/95) in X:\CSERVE\WINCIM,
X:\CSERVE\MOSAIC, and X:\CSERVE\CID where &quot;X&quot; is the drive on
which you have your CompuServe stuff installed.
<P>
It is probably NOT a good idea to have these folders in the &quot;PATH&quot;
statement in your AUTOEXEC.BAT file (usually found in C:\)
<P>
<b>#### REMOVE OR RENAME ALL OTHER WINSOCK.DLL FILES ####</b>
<P>
Repeat steps 1 thru 6 above but substitute &quot;winsock.dll&quot; with
&quot;wsock32.dll&quot; in step 4. You should find wsock32.dll (65K 07/11/95)
in both your X:\WINDOWS &amp; X:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM folders.
<P>
<b>TRAP #2:</b> 16-bit vs. 32-bit Netscapes
<P>
There are two variants of Netscape 2 - 16 bit and 32 bit.  The one you
need is the 32 bit.  Their are several 32-bit versions available titled
&quot;N32E201.EXE&quot; OR &quot;ATLS32S2.EXE&quot; - both will work OK.  It
is assumed that you already know how to install this. If not see the instructions at
http://www.netscape.com.
<P>

 <h3>SECTION D:</h3>
<P>
<b>DIAL-UP SCRIPTING TOOL</b>
<P>
1). Press the Start button, select &quot;Programs,&quot; then &quot;
Accessories.&quot;  If the Dial-Up Scripting Tool shows up, you're ready to proceed.
<P>
<b>*</b>If it is not there:<br>
(i) If you have the Windows 95 CD, press the Start button,
select &quot;Settings,&quot; then &quot;Control Panel.&quot;  Double-click
on the Add/Remove Programs icon.  Select the &quot;Windows Setup&quot; tab, then
click on the &quot;Have Disk&quot; option.  Assuming your CD-ROM drive is
D:, enter the path D:\Admin\Apptools\Dscript.  Click OK and the
SLIP/CSLIP drivers and Dial-up Scripting Tool will be installed.
<P>
(ii) If you have Windows 95 on floppies, you can download the
Dial-up Scripting Tool and SLIP drivers {DSCRPT.EXE} from the
Internet Resources Forum library on CompuServe via GO INETRES.
Run this file to extract the archive and then install as per the
readme file.]
<P>
2). Click Dial-Up Scripting Tool. You will see the utility's dialog box.
<P>
Your current dial-up profile(s) will be listed in the text area on the
left.
<P>
3). Select the profile for which you wrote the script, (&quot;CompuServe,
&quot; if you followed the example) and then click &quot;Browse.&quot;  If you saved
CIS.SCP in the C:\Program Files\Accessories folder, it should appear in the
dialog box. Select it and click &quot;Open.&quot;
<P>
4). Leave &quot;Step through script&quot; and &quot;Start terminal screen
minimized&quot; unchecked.  Click &quot;Apply&quot; and then click OK to close the Dial-up
Scripting Tool.
<P>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<P>
<h3>SECTION E:</h3>
<P>
<b>TO CONNECT YOUR SCRIPT</b>
<P>
In the Dial-Up Networking group, double-click on your dial-up networking
icon titled &quot;CompuServe&quot; (if you used the example) and enter your
username (e.g., 111111,2222) and password in the dialog boxes, since
your script will need these variables to connect.  It is assumed that
you can enter &quot;Dial-Up Properties...&quot; with no problem (the phone
number is of course that which you use to access CompuServe).
<P>
To test your work so far, click &quot;Connect&quot; and the dialer should
start initializing the modem and dialing.  You will know that you have been
successful when you see the &quot;Connected to CompuServe&quot; window pop
up and start counting time.  Do not panic if it takes a while to connect after
the popup window displays &quot;Password:&quot; and the following line with
a square &quot;bullet point.&quot;  This can take 30 seconds or so to process
the log-on and go to the next step.
<P>
Note that the connection speed is also displayed in the pop-up window,
e.g., 26400bps. The speed is not necessarily the speed of your modem; it
is determined at the time of connection by a number of factors.  If all
goes well with your connection click &quot;Disconnect&quot; and proceed with
Section F - if you are experiencing difficulty go to Section G.
<P>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<P>

<h3>SECTION F:</h3>
<P>
<b>ESTABLISHING THE LINK TO THE DIALER FROM NETSCAPE</b>
<P>
1). Click Start and select &quot;Settings&quot; and &quot;Control Panel.
&quot;<br>
2). Double-click on the icon &quot;Internet&quot; (If this is not present
see NOTE 3a below).<br>
3). On the &quot;Options&quot; tab, check &quot;Autodial&quot; and select
&quot;CompuServe&quot; as your dial-up network setting.<br>
4). Click OK.<br>
<P>
This should give you &quot;semi-automatic&quot; dialing so when you start
Netscape, a popup window will appear requiring you to click &quot;Connect.
&quot; The dialer should then connect you to CompuServe as your Internet
service provider.
<P>
You may want to adjust your preferences in Netscape:
<P>
1). Open Netscape.<br>
2). Click &quot;Options.&quot;<br>
3). Click &quot;Mail and News preferences.&quot;<br>
4). Click &quot;Servers&quot; tab.<br>
5). Set Outgoing Mail [SMTP] server = mail.compuserve.com.<br>
6). Set News [NNTP] Server = news.compuserve.com and News RC Directory =
X:\NETSCAPE\NEWS, where X = the drive where you have Netscape.<br>
7). Click &quot;Identity&quot; tab.<br>
8). Enter your name, email address, and reply address (usually your
email address).<br>
<P>
Your Name = John Smith<br>
Your Email = 111111.1111@compuserve.com<br>
Reply to Address = 111111.1111@compuserve.com<br>
<P>
<b>NOTE 1a</b> - DO NOT put a comma in your CompuServe address.  It is supposed
to be a stop, exactly as above.
<P>
<b>NOTE 2a</b> - You CAN NOT use Netscape mail to receive your CompuServe mail
because they do not have a POP3 server.  Sending mail is OK.
<P>
<b>NOTE 3a</b> - If you don't have the &quot;Internet&quot; icon (i.e., you have
not installed &quot;Internet tools&quot; as per notes 1 through 3 at the head of
this file) all is not lost.  You will just have to use &quot;Manual start up.
&quot; To do this &quot;fire up&quot; your dialer, and when you are connected to
CompuServe open Netscape.
<P>
<b>NOTE 4a</b> - The dialer DOES NOT DISCONNECT AUTOMATICALLY when you exit
Netscape.  You will HAVE TO manually disconnect the dialer when you
are finished.  To disconnect the dialer, click the Disconnect button
in the &quot;Connected To&quot; window.
<P>
^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^^
<P>
<h3>SECTION G:</h3>
<P>
<b>ANOTHER PROBLEM SOMETIMES ENCOUNTERED</b>
<P>
<b>THE PROBLEM:</b> Dialer starts OK and establishes a connection.  Netscape is
started but just sits for what seems an eternity and eventually returns
the following error message:<br>
<p>
&quot;Netscape is unable to locate the server<br>
www.xxxxxxxx.com<br>
The server does not have a DNS entry<br>
Check the server name in the location [URL] and try again&quot;<br>
<P>
<b>OTHER SYMPTOMS:</b> Microsoft Explorer [also installed] behaves perfectly.
<P>
<b>A POSSIBLE FIX:</b> Remove the Internet stuff from WIN 95 using &quot;Add/Remove
Programs&quot; and then re-install Microsoft Internet Explorer by
downloading &quot;MSIE20.EXE&quot; as outlined at the start of this file (GO
WINCON).  Then run MSIE20.EXE, not using the Add/Remove Programs utility.
<P>
<b>ALSO CHECK:</b> Go to the Control Panel and double-click on &quot;Network.&quot;
Highlight &quot;Dial-up adapter&quot; and click &quot;Properties.&quot;  On
the Bindings tab you should only have ONE ENTRY, &quot;TCP/IP.&quot;

<h3>Opening an Internet Connection to your Internet Service Provider
Automatically in Windows 95</h3>
<p>If you are using Dial-Up Networking (DUN) in Windows 95 to connect to your
Internet Service Provider, you *may* be able to open a connection to
your ISP automatically whenever an application requests an Internet
connection.  For some reason, this does not work with some DUN setups.
<p>
To do this:

<ol>
<li>Right-click on the Internet icon on your desktop and select Properties
(or double-click on this icon in Control Panel).

<li>On the "Options" tab, check "Autodial" and select your ISP from
the Dial-Up Networking drop-down list.

<li>Click OK.
</ol>
<p>This should give you "semi-automatic" dialing so when you start
EchoSearch, a popup window will appear requiring you to click "Connect."
The dialer should then connect you to your ISP.
<p>
==============================================================
<a name="trouble"><h3>Troubleshooting</h3>

<P>
<b>PROBLEM:</b> EchoSearch connects to the wrong service provider
<p>
<b>SOLUTION (Windows 95):</b> If you have multiple service providers set up on your
system (e.g., CompuServe and MSN), you may have another provider
set to establish your Internet connections.  Right-click on the
Internet icon on your desktop and select &quot;Properties&quot; (or open it
in the Control Panel).  On the Options tab, check &quot;Autodial,&quot; and
select the provider you want to use for your Internet connections.
<P>
<b>PROBLEM:</b> You get an error message "Error. Cannot connect to search
engines" when you try to run a search.

<p><b>SOLUTION:</b> You must be using Windows 95 or Windows NT.  EchoSearch
does not work on Windows 3.1.
<p>
<b>SOLUTION:</b> You must be using a 32-bit Internet connection in order to
run EchoSearch.  If you do not know if you are using a 32-bit connection,
check the information for your Internet Service Provider provided above,
or contact your ISP's Customer Service  or Technical Support
department (see "Contact Information" below).
<p>
<b>SOLUTION:</b> Check that you are using the correct username and password.
<p>
<b>SOLUTION:</b> Is your modem working correctly?  If it is an external modem,
is it on and plugged into a phone jack?
<p>
<b>SOLUTION:</b> Make sure that you are "connected" to your Internet Service
Provider.  You may also need to close and reopen EchoSearch if you
did not have a connection open before when you attempted to run a search.

<p>
<b>SOLUTION (Windows 95):</b> You may not have a 16550 compatible UART.  If you do not,
choose Start - Settings - Control Panel. Double-click on the Modems
icon.  Select your modem and click &quot;Properties.&quot;  Select the
Connection tab and &quot;Port Settings.&quot;  Uncheck the &quot;Use FIFO
buffers&quot; box.  Click OK, OK, and OK again to exit.

<p><b>PROBLEM: </b>Your browser is unable to find or display the search
results
<p>
<b>SOLUTION: </b>You must be using a 32-bit browser, which is able to display
files with long filenames, in order to view EchoSearch's search results.
If you do not know if you are using a 32-bit browser, check the
information for your Internet Service Provider provided above.  Or contact
your ISP's Customer Service or Technical Support department (see
<a href="#contact">Contact Information</a>) to find out how to obtain and set
up a 32-bit browser with your ISP's software.  We recommend that you use the
most current version of Netscape Navigator (3.0) or Internet Explorer (3.0).

<HR>
In <i>PC Computing</i>'s October issue, due out on the newsstands in
mid-September, EchoSearch is given a one-page review and a 4-Star rating.
Until that review is available in full, here are some excerpts from it. <p>
 <blockquote><B>"No other engine delivers text
searches of the Web with its combination of broad reach and near perfect
accuracy"</blockquote> <p> <P> <blockquote>"We sent EchoSearch out on some
acid-test searches we've run many times before, and it came back with flying
colors.  Its accuracy rate was nothing short of amazing... What's more,
EchoSearch unearthed relevant pages we'd never seen before." </blockquote>
<p> <P> <blockquote>"If you've ever run a search on Alta Vista or Infoseek
that returned hundreds of irrelevant hits, you're going to flip for
EchoSearch."</blockquote> <p> <P> <blockquote>"All in all, EchoSearch is one
of the most impressive first-release products we've ever
seen."</blockquote></B> <hr> <p>

excerpts from the review:</i>
<p>
<blockquote>
<b>"EchoSearch [company information omitted] can be your guide through

"EchoSearch's great strength is its ability to make sense of the [search]

<head><title>Columbia Daily Tribune Article</title></head>
<body bgcolor="#ffffff">
<em>Article by Scott A. May, as seen in his <b>PC Solutions</b> column.
Reprinted with permission from the Columbia Daily Tribune</em>
<p>
Following years of empty promises and speculative ballyhoo, the information
age is finally upon us.  Your doorway to this brave new world is the personal
computer, linked globally via the Internet or internally through corporate
Intranets.  The trouble now is finding exactly what you need - quickly,
cheaply and effectively - in this growing  mountain of information.
<p>
The World Wide Web provides many tools, called search engines, to filter
through thousands of Internet sites.  Using a key word or phrase, these
engines search the entire Web and return "hit lists" relevant to your query.
Unfortunately, not all search engines are created equally.  It would be nice
to have a single tool that utilizes every search engine, while fine-tuning
your search criteria in ways no single engine allows.
<p>
Enter "EchoSearch from Iconovex Corp., experts in Web and network indexing
software.  Whether you search the web for fun or business research, consider
this one-stop window to the Net, guaranteed to save you time, trouble and
expense.
<p>
To use, the program requires an on-line access provider or direct link to a
corporate Intranet.  To begin, simply type in a word or phrase you wish to
search for.  Next, indicate where you want to search: the Web, Usenet or
Intranet.  Finally, specify the number of documents, or relevant "hits," that
you'd like returned.  Click the search button and the rest is automatic.
<p>
Web search engines supported by EchoSearch include AltaVista, Excite,
InfoSeek, Lycos, OpenText and WebCrawler.  Using special Java multi-threading
technology, the program submits your query to every search engine on the
list.  A progress screen shows which engine is being used and the number of
hits each generates.
<p>
When the searching process is complete, the program then downloads, analyzes
and indexes the results, which can then be viewed with your Web browser.
Here's the best part for those looking to save money: Only the actual search
process requires being on-line.  Setting up your query and viewing the
results are accomplished off-line.  No more wasted time and expense
conducting such research "live."
<p>
Search results are displayed in your browser in a number of different ways,
including an index view, concept view, summary view or search statistics.
Even though you're working off-line, you can still use many of your
browser's functions to find, print or bookmark source documents.  If you find
something of interest, simply click on that entry to go back on-line and
connect with that site.  Search results can also be saved to your hard disk
for later review or on-line connection.
<p>
To be more specific in the results the program generates, an advanced search
option allows you to specify which words or phrases must be found to qualify
as a hit.  Conversely, you can also tell the program to ignore documents that
contain certain words or phrases.  This ability to fine-tune your criteria
not only speeds up the search process, but helps you eliminate irrelevant
hits.
<p>
Other goodies include the ability to automatically update and add to your
list of available search engines.  You can also narrow your search to
specific Web or Usenet pages by creating bookmarks and instructing the
program to search only this customized list.  This is especially helpful if
you routinely visit only a select number of sites and wish to search only
those pages for new or updated information.
<p>
The program may seem technical, especially for those new to the on-line
experience, but it is actually extremely easy to use.  Between the printed
manual and excellent on-line help, even novice users will quickly become
experts at pinpointing exactly the information they need.  As an on-line
research tool, EchoSearch is an invaluable resource.
<p>
EchoSearch is available on floppy disk for Windows 95, Windows NT, UNIX and
Macintosh computers.  Product requirements include a modem, Internet or
Intranet connection and Web browser.  Suggested retail price is $49.95, from
Iconovex Corp., (800) 943-0292

<TITLE>Search Engine Clones</TITLE>

<h1 align=center>Search Engine Clones</h1>

<hr>
<p>
<P>Some search engines are available in different versions for different
areas of the world or even "Intranet" versions that can reside on your

<li>and clones that will be <a href="#added">added</a> to future releases of
EchoSearch. </ul>
<P>

<a name="updating"></a>
<h3>How to Update Your Search Engine List</h3>
<p>If any of the

<h1>
THE GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE
(GATT 1947)</h1><p><p>    This is the complete text of the
General Agreement together with all the amendments which became effective
since its entry into force. For the convenience of the reader, asterisks mark
the portions of the text which should be read in conjunction with notes and
supplementary provisions in Annex I of the Agreement.<p>


<h2>
THE GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TARIFFS AND TRADE </h2>


<b><p></b>    The Governments of the Commonwealth of Australia, the Kingdom
of Belgium, the United States of Brazil, Burma, Canada, Ceylon, the Republic
of Chile, the Republic of China, the Republic of Cuba, the Czechoslovak
Republic, the French Republic, India, Lebanon, the Grand-Duchy of Luxemburg,
the Kingdom of the Netherlands, New Zealand, the Kingdom of Norway, Pakistan,
Southern Rhodesia, Syria, the Union of South Africa, the United Kingdom of
Great Britain and Northern Ireland, and the United States of America:<p>
Recognizing that their relations in the field of trade and economic endeavor
should be conducted with a view to raising standards of living, ensuring full
employment and a large and steadily growing volume of real income and
effective demand, developing the full use of the resources of the world and
expanding the production and exchange of goods,<p>    Being desirous of
contributing to these objectives by entering into reciprocal and mutually
advantageous arrangements directed to the substantial reduction of tariffs
and other barriers to trade and to the elimination of discriminatory
treatment in international commerce,<p> Have through their Representatives
    agreed as follows:<p>

<h3>
PART I </h3>

<h4>
Article I </h4>

<h4>
General Most-Favored-Nation Treatment </h4>


<p>1.    With respect to customs duties and charges of any kind imposed on
    or in connection with importation or exportation or imposed on the
international transfer of payments for imports or exports, and with respect
to the method of levying such duties and charges, and with respect to all
rules and formalities in connection with importation and exportation, and
with respect to all matters referred to in paragraphs 2 and 4 of Article
III,* any advantage, favor, privilege or immunity granted by any contracting
party to any product originating in or destined for any other country shall
be accorded immediately and unconditionally to the like product originating
in or destined for the territories of all other contracting parties.<p>2.     The provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article shall not require the elimination of any preferences in respect
of import duties or charges which do not exceed the levels provided for in
paragraph 4 of this Article and which fall within the following
descriptions:<p> (<i>a</i>)    Preferences in force exclusively between two
or more of the territories listed in Annex A, subject to the conditions set
forth therein; <p> (<i>b</i>)    Preferences in force exclusively between two
or more territories which on July 1, 1939, were connected by common
sovereignty or relations of protection or suzerainty and which are listed in
Annexes B, C and D, subject to the conditions set forth therein;<p>
(<i>c</i>)    Preferences in force exclusively between the United States of
America and the Republic of Cuba;<p> (<i>d</i>)    Preferences in force
exclusively between neighboring countries listed in Annexes E and F.<p> 3.
The provisions of paragraph 1 shall not apply to preferences between the
countries formerly a part of the Ottoman Empire and detached from it on
July&#160;24, l923, provided such preferences are approved under paragraph 5
The authentic text erroneously reads "subparagraph 5 (a)".
 of Article XXV, which shall be applied in this respect in the light of
paragraph 1 of Article XXIX.<p>4.    The margin of preference* on any product
in respect of which a preference is permitted under paragraph 2 of this
Article but is not specifically set forth as a maximum margin of preference
in the appropriate Schedule annexed to this Agreement shall not exceed:<p>
(<i>a</i>)    in respect of duties or charges on any product described in
such Schedule, the difference between the most-favored-nation and
preferential rates provided for therein; if no preferential rate is provided
for, the preferential rate shall for the purposes of this paragraph be taken
to be that in force on April 10, l947, and, if no most-favored-nation rate
is provided for, the margin shall not exceed the difference between the
most-favored-nation and preferential rates existing on April 10, 1947;<p>
(<i>b</i>)    in respect of duties or charges on any product not described in the appropriate Schedule, the
difference between the most-favored-nation and preferential rates existing
on April 10, 1947.<p> In the case of the contracting parties named in Annex
G, the date of April 10, 1947, referred to in subparagraph (<i>a</i>) and
(<i>b</i>) of this paragraph shall be replaced by the respective dates set
forth in that Annex.<p>

<h4>
Article II </h4>

<h4>
Schedules of Concessions </h4>


1.    (<i>a</i>)    Each contracting party shall accord to the commerce of
the other contracting parties treatment no less favorable than that provided
for in the appropriate Part of the appropriate Schedule annexed to this
Agreement.<p> (<i>b</i>)    The products described in Part I of the Schedule
    relating to any contracting party, which are the products of territories
of other contracting parties, shall, on their importation into the territory
to which the Schedule relates, and subject to the terms, conditions or
qualifications set forth in that Schedule, be exempt from ordinary customs
duties in excess of those set forth and provided therein. Such products shall
also be exempt from all other duties or charges of any kind imposed on or in
connection with the importation in excess of those imposed on the date of
this Agreement or those directly and mandatorily required to be imposed
thereafter by legislation in force in the importing territory on that
date.<p>    (<i>c</i>)    The products described in Part II of the Schedule
relating to any contracting party which are the products of territories
entitled under Article I to receive preferential treatment upon importation
into the territory to which the Schedule relates shall, on their importation
into such territory, and subject to the terms, conditions or qualifications
set forth in that Schedule, be exempt from ordinary customs duties in excess
of those set forth and provided for in Part II of that Schedule. Such
products shall also be exempt from all other duties or charges of any kind
imposed on or in connection with importation in excess of those imposed on
the date of this Agreement or those directly or mandatorily required to be
imposed thereafter by legislation in force in the importing territory on that
date. Nothing in this Article shall prevent any contracting party from
maintaining its requirements existing on the date of this Agreement as to the
eligibility of goods for entry at preferential rates of duty.<p>2.    Nothing
in this Article shall prevent any contracting party from imposing at any time
on the importation of any product:<p> (<i>a</i>)    a charge equivalent to an
internal tax imposed consistently with the provisions of paragraph 2 of
Article III* in respect of the like domestic product or in respect of an
article from which the imported product has been manufactured or produced in
whole or in part;<p> (<i>b</i>)    any anti-dumping or countervailing duty
applied consistently with the provisions of Article VI;*<p> (<i>c</i>)
fees or other charges commensurate with the cost of services rendered.<p> 3.
No contracting party shall alter its method of determining dutiable value or
of converting currencies so as to impair the value of any of the concessions
provided for in the appropriate Schedule annexed to this Agreement.<p>4.
If any contracting party establishes, maintains or authorizes, formally or in
effect, a monopoly of the importation of any product described in the
appropriate Schedule annexed to this Agreement, such monopoly shall not,
except as provided for in that Schedule or as otherwise agreed between the
parties which initially negotiated the concession, operate so as to afford
protection on the average in excess of the amount of protection provided for
in that Schedule. The provisions of this paragraph shall not limit the use
by contracting parties of any form of assistance to domestic producers
permitted by other provisions of this Agreement.*<p>5.    If any contracting
party considers that a product is not receiving from another contracting
party the treatment which the first contracting party believes to have been
contemplated by a concession provided for in the appropriate Schedule annexed
to this Agreement, it shall bring the matter directly to the attention of the
other contracting party. If the latter agrees that the treatment contemplated
was that claimed by the first contracting party, but declares that such
treatment cannot be accorded because a court or other proper authority has
ruled to the effect that the product involved cannot be classified under the
tariff laws of such contracting party so as to permit the treatment
contemplated in this Agreement, the two contracting parties, together with
any other contracting parties substantially interested, shall enter promptly
into further negotiations with a view to a compensatory adjustment of the
matter.<p>6.    (<i>a</i>)    The specific duties and charges included in the
Schedules relating to contracting parties members of the International
Monetary Fund, and margins of preference in specific duties and charges
maintained by such contracting parties, are expressed in the appropriate
currency at the par value accepted or provisionally recognized by the Fund at
the date of this Agreement. Accordingly, in case this par value is reduced
consistently with the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary
Fund by more than twenty per centum, such specific duties and charges and
margins of preference may be adjusted to take account of such reduction;
<i>provided </i>that the CONTRACTING PARTIES (<i>i.e</i>., the contracting
parties acting jointly as provided for in Article XXV) concur that such
adjustments will not impair the value of the concessions provided for in the
appropriate Schedule or elsewhere in this Agreement, due account being taken
of all factors which may influence the need for, or urgency of, such
adjustments.<p>    (<i>b</i>)    Similar provisions shall apply to any
contracting party not a member of the Fund, as from the date on which such
contracting party becomes a member of the Fund or enters into a special
exchange agreement in pursuance of Article&#160;XV.<p> 7.    The Schedules
annexed to this Agreement are hereby made an integral part of Part I of this
Agreement.<p>

<h3>
PART II </h3>

<h4>
Article III* </h4>

<h4>
National Treatment on Internal Taxation and Regulation </h4>


1.    The contracting parties recognize that internal taxes and other
internal charges, and laws, regulations and requirements affecting the
internal sale, offering for sale, purchase, transportation, distribution or
use of products, and internal quantitative regulations requiring the
mixture, processing or use of products in specified amounts or proportions,
should not be applied to imported or domestic products so as to afford
protection to domestic production.*<p>
2.    The products of the territory of any contracting party imported into
the territory of any other contracting party shall not be subject, directly
or indirectly, to internal taxes or other internal charges of any kind in
excess of those applied, directly or indirectly, to like domestic products.
Moreover, no contracting party shall otherwise apply internal taxes or other
internal charges to imported or domestic products in a manner contrary to
the principles set forth in paragraph&#160;1.*<p>3.    With respect to any
existing internal tax which is inconsistent with the provisions of paragraph
2, but which is specifically authorized under a trade agreement, in force on
April 10, l947, in which the import duty on the taxed product is bound
against increase, the contracting party imposing the tax shall be free to
postpone the application of the provisions of paragraph 2 to such tax until
such time as it can obtain release from the obligations of such trade
agreement in order to permit the increase of such duty to the extent
necessary to compensate for the elimination of the protective element of the
tax.<p>4.    The products of the territory of any contracting party imported
into the territory of any other contracting party shall be accorded treatment
no less favorable than that accorded to like products of national origin in
respect of all laws, regulations and requirements affecting their internal
sale, offering for sale, purchase, transportation, distribution or use. The
provisions of this paragraph shall not prevent the application of
differential internal transportation charges which are based exclusively on
the economic operation of the means of transport and not on the nationality
of the product.<p>5.    No contracting party shall establish or maintain any
internal quantitative regulation relating to the mixture, processing or use
of products in specified amounts or proportions which requires, directly or
indirectly, that any specified amount or proportion of any product which is
the subject of the regulation must be supplied from domestic sources.
Moreover, no contracting party shall otherwise apply internal quantitative
regulations in a manner contrary to the principles set forth in paragraph
1.*<p>6.    The provisions of paragraph 5 shall not apply to any internal
quantitative regulation in force in the territory of any contracting party on
July 1, 1939, April 10, 1947, or March 24, l948, at the option of that
contracting party; <i>Provided</i> that any such regulation which is contrary to the provisions of paragraph 5 shall
not be modified to the detriment of imports and shall be treated as a
customs duty for the purpose of negotiation.<p>7.    No internal quantitative
regulation relating to the mixture, processing or use of products in
specified amounts or proportions shall be applied in such a manner as to
allocate any such amount or proportion among external sources of supply.<p>8.
(<i>a</i>)    The provisions of this Article shall not apply to laws,
regulations or requirements governing the procurement by governmental
agencies of products purchased for governmental purposes and not with a view
to commercial resale or with a view to use in the production of goods for
commercial sale.<p>    (<i>b</i>)    The provisions of this Article shall not
prevent the payment of subsidies exclusively to domestic producers, including
payments to domestic producers derived from the proceeds of internal taxes or
charges applied consistently with the provisions of this Article and
subsidies effected through govern mental purchases of domestic products.<p>9.
The contracting parties recognize that internal maximum price control
measures, even though conforming to the other provisions of this Article, can
have effects prejudicial to the interests of contracting parties supplying
imported products. Accordingly, contracting parties applying such measures
shall take account of the interests of exporting contracting parties with a
view to avoiding to the fullest practicable extent such prejudicial
effects.<p> 10.    The provisions of this Article shall not prevent any
contracting party from establishing or maintaining internal quantitative
regulations relating to exposed cinematographic films and meeting the
requirements of Article IV.<p>

<h4>
Article IV     </h4>

<h4>
Special Provisions relating to Cinematographic Films </h4>


    If any contracting party establishes or maintains internal quantitative
regulations relating to exposed cinematographic films, such regulations shall
take the form of screen quotas which shall conform to the following
requirements:<p> (<i>a</i>)    Screen quotas may require the exhibition of
cinematographic films of national origin during a specified minimum proportion
of the total screen time actually utilized, over a specified period of not
less than one year, in the commercial exhibition of all films of whatever
origin, and shall be computed on the basis of screen time per theatre per
year or the equivalent thereof;<p> (<i>b</i>)    With the exception of screen
time reserved for films of national origin under a screen quota, screen time
including that released by administrative action from screen time reserved
for films of national origin, shall not be allocated formally or in effect
among sources of supply;<p> (<i>c</i>)    Notwithstanding the provisions of
subparagraph (<i>b</i>) of this Article, any contracting party may maintain
screen quotas conforming to the requirements of subparagraph (<i>a</i>) of
this Article which reserve a minimum proportion of screen time for films of a
specified origin other than that of the contracting party imposing such
screen quotas; <i>Provided</i> that no such minimum proportion of screen time
shall be increased above the level in effect on April 10, 1947;<p> (<i>d</i>)
Screen quotas shall be subject to negotiation for their limitation,

Article V </h4>

<h4>
Freedom of Transit </h4>


1.    Goods (including baggage), and also vessels and other means of
transport, shall be deemed to be in transit across the territory of a
contracting party when the passage across such territory, with or without
trans-shipment, warehousing, breaking bulk, or change in the mode of
transport, is only a portion of a complete journey beginning and terminating
beyond the frontier of the contracting party across whose territory the
traffic passes.  Traffic of this nature is termed in this article "traffic in
transit".<p>2.    There shall be freedom of transit through the territory of
each contracting party, via the routes most convenient for international
transit, for traffic in transit to or from the territory of other contracting
parties. No distinction shall be made which is based on the flag of vessels,
the place of origin, departure, entry, exit or destination, or on any
circumstances relating to the ownership of goods, of vessels or of other
means of transport.<p>3.    Any contracting party may require that traffic in
transit through its territory be entered at the proper custom house, but,
except in cases of failure to comply with applicable customs laws and
regulations, such traffic coming from or going to the territory of other
contracting parties shall not be subject to any unnecessary delays or
restrictions and shall be exempt from customs duties and from all transit
duties or other charges imposed in respect of transit, except charges for
transportation or those commensurate with administrative expenses entailed by
transit or with the cost of services rendered.<p>4.    All charges and
regulations imposed by contracting parties on traffic in transit to or from
the territories of other contracting parties shall be reasonable, having
regard to the conditions of the traffic.<p>5.    With respect to all charges,
regulations and formalities in connection with transit, each contracting
party shall accord to traffic in transit to or from the territory of any
other contracting party treatment no less favorable than the treatment
accorded to traffic in transit to or from any third country.*<p>6.    Each
contracting party shall accord to products which have been in transit through
the territory of any other contracting party treatment no less favorable
than that which would have been accorded to such products had they been
transported from their place of origin to their destination without going
through the territory of such other contracting party. Any contracting party
shall, however, be free to maintain its requirements of direct consignment
existing on the date of this Agreement, in respect of any goods in regard to
which such direct consignment is a requisite condition of eligibility for
entry of the goods at preferential rates of duty or has relation to the
contracting party's prescribed method of valuation for duty purposes.<p> 7.
The provisions of this Article shall not apply to the operation of aircraft
in transit, but shall apply to air transit of goods (including baggage).<p>

<h4>
Article VI </h4>

<h4>
Anti-dumping and Countervailing Duties </h4>


1.    The contracting parties recognize that dumping, by which products of
one country are introduced into the commerce of another country at less than
the normal value of the products, is to be condemned if it causes or
threatens material injury to an established industry in the territory of a
contracting party or materially retards the establishment of a domestic
industry. For the purposes of this Article, a product is to be considered as
being introduced into the commerce of an importing country at less than its
normal value, if the price of the product exported from one country to
another<p> (<i>a</i>)    is less than the comparable price, in the ordinary
course of trade, for the like product when destined for consumption in the
exporting country, or,<p> (<i>b</i>)    in the absence of such domestic
price, is less than either<p> (i)    the highest comparable price for the
like product for export to any third country in the ordinary course of trade,
or<p> (ii)    the cost of production of the product in the country of origin
plus a reasonable addition for selling cost and profit.<p> Due allowance
shall be made in each case for differences in conditions and terms of sale,
for differences in taxation, and for other differences affecting price
comparability.*<p>2.    In order to offset or prevent dumping, a contracting
party may levy on any dumped product an anti-dumping duty not greater in
amount than the margin of dumping in respect of such product. For the
purposes of this Article, the margin of dumping is the price difference
determined in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1.*<p>3.    No
countervailing duty shall be levied on any product of the territory of any
contracting party imported into the territory of another contracting party in
excess of an amount equal to the estimated bounty or subsidy determined to
have been granted, directly or indirectly, on the manufacture, production or
export of such product in the country of origin or exportation, including any
special subsidy to the transportation of a particular product. The term
"countervailing duty" shall be understood to mean a special duty levied for
the purpose of offsetting any bounty or subsidy bestowed, directly, or
indirectly, upon the manufacture, production or export of any
merchandise.*<p>4.    No product of the territory of any contracting party
imported into the territory of any other contracting party shall be subject
to anti-dumping or countervailing duty by reason of the exemption of such
product from duties or taxes borne by the like product when destined for
consumption in the country of origin or exportation, or by reason of the
refund of such duties or taxes.<p>5.    No product of the territory of any
contracting party imported into the territory of any other contracting party
shall be subject to both anti-dumping and countervailing duties to compensate
for the same situation of dumping or export subsidization.<p>6.    (<i>a</i>)
No contracting party shall levy any anti-dumping or countervailing duty on
the importation of any product of the territory of another contracting party
unless it determines that the effect of the dumping or subsidization, as the
case may be, is such as to cause or threaten material injury to an
established domestic industry, or is such as to retard materially the
establishment of a domestic industry.<p>    (<i>b</i>)    The CONTRACTING
PARTIES may waive the requirement of subparagraph (<i>a</i>) of this
paragraph so as to permit a contracting party to levy an anti-dumping or
countervailing duty on the importation of any product for the purpose of
offsetting dumping or subsidization which causes or threatens material injury
to an industry in the territory of another contracting party exporting the
product concerned to the territory of the importing contracting party. The
CONTRACTING PARTIES shall waive the requirements of subparagraph (<i>a</i>)
of this paragraph, so as to permit the levying of a countervailing duty, in
cases in which they find that a subsidy is causing or threatening material
injury to an industry in the territory of another contracting party exporting
the product concerned to the territory of the importing contracting
party.*<p>    (<i>c</i>)    In exceptional circumstances, however, where
delay might cause damage which would be difficult to repair, a contracting
party may levy a countervailing duty for the purpose referred to in
subparagraph (<i>b</i>) of this paragraph without the prior approval of the
CONTRACTING PARTIES; <i>Provided </i>that such action shall be reported
immediately to the CONTRACTING PARTIES and that the countervailing duty shall
be withdrawn promptly if the CONTRACTING PARTIES disapprove.<p>7.    A system
for the stabilization of the domestic price or of the return to domestic
producers of a primary commodity, independently of the movements of export
prices, which results at times in the sale of the commodity for export at a
price lower than the comparable price charged for the like commodity to
buyers in the domestic market, shall be presumed not to result in material
injury within the meaning of paragraph 6 if it is determined by consultation
among the contracting parties substantially interested in the commodity
concerned that:<p> (<i>a</i>)    the system has also resulted in the sale of
the commodity for export at a price higher than the comparable price charged
for the like commodity to buyers in the domestic market, and<p> (<i>b</i>)
the system is so operated, either because of the effective regulation of
production, or otherwise, as not to stimulate exports unduly or otherwise
seriously prejudice the interests of other contracting parties. <p>

<h4>
Article VII     </h4>

<h4>
Valuation for Customs Purposes </h4>


1.    The contracting parties recognize the validity of the general
principles of valuation set forth in the following paragraphs of this
Article, and they undertake to give effect to such principles, in respect of
all products subject to duties or other charges* or restrictions on
importation and exportation based upon or regulated in any manner by value.
Moreover, they shall, upon a request by another contracting party review the
operation of any of their laws or regulations relating to value for customs
purposes in the light of these principles. The CONTRACTING PARTIES may
request from contracting parties reports on steps taken by them in pursuance
of the provisions of this Article.<p> 2.    (<i>a</i>)    The value for
customs purposes of imported merchandise should be based on the actual value
of the imported merchandise on which duty is assessed, or of like
merchandise, and should not be based on the value of merchandise of national
origin or on arbitrary or fictitious values.*<p>    (<i>b</i>)    "Actual
value" should be the price at which, at a time and place determined by the
legislation of the country of importation, such or like merchandise is sold
or offered for sale in the ordinary course of trade under fully competitive
conditions. To the extent to which the price of such or like merchandise is
governed by the quantity in a particular transaction, the price to be
considered should uniformly be related to either (i) comparable quantities,
or (ii) quantities not less favorable to importers than those in which the
greater volume of the merchandise is sold in the trade between the countries
of exportation and importation.*<p>    (<i>c</i>)    When the actual value is
not ascertainable in accordance with subparagraph (<i>b</i>) of this
paragraph, the value for customs purposes should be based on the nearest
ascertainable equivalent of such value.*<p>3.    The value for customs
purposes of any imported product should not include the amount of any
internal tax, applicable within the country of origin or export, from which
the imported product has been exempted or has been or will be relieved by
means of refund.<p>4.    (<i>a</i>)    Except as otherwise provided for in
this paragraph, where it is necessary for the purposes of paragraph 2 of this
Article for a contracting party to convert into its own currency a price
expressed in the currency of another country, the conversion rate of exchange
to be used shall be based, for each currency involved, on the par value as
established pursuant to the Articles of Agreement of the International
Monetary Fund or on the rate of exchange recognized by the Fund, or on the
par value established in accordance with a special exchange agreement entered
into pursuant to Article XV of this Agreement.<p>    (<i>b</i>)    Where no
such established par value and no such recognized rate of exchange exist,
the conversion rate shall reflect effectively the current value of such
currency in commercial transactions.<p>    (<i>c</i>)    The CONTRACTING
PARTIES, in agreement with the International Monetary Fund, shall formulate
rules governing the conversion by contracting parties of any foreign currency
in respect of which multiple rates of exchange are maintained consistently
with the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund. Any
contracting party may apply such rules in respect of such foreign currencies
for the purposes of paragraph 2 of this Article as an alternative to the use
of par values. Until such rules are adopted by the Contracting Parties, any
contracting party may employ, in respect of any such foreign currency, rules
of conversion for the purposes of paragraph 2 of this Article which are
designed to reflect effectively the value of such foreign currency in
commercial transactions.<p>    (<i>d</i>)    Nothing in this paragraph shall
be construed to require any contracting party to alter the method of
converting currencies for customs purposes which is applicable in its
territory on the date of this Agreement, if such alteration would have the
effect of increasing generally the amounts of duty payable.<p> 5.    The
bases and methods for determining the value of products subject to duties or
other charges or restrictions based upon or regulated in any manner by value
should be stable and should be given sufficient publicity to enable traders
to estimate, with a reasonable degree of certainty, the value for customs
purposes.<p>

<h4>
Article VIII </h4>

<h4>
Fees and Formalities connected with Importation and Exportation* </h4>


1.    (<i>a</i>)    All fees and charges of whatever character (other than
import and export duties and other than taxes within the purview of Article
III) imposed by contracting parties on or in connection with importation or
exportation shall be limited in amount to the approximate cost of services
rendered and shall not represent an indirect protection to domestic products
or a taxation of imports or exports for fiscal purposes.<p> (<i>b</i>)    The
    contracting parties recognize the need for reducing the number and
    diversity of fees and charges referred to in subparagraph (<i>a</i>).<p>
(<i>c</i>)    The contracting parties also recognize the need for minimizing
the incidence and complexity of import and export formalities and for
decreasing and simplifying import and export documentation
requirements.*<p>2.    A contracting party shall, upon request by another
contracting party or by the CONTRACTING PARTIES, review the operation of its
laws and regulations in the light of the provisions of this Article.<p>3.
No contracting party shall impose substantial penalties for minor breaches of
customs regulations or procedural requirements. In particular, no penalty in
respect of any omission or mistake in customs documentation which is easily
rectifiable and obviously made without fraudulent intent or gross negligence
shall be greater than necessary to serve merely as a warning.<p>4.    The
provisions of this Article shall extend to fees, charges, formalities and
requirements imposed by governmental authorities in connection with
importation and exportation, including those relating to:<p> (<i>a</i>)
consular transactions, such as consular invoices and certificates;<p>
(<i>b</i>)    quantitative restrictions;<p>
(<i>c</i>)    licensing;<p>
(<i>d</i>)    exchange control;<p>
(<i>e</i>)    statistical services;<p>
(<i>f</i>)    documents, documentation and certification;<p>
(<i>g</i>)    analysis and inspection; and<p>
(<i>h</i>)    quarantine, sanitation and fumigation.<p>

<h4>
Article IX </h4>

<h4>
Marks of Origin </h4>


1.    Each contracting party shall accord to the products of the territories
of other contracting parties treatment with regard to marking requirements no
less favorable than the treatment accorded to like products of any third
country.<p> 2.    The contracting parties recognize that, in adopting and
enforcing laws and regulations relating to marks of origin, the difficulties
and inconveniences which such measures may cause to the commerce and industry
of exporting countries should be reduced to a minimum, due regard being had
to the necessity of protecting consumers against fraudulent or misleading
indications.<p>3.    Whenever it is administratively practicable to do so,
contracting parties should permit required marks of origin to be affixed at
the time of importation.<p>4.    The laws and regulations of contracting
parties relating to the marking of imported products shall be such as to
permit compliance without seriously damaging the products, or materially
reducing their value, or unreasonably increasing their cost.<p>5.    As a
general rule, no special duty or penalty should be imposed by any contracting
party for failure to comply with marking requirements prior to importation
unless corrective marking is unreasonably delayed or deceptive marks have
been affixed or the required marking has been intentionally omitted.<p> 6.
The contracting parties shall co-operate with each other with a view to
preventing the use of trade names in such manner as to misrepresent the true
origin of a product, to the detriment of such distinctive regional or
geographical names of products of the territory of a contracting party as are
protected by its legislation. Each contracting party shall accord full and
sympathetic consideration to such requests or representations as may be made
by any other contracting party regarding the application of the undertaking
set forth in the preceding sentence to names of products which have been
communicated to it by the other contracting party.<p>

<h4>
Article X </h4>

<h4>
Publication and Administration of Trade Regulations </h4>


1.    Laws, regulations, judicial decisions and administrative rulings of
general application, made effective by any contracting party, pertaining to
the classification or the valuation of products for customs purposes, or to
rates of duty, taxes or other charges, or to requirements, restrictions or
prohibitions on imports or exports or on the transfer of payments therefor,
or affecting their sale, distribution, transportation, insurance, warehousing
inspection, exhibition, processing, mixing or other use, shall be published
promptly in such a manner as to enable governments and traders to become
acquainted with them. Agreements affecting international trade policy which
are in force between the government or a governmental agency of any
contracting party and the government or governmental agency of any other
contracting party shall also be published. The provisions of this paragraph
shall not require any contracting party to disclose confidential information
which would impede law enforcement or otherwise be contrary to the public
interest or would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of particular
enterprises, public or private.<p> 2.    No measure of general application
taken by any contracting party effecting an advance in a rate of duty or
other charge on imports under an established and uniform practice, or
imposing a new or more burdensome requirement, restriction or prohibition on
imports, or on the transfer of payments therefor, shall be enforced before
such measure has been officially published.<p>3.    (<i>a</i>)    Each
contracting party shall administer in a uniform, impartial and reasonable
manner all its laws, regulations, decisions and rulings of the kind described
in paragraph 1 of this Article.<p>    (<i>b</i>)    Each contracting party
shall maintain, or institute as soon as practicable, judicial, arbitral or
administrative tribunals or procedures for the purpose, <i>inter alia</i>, of the prompt review and correction of
administrative action relating to customs matters. Such tribunals or
procedures shall be independent of the agencies entrusted with administrative
enforcement and their decisions shall be implemented by, and shall govern the
practice of, such agencies unless an appeal is lodged with a court or
tribunal of superior jurisdiction within the time prescribed for appeals to
be lodged by importers; <i>Provided</i> that the central administration of
such agency may take steps to obtain a review of the matter in another
proceeding if there is good cause to believe that the decision is
inconsistent with established principles of law or the actual facts.<p>
    (<i>c</i>)    The provisions of subparagraph (<i>b</i>) of this paragraph shall not require the elimination or
substitution of procedures in force in the territory of a contracting party
    on the date of this Agreement which in fact provide for an objective and
impartial review of administrative action even though such procedures are not
fully or formally independent of the agencies entrusted with administrative
enforcement. Any contracting party employing such procedures shall, upon
request, furnish the CONTRACTING PARTIES with full information thereon in
order that they may determine whether such procedures conform to the
requirements of this subparagraph.<p>

<h4>
Article XI* </h4>

<h4>
General Elimination of Quantitative Restrictions </h4>


1.    No prohibitions or restrictions other than duties, taxes or other
charges, whether made effective through quotas, import or export licenses or
other measures, shall be instituted or maintained by any contracting party on
the importation of any product of the territory of any other contracting
party or on the exportation or sale for export of any product destined for
the territory of any other contracting party.<p> 2.    The provisions of
paragraph 1 of this Article shall not extend to the following:<p> (<i>a</i>)
Export prohibitions or restrictions temporarily applied to prevent or relieve
critical shortages of foodstuffs or other products essential to the exporting
contracting party;<p> (<i>b</i>)    Import and export prohibitions or
restrictions necessary to the application of standards or regulations for the
classification, grading or marketing of commodities in international
trade;<p> (<i>c</i>)    Import restrictions on any agricultural or fisheries
product, imported in any form,* necessary to the enforcement of governmental
measures which operate:<p> (i)    to restrict the quantities of the like
domestic product permitted to be marketed or produced, or, if there is no
substantial domestic production of the like product, of a domestic product
for which the imported product can be directly substituted; or<p> (ii)    to
remove a temporary surplus of the like domestic product, or, if there is no
substantial domestic production of the like product, of a domestic product
for which the imported product can be directly substituted, by making the
surplus available to certain groups of domestic consumers free of charge or
at prices below the current market level; or<p> (iii)    to restrict the
quantities permitted to be produced of any animal product the production of
which is directly dependent, wholly or mainly, on the imported commodity, if
the domestic production of that commodity is relatively negligible.<p>
Any contracting party applying restrictions on the importation of any
product pursuant to subparagraph (<i>c</i>) of this paragraph shall give
public notice of the total quantity or value of the product permitted to be
imported during a specified future period and of any change in such quantity
or value. Moreover, any restrictions applied under (i) above shall not be
such as will reduce the total of imports relative to the total of domestic
production, as compared with the proportion which might reasonably be
expected to rule between the two in the absence of restrictions. In
determining this proportion, the contracting party shall pay due regard to
the proportion prevailing during a previous representative period and to any
special factors* which may have affected or may be affecting the trade in the
product concerned.<p>

<h4>
Article XII* </h4>

<h4>
Restrictions to Safeguard the Balance of Payments </h4>


1.    Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 1 of Article XI, any
contracting party, in order to safeguard its external financial position and
its balance of payments, may restrict the quantity or value of merchandise
permitted to be imported, subject to the provisions of the following
paragraphs of this Article.<p>2.    (<i>a</i>)    Import restrictions
instituted, maintained or intensified by a contracting party under this
Article shall not exceed those necessary:<p>
(i)    to forestall the imminent threat of, or to stop, a serious decline in
its monetary reserves, or<p> (ii)    in the case of a contracting party with
very low monetary reserves, to achieve a reasonable rate of increase in its
reserves.<p> Due regard shall be paid in either case to any special factors
which may be affecting the reserves of such contracting party or its need for
reserves, including, where special external credits or other resources are
available to it, the need to provide for the appropriate use of such credits
or resources.<p>    (<i>b</i>)    Contracting parties applying restrictions
under sub-paragraph (<i>a</i>) of this paragraph shall progressively relax
them as such conditions improve, maintaining them only to the extent that the
conditions specified in that sub-paragraph still justify their application.
They shall eliminate the restrictions when conditions would no longer justify
their institution or maintenance under that subparagraph.<p>3.    (<i>a</i>)
Contracting parties undertake, in carrying out their domestic policies, to
pay due regard to the need for maintaining or restoring equilibrium in their
balance of payments on a sound and lasting basis and to the desirability of
avoiding an uneconomic employment of productive resources. They recognize
that, in order to achieve these ends, it is desirable so far as possible to
adopt measures which expand rather than contract international trade.<p>
(<i>b</i>)    Contracting parties applying restrictions under this Article
may determine the incidence of the restrictions on imports of different
products or classes of products in such a way as to give priority to the
importation of those products which are more essential.<p>    (<i>c</i>)
Contracting parties applying restrictions under this Article undertake:<p>
(i)    to avoid unnecessary damage to the commercial or economic interests
of any other contracting party;*<p> (ii)    not to apply restrictions so as
to prevent unreasonably the importation of any description of goods in
minimum commercial quantities the exclusion of which would impair regular
channels of trade; and<p> (iii)    not to apply restrictions which would
prevent the importations of commercial samples or prevent compliance with
patent, trade mark, copyright, or similar procedures.<p> (<i>d</i>)    The
    contracting parties recognize that, as a result of domestic policies
    directed towards the achievement and maintenance of full and productive
employment or towards the development of economic resources, a contracting
party may experience a high level of demand for imports involving a threat to
its monetary reserves of the sort referred to in paragraph 2 (<i>a</i>) of
this Article. Accordingly, a contracting party otherwise complying with the
provisions of this Article shall not be required to withdraw or modify
restrictions on the ground that a change in those policies would render
unnecessary restrictions which it is applying under this Article.<p>4.
(<i>a</i>)    Any contracting party applying new restrictions or raising the
general level of its existing restrictions by a substantial intensification
of the measures applied under this Article shall immediately after
instituting or intensifying such restrictions (or, in circumstances in which
prior consultation is practicable, before doing so) consult with the
CONTRACTING PARTIES as to the nature of its balance of payments difficulties,
alternative corrective measures which may be available, and the possible
effect of the restrictions on the economies of other contracting parties.<p>
(<i>b</i>)    On a date to be determined by them,* the CONTRACTING PARTIES
shall review all restrictions still applied under this Article on that date.
Beginning one year after that date, contracting parties applying import
restrictions under this Article shall enter into consultations of the type
provided for in subparagraph (<i>a</i>) of this paragraph with the
CONTRACTING PARTIES annually.<p>    (<i>c</i>)    (i)    If, in the course of
consultations with a contracting party under subparagraph (<i>a</i>) or
(<i>b</i>) above, the CONTRACTING PARTIES find that the restrictions are not
consistent with provisions of this Article or with those of Article XIII
(subject to the provisions of Article XIV), they shall indicate the nature of
the inconsistency and may advise that the restrictions be suitably
modified.<p>        (ii)    If, however, as a result of the consultations,
the CONTRACTING PARTIES determine that the restrictions are being applied in
a manner involving an inconsistency of a serious nature with the provisions
of this Article or with those of Article XIII (subject to the provisions of
Article XIV) and that damage to the trade of any contracting party is caused
or threatened thereby, they shall so inform the contracting party applying
the restrictions and shall make appropriate recommendations for securing
conformity with such provisions within the specified period of time. If such
contracting party does not comply with these recommendations within the
specified period, the CONTRACTING PARTIES may release any contracting party
the trade of which is adversely affected by the restrictions from such
obligations under this Agreement towards the contracting party applying the
restrictions as they determine to be appropriate in the circumstances.<p>
(<i>d</i>)    The CONTRACTING PARTIES shall invite any contracting party
which is applying restrictions under this Article to enter into consultations
with them at the request of any contracting party which can establish a
<i>prima facie</i> case that the restrictions are inconsistent with the
provisions of this Article or with those of Article XIII (subject to the
provisions of Article XIV) and that its trade is adversely affected thereby.
However, no such invitation shall be issued unless the CONTRACTING PARTIES
have ascertained that direct discussions between the contracting parties
concerned have not been successful. If, as a result of the consultations with
the CONTRACTING PARTIES, no agreement is reached and they determine that the
restrictions are being applied inconsistently with such provisions, and that
damage to the trade of the contracting party initiating the procedure is
caused or threatened thereby, they shall recommend the withdrawal or
modification of the restrictions. If the restrictions are not withdrawn or
modified within such time as the CONTRACTING PARTIES may prescribe, they may
release the contracting party initiating the procedure from such obligations
under this Agreement towards the contracting party applying the restrictions
as they determine to be appropriate in the circumstances.<p>    (<i>e</i>)
In proceeding under this paragraph, the  CONTRACTING PARTIES shall have due
regard to any special external factors adversely affecting the export trade
of the contracting party applying the restrictions.*<p>    (<i>f</i>)
Determinations under this paragraph shall be rendered expeditiously and, if
possible, within sixty days of the initiation of the consultations.<p> 5.
If there is a persistent and widespread application of import restrictions
under this Article, indicating the existence of a general disequilibrium
which is restricting international trade, the CONTRACTING PARTIES shall
initiate discussions to consider whether other measures might be taken,
either by those contracting parties the balance of payments of which are
under pressure or by those the balance of payments of which are tending to be
exceptionally favorable, or by any appropriate inter-governmental
organization, to remove the underlying causes of the disequilibrium. On the
invitation of the CONTRACTING PARTIES, contracting parties shall participate
in such discussions.<p>

<h4>
    Article XIII* </h4>

<h4>
Non-discriminatory Administration of Quantitative Restrictions </h4>


1.    No prohibition or restriction shall be applied by any contracting party on the importation of any
product of the territory of any other contracting party or on the
exportation of any product destined for the territory of any other
contracting party, unless the importation of the like product of all third
countries or the exportation of the like product to all third countries is
similarly prohibited or restricted.<p> 2.    In applying import restrictions
to any product, contracting parties shall aim at a distribution of trade in
such product approaching as closely as possible the shares which the various
contracting parties might be expected to obtain in the absence of such
restrictions and to this end shall observe the following provisions:<p>
    (<i>a</i>)    Wherever practicable, quotas representing the total amount
    of permitted imports (whether allocated among supplying countries or not)
shall be fixed, and notice given of their amount in accordance with
paragraph&#160;3&#160;(<i>b</i>) of this Article;<p> (<i>b</i>)    In cases
in which quotas are not practicable, the restrictions may be applied by means
of import licenses or permits without a quota;<p> (<i>c</i>)     Contracting
parties shall not, except for purposes of operating quotas allocated in
accordance with subparagraph (<i>d</i>) of this paragraph, require that
import licenses or permits be utilized for the importation of the product
concerned from a particular country or source;<p> (<i>d</i>)     In cases in
which a quota is allocated among supplying countries the contracting party
applying the restrictions may seek agreement with respect to the allocation
of shares in the quota with all other contracting parties having a
substantial interest in supplying the product concerned. In cases in which
this method is not reasonably practicable, the contracting party concerned
shall allot to contracting parties having a substantial interest in supplying
the product shares based upon the proportions, supplied by such contracting
parties during a previous representative period, of the total quantity or
value of imports of the product, due account being taken of any special
factors which may have affected or may be affecting the trade in the product.
No conditions or formalities shall be imposed which would prevent any
contracting party from utilizing fully the share of any such total quantity
or value which has been allotted to it, subject to importation being made
within any prescribed period to which the quota may relate.*<p> 3.
(<i>a</i>)    In cases in which import licenses are issued in connection with
import restrictions, the contracting party applying the restrictions shall
provide, upon the request of any contracting party having an interest in the
trade in the product concerned, all relevant information concerning the
administration of the restrictions, the import licenses granted over a recent
period and the distribution of such licenses among supplying countries;
<i>Provided</i> that there shall be no obligation to supply information as to
the names of importing or supplying enterprises.<p>    (<i>b</i>)    In the
case of import restrictions involving the fixing of quotas, the contracting
party applying the restrictions shall give public notice of the total
quantity or value of the product or products which will be permitted to be
imported during a specified future period and of any change in such quantity
or value.  Any supplies of the product in question which were <i>en route
</i>at the time at which public notice was given shall not be excluded from
entry; <i>Provided </i>that they may be counted so far as practicable,
against the quantity permitted to be imported in the period in question, and
also, where necessary, against the quantities permitted to be imported in
the next following period or periods; and <i>Provided </i>further that if any
contracting party customarily exempts from such restrictions products entered
for consumption or withdrawn from warehouse for consumption during a period
of thirty days after the day of such public notice, such practice shall be
considered full compliance with this subparagraph.<p>    (<i>c</i>)    In the
case of quotas allocated among supplying countries, the contracting party
applying the restrictions shall promptly inform all other contracting parties
having an interest in supplying the product concerned of the shares in the
quota currently allocated, by quantity or value, to the various supplying
countries and shall give public notice thereof.<p>4.    With regard to
restrictions applied in accordance with paragraph 2 (<i>d</i>) of this
Article or under paragraph 2 (<i>c</i>) of Article XI, the selection of a
representative period for any product and the appraisal of any special
factors* affecting the trade in the product shall be made initially by the
contracting party applying the restriction; <i>Provided </i>that such
contracting party shall, upon the request of any other contracting party
having a substantial interest in supplying that product or upon the request
of the CONTRACTING PARTIES, consult promptly with the other contracting party
or the CONTRACTING PARTIES regarding the need for an adjustment of the
proportion determined or of the base period selected, or for the reappraisal
of the special factors involved, or for the elimination of conditions,
formalities or any other provisions established unilaterally relating to the
allocation of an adequate quota or its unrestricted utilization.<p> 5.    The
provisions of this Article shall apply to any tariff quota instituted or
maintained by any contracting party, and, in so far as applicable, the
principles of this Article shall also extend to export restrictions.<p>

<h4>
Article XIV* </h4>

<h4>
Exceptions to the Rule of Non-discrimination </h4>


1.    A contracting party which applies restrictions under Article XII or
under Section B of Article XVIII may, in the application of such
restrictions, deviate from the provisions of Article XIII in a manner having
equivalent effect to restrictions on payments and transfers for current
international transactions which that contracting party may at that time
apply under Article VIII or XIV of the Articles of Agreement of the
International Monetary Fund, or under analogous provisions of a special
exchange agreement entered into pursuant to paragraph&#160;6 of Article
XV.*<p> 2.    A contracting party which is applying import restrictions under
Article&#160;XII or under Section B of Article XVIII may, with the consent of
the CONTRACTING PARTIES, temporarily deviate from the provisions of Article
XIII in respect of a small part of its external trade where the benefits to
the contracting party or contracting parties concerned substantially outweigh
any injury which may result to the trade of other contracting parties.*<p> 3.
The provisions of Article XIII shall not preclude a group of territories
having a common quota in the International Monetary Fund from applying
against imports from other countries, but not among themselves, restrictions
in accordance with the provisions of Article XII or of Section B of Article
XVIII on condition that such restrictions are in all other respects
consistent with the provisions of Article XIII.<p> 4.    A contracting party
applying import restrictions under Article XII or under Section B of Article
XVIII shall not be precluded by Articles XI to XV or Section B of Article
XVIII of this Agreement from applying measures to direct its exports in such
a manner as to increase its earnings of currencies which it can use without
deviation from the provisions of Article XIII.<p>5.    A contracting party
shall not be precluded by Articles XI to XV, inclusive, or by Section B of
Article XVIII, of this Agreement from applying quantitative restrictions:<p>
(<i>a</i>)    having equivalent effect to exchange restrictions authorized
under Section 3 (<i>b</i>) of Article VII of the Articles of Agreement of the
International Monetary Fund, or<p> (<i>b</i>)     under the preferential
arrangements provided for in Annex A of this Agreement, pending the outcome
of the negotiations referred to therein.<p> <b><i>Article
XV</b></i><b><p></b> <b></b><i>Exchange Arrangements</i><p> 1.    The
CONTRACTING PARTIES shall seek co-operation with the International Monetary
Fund to the end that the CONTRACTING PARTIES and the Fund may pursue a
coordinated policy with regard to exchange questions within the jurisdiction
of the Fund and questions of quantitative restrictions and other trade
measures within the jurisdiction of the CONTRACTING PARTIES.<p>2.    In all
cases in which the CONTRACTING PARTIES are called upon to consider or deal
with problems concerning monetary reserves, balances of payments or foreign
exchange arrangements, they shall consult fully with the International
Monetary Fund. In such consultations, the CONTRACTING PARTIES shall accept
all findings of statistical and other facts presented by the Fund relating to
foreign exchange, monetary reserves and balances of payments, and shall
accept the determination of the Fund as to whether action by a contracting
party in exchange matters is in accordance with the Articles of Agreement of
the International Monetary Fund, or with the terms of a special exchange
agreement between that contracting party and the CONTRACTING PARTIES. The
CONTRACTING PARTIES in reaching their final decision in cases involving the
criteria set forth in paragraph 2 (<i>a</i>) of Article XII or in paragraph 9
of Article&#160;XVIII, shall accept the determination of the Fund as to what
constitutes a serious decline in the contracting party's monetary reserves, a
very low level of its monetary reserves or a reasonable rate of increase in
its monetary reserves, and as to the financial aspects of other matters
covered in consultation in such cases.<p> 3.    The CONTRACTING PARTIES shall
seek agreement with the Fund regarding procedures for consultation under
paragraph 2 of this Article.<p>4.    Contracting parties shall not, by
exchange action, frustrate* the intent of the provisions of this Agreement,
nor, by trade action, the intent of the provisions of the Articles of
Agreement of the International Monetary Fund.<p>5.    If the CONTRACTING
PARTIES consider, at any time, that exchange restrictions on payments and
transfers in connection with imports are being applied by a contracting
party in a manner inconsistent with the exceptions provided for in this
Agreement for quantitative restrictions, they shall report thereon to the
Fund.<p>6.    Any contracting party which is not a member of the Fund shall,
within a time to be determined by the CONTRACTING PARTIES after consultation
with the Fund, become a member of the Fund, or, failing that, enter into a
special exchange agreement with the CONTRACTING PARTIES. A contracting party
which ceases to be a member of the Fund shall forthwith enter into a special
exchange agreement with the CONTRACTING PARTIES. Any special exchange
agreement entered into by a contracting party under this paragraph shall
thereupon become part of its obligations under this Agreement.<p>7.
(<i>a</i>)    A special exchange agreement between a contracting party and
the CONTRACTING PARTIES under paragraph 6 of this Article shall provide to
the satisfaction of the CONTRACTING PARTIES that the objectives of this
Agreement will not be frustrated as a result of action in exchange matters by
the contracting party in question.<p>    (<i>b</i>)    The terms of any such
agreement shall not impose obligations on the contracting party in exchange
matters generally more restrictive than those imposed by the Articles of
Agreement of the International Monetary Fund on members of the Fund.<p>8.
A contracting party which is not a member of the Fund shall furnish such
information within the general scope of section 5 of Article VIII of the
Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund as the CONTRACTING
PARTIES may require in order to carry out their functions under this
Agreement.<p>9.    Nothing in this Agreement shall preclude:<p> (<i>a</i>)
    the use by a contracting party of exchange controls or exchange
    restrictions in accordance with the Articles of Agreement of the
International Monetary Fund or with that contracting party's special exchange
agreement with the CONTRACTING PARTIES, or<p> (<i>b</i>)    the use by a
    contracting party of restrictions or controls in imports or exports, the
    sole effect of which, additional to the effects permitted under Articles
XI, XII, XIII and XIV, is to make effective such exchange controls or
exchange restrictions.<p> <p>

<h4>
Article XVI* </h4>

<h4>
Subsidies </h4>

<h5>
Section A Subsidies in General </h5>


1.    If any contracting party grants or maintains any subsidy, including
any form of income or price support, which operates directly or indirectly to
increase exports of any product from, or to reduce imports of any product
into, its territory, it shall notify the CONTRACTING PARTIES in writing of
the extent and nature of the subsidization, of the estimated effect of the
subsidization on the quantity of the affected product or products imported
into or exported from its territory and of the circumstances making the
subsidization necessary. In any case in which it is determined that serious
prejudice to the interests of any other contracting party is caused or
threatened by any such subsidization, the contracting party granting the
subsidy shall, upon request, discuss with the other contracting party or
parties concerned, or with the CONTRACTING PARTIES, the possibility of
limiting the subsidization.<p>

<h5>
Section B Additional Provisions on Export Subsidies* </h5>


2.    The contracting parties recognize that the granting by a contracting
party of a subsidy on the export of any product may have harmful effects for
other contracting parties, both importing and exporting, may cause undue
disturbance to their normal commercial interests, and may hinder the
achievement of the objectives of this Agreement.<p>3.    Accordingly,
contracting parties should seek to avoid the use of subsidies on the export
of primary products. If, however, a contracting party grants directly or
indirectly any form of subsidy which operates to increase the export of any
primary product from its territory, such subsidy shall not be applied in a
manner which results in that contracting party having more than an equitable
share of world export trade in that product, account being taken of the
shares of the contracting parties in such trade in the product during a
previous representative period, and any special factors which may have
affected or may be affecting such trade in the product.*<p>4.    Further, as
from 1 January 1958 or the earliest practicable date thereafter, contracting
parties shall cease to grant either directly or indirectly any form of
subsidy on the export of any product other than a primary product which
subsidy results in the sale of such product for export at a price lower than
the comparable price charged for the like product to buyers in the domestic
market. Until 31 December 1957 no contracting party shall extend the scope of
any such subsidization beyond that existing on 1 January 1955 by the
introduction of new, or the extension of existing, subsidies.*<p> 5.    The
CONTRACTING PARTIES shall review the operation of the provisions of this
Article from time to time with a view to examining its effectiveness, in the
light of actual experience, in promoting the objectives of this Agreement and
avoiding subsidization seriously prejudicial to the trade or interests of
contracting parties.<p>

<h4>
Article XVII </h4>

<h4>
State Trading Enterprises </h4>


1.*    (<i>a</i>)    Each contracting party undertakes that if it
establishes or maintains a State enterprise, wherever located, or grants to
any enterprise, formally or in effect, exclusive or special privileges,* such
enterprise shall, in its purchases or sales involving either imports or
exports, act in a manner consistent with the general principles of
non-discriminatory treatment prescribed in this Agreement for governmental
measures affecting imports or exports by private traders.<p>
    (<i>b</i>)    The provisions of subparagraph (<i>a</i>) of this
paragraph shall be understood to require that such enterprises shall, having
due regard to the other provisions of this Agreement, make any such purchases
or sales solely in accordance with commercial considerations,* including
price, quality, availability, marketability, transportation and other
conditions of purchase or sale, and shall afford the enterprises of the other
contracting parties adequate opportunity, in accordance with customary
business practice, to compete for participation in such purchases or
sales.<p>    (<i>c</i>)    No contracting party shall prevent any enterprise
(whether or not an enterprise described in subparagraph (<i>a</i>) of this
paragraph) under its jurisdiction from acting in accordance with the
principles of subparagraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) of this paragraph.<p>2.
The provisions of paragraph 1 of this Article shall not apply to imports of
products for immediate or ultimate consumption in governmental use and not
otherwise for resale or use in the production of goods* for sale. With
respect to such imports, each contracting party shall accord to the trade of
the other contracting parties fair and equitable treatment.<p>3.    The
contracting parties recognize that enterprises of the kind described in
paragraph 1 (<i>a</i>) of this Article might be operated so as to create
serious obstacles to trade; thus negotiations on a reciprocal and mutually
advantageous basis designed to limit or reduce such obstacles are of
importance to the expansion of international trade.*<p>4.    (<i>a</i>)
Contracting parties shall notify the CONTRACTING PARTIES of the products
which are imported into or exported from their territories by enterprises of
the kind described in paragraph 1 (<i>a</i>) of this Article.<p>
(<i>b</i>)    A contracting party establishing, maintaining or authorizing an
import monopoly of a product, which is not the subject of a concession under
Article II, shall, on the request of another contracting party having a
substantial trade in the product concerned, inform the CONTRACTING PARTIES of
the import mark-up* on the product during a recent representative period, or,
when it is not possible to do so, of the price charged on the resale of the
product.<p>    (<i>c</i>)    The CONTRACTING PARTIES may, at the request of a
contracting party which has reason to believe that its interest under this
Agreement are being adversely affected by the operations of an enterprise of
the kind described in paragraph 1 (<i>a</i>), request the contracting party
establishing, maintaining or authorizing such enterprise to supply
information about its operations related to the carrying out of the
provisions of this Agreement.<p>
    (<i>d</i>)    The provisions of this paragraph shall not require any
contracting party to disclose confidential information which would impede law
enforcement or otherwise be contrary to the public interest or would
prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of particular enterprises.<p>

<h4>
Article XVIII* </h4>

<h4>
Governmental Assistance to Economic Development </h4>


1.    The contracting parties recognize that the attainment of the
objectives of this Agreement will be facilitated by the progressive
development of their economies, particularly of those contracting parties the
economies of which can only support low standards of living* and are in the
early stages of development.*<p> 2.    The contracting parties recognize
further that it may be necessary for those contracting parties, in order to
implement programs and policies of economic development designed to raise
the general standard of living of their people, to take protective or other
measures affecting imports, and that such measures are justified in so far as
they facilitate the attainment of the objectives of this Agreement. They
agree, therefore, that those contracting parties should enjoy additional
facilities to enable them (<i>a</i>) to maintain sufficient flexibility in
their tariff structure to be able to grant the tariff protection required for
the establishment of a particular industry* and (<i>b</i>) to apply
quantitative restrictions for balance of payments purposes in a manner which
takes full account of the continued high level of demand for imports likely
to be generated by their programs of economic development.<p>3.    The
contracting parties recognize finally that, with those additional facilities
which are provided for in Sections A and B of this Article, the provisions of
this Agreement would normally be sufficient to enable contracting parties to
meet the requirements of their economic development. They agree, however,
that there may be circumstances where no measure consistent with those
provisions is practicable to permit a contracting party in the process of
economic development to grant the governmental assistance required to promote
the establishment of particular industries* with a view to raising the
general standard of living of its people. Special procedures are laid down in
Sections C and D of this Article to deal with those cases.<p>4.    (<i>a</i>)
Consequently, a contracting party, the economy of which can only support low
standards of living* and is in the early stages of development,* shall be
free to deviate temporarily from the provisions of the other Articles of this
Agreement, as provided in Sections A, B and C of this Article.<p>
(<i>b</i>)    A contracting party, the economy of which is in the process of
development, but which does not come within the scope of subparagraph
(<i>a</i>) above, may submit applications to the CONTRACTING PARTIES under
Section D of this Article.<p>5.    The contracting parties recognize that the
export earnings of contracting parties, the economies of which are of the
type described in paragraph 4 (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) above and which
depend on exports of a small number of primary commodities, may be seriously
reduced by a decline in the sale of such commodities.  Accordingly, when the
exports of primary commodities by such a contracting party are seriously
affected by measures taken by another contracting party, it may have resort
to the consultation provisions of Article XXII of this Agreement.<p>6.    The
CONTRACTING PARTIES shall review annually all measures applied pursuant to
the provisions of Sections C and D of this Article.<p> Section A<p> 7.
(<i>a</i>)    If a contracting party coming within the scope of paragraph 4
(<i>a</i>) of this Article considers it desirable, in order to promote the
establishment of a particular industry* with a view to raising the general
standard of living of its people, to modify or withdraw a concession
included in the appropriate Schedule annexed to this Agreement, it shall
notify the CONTRACTING PARTIES to this effect and enter into negotiations
with any contracting party with which such concession was initially
negotiated, and with any other contracting party determined by the
CONTRACTING PARTIES to have a substantial interest therein. If agreement is
reached between such contracting parties concerned, they shall be free to
modify or withdraw concessions under the appropriate Schedules to this
Agreement in order to give effect to such agreement, including any
compensatory adjustments involved.<p> (<i>b</i>)    If agreement is not
    reached within sixty days after the notification provided for in
    subparagraph (<i>a</i>) above, the contracting party which proposes to
    modify or withdraw the concession may refer the matter to the CONTRACTING
PARTIES which shall promptly examine it. If they find that the contracting
party which proposes to modify or withdraw the concession has made every
effort to reach an agreement and that the compensatory adjustment offered by
it is adequate, that contracting party shall be free to modify or withdraw
the concession if, at the same time, it gives effect to the compensatory
adjustment. If the CONTRACTING PARTIES do not find that the compensation
offered by a contracting party proposing to modify or withdraw the concession
is adequate, but find that it has made every reasonable effort to offer
adequate compensation, that contracting party shall be free to proceed with
such modification or withdrawal. If such action is taken, any other
contracting party referred to in subparagraph (<i>a</i>) above shall be free
to modify or withdraw substantially equivalent concessions initially
negotiated with the contracting party which has taken the action.*<p> Section
B<p> 8.    The contracting parties recognize that contracting parties coming
within the scope of paragraph 4 (<i>a</i>) of this Article tend, when they
are in rapid process of development, to experience balance of payments
difficulties arising mainly from efforts to expand their internal markets as
well as from the instability in their terms of trade.<p> 9.    In order to
safeguard its external financial position and to ensure a level of reserves
adequate for the implementation of its program of economic development, a
contracting party coming within the scope of paragraph 4 (<i>a</i>) of this
Article may, subject to the provisions of paragraphs 10 to 12, control the
general level of its imports by restricting the quantity or value of
merchandise permitted to be imported; <i>Provided </i>that the import
restrictions instituted, maintained or intensified shall not exceed those
necessary:<p> (<i>a</i>)    to forestall the threat of, or to stop, a serious
decline in its monetary reserves, or<p> (<i>b</i>)     in the case of a
contracting party with inadequate monetary reserves, to achieve a reasonable
rate of increase in its reserves.<p> Due regard shall be paid in either case
to any special factors which may be affecting the reserves of the contracting
party or its need for reserves, including, where special external credits or
other resources are available to it, the need to provide for the appropriate
use of such credits or resources.<p>10.    In applying these restrictions,
the contracting party may determine their incidence on imports of different
products or classes of products in such a way as to give priority to the
importation of those products which are more essential in the light of its
policy of economic development; <i>Provided </i>that the restrictions are so
applied as to avoid unnecessary damage to the commercial or economic
interests of any other contracting party and not to prevent unreasonably the
importation of any description of goods in minimum commercial quantities the
exclusion of which would impair regular channels of trade; and <i>Provided
</i>further that the restrictions are not so applied as to prevent the
importation of commercial samples or to prevent compliance with patent, trade
mark, copyright or similar procedures.<p>11.    In carrying out its domestic
policies, the contracting party concerned shall pay due regard to the need
for restoring equilibrium in its balance of payments on a sound and lasting
basis and to the desirability of assuring an economic employment of
productive resources. It shall progressively relax any restrictions applied
under this Section as conditions improve, maintaining them only to the extent
necessary under the terms of paragraph 9 of this Article and shall eliminate
them when conditions no longer justify such maintenance; <i>Provided </i>that
no contracting party shall be required to withdraw or modify restrictions on
the ground that a change in its development policy would render unnecessary
the restrictions which it is applying under this Section.*<p>12.
(<i>a</i>)    Any contracting party applying new restrictions or raising the
general level of its existing restrictions by a substantial intensification
of the measures applied under this Section, shall immediately after
instituting or intensifying such restrictions (or, in circumstances in which
prior consultation is practicable, before doing so) consult with the
CONTRACTING PARTIES as to the nature of its balance of payments difficulties,
alternative corrective measures which may be available, and the possible
effect of the restrictions on the economies of other contracting parties.<p>
(<i>b</i>)    On a date to be determined by them* the CONTRACTING PARTIES
shall review all restrictions still applied under this Section on that date.
Beginning two years after that date, contracting parties applying
restrictions under this Section shall enter into consultations of the type
provided for in subparagraph (<i>a</i>) above with the CONTRACTING PARTIES at
intervals of approximately, but not less than, two years according to a
program to be drawn up each year by the CONTRACTING PARTIES; <i>Provided
</i>that no consultation under this subparagraph shall take place within two
years after the conclusion of a consultation of a general nature under any
other provision of this paragraph.<p>    (<i>c</i>)    (i)    If, in the
course of consultations with a contracting party under subparagraph
(<i>a</i>) or (<i>b</i>) of this paragraph, the CONTRACTING PARTIES find that
the restrictions are not consistent with the provisions of this Section or
with those of Article XIII (subject to the provisions of Article XIV), they
shall indicate the nature of the inconsistency and may advise that the
restrictions be suitably modified.<p>        (ii)    If, however, as a result
of the consultations, the CONTRACTING PARTIES determine that the restrictions
are being applied in a manner involving an inconsistency of a serious nature
with the provisions of this Section or with those of Article XIII (subject to
the provisions of Article XIV) and that damage to the trade of any
contracting party is caused or threatened thereby, they shall so inform the
contracting party applying the restrictions and shall make appropriate
recommendations for securing conformity with such provisions within a
specified period. If such contracting party does not comply with these
recommendations within the specified period, the CONTRACTING PARTIES may
release any contracting party the trade of which is adversely affected by the
restrictions from such obligations under this Agreement towards the
contracting party applying the restrictions as they determine to be
appropriate in the circumstances.<p>    (<i>d</i>)    The CONTRACTING PARTIES
shall invite any contracting party which is applying restrictions under this
Section to enter into consultations with them at the request of any
contracting party which can establish a <i>prima facie </i>case that the
restrictions are inconsistent with the provisions of this Section or with
those of Article XIII (subject to the provisions of Article XIV) and that its
trade is adversely affected thereby. However, no such invitation shall be
issued unless the CONTRACTING PARTIES have ascertained that direct
discussions between the contracting parties concerned have not been
successful. If, as a result of the consultations with the CONTRACTING PARTIES
no agreement is reached and they determine that the restrictions are being
applied inconsistently with such provisions, and that damage to the trade of
the contracting party initiating the procedure is caused or threatened
thereby, they shall recommend the withdrawal or modification of the
restrictions. If the restrictions are not withdrawn or modified within such
time as the CONTRACTING PARTIES may prescribe, they may release the
contracting party initiating the procedure from such obligations under this
Agreement towards the contracting party applying the restrictions as they
determine to be appropriate in the circumstances.<p>    (<i>e</i>)    If a
contracting party against which action has been taken in accordance with the
last sentence of subparagraph (<i>c</i>) (ii) or (<i>d</i>) of this
paragraph, finds that the release of obligations authorized by the
CONTRACTING PARTIES adversely affects the operation of its program and
policy of economic development, it shall be free, not later than sixty days
after such action is taken, to give written notice to the Executive
Secretary By the Decision of 23 March 1965, the CONTRACTING PARTIES changed
the title of the head of the GATT secretariat from "Executive Secretary" to
"Director-General".  to the Contracting Parties of its intention to withdraw
 from this Agreement and such withdrawal shall take effect on the sixtieth
day following the day on which the notice is received by him.<p>
(<i>f</i>)    In proceeding under this paragraph, the CONTRACTING PARTIES
shall have due regard to the factors referred to in paragraph 2 of this
Article. Determinations under this paragraph shall be rendered expeditiously
and, if possible, within sixty days of the initiation of the
consultations.<p> Section C<p> 13.     If a contracting party coming within
the scope of paragraph 4 (<i>a</i>) of this Article finds that governmental
assistance is required to promote the establishment of a particular industry*
with a view to raising the general standard of living of its people, but that
no measure consistent with the other provisions of this Agreement is
practicable to achieve that objective, it may have recourse to the provisions
and procedures set out in this Section.*<p> 14.    The contracting party
concerned shall notify the CONTRACTING PARTIES of the special difficulties
which it meets in the achievement of the objective outlined in paragraph 13
of this Article and shall indicate the specific measure affecting imports
which it proposes to introduce in order to remedy these difficulties. It
shall not introduce that measure before the expiration of the time-limit laid
down in paragraph 15 or 17, as the case may be, or if the measure affects
imports of a product which is the subject of a concession included in the
appropriate Schedule annexed to this Agreement, unless it has secured the
concurrence of the CONTRACTING PARTIES in accordance with provisions of
paragraph 18; <i>Provided </i>that, if the industry receiving assistance has
already started production, the contracting party may, after informing the
CONTRACTING PARTIES, take such measures as may be necessary to prevent,
during that period, imports of the product or products concerned from
increasing substantially above a normal level.*<p>15.    If, within thirty
days of the notification of the measure, the CONTRACTING PARTIES do not
request the contracting party concerned to consult with them,* that
contracting party shall be free to deviate from the relevant provisions of
the other Articles of this Agreement to the extent necessary to apply the
proposed measure.<p>16.    If it is requested by the CONTRACTING PARTIES to
do so,* the contracting party concerned shall consult with them as to the
purpose of the proposed measure, as to alternative measures which may be
available under this Agreement, and as to the possible effect of the measure
proposed on the commercial and economic interests of other contracting
parties. If, as a result of such consultation, the CONTRACTING PARTIES agree
that there is no measure consistent with the other provisions of this
Agreement which is practicable in order to achieve the objective outlined in
paragraph 13 of this Article, and concur* in the proposed measure, the
contracting party concerned shall be released from its obligations under the
relevant provisions of the other Articles of this Agreement to the extent
necessary to apply that measure.<p>17.    If, within ninety days after the
date of the notification of the proposed measure under paragraph 14 of this
Article, the CONTRACTING PARTIES have not concurred in such measure, the
contracting party concerned may introduce the measure proposed after
informing the CONTRACTING PARTIES.<p>18.    If the proposed measure affects a
product which is the subject of a concession included in the appropriate
Schedule annexed to this Agreement, the contracting party concerned shall
enter into consultations with any other contracting party with which the
concession was initially negotiated, and with any other contracting party
determined by the CONTRACTING PARTIES to have a substantial interest therein.
The CONTRACTING PARTIES shall concur* in the measure if they agree that there is no measure consistent with the other provisions of this Agreement which is practicable in order to achieve the objective set
forth in paragraph 13 of this Article, and if they are satisfied:<p>
(<i>a</i>)    that agreement has been reached with such other contracting
parties as a result of the consultations referred to above, or<p> (<i>b</i>)
if no such agreement has been reached within sixty days after the
notification provided for in paragraph 14 has been received by the
CONTRACTING PARTIES, that the contracting party having recourse to this
Section has made all reasonable efforts to reach an agreement and that the
interests of other contracting parties are adequately safeguarded.*<p> The
contracting party having recourse to this Section shall thereupon be released
from its obligations under the relevant provisions of the other Articles of
this Agreement to the extent necessary to permit it to apply the
measure.<p>19.    If a proposed measure of the type described in paragraph 13
of this Article concerns an industry the establishment of which has in the
initial period been facilitated by incidental protection afforded by
restrictions imposed by the contracting party concerned for balance of
payments purposes under the relevant provisions of this Agreement, that
contracting party may resort to the provisions and procedures of this
Section; <i>Provided </i>that it shall not apply the proposed measure without
the concurrence* of the CONTRACTING PARTIES.*<p>20.    Nothing in the
preceding paragraphs of this Section shall authorize any deviation from the
provisions of Articles I, II and XIII of this Agreement. The provisos to
paragraph 10 of this Article shall also be applicable to any restriction
under this Section.<p>21.    At any time while a measure is being applied
under paragraph 17 of this Article any contracting party substantially
affected by it may suspend the application to the trade of the contracting
party having recourse to this Section of such substantially equivalent
concessions or other obligations under this Agreement the suspension of
which the CONTRACTING PARTIES do not disapprove;* <i>Provided </i>that sixty
days' notice of such suspension is given to the CONTRACTING PARTIES not later
than six months after the measure has been introduced or changed
substantially to the detriment of the contracting party affected.  Any such
contracting party shall afford adequate opportunity for consultation in
accordance with the provisions of Article XXII of this Agreement.<p> Section
D<p> 22.    A contracting party coming within the scope of subparagraph 4
(<i>b</i>) of this Article desiring, in the interest of the development of
its economy, to introduce a measure of the type described in paragraph 13 of
this Article in respect of the establishment of a particular industry* may
apply to the CONTRACTING PARTIES for approval of such measure. The
CONTRACTING PARTIES shall promptly consult with such contracting party and
shall, in making their decision, be guided by the considerations set out in
paragraph 16. If the CONTRACTING PARTIES concur* in the proposed measure the
contracting party concerned shall be released from its obligations under the
relevant provisions of the other Articles of this Agreement to the extent
necessary to permit it to apply the measure. If the proposed measure affects
a product which is the subject of a concession included in the appropriate
Schedule annexed to this Agreement, the provisions of paragraph 18 shall
apply.*<p> 23.    Any measure applied under this Section shall comply with
the provisions of paragraph 20 of this Article.<p>

Article XIX </h4>

<h4>
Emergency Action on Imports of Particular Products </h4>


1.    (<i>a</i>)    If, as a result of unforeseen developments and of the
effect of the obligations incurred by a contracting party under this
Agreement, including tariff concessions, any product is being imported into
the territory of that contracting party in such increased quantities and
under such conditions as to cause or threaten serious injury to domestic
producers in that territory of like or directly competitive products, the
contracting party shall be free, in respect of such product, and to the
extent and for such time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy such
injury, to suspend the obligation in whole or in part or to withdraw or
modify the concession.<p>
    (<i>b</i>)    If any product, which is the subject of a concession with
respect to a preference, is being imported into the territory of a
contracting party in the circumstances set forth in subparagraph (<i>a</i>)
of this paragraph, so as to cause or threaten serious injury to domestic
producers of like or directly competitive products in the territory of a
contracting party which receives or received such preference, the importing
contracting party shall be free, if that other contracting party so
requests, to suspend the relevant obligation in whole or in part or to
withdraw or modify the concession in respect of the product, to the extent
and for such time as may be necessary to prevent or remedy such injury.<p>2.
Before any contracting party shall take action pursuant to the provisions of
paragraph 1 of this Article, it shall give notice in writing to the
CONTRACTING PARTIES as far in advance as may be practicable and shall afford
the CONTRACTING PARTIES and those contracting parties having a substantial
interest as exporters of the product concerned an opportunity to consult with it in respect of the proposed
action. When such notice is given in relation to a concession with respect
to a preference, the notice shall name the contracting party which has
requested the action. In critical circumstances, where delay would cause
damage which it would be difficult to repair, action under paragraph 1 of
this Article may be taken provisionally without prior consultation, on the
condition that consultation shall be effected immediately after taking such
action.<p>3.    (<i>a</i>)    If agreement among the interested contracting
parties with respect to the action is not reached, the contracting party
which proposes to take or continue the action shall, nevertheless, be free to
do so, and if such action is taken or continued, the affected contracting
parties shall then be free, not later than ninety days after such action is
taken, to suspend, upon the expiration of thirty days from the day on which
written notice of such suspension is received by the CONTRACTING PARTIES, the
application to the trade of the contracting party taking such action, or, in
the case envisaged in paragraph 1 (<i>b</i>) of this Article, to the trade of
the contracting party requesting such action, of such substantially
equivalent concessions or other obligations under this Agreement the
suspension of which the CONTRACTING PARTIES do not disapprove.<p> (<i>b</i>)
    Notwithstanding the provisions of subparagraph (<i>a</i>) of this
    paragraph, where action is taken under paragraph 2 of this Article
without prior consultation and causes or threatens serious injury in the
territory of a contracting party to the domestic producers of products affected by the action, that contracting
party shall, where delay would cause damage difficult to repair, be free to
suspend, upon the taking of the action and throughout the period of
consultation, such concessions or other obligations as may be necessary to
prevent or remedy the injury.<p>

Article XX </h4>

<h4>
General Exceptions </h4>


<i>    </i>Subject to the requirement that such measures are not applied in
a manner which would constitute a means of arbitrary or unjustifiable
discrimination between countries where the same conditions prevail, or a
disguised restriction on international trade, nothing in this Agreement shall
be construed to prevent the adoption or enforcement by any contracting party
of measures:<p> (<i>a</i>)    necessary to protect public morals;<p>
(<i>b</i>)    necessary to protect human, animal or plant life or health;<p>
(<i>c</i>)    relating to the importations or exportations of gold or
silver;<p> (<i>d</i>)    necessary to secure compliance with laws or

labor;<p> (<i>f</i>)    imposed for the protection of national treasures of
artistic, historic or archaeological value;<p> (<i>g</i>)    relating to the
conservation of exhaustible natural resources if such measures are made

any inter-governmental commodity agreement which conforms to criteria
submitted to the CONTRACTING PARTIES and not disapproved by them or which is
itself so submitted and not so disapproved;*<p> (<i>i</i>)    involving
restrictions on exports of domestic materials necessary to ensure essential
quantities of such materials to a domestic processing industry during periods
when the domestic price of such materials is held below the world price as
part of a governmental stabilization plan; <i>Provided </i>that such
restrictions shall not operate to increase the exports of or the protection
afforded to such domestic industry, and shall not depart from the provisions
of this Agreement relating to non-discrimination;<p> (<i>j</i>)    essential
to the acquisition or distribution of products in general or local short
supply; <i>Provided </i>that any such measures shall be consistent with the
principle that all contracting parties are entitled to an equitable share of
the international supply of such products, and that any such measures, which
are inconsistent with the other provisions of the Agreement shall be
discontinued as soon as the conditions giving rise to them have ceased to
exist.  The CONTRACTING PARTIES shall review the need for this sub-paragraph
not later than 30 June 1960.<p>

<h4>
Article XXI </h4>

<h4>
Security Exceptions </h4>

(<i>a</i>)     to require any contracting party to furnish any information
the disclosure of which it considers contrary to its essential security
interests; or<p> (<i>b</i>)     to prevent any contracting party from taking
any action which it considers necessary for the protection of its essential
security interests<p> (i)     relating to fissionable materials or the
	materials from which they are derived;<p> (ii)    relating to the
	traffic in arms, ammunition and implements of war and to such traffic
in other goods and materials as is carried on directly or indirectly for the
purpose of supplying a military establishment;<p> (iii)    taken in time of
	war or other emergency in international relations; or<p> (<i>c</i>)

obligations under the United Nations Charter for the maintenance of
international peace and security.<p>

<h4>
Article XXII </h4>

<h4>
Consultation </h4>


1.    Each contracting party shall accord sympathetic consideration to, and
shall afford adequate opportunity for consultation regarding, such
representations as may be made by another contracting party with respect to
any matter affecting the operation of this Agreement.<p> 2.    The
CONTRACTING PARTIES may, at the request of a contracting party, consult with
any contracting party or parties in respect of any matter for which it has
not been possible to find a satisfactory solution through consultation under
paragraph&#160;1.<p>

<h4>
Article XXIII </h4>

<h4>
Nullification or Impairment </h4>


    1.    If any contracting party should consider that any benefit accruing
to it directly or indirectly under this Agreement is being nullified or
impaired or that the attainment of any objective of the Agreement is being
impeded as the result of<p> (<i>a</i>)    the failure of another contracting
party to carry out its obligations under this Agreement, or<p> (<i>b</i>)
the application by another contracting party of any measure, whether or not
it conflicts with the provisions of this Agreement, or<p> (<i>c</i>)    the
existence of any other situation, <p> the contracting party may, with a view
to the satisfactory adjustment of the matter, make written representations or
proposals to the other contracting party or parties which it considers to be
concerned. Any contracting party thus approached shall give sympathetic
consideration to the representations or proposals made to it.<p> 2.    If no
satisfactory adjustment is effected between the contracting parties concerned
within a reasonable time, or if the difficulty is of the type described in
paragraph 1 (<i>c</i>) of this Article, the matter may be referred to the
CONTRACTING PARTIES. The CONTRACTING PARTIES shall promptly investigate any
matter so referred to them and shall make appropriate recommendations to the
contracting parties which they consider to be concerned, or give a ruling on
the matter, as appropriate. The CONTRACTING PARTIES may consult with
contracting parties, with the Economic and Social Council of the United
Nations and with any appropriate inter-governmental organization in cases
where they consider such consultation necessary. If the CONTRACTING PARTIES
consider that the circumstances are serious enough to justify such action,
they may authorize a contracting party or parties to suspend the application
to any other contracting party or parties of such concessions or other
obligations under this Agreement as they determine to be appropriate in the
circumstances. If the application to any contracting party of any concession
or other obligation is in fact suspended, that contracting party shall then
be free, not later than sixty days after such action is taken, to give
written notice to the Executive Secretary By the Decision of 23 March 1965,
the CONTRACTING PARTIES changed the title of the head of the GATT secretariat
from "Executive Secretary" to "Director-General".  to the Contracting Parties
 of its intention to withdraw from this Agreement and such withdrawal shall
take effect upon the sixtieth day following the day on which such notice is

 Article XXIV </h4>

<h4>
Territorial Application Frontier Traffic Customs Unions and Free-trade Areas
</h4>


1.    The provisions of this Agreement shall apply to the metropolitan
customs territories of the contracting parties and to any other customs
territories in respect of which this Agreement has been accepted under
Article XXVI or is being applied under Article XXXIII or pursuant to the
Protocol of Provisional Application. Each such customs territory shall,
exclusively for the purposes of the territorial application of this
Agreement, be treated as though it were a contracting party; <i>Provided
</i>that the provisions of this paragraph shall not be construed to create
any rights or obligations as between two or more customs territories in
respect of which this Agreement has been accepted under Article&#160;XXVI or
is being applied under Article XXXIII or pursuant to the Protocol of
Provisional Application by a single contracting party.<p>
2.    For the purposes of this Agreement a customs territory shall be
understood to mean any territory with respect to which separate tariffs or
other regulations of commerce are maintained for a substantial part of the
trade of such territory with other territories.<p>3.    The provisions of
this Agreement shall not be construed to prevent:<p> (<i>a</i>)
Advantages accorded by any contracting party to adjacent countries in order
to facilitate frontier traffic;<p> (<i>b</i>)     Advantages accorded to the
trade with the Free Territory of Trieste by countries contiguous to that
territory, provided that such advantages are not in conflict with the
Treaties of Peace arising out of the Second World War.<p> 4.    The
contracting parties recognize the desirability of increasing freedom of trade
by the development, through voluntary agreements, of closer integration
between the economies of the countries parties to such agreements. They also
recognize that the purpose of a customs union or of a free-trade area should
be to facilitate trade between the constituent territories and not to raise
barriers to the trade of other contracting parties with such
territories.<p>5.    Accordingly, the provisions of this Agreement shall not
prevent, as between the territories of contracting parties, the formation of
a customs union or of a free-trade area or the adoption of an interim
agreement necessary for the formation of a customs union or of a free-trade
area; <i>Provided </i>that:<p> (<i>a</i>)     with respect to a customs
union, or an interim agreement leading to a formation of a customs union, the
duties and other regulations of commerce imposed at the institution of any
such union or interim agreement in respect of trade with contracting parties
not parties to such union or agreement shall not on the whole be higher or
more restrictive than the general incidence of the duties and regulations of
commerce applicable in the constituent territories prior to the formation of
such union or the adoption of such interim agreement, as the case may be;<p>
(<i>b</i>)     with respect to a free-trade area, or an interim agreement
leading to the formation of a free-trade area, the duties and other
regulations of commerce maintained in each if the constituent territories and
applicable at the formation of such free-trade area or the adoption of such
interim agreement to the trade of contracting parties not included in such
area or not parties to such agreement shall not be higher or more restrictive
than the corresponding duties and other regulations of commerce existing in
the same constituent territories prior to the formation of the free-trade
area, or interim agreement as the case may be; and<p> (<i>c</i>)     any
interim agreement referred to in subparagraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>)
shall include a plan and schedule for the formation of such a customs union
or of such a free-trade area within a reasonable length of time.<p> 6.    If,
in fulfilling the requirements of subparagraph 5 (<i>a</i>), a contracting
party proposes to increase any rate of duty inconsistently with the
provisions of Article II, the procedure set forth in Article XXVIII shall
apply. In providing for compensatory adjustment, due account shall be taken
of the compensation already afforded by the reduction brought about in the
corresponding duty of the other constituents of the union.<p>7.    (<i>a</i>)
Any contracting party deciding to enter into a customs union or free-trade
area, or an interim agreement leading to the formation of such a union or
area, shall promptly notify the CONTRACTING PARTIES and shall make available
to them such information regarding the proposed union or area as will enable
them to make such reports and recommendations to contracting parties as they
may deem appropriate.<p>    (<i>b</i>)    If, after having studied the plan
and schedule included in an interim agreement referred to in paragraph 5 in
consultation with the parties to that agreement and taking due account of the
information made available in accordance with the provisions of subparagraph
(<i>a</i>), the CONTRACTING PARTIES find that such agreement is not likely to
result in the formation of a customs union or of a free-trade area within the
period contemplated by the parties to the agreement or that such period is
not a reasonable one, the CONTRACTING PARTIES shall make recommendations to
the parties to the agreement. The parties shall not maintain or put into
force, as the case may be, such agreement if they are not prepared to modify
it in accordance with these recommendations.<p>    (<i>c</i>)    Any
substantial change in the plan or schedule referred to in paragraph 5
(<i>c</i>) shall be communicated to the CONTRACTING PARTIES, which may
request the contracting parties concerned to consult with them if the change
seems likely to jeopardize or delay unduly the formation of the customs union
or of the free-trade area.<p>8.    For the purposes of this Agreement:<p>
(<i>a</i>)    A customs union shall be understood to mean the substitution of a single customs territory for
two or more customs territories, so that<p>
(i)    duties and other restrictive regulations of commerce (except, where
necessary, those permitted under Articles XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV and XX) are
eliminated with respect to substantially all the trade between the
constituent territories of the union or at least with respect to
substantially all the trade in products originating in such territories,
and,<p> (ii)    subject to the provisions of paragraph 9, substantially the
same duties and other regulations of commerce are applied by each of the
members of the union to the trade of territories not included in the
union;<p> (<i>b</i>)     A free-trade area shall be understood to mean a
group of two or more customs territories in which the duties and other
restrictive regulations of commerce (except, where necessary, those permitted
under Articles&#160;XI, XII, XIII, XIV, XV and XX) are eliminated on
substantially all the trade between the constituent territories in products
originating in such territories.<p> 9.    The preferences referred to in
paragraph 2 of Article I shall not be affected by the formation of a customs
union or of a free-trade area but may be eliminated or adjusted by means of
negotiations with contracting parties affected.* This procedure of
negotiations with affected contracting parties shall, in particular, apply to
the elimination of preferences required to conform with the provisions of
paragraph 8 (<i>a</i>)(i) and paragraph 8 (<i>b</i>).<p>10.    The
CONTRACTING PARTIES may by a two-thirds majority approve proposals which do
not fully comply with the requirements of paragraphs 5 to 9 inclusive,
provided that such proposals lead to the formation of a customs union or a
free-trade area in the sense of this Article.<p>11.    Taking into account
the exceptional circumstances arising out of the establishment of India and
Pakistan as independent States and recognizing the fact that they have long
constituted an economic unit, the contracting parties agree that the
provisions of this Agreement shall not prevent the two countries from
entering into special arrangements with respect to the trade between them,
pending the establishment of their mutual trade relations on a definitive
basis.*<p> 12.    Each contracting party shall take such reasonable measures
as may be available to it to ensure observance of the provisions of this
Agreement by the regional and local governments and authorities within its
territories.<p>

1.    Representatives of the contracting parties shall meet from time to
time for the purpose of giving effect to those provisions of this Agreement
which involve joint action and, generally, with a view to facilitating the
operation and furthering the objectives of this Agreement. Wherever reference
is made in this Agreement to the contracting parties acting jointly they are
designated as the CONTRACTING PARTIES.<p> 2.    The Secretary-General of the
United Nations is requested to convene the first meeting of the CONTRACTING
PARTIES, which shall take place not later than March 1, 1948.<p>3.    Each
contracting party shall be entitled to have one vote at all meetings of the
CONTRACTING PARTIES.<p>4.    Except as otherwise provided for in this
Agreement, decisions of the CONTRACTING PARTIES shall be taken by a majority
of the votes cast.<p>5.    In exceptional circumstances not elsewhere
provided for in this Agreement, the CONTRACTING PARTIES may waive an
obligation imposed upon a contracting party by this Agreement; <i>Provided
</i>that any such decision shall be approved by a two-thirds majority of the
votes cast and that such majority shall comprise more than half of the
contracting parties. The CONTRACTING PARTIES may also by such a vote<p> (i)
define certain categories of exceptional circumstances to which other voting
requirements shall apply for the waiver of obligations, and<p> (ii)
prescribe such criteria as may be necessary for the application of this
paragraph The authentic text erroneously reads "sub-paragraph".  .<p>

hereinafter referred to as the "contracting parties primarily concerned"),
and subject to consultation with any other contracting party determined by
the CONTRACTING PARTIES to have a substantial interest* in such concession,
modify or withdraw a concession* included in the appropriate schedule annexed
to this Agreement.<p> 2.    In such negotiations and agreement, which may
include provision for compensatory adjustment with respect to other products,
the contracting parties concerned shall endeavor to maintain a general level
of reciprocal and mutually advantageous concessions not less favorable to
trade than that provided for in this Agreement prior to such
negotiations.<p>3.    (<i>a</i>)    If agreement between the contracting
parties primarily concerned cannot be reached before 1 January 1958 or before
the expiration of a period envisaged in paragraph 1 of this Article, the
contracting party which proposes to modify or withdraw the concession shall,
nevertheless, be free to do so and if such action is taken any contracting
party with which such concession was initially negotiated, any contracting
party determined under paragraph 1 to have a principal supplying interest
and any contracting party determined under paragraph 1 to have a substantial
interest shall then be free not later than six months after such action is

contracting party.<p>    (<i>b</i>)    If agreement between the contracting

is not satisfied, such other contracting party shall be free, not later than
six months after action under such agreement is taken, to withdraw, upon the
expiration of thirty days from the day on which written notice of such
withdrawal is received by the CONTRACTING PARTIES, substantially equivalent
concessions initially negotiated with the applicant contracting party.<p>4.
The CONTRACTING PARTIES may, at any time, in special circumstances,
authorize* a contracting party to enter into negotiations for modification or
withdrawal of a concession included in the appropriate Schedule annexed to
this Agreement subject to the following procedures and conditions:<p>
    (<i>a</i>)     Such negotiations* and any related consultations shall be
    conducted in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 1 and 2 of this
Article.<p> (<i>b</i>)     If agreement between the contracting parties
primarily concerned is reached in the negotiations, the provisions of
paragraph 3 (<i>b</i>) of this Article shall apply.<p> (<i>c</i>)     If
agreement between the contracting parties primarily concerned is not reached
within a period of sixty days* after negotiations have been authorized, or
within such longer period as the CONTRACTING PARTIES may have prescribed, the
applicant contracting party may refer the matter to the CONTRACTING
PARTIES.<p> (<i>d</i>)     Upon such reference, the CONTRACTING PARTIES shall
promptly examine the matter and submit their views to the contracting parties
primarily concerned with the aim of achieving a settlement. If a settlement
is reached, the provisions of paragraph 3 (<i>b</i>) shall apply as if
agreement between the contracting parties primarily concerned had been
reached. If no settlement is reached between the contracting parties
primarily concerned, the applicant contracting party shall be free to modify
or withdraw the concession, unless the CONTRACTING PARTIES determine that
the applicant contracting party has unreasonably failed to offer adequate
compensation.* If such action is taken, any contracting party with which the
concession was initially negotiated, any contracting party determined under
para graph 4 (<i>a</i>) to have a principal supplying interest and any
contracting party determined under paragraph 4 (<i>a</i>) to have a
substantial interest, shall be free, not later than six months after such
action is taken, to modify or withdraw, upon the expiration of thirty days
from the day on which written notice of such withdrawal is received by the
CONTRACTING PARTIES, substantially equivalent concessions initially
negotiated with applicant contracting party.<p> 5.    Before 1 January 1958
and before the end of any period envisaged in paragraph 1 a contracting party
may elect by notifying the CONTRACTING PARTIES to reserve the right, for the
duration of the next period, to modify the appropriate Schedule in accordance
with the procedures of paragraph 1 to 3. If a contracting party so elects,
other contracting parties shall have the right, during the same period, to
modify or withdraw, in accordance with the same procedures, concessions
initially negotiated with that contracting party.<p>

<h4>
Tariff Negotiations </h4>


1.    The contracting parties recognize that customs duties often constitute
serious obstacles to trade; thus negotiations on a reciprocal and mutually
advantageous basis, directed to the substantial reduction of the general
level of tariffs and other charges on imports and exports and in particular
to the reduction of such high tariffs as discourage the importation even of
minimum quantities, and conducted with due regard to the objectives of this
Agreement and the varying needs of individual contracting parties, are of
great importance to the expansion of international trade. The CONTRACTING
PARTIES may therefore sponsor such negotiations from time to time.<p> 2.
(<i>a</i>)    Negotiations under this Article may be carried out on a
selective product-by-product basis or by the application of such multilateral
procedures as may be accepted by the contracting parties concerned. Such
negotiations may be directed towards the reduction of duties, the binding of
duties at then existing levels or undertakings that individual duties or the
average duties on specified categories of products shall not exceed specified
levels. The binding against increase of low duties or of duty-free treatment
shall, in principle, be recognized as a concession equivalent in value to
the reduction of high duties.<p>    (<i>b</i>)    The contracting parties
recognize that in general the success of multilateral negotiations would
depend on the participation of all contracting parties which conduct a
substantial proportion of their external trade with one another.<p>3.
Negotiations shall be conducted on a basis which affords adequate opportunity
to take into account:<p> (<i>a</i>)    the needs of individual contracting
    parties and individual industries;<p> (<i>b</i>)    the needs of
less-developed countries for a more flexible use of tariff protection to
assist their economic development and the special needs of these countries to
maintain tariffs for revenue purposes; and<p> (<i>c</i>)    all other
    relevant circumstances, including the fiscal,* developmental, strategic
    and other needs of the contracting parties concerned.<p>

<h4>
The Relation of this Agreement to the Havana Charter </h4>


1.    The contracting parties undertake to observe to the fullest extent of
    their executive authority the general principles of Chapters I to VI
inclusive and of Chapter IX of the Havana Charter pending their acceptance of
it in accordance with their constitutional procedures.*<p> 2.    Part II of
this Agreement shall be suspended on the day on which the Havana Charter
enters into force.<p>3.    If by September 30, 1949, the Havana Charter has
not entered into force, the contracting parties shall meet before December
31, 1949, to agree whether this Agreement shall be amended, supplemented or
maintained.<p>4.    If at any time the Havana Charter should cease to be in
force, the CONTRACTING PARTIES shall meet as soon as practicable thereafter
to agree whether this Agreement shall be supplemented, amended or maintained.
Pending such agreement, Part II of this Agreement shall again enter into
force; <i>Provided </i>that the provisions of Part II other than Article
XXIII shall be replaced, <i>mutatis mutandis, </i>in the form in which they
then appeared in the Havana Charter; and <i>Provided </i>further that no
contracting party shall be bound by any provisions which did not bind it at
the time when the Havana Charter ceased to be in force.<p>5.    If any
contracting party has not accepted the Havana Charter by the date upon which
it enters into force, the CONTRACTING PARTIES shall confer to agree whether,
and if so in what way, this Agreement in so far as it affects relations
between such contracting party and other contracting parties, shall be
supplemented or amended. Pending such agreement the provisions of Part II of
this Agreement shall, notwithstanding the provisions of paragraph 2 of this
Article, continue to apply as between such contracting party and other
contracting parties.<p> 6.    Contracting parties which are Members of the
International Trade Organization shall not invoke the provisions of this
Agreement so as to prevent the operation of any provision of the Havana
Charter. The application of the principle underlying this paragraph to any
contracting party which is not a Member of the International Trade
Organization shall be the subject of an agreement pursuant to paragraph 5 of
this Article.<p>

<h3>
PART IV* </h3>

<h3>
TRADE AND DEVELOPMENT </h3>

<h4>
Article XXXVI </h4>

<h4>
Principles and Objectives </h4>


1.*    The contracting parties,<p>
(<i>a</i>)    recalling that the basic objectives of this Agreement include
the raising of standards of living and the progressive development of the
economies of all contracting parties, and considering that the attainment of
these objectives is particularly urgent for less-developed contracting
parties;<p> (<i>b</i>)     considering that export earnings of the
less-developed contracting parties can play a vital part in their economic
development and that the extent of this contribution depends on the prices
paid by the less-developed contracting parties for essential imports, the
volume of their exports, and the prices received for these exports;<p>
(<i>c</i>)     noting, that there is a wide gap between standards of living
in less-developed countries and in other countries;<p> (<i>d</i>)
recognizing that individual and joint action is essential to further the
development of the economies of less-developed contracting parties and to
bring about a rapid advance in the standards of living in these countries;<p>
(<i>e</i>)     recognizing that international trade as a means of achieving
economic and social advancement should be governed by such rules and
procedures and measures in conformity with such rules and procedures as are
consistent with the objectives set forth in this Article;<p> (<i>f</i>)
noting that the CONTRACTING PARTIES may enable less-developed contracting
parties to use special measures to promote their trade and development;<p>
agree as follows.<p>2.    There is need for a rapid and sustained expansion
of the export earnings of the less-developed contracting parties.<p>3.
There is need for positive efforts designed to ensure that less-developed
contracting parties secure a share in the growth in international trade
commensurate with the needs of their economic development.<p>4.    Given the
continued dependence of many less-developed contracting parties on the
exportation of a limited range of primary products,* there is need to provide
in the largest possible measure more favorable and acceptable conditions of
access to world markets for these products, and wherever appropriate to
devise measures designed to stabilize and improve conditions of world
markets in these products, including in particular measures designed to
attain stable, equitable and remunerative prices, thus permitting an
expansion of world trade and demand and a dynamic and steady growth of the
real export earnings of these countries so as to provide them with expanding
resources for their economic development.<p>5.    The rapid expansion of the
economies of the less-developed contracting parties will be facilitated by a
diversification* of the structure of their economies and the avoidance of an
excessive dependence on the export of primary products. There is, therefore,
need for increased access in the largest possible measure to markets under
favorable conditions for processed and manufactured products currently or
potentially of particular export interest to less-developed contracting
parties.<p>6.    Because of the chronic deficiency in the export proceeds and
other foreign exchange earnings of less-developed contracting parties, there
are important inter-relationships between trade and financial assistance to
development. There is, therefore, need for close and continuing collaboration
between the CONTRACTING PARTIES and the international lending agencies so
that they can contribute most effectively to alleviating the burdens these
less-developed contracting parties assume in the interest of their economic
development.<p>7.    There is need for appropriate collaboration between the
CONTRACTING PARTIES, other inter-governmental bodies and the organs and
agencies of the United Nations system, whose activities relate to the trade
and economic development of less-developed countries.<p>8.    The developed
contracting parties do not expect reciprocity for commitments made by them in
trade negotiations to reduce or remove tariffs and other barriers to the
trade of less-developed contracting parties.*<p> 9.    The adoption of
measures to give effect to these principles and objectives shall be a matter
of conscious and purposeful effort on the part of the contracting parties
both individually and jointly.<p>

<h4>
Article XXXVII </h4>

<h4>
Commitments </h4>


1.    The developed contracting parties shall to the fullest extent possible
that is, except when compelling reasons, which may include legal reasons,
make it impossible give effect to the following provisions:<p> (<i>a</i>)
accord high priority to the reduction and elimination of barriers to products
currently or potentially of particular export interest to less-developed
contracting parties, including customs duties and other restrictions which
differentiate unreasonably between such products in their primary and in
their processed forms;*<p> (<i>b</i>)     refrain from introducing, or
increasing the incidence of, customs duties or non-tariff import barriers on
products currently or potentially of particular export interest to
less-developed contracting parties; and<p> (<i>c</i>)    (i)    refrain from
imposing new fiscal measures, and <p> (ii)    in any adjustments of fiscal
policy accord high priority to the reduction and elimination of fiscal
measures,<p> which would hamper, or which hamper, significantly the growth of
consumption of primary products, in raw or processed form, wholly or mainly
produced in the territories of less-developed contracting parties, and which
are applied specifically to those products.<p> 2.    (<i>a</i>)    Whenever
it is considered that effect is not being given to any of the provisions of
subparagraph (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) or (<i>c</i>) of paragraph 1, the matter
shall be reported to the CONTRACTING PARTIES either by the contracting party
not so giving effect to the relevant provisions or by any other interested
contracting party.<p> (<i>b</i>)    (i)    The CONTRACTING PARTIES shall, if
    requested so to do by any interested contracting party, and without
    prejudice to any bilateral consultations that may be undertaken, consult
with the contracting party concerned and all interested contracting parties
with respect to the matter with a view to reaching solutions satisfactory to
all contracting parties concerned in order to further the objectives set
forth in Article XXXVI. In the course of these consultations, the reasons
given in cases where effect was not being given to the provisions of
subparagraph (<i>a</i>), (<i>b</i>) or (<i>c</i>) of paragraph 1 shall be
examined.<p> (ii)    As the implementation of the provisions of subparagraph
    (<i>a)</i>, (<i>b</i>) or (<i>c</i>) of paragraph 1 by individual
contracting parties may in some cases be more readily achieved where action
is taken jointly with other developed contracting parties, such consultation
might, where appropriate, be directed towards this end.<p> (iii)    The
consultations by the CONTRACTING PARTIES might also, in appropriate cases, be
directed towards agreement on joint action designed to further the objectives
of this Agreement as envisaged in paragraph 1 of Article XXV.<p> 3.    The
developed contracting parties shall:<p> (<i>a</i>)    make every effort, in
cases where a government directly or indirectly determines the resale price
of products wholly or mainly produced in the territories of less-developed
contracting parties, to maintain trade margins at equitable levels;<p>
(<i>b</i>)    give active consideration to the adoption of other measures*
designed to provide greater scope for the development of imports from
less-developed contracting parties and collaborate in appropriate
international action to this end;<p> (<i>c</i>)    have special regard to the
trade interests of less-developed contracting parties when considering the
application of other measures permitted under this Agreement to meet
particular problems and explore all possibilities of constructive remedies
before applying such measures where they would affect essential interests of
those contracting parties.<p> 4.    Less-developed contracting parties agree
to take appropriate action in implementation of the provisions of Part IV for
the benefit of the trade of other less-developed contracting parties, in so
far as such action is consistent with their individual present and future
development, financial and trade needs taking into account past trade
developments as well as the trade interests of less-developed contracting
parties as a whole.<p> 5.    In the implementation of the commitments set
forth in paragraph 1 to 4 each contracting party shall afford to any other
interested contracting party or contracting parties full and prompt
opportunity for consultations under the normal procedures of this Agreement
with respect to any matter or difficulty which may arise.<p><p>

<h4>
Article XXXVIII </h4>

<h4>
Joint Action </h4>


1.    The contracting parties shall collaborate jointly, with the framework
of this Agreement and elsewhere, as appropriate, to further the objectives
set forth in Article XXXVI.<p> 2.    In particular, the CONTRACTING PARTIES
shall:<p> (<i>a</i>)    where appropriate, take action, including action
through international arrangements, to provide improved and acceptable
conditions of access to world markets for primary products of particular
interest to less-developed contracting parties and to devise measures
designed to stabilize and improve conditions of world markets in these
products including measures designed to attain stable, equitable and
remunerative prices for exports of such products;<p> (<i>b</i>)    seek
appropriate collaboration in matters of trade and development policy with the
United Nations and its organs and agencies, including any institutions that
may be created on the basis of recommendations by the United Nations
Conference on Trade and Development;<p> (<i>c</i>)    collaborate in
analyzing the development plans and policies of individual less-developed
contracting parties and in examining trade and aid relationships with a view
to devising concrete measures to promote the development of export potential
and to facilitate access to export markets for the products of the industries
thus developed and, in this connection, seek appropriate collaboration with
governments and international organizations, and in particular with
organizations having competence in relation to financial assistance for
economic development, in systematic studies of trade and aid relationships in
individual less-developed contracting parties aimed at obtaining a clear
analysis of export potential, market prospects and any further action that
may be required; <p> (<i>d</i>)     keep under continuous review the
development of world trade with special reference to the rate of growth of
the trade of less-developed contracting parties and make such recommendations
to contracting parties as may, in the circumstances, be deemed
appropriate;<p> (<i>e</i>)    collaborate in seeking feasible methods to
expand trade for the purpose of economic development, through international
harmonization and adjustment of national policies and regulations, through
technical and commercial standards affecting production, transportation and
marketing, and through export promotion by the establishment of facilities
for the increased flow of trade information and the development of market
research; and<p> (<i>f</i>)    establish such institutional arrangements as
may be necessary to further the objectives set forth in Article XXXVI and to
give effect to the provision of this Part.<p> <b><p></b>

single preferential rate which shall not on the whole be less favorable to
suppliers at the most-favored-nation rate than the preferences in force
prior to such substitution.<p>    The imposition of an equivalent margin of
tariff preference to replace a margin of preference in an internal tax

Ad Article I </h5>


<i>Paragraph 1<p></i>
    The obligations incorporated in paragraph 1 of Article I by reference to
paragraphs 2 and 4 of Article III and those incorporated in paragraph 2
(<i>b</i>) of Article II by reference to Article VI shall be considered as
falling within Part II for the purposes of the Protocol of Provisional
Application.<p> The cross-references, in the paragraph immediately above and
    in paragraph 1 of Article I, to paragraphs 2 and 4 of Article III shall
only apply after Article III has been modified by the entry into force of the
amendment provided for in the Protocol Modifying Part II and Article XXVI of
the General Agreement on Tariffs and Trade, dated September 14, l948.  This
Protocol entered into force on 14 December 1948.  <p> <i>Paragraph 4</i><p>
    The term "margin of preference" means the absolute difference between the most-favored-nation rate of
duty and the preferential rate of duty for the like product, and not the
    proportionate relation between those rates.  As examples:<p> (1)     If
the most-favored-nation rate were 36 per cent <i>ad valorem</i> and the
preferential rate were 24 per cent<i> ad valorem</i>, the margin of
preference would be 12 per cent<i> ad valorem,</i> and not one-third of the
most-favored-nation rate;<p>
(2)    If the most-favored-nation rate were 36 per cent<i> ad valorem</i>
and the preferential rate were expressed as two-thirds of the
most-favored-nation rate, the margin of preference would be 12 per cent
<i>ad valorem</i>;<p> (3)     If the most-favored-nation rate were 2 francs
per kilogram and the preferential rate were 1.50 francs per kilogram, the
margin of preference would be 0.50 franc per kilogram.<p> The following
    kinds of customs action, taken in accordance with established uniform
    procedures, would not be contrary to a general binding of margins of
preference:<p> (i)    The re-application to an imported product of a tariff
classification or rate of duty, properly applicable to such product, in cases
in which the application of such classification or rate to such product was
temporarily suspended or inoperative on April 10, 1947; and<p>
(ii)    The classification of a particular product under a tariff item other
than that under which importations of that product were classified on April
10, 1947, in cases in which the tariff law clearly contemplates that such
product may be classified under more than one tariff item. <p>

<h5>
Ad Article II </h5>


<i>Paragraph 2</i> (a)<p>
    The cross-reference, in paragraph 2 (<i>a</i>) of Article II, to
paragraph 2 of Article III shall only apply after Article III has been
modified by the entry into force of the amendment provided for in the
Protocol Modifying Part II and Article XXVI of the General Agreement on
Tariffs and Trade, dated September 14, 1948.  This Protocol entered into
force on 14 December 1948.  <p> <i>Paragraph 2</i> (b)<p> See the note
    relating to paragraph 1 of Article I.<p> <i>    Paragraph 4</i><p> Except
    where otherwise specifically agreed between the contracting parties which
    initially negotiated the concession, the provisions of this paragraph
will be applied in the light of the provisions of Article 31 of the Havana
Charter. <p>

<h5>
Ad Article III </h5>


    Any internal tax or other internal charge, or any law, regulation or
requirement of the kind referred to in paragraph 1 which applies to an
imported product and to the like domestic product and is collected or
enforced in the case of the imported product at the time or point of
importation, is nevertheless to be regarded as an internal tax or other
internal charge, or a law, regulation or requirement of the kind referred to
in paragraph 1, and is accordingly subject to the provisions of Article
III.<p> <i>Paragraph 1</i><p> The application of paragraph 1 to internal
    taxes imposed by local governments and authorities with the territory of
a contracting party is subject to the provisions of the final paragraph of
Article XXIV. The term "reasonable measures" in the last-mentioned paragraph
would not require, for example, the repeal of existing national legislation
authorizing local governments to impose internal taxes which, although
technically inconsistent with the letter of Article&#160;III, are not in fact
inconsistent with its spirit, if such repeal would result in a serious
financial hardship for the local governments or authorities concerned. With
regard to taxation by local governments or authorities which is inconsistent
with both the letter and spirit of Article III, the term "reasonable
measures" would permit a contracting party to eliminate the inconsistent
taxation gradually over a transition period, if abrupt action would create
serious administrative and financial difficulties.<p> <i>Paragraph 2 </i><p>
    A tax conforming to the requirements of the first sentence of paragraph
    2 would be considered to be inconsistent with the provisions of the
    second sentence only in cases where competition was involved between, on
    the one hand, the taxed product and, on the other hand, a directly
competitive or substitutable product which was not similarly taxed.<p>
<i>Paragraph 5</i><p>
    Regulations consistent with the provisions of the first sentence of
paragraph&#160;5 shall not be considered to be contrary to the provisions of
the second sentence in any case in which all of the products subject to the
regulations are produced domestically in substantial quantities. A regulation
cannot be justified as being consistent with the provisions of the second
sentence on the ground that the proportion or amount allocated to each of the
products which are the subject of the regulation constitutes an equitable
relationship between imported and domestic products.<p>

<h5>
Ad Article V </h5>


<i>Paragraph 5</i><p>
    With regard to transportation charges, the principle laid down in
paragraph&#160;5 refers to like products being transported on the same route
under like conditions.<p>

<h5>
Ad Article VI </h5>


<i>Paragraph 1</i><p>
1.    Hidden dumping by associated houses (that is, the sale by an importer
at a price below that corresponding to the price invoiced by an exporter with
whom the importer is associated, and also below the price in the exporting
country) constitutes a form of price dumping with respect to which the margin of dumping may be calculated on
the basis of the price at which the goods are resold by the importer.<p>
2.    It is recognized that, in the case of imports from a country which has
a complete or substantially complete monopoly of its trade and where all
domestic prices are fixed by the State, special difficulties may exist in
determining price comparability for the purposes of paragraph 1, and in such
cases importing contracting parties may find it necessary to take into
account the possibility that a strict comparison with domestic prices in such
a country may not always be appropriate.<p> <i>Paragraphs 2 and 3</i><p> 1.
As in many other cases in customs administration, a contracting party may
require reasonable security (bond or cash deposit) for the payment of
anti-dumping or countervailing duty pending final determination of the facts
in any case of suspected dumping or subsidization.<p> 2.    Multiple currency
practices can in certain circumstances constitute a subsidy to exports which
may be met by countervailing duties under paragraph 3 or can constitute a
form of dumping by means of a partial depreciation of a country's currency
which may be met by action under paragraph&#160;2. By "multiple currency
practices" is meant practices by governments or sanctioned by governments.<p>
<i>Paragraph 6</i> (b)<p>
    Waivers under the provisions of this subparagraph shall be granted only
on application by the contracting party proposing to levy an anti-dumping or
countervailing duty, as the case may be.<p>

<h5>
Ad Article VII </h5>


<i>Paragraph 1</i><p>
    The expression "or other charges" is not to be regarded as including
internal taxes or equivalent charges imposed on or in connection with
imported products.<p> <i>Paragraph 2</i><p>
1.    It would be in conformity with Article VII to presume that "actual
value" may be represented by the invoice price, plus any non-included charges
for legitimate costs which are proper elements of "actual value" and plus any
abnormal discount or other reduction from the ordinary competitive price.<p>
2.    It would be in conformity with Article VII, paragraph 2 (<i>b</i>),
for a contracting party to construe the phrase "in the ordinary course of
trade ... under fully competitive conditions", as excluding any transaction
wherein the buyer and seller are not independent of each other and price is
not the sole consideration.<p>3.    The standard of "fully competitive
conditions" permits a contracting party to exclude from consideration prices
involving special discounts limited to exclusive agents.<p> 4.    The wording
of subparagraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>) permits a contracting party to
determine the value for customs purposes uniformly either (1) on the basis of
a particular exporter's prices of the imported merchandise, or (2) on the
basis of the general price level of like merchandise.<p>

<h5>
Ad Article VIII </h5>


1.    While Article VIII does not cover the use of multiple rates of
exchange as such, paragraphs&#160;1 and 4 condemn the use of exchange taxes
or fees as a device for implementing multiple currency practices; if,
however, a contracting party is using multiple currency exchange fees for
balance of payments reasons with the approval of the International Monetary
Fund, the provisions of paragraph 9 (<i>a</i>) of Article XV fully safeguard
its position.<p> 2.    It would be consistent with paragraph 1 if, on the
importation of products from the territory of a contracting party into the
territory of another contracting party, the production of certificates of
origin should only be required to the extent that is strictly
indispensable.<p>

<h5>
Ad Articles XI, XII, XIII, XIV and XVIII </h5>


    Throughout Articles XI, XII, XIII, XIV and XVIII, the terms "import
restrictions" or "export restrictions" include restrictions made effective
through state-trading operations.<p>

<h5>
    Ad Article XI </h5>


<i>Paragraph 2</i> (c)<p>
    The term "in any form" in this paragraph covers the same products when
in an early stage of processing and still perishable, which compete directly
with the fresh product and if freely imported would tend to make the
restriction on the fresh product ineffective.<p>
<i>Paragraph 2, last subparagraph<p></i>
    The term "special factors" includes changes in relative productive
efficiency as between domestic and foreign producers, or as between different
foreign producers, but not changes artificially brought about by means not
permitted under the Agreement.<p>

<h5>
Ad Article XII </h5>


    The CONTRACTING PARTIES shall make provision for the utmost secrecy in
the conduct of any consultation under the provisions of this Article.<p>
<i>Paragraph 3</i> (c)(<i>i</i>)<p>
    Contracting parties applying restrictions shall endeavor to avoid
causing serious prejudice to exports of a commodity on which the economy of a
contracting party is largely dependent.<p> <i>Paragraph 4 </i>(b)<p> It is
    agreed that the date shall be within ninety days after the entry into
    force of the amendments of this Article effected by the Protocol Amending
the Preamble and Parts II and III of this Agreement. However, should the
CONTRACTING PARTIES find that conditions were not suitable for the
application of the provisions of this subparagraph at the time envisaged,
they may determine a later date; <i>Provided</i> that such date is not more
than thirty days after such time as the obligations of Article VIII,
Sections&#160;2,&#160;3 and 4, of the Articles of Agreement of the
International Monetary Fund become applicable to contracting parties, members
of the Fund, the combined foreign trade of which constitutes at least fifty
per centum of the aggregate foreign trade of all contracting parties.<p>
<i>Paragraph 4</i> (e)<p>
    It is agreed that paragraph 4 (<i>e</i>) does not add any new criteria
for the imposition or maintenance of quantitative restrictions for balance of
payments reasons. It is solely intended to ensure that all external factors
such as changes in the terms of trade, quantitative restrictions, excessive
tariffs and subsidies, which may be contributing to the balance of payments
difficulties of the contracting party applying restrictions, will be fully
taken into account.     <p>

<h5>
Ad Article XIII </h5>


<i>Paragraph 2</i> (d)<p>
    No mention was made of "commercial considerations" as a rule for the
allocation of quotas because it was considered that its application by
governmental authorities might not always be practicable. Moreover, in cases
where it is practicable, a contracting party could apply these considerations in the process of seeking agreement,
consistently with the general rule laid down in the opening sentence of
paragraph 2.<p> <i>Paragraph 4<p></i> See note relating to "special factors"
    in connection with the last subparagraph of paragraph&#160;2 of Article
    XI.<p>

<h5>
Ad Article XIV </h5>


<i>Paragraph 1<p></i>
<i>    </i>The provisions of this paragraph shall not be so construed as to
    preclude full consideration by the CONTRACTING PARTIES, in the
    consultations provided for in paragraph 4 of Article XII and in paragraph
    12 of Article XVIII, of the nature, effects and reasons for
discrimination in the field of import restrictions.<p> <i>    Paragraph
2</i><p> One of the situations contemplated in paragraph 2 is that of a
    contracting party holding balances acquired as a result of current
transactions which it finds itself unable to use without a measure of
discrimination.<p>

<h5>
Ad Article XV </h5>


<i>Paragraph 4<p></i>
    The word "frustrate" is intended to indicate, for example, that
infringements of the letter of any Article of this Agreement by exchange
action shall not be regarded as a violation of that Article if, in practice,
there is no appreciable departure from the intent of the Article. Thus, a
contracting party which, as part of its exchange control operated in
accordance with the Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund,
requires payment to be received for its exports in its own currency or in the
currency of one or more members of the International Monetary Fund will not
thereby be deemed to contravene Article XI or Article XIII. Another example
would be that of a contracting party which specifies on an import license the
country from which the goods may be imported, for the purpose not of
introducing any additional element of discrimination in its import licensing
system but of enforcing permissible exchange controls.<p>

<h5>
Ad Article XVI </h5>


    The exemption of an exported product from duties or taxes borne by the
like product when destined for domestic consumption, or the remission of such
duties or taxes in amounts not in excess of those which have accrued, shall
not be deemed to be a subsidy.<p> <i>Section B</i><p> 1.    Nothing in
Section B shall preclude the use by a contracting party of multiple rates of
exchange in accordance with the Articles of Agreement of the International
Monetary Fund.<p> 2.    For the purposes of Section B, a "primary product" is
understood to be any product of farm, forest or fishery, or any mineral, in
its natural form or which has undergone such processing as is customarily
required to prepare it for marketing in substantial volume in international
trade.<p> <i>Paragraph 3</i><p> 1.    The fact that a contracting party has
not exported the product in question during the previous representative
period would not in itself preclude that contracting party from establishing
its right to obtain a share of the trade in the product concerned.<p> 2.
A system for the stabilization of the domestic price or of the return to
domestic producers of a primary product independently of the movements of
export prices, which results at times in the sale of the product for export
at a price lower than the comparable price charged for the like product to
buyers in the domestic market, shall be considered not to involve a subsidy
on exports within the meaning of paragraph 3 if the CONTRACTING PARTIES
determine that:<p> (<i>a</i>)    the system has also resulted, or is so
designed as to result, in the sale of the product for export at a price
higher than the comparable price charged for the like product to buyers in
the domestic market; and<p> (<i>b</i>)    the system is so operated, or is
designed so to operate, either because of the effective regulation of
production or otherwise, as not to stimulate exports unduly or otherwise
seriously to prejudice the interests of other contracting parties.<p>
Notwithstanding such determination by the CONTRACTING PARTIES, operations
under such a system shall be subject to the provisions of paragraph 3 where
they are wholly or partly financed out of government funds in addition to the
funds collected from producers in respect of the product concerned.<p> <i>
Paragraph 4</i><p> The intention of paragraph 4 is that the contracting
    parties should seek before the end of 1957 to reach agreement to abolish
all remaining subsidies as from 1 January 1958; or, failing this, to reach
agreement to extend the application of the standstill until the earliest date
thereafter by which they can expect to reach such agreement.<p>

<h5>
Ad Article XVII </h5>


<i>Paragraph 1</i><p>
    The operations of Marketing Boards, which are established by contracting
parties and are engaged in purchasing or selling, are subject to the
provisions of subparagraphs (<i>a</i>) and (<i>b</i>).<p> The activities of
    Marketing Boards which are established by contracting parties and which
    do not purchase or sell but lay down regulations covering private trade
are governed by the relevant Articles of this Agreement.<p>    The charging
by a state enterprise of different prices for its sales of a product in
different markets is not precluded by the provisions of this Article,
provided that such different prices are charged for commercial reasons, to
meet conditions of supply and demand in export markets.<p> <i>Paragraph 1</i>
(a)<p> Governmental measures imposed to insure standards of quality and
    efficiency in the operation of external trade, or privileges granted for
the exploitation of national natural resources but which do not empower the
government to exercise control over the trading activities of the enterprise
in question, do not constitute "exclusive or special privileges".<p>
<i>Paragraph 1</i> (b)<p>
    A country receiving a "tied loan" is free to take this loan into account
as a "commercial consideration" when purchasing requirements abroad.<p>
<i>Paragraph 2</i><p>
    The term "goods" is limited to products as understood in commercial
practice, and is not intended to include the purchase or sale of services.<p>
<i>Paragraph 3</i><p>
    Negotiations which contracting parties agree to conduct under this
paragraph may be directed towards the reduction of duties and other charges
on imports and exports or towards the conclusion of any other mutually
satisfactory arrangement consistent with the provisions of this Agreement.
(See paragraph 4 of Article II and the note to that paragraph.)<p>
<i>Paragraph 4</i> (b)<p>
    The term "import mark-up" in this paragraph shall represent the margin
by which the price charged by the import monopoly for the imported product
(exclusive of internal taxes within the purview of Article III,
transportation, distribution, and other expenses incident to the purchase,
sale or further processing, and a reasonable margin of profit) exceeds the
landed cost.<p>

<h5>
Ad Article XVIII </h5>


<i>    </i>The CONTRACTING PARTIES and the contracting parties concerned
shall preserve the utmost secrecy in respect of matters arising under this
Article.<p> <i>Paragraphs 1 and 4</i><p> 1.    When they consider whether the
economy of a contracting party "can only support low standards of living",
the CONTRACTING PARTIES shall take into consideration the normal position of
that economy and shall not base their determination on exceptional
circumstances such as those which may result from the temporary existence of
exceptionally favorable conditions for the staple export product or products
of such contracting party.<p> 2.    The phrase "in the early stages of
development" is not meant to apply only to contracting parties which have
just started their economic development, but also to contracting parties the
economies of which are undergoing a process of industrialization to correct
an excessive dependence on primary production.<p> <i>Paragraphs 2, 3, 7, 13
and 22</i><p> The reference to the establishment of particular industries
    shall apply not only to the establishment of a new industry, but also to
the establishment of a new branch of production in an existing industry and
to the substantial transformation of an existing industry, and to the
substantial expansion of an existing industry supplying a relatively small
proportion of the domestic demand. It shall also cover the reconstruction of
an industry destroyed or substantially damaged as a result of hostilities or
natural disasters.<p> <i>Paragraph 7</i> (b)<p> A modification or withdrawal,
    pursuant to paragraph 7 (<i>b</i>), by a contracting party, other than
    the applicant contracting party, referred to in paragraph 7 (<i>a</i>),
shall be made within six months of the day on which the action is taken by
the applicant contracting party, and shall become effective on the thirtieth
day following the day on which such modification or withdrawal has been
notified to the CONTRACTING PARTIES.<p> <i>Paragraph 11</i><p> The second
    sentence in paragraph 11 shall not be interpreted to mean that a
    contracting party is required to relax or remove restrictions if such
relaxation or removal would thereupon produce conditions justifying the
intensification or institution, respectively, of restrictions under paragraph
9 of Article XVIII.<p> <i>Paragraph 12</i> (b)<p> The date referred to in
    paragraph 12 (<i>b</i>) shall be the date determined by the CONTRACTING
    PARTIES in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 4 (<i>b</i>) of
Article XII of this Agreement.<p> <i>Paragraphs 13 and 14</i><p> It is
    recognized that, before deciding on the introduction of a measure and
    notifying the CONTRACTING PARTIES in accordance with paragraph 14, a
contracting party may need a reasonable period of time to assess the
competitive position of the industry concerned.<p>
<i>Paragraphs 15 and 16</i><p>
    It is understood that the CONTRACTING PARTIES shall invite a contracting
party proposing to apply a measure under Section C to consult with them
pursuant to paragraph 16 if they are requested to do so by a contracting
party the trade of which would be appreciably affected by the measure in
question.<p> <i>Paragraphs 16, 18, 19 and 22</i><p> 1.    It is understood
that the CONTRACTING PARTIES may concur in a proposed measure subject to
specific conditions or limitations. If the measure as applied does not
conform to the terms of the concurrence it will to that extent be deemed a
measure in which the CONTRACTING PARTIES have not concurred. In cases in
which the CONTRACTING PARTIES have concurred in a measure for a specified
period, the contracting party concerned, if it finds that the maintenance of
the measure for a further period of time is required to achieve the objective
for which the measure was originally taken, may apply to the CONTRACTING
PARTIES for an extension of that period in accordance with the provisions and
procedures of Section C or D, as the case may be.<p> 2.    It is expected
that the CONTRACTING PARTIES will, as a rule, refrain from concurring in a
measure which is likely to cause serious prejudice to exports of a commodity
on which the economy of a contracting party is largely dependent.<p>
<i>Paragraph 18 and 22</i><p>
    The phrase "that the interests of other contracting parties are
adequately safeguarded" is meant to provide latitude sufficient to permit
consideration in each case of the most appropriate method of safeguarding
those interests. The appropriate method may, for instance, take the form of
an additional concession to be applied by the contracting party having
recourse to Section C or D during such time as the deviation from the other
Articles of the Agreement would remain in force or of the temporary
suspension by any other contracting party referred to in paragraph 18 of a
concession substantially equivalent to the impairment due to the introduction
of the measure in question. Such contracting party would have the right to
safeguard its interests through such a temporary suspension of a concession;
<i>Provided</i> that this right will not be exercised when, in the case of a
measure imposed by a contracting party coming within the scope of paragraph 4
(<i>a</i>), the CONTRACTING PARTIES have determined that the extent of the
compensatory concession proposed was adequate.<p> <i>Paragraph 19</i><p> The
    provisions of paragraph 19 are intended to cover the cases where an
    industry has been in existence beyond the "reasonable period of time"
referred to in the note to paragraphs 13 and 14, and should not be so
construed as to deprive a contracting party coming within the scope of
paragraph 4 (<i>a</i>) of Article XVIII, of its right to resort to the other
provisions of Section C, including paragraph 17, with regard to a newly
established industry even though it has benefited from incidental protection
afforded by balance of payments import restrictions.<p> <i>Paragraph
21</i><p> Any measure taken pursuant to the provisions of paragraph 21 shall
    be withdrawn forthwith if the action taken in accordance with paragraph
17 is withdrawn or if the CONTRACTING PARTIES concur in the measure proposed
after the expiration of the ninety-day time limit specified in paragraph
17.<p>

<h5>
Ad Article XX </h5>


<i>Subparagraph</i> (h)<p>
    The exception provided for in this subparagraph extends to any commodity
agreement which conforms to the principles approved by the Economic and
Social Council in its resolution 30 (IV) of 28 March l947.<p>

<h5>
Ad Article XXIV </h5>


<i>Paragraph 9</i><p>
    It is understood that the provisions of Article I would require that,
when a product which has been imported into the territory of a member of a
customs union or free-trade area at a preferential rate of duty is
re-exported to the territory of another member of such union or area, the
latter member should collect a duty equal to the difference between the duty
already paid and any higher duty that would be payable if the product were
being imported directly into its territory.<p> <i>Paragraph 11</i><p>
    Measures adopted by India and Pakistan in order to carry out definitive
    trade arrangements between them, once they have been agreed upon, might
depart from particular provisions of this Agreement, but these measures would
in general be consistent with the objectives of the Agreement.<p>

<h5>
Ad Article XXVIII </h5>


    The CONTRACTING PARTIES and each contracting party concerned should
arrange to conduct the negotiations and consultations with the greatest
possible secrecy in order to avoid premature disclosure of details of
prospective tariff changes. The CONTRACTING PARTIES shall be informed
immediately of all changes in national tariffs resulting from recourse to
this Article.<p> <i>Paragraph 1</i><p> 1.    If the CONTRACTING PARTIES
specify a period other than a three-year period, a contracting party may act
pursuant to paragraph 1 or paragraph 3 of Article XXVIII on the first day
following the expiration of such other period and, unless the CONTRACTING
PARTIES have again specified another period, subsequent periods will be
three-year periods following the expiration of such specified period.<p>
2.    The provision that on 1 January 1958, and on other days determined
pursuant to paragraph 1, a contracting party "may ... modify or withdraw a
concession" means that on such day, and on the first day after the end of
each period, the legal obligation of such contracting party under Article II
is altered; it does not mean that the changes in its customs tariff should
necessarily be made effective on that day. If a tariff change resulting from
negotiations undertaken pursuant to this Article is delayed, the entry into
force of any compensatory concessions may be similarly delayed.<p>3.    Not
earlier than six months, nor later than three months, prior to 1 January
1958, or to the termination date of any subsequent period, a contracting
party wishing to modify or withdraw any concession embodied in the
appropriate Schedule, should notify the CONTRACTING PARTIES to this effect.
The CONTRACTING PARTIES shall then determine the contracting party or
contracting parties with which the negotiations or consultations referred to
in paragraph 1 shall take place. Any contracting party so determined shall
participate in such negotiations or consultations with the applicant
contracting party with the aim of reaching agreement before the end of the
period. Any extension of the assured life of the Schedules shall relate to
the Schedules as modified after such negotiations, in accordance with
paragraphs 1, 2, and 3 of Article XXVIII. If the CONTRACTING PARTIES are
arranging for multilateral tariff negotiations to take place within the
period of six months before 1 January 1958, or before any other day
determined pursuant to paragraph 1, they shall include in the arrangements
for such negotiations suitable procedures for carrying out the negotiations
referred to in this paragraph.<p>4.    The object of providing for the
participation in the negotiation of any contracting party with a principle
supplying interest, in addition to any contracting party with which the
concession was originally negotiated, is to ensure that a contracting party
with a larger share in the trade affected by the concession than a
contracting party with which the concession was originally negotiated shall
have an effective opportunity to protect the contractual right which it
enjoys under this Agreement. On the other hand, it is not intended that the
scope of the negotiations should be such as to make negotiations and
agreement under Article XXVIII unduly difficult nor to create complications
in the application of this Article in the future to concessions which result
from negotiations thereunder.  Accordingly, the CONTRACTING PARTIES should
only determine that a contracting party has a principal supplying interest if
that contracting party has had, over a reasonable period of time prior to the
negotiations, a larger share in the market of the applicant contracting party
than a contracting party with which the concession was initially negotiated
or would, in the judgement of the CONTRACTING PARTIES, have had such a share
in the absence of discriminatory quantitative restrictions maintained by the
applicant contracting party. It would therefore not be appropriate for the
CONTRACTING PARTIES to determine that more than one contracting party, or in
those exceptional cases where there is near equality more than two
contracting parties, had a principal supplying interest.<p>5.
Notwithstanding the definition of a principal supplying interest in note 4 to
paragraph 1, the CONTRACTING PARTIES may exceptionally determine that a
contracting party has a principal supplying interest if the concession in
question affects trade which constitutes a major part of the total exports of
such contracting party.<p>6.    It is not intended that provision for
participation in the negotiations of any contracting party with a principal
supplying interest, and for consultation with any contracting party having a
substantial interest in the concession which the applicant contracting party
is seeking to modify or withdraw, should have the effect that it should have
to pay compensation or suffer retaliation greater than the withdrawal or
modification sought, judged in the light of the conditions of trade at the
time of the proposed withdrawal or modification, making allowance for any
discriminatory quantitative restrictions maintained by the applicant
contracting party.<p>7.    The expression "substantial interest" is not
capable of a precise definition and accordingly may present difficulties for
the CONTRACTING PARTIES. It is, however, intended to be construed to cover
only those contracting parties which have, or in the absence of
discriminatory quantitative restrictions affecting their exports could
reasonably be expected to have, a significant share in the market of the
contracting party seeking to modify or withdraw the concession.<p>
<i>Paragraph 4</i><p>
1.    Any request for authorization to enter into negotiations shall be
accompanied by all relevant statistical and other data. A decision on such
request shall be made within thirty days of its submission.<p> 2.    It is
recognized that to permit certain contracting parties, depending in large
measure on a relatively small number of primary commodities and relying on
the tariff as an important aid for furthering diversification of their
economies or as an important source of revenue, normally to negotiate for
the modification or withdrawal of concessions only under paragraph 1 of
Article XXVIII, might cause them at such time to make modifications or
withdrawals which in the long run would prove unnecessary. To avoid such a
situation the CONTRACTING PARTIES shall authorize any such contracting party,
under paragraph 4, to enter into negotiations unless they consider this would
result in, or contribute substantially towards, such an increase in tariff
levels as to threaten the stability of the Schedules to this Agreement or
lead to undue disturbance of international trade.<p>3.    It is expected that
negotiations authorized under paragraph 4 for modification or withdrawal of a
single item, or a very small group of items, could normally be brought to a
conclusion in sixty days. It is recognized, however, that such a period will
be inadequate for cases involving negotiations for the modification or
withdrawal of a larger number of items and in such cases, therefore, it would
be appropriate for the CONTRACTING PARTIES to prescribe a longer period.<p>4.
The determination referred to in paragraph 4 (<i>d</i>) shall be made by the
CONTRACTING PARTIES within thirty days of the submission of the matter to
them unless the applicant contracting party agrees to a longer period.<p> 5.
In determining under paragraph 4 (<i>d</i>) whether an applicant contracting
party has unreasonably failed to offer adequate compensation, it is
understood that the CONTRACTING PARTIES will take due account of the special
position of a contracting party which has bound a high proportion of its
tariffs at very low rates of duty and to this extent has less scope than
other contracting parties to make compensatory adjustment.<p>

<h5>
Ad Article XXVIII bis </h5>


<i>Paragraph 3</i><p>
    It is understood that the reference to fiscal needs would include the
revenues aspect of duties and particularly duties imposed primarily for
revenue purpose, or duties imposed on products which can be substituted for
products subject to revenue duties to prevent the avoidance of such
duties.<p>

<h5>
Ad Article XXIX </h5>


<i>Paragraph 1</i><p>
    Chapters VII and VIII of the Havana Charter have been excluded from
paragraph 1 because they generally deal with the organization, functions and
procedures of the International Trade Organization.<p>

<h5>
Ad Part IV </h5>


    The words "developed contracting parties" and the words "less-developed
contracting parties" as used in Part IV are to be understood to refer to
developed and less-developed countries which are parties to the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade.<p>

<h5>
Ad Article XXXVI </h5>


<i>Paragraph 1</i><p>
    This Article is based upon the objectives set forth in Article I as it
will be amended by Section A of paragraph 1 of the Protocol Amending Part I
and Articles XXIX and XXX when that Protocol enters into force.  This
Protocol was abandoned on 1 January 1968.  <p> <i>Paragraph 4</i><p> The term
    "primary products" includes agricultural products, <i>vide</i> paragraph
    2 of the note<i> ad </i>Article XVI, Section B.<p> <i>Paragraph 5</i><p>
    A diversification program would generally include the intensification
    of activities for the processing of primary products and the development
of manufacturing industries, taking into account the situation of the
particular contracting party and the world outlook for production and
consumption of different commodities.<p> <i>    Paragraph 8</i><p> It is
    understood that the phrase "do not expect reciprocity" means, in
    accordance with the objectives set forth in this Article, that the
less-developed contracting parties should not be expected, in the course of
trade negotiations, to make contributions which are inconsistent with their
individual development, financial and trade needs, taking into consideration
past trade developments.<p> This paragraph would apply in the event of action
    under Section A of Article XVIII, Article&#160;XXVIII, Article XXVIII
<i>bis </i>(Article XXIX after the amendment set forth in Section A of
paragraph 1 of the Protocol Amending Part I and Articles XXIX and XXX shall
have become effective This Protocol was abandoned on 1 January 1968.  ),
Article XXXIII, or any other procedure under this Agreement.<p>

<h5>
Ad Article XXXVII </h5>


<i>Paragraph 1</i> (a)<p>
    This paragraph would apply in the event of negotiations for reduction or
elimination of tariffs or other restrictive regulations of commerce under
Articles XXVIII, XXVIII <i>bis </i>(XXIX after the amendment set forth in
Section A of paragraph 1 of the Protocol Amending Part I and Articles XXIX
and XXX shall have become effective13), and Article XXXIII, as well as in
connection with other action to effect such reduction or elimination which
contracting parties may be able to undertake.<p>
<i>Paragraph 3 </i>(b)<p>
    The other measures referred to in this paragraph might include steps to
promote domestic structural changes, to encourage the consumption of
particular products, or to introduce measures of trade promotion.<p>

<P>
<P>Ocean and Oceanography, great body of salt water comprising all the oceans and seas that cover nearly three-fourths of the surface of the earth, and the scientific study of the physical, chemical, and biological aspects of the so-called world ocean. The major goals of oceanography are to understand the geologic and geochemical processes involved in the evolution and alteration of the ocean and its basin, to evaluate the interaction of the ocean and the atmosphere so that greater knowlege of climatic variations can be attained, and to describe how the biological productivity in the sea is controlled.
<P>

<B>Ocean Basin Structure</B>
<P>The world ocean covers 71 percent of the earth's surface, or about 361 million sq km (140 million sq mi). Its average depth is 5000 m (16,000 ft), and its total volume is about 1,347,000,000 cu km (322,300,000 cu mi). The three major subdivisions of the world ocean are the Atlantic Ocean, the Pacific Ocean, and the Indian Ocean, which are conventionally bounded by the continental masses (see Continent) or by ocean ridges or currents; they merge below 40&#139; South latitude in the Antarctic Circumpolar Current, or West Wind Drift, where they are then often referred to as the Antarctic Ocean. In the north polar region the nearly circular Arctic Ocean, almost landlocked except between Greenland and Europe, is considered by some part of the Atlantic and by others a fourth ocean subdivision. From the shorelines of the continents a submerged part of the continental mass, called the continental shelf, extends sea ward an average distance of 75 km (43 mi); it varies in width from nearly zero to 1500 km (930 mi). The shelf gives way abruptly at a depth of about 200 m (660 ft) to a steeper zone known as the continental slope, which descends about 3500 m (12,000 ft). The continental rise, a gradually sloping zone of sediment that is considered part of the ocean bottom, extends about 600 km (370 mi) from the base of the continental slope to the flat abyssal plains of the deep-ocean floor. In the central parts of the oceans are the midocean ridges, which are extensive mountain chains with inner troughs that are heavily intersected by cracks, called fracture zones. The ridges are sections of a continuous system that winds for 60,000 km (40,000 mi) through all the oceans. The Mid-Atlantic Ridge extends from the Norwegian Sea through the volcanic islands of Iceland and the Azores to the South Atlantic, where it is equidistant from the African and South American coasts. The ridge continues into the Indian Ocean, with a branch that reaches into the Gulf of Aden and the Red Sea, then passes between Australia and Antarctica and into the eastern South Pacific. The East Pacific Rise extends north to the Gulf of California; Easter Island and the Gal&aacute;pagos are volcanic islands that are part of this submarine mountain chain. The ridge system seems to merge into the continents in several areas, such as the Red Sea and the Gulf of California, and such areas are regions of great geologic activity, characterized by volcanoes, or earthquakes and faults (see Earthquake; Fault; Volcano).
<P>
<P>The midocean ridges play a key role in plate tectonics (movements in the earth's crust), for it is from the inner troughs of these ridges that molten rock upwells from the earth's mantle and spreads laterally on both sides, adding new material to the earth's rigid crustal plates. The plates are moving apart, currently at the rate of 1 to 10 cm (0.39 to 3.9 in) a year and are being forced against adjacent plates. From the Mid-Atlantic Ridge, the continents, which rest on the plates and which once were joined, have moved away from one another. In the Pacific Ocean, plates are also moving apart from the East Pacific Rise, but the bordering plates are overlapping them and forcing them under at the edges. At these places, along almost the entire rim of the Pacific, deep trenches are formed as crust is subducted and returned to the mantle. The Pacific trenches commonly reach depths of more than 7 km (4.3 mi); the deepest known point, in the Mariana Trench east of the Philippines, is about 10.9 km (6.8 mi). Trench areas, or subduction zones, are characterized by volcanic and seismic activity, indicative of the motions and stresses of the earth's crustal plates (see Plate Tectonics; Seismology).
<P>
<P>The structure and topography of the ocean floor are studied through the use of sonar and seismic techniques. Depths are found by measuring the time for a sound wave to travel from the surface of the ocean to bottom, and to return (see Sounding). Often several returns are recorded, indicating several layers of sediment below the surface of the ocean floor. More extensive studies of the structure beneath the ocean floor are carried out by one ship firing an explosive in the water, and another recording the reception of sound waves on sensitive instruments. Some of the waves travel directly to the second ship; others travel to the ocean floor, are refracted within the layers of sediment, and then travel to the ship. The strength of the explosive and the distance between the ships are measurements that determine the amount of detail of the subbottom structure that is made available. In this way the thickness of the sediments can be determined.
<P>

<B>Composition of Sediment</B>
<P>
<P>The ocean floor is covered by an average of 0.5 km (0.3 mi) of sediment, but the thickness varies up to about 7 km (4.3 mi) in the Argentine Basin in the South Atlantic. Some regions, particularly the central parts of the midocean ridges where new crust is formed, have little, if any, sediment on them. The sediments are studied by dredging and by deep-sea exploration projects such as the Ocean Drilling Program, which obtains core samples of seafloor sediment from all the world's oceans (see Deep-Sea Exploration).
<P>
<P>The sediments are found to consist of rock particles and organic remains; the compositions depend on depth, distance from continents, and local variants such as submarine volcanoes or high biological productivity. Clay minerals, which are formed by the weathering of continental rocks and carried out to sea by rivers and wind, are usually abundant in the deep sea. Thick deposits of such detrital material are often found near mouths of rivers and on continental shelves; fine particles of clay are spread through the ocean and accumulate slowly on the deep-ocean floor. These sediments are stirred up and periodically redistributed by fierce current-generated disturbances that are called benthic storms because they occur in the sparsely populated deep-sea habitat known as the benthic zone (see Marine Life). Also accumulating as sediment in the benthic zone are the calcium carbonate shells of small organisms such as foraminifera and the siliceous shells of marine protozoans (see Diatom; Protozoa).
<P>

<B>Dating Techniques</B>
<P>Vast quantities of microscopic plants and animals live near the ocean surface. When they die, their shell remains drift down to the ocean floor and accumulate in thick layers of sediment. When studied in sedimentary core samples, which can represent many millions of years of deposits, they provide a detailed and continuous history of the earth's environmental changes. The record is particularly informative for the most recent 2 million to 5 million years, during which major fluctuations in global climate have occurred. Successive ice ages can be traced by the relative scarcity or abundance of the shells of warm-water and cold-water diatoms in various layers of a sedimentary core, as the organisms migrated to more hospitable habitats. Geochemical records of these same fluctuations are revealed by determining the ratios of two isotopes of oxygen, oxygen-16 and oxygen-18, in the shells of foraminifera. The ratio of the two isotopes is proportional to the temperature of the water in which the organism grew; hence, a temperature record is preserved when each organism dies and its shell drifts to the ocean floor. The records of climatic fluctuation found in ocean-floor sediments are much more continuous than similar records on land; they also lend themselves to worldwide correlation. The absolute ages of climatic changes can be determined by correlating the evidence of temperature changes with radioactive-dating techniques (see Chronology; Dating Methods; Radioactivity). Thorium-230 dating is applicable to samples younger than 300,000 years, potassium-argon dating to samples in the range of 75,000 years, and carbon-14 dating to samples younger than 40,000 years. Several other radioactive dating techniques are available for samples of very recent age. A geophysical dating method is also commonly used; it determines the magnetic orientation of sediment particles, since it is now known that the earth's magnetic field has reversed its orientation several times in the past few million years (see Earth: Terrestrial Magnetism). Such dating techniques indicate that the ocean basins are no older than 200 million years.
<P>

<B>Composition of Seawater</B>
<P>Seawater is a dilute solution of several salts derived from weathering and erosion of continental rocks. The salinity of seawater is expressed in terms of total dissolved salts in parts per thousand parts of water. Salinity varies from nearly zero in continental waters to about 41 parts per 1000 in the Red Sea, a region of high evaporation, and more than 150 parts per 1000 in the Great Salt Lake. In the main ocean, salinity averages about 35 parts per 1000, varying between 34 and 36. The major cations, or positive ions, present, and their approximate abundance per 1000 parts of water are as follows: sodium, 10.5; magnesium, 1.3; calcium, 0.4; and potassium, 0.4 parts. The major anions, or negative ions, are chloride, 19 parts per 1000, and sulfate, 2.6 parts. These ions constitute a significant portion of the dissolved salts in seawater, with bromide ions, bicarbonate, silica, a variety of trace elements, and inorganic and organic nutrients making up the remainder. The ratios of the major ions vary little throughout the ocean, and only their total concentration changes. The major nutrients, although not abundant in comparison with the major ions, are extremely important in the biological productivity of the sea. Trace metals are of specific importance for certain organisms, but carbon, nitrogen, phosphorus, and oxygen are almost universally important to marine life. Carbon is found mainly as bicarbonate, HCO3-; nitrogen as nitrate, NO3-; and phosphorus as phosphate, PO4&#149;.
<P>

<B>Temperature</B><P>The temperature of surface ocean water ranges from 26&#139; C (79&#139; F) in tropical waters to -1.4&#139; C (29.5&#139; F), the freezing point of seawater, in polar regions. Surface temperatures generally decrease with increasing latitude, with seasonal variations far less extreme than on land. In the upper 100 m (330 ft) of the sea, the water is almost as warm as at the surface. From 100 m to approximately 1000 m (3300 ft), the temperature drops rapidly to about 5&#139; C (41&#139; F), and below this it drops gradually about another 4&#139; to barely above freezing. The region of rapid change is known as the thermocline.
<P>

<B>Ocean Currents</B>
<P>
<P>The surface currents of the ocean are characterized by large gyres, or currents that are kept in motion by prevailing winds, but the direction of which is altered by the rotation of the earth (see Coriolis Force). The best known of these currents is probably the Gulf Stream in the North Atlantic; the Kuroshio in the North Pacific is a similar current, and both serve to warm the climates of the eastern edges of the two oceans. In regions where the prevailing winds blow offshore, such as the west coast of Mexico and the coast of Peru and Chile, surface waters move away from the continents and they are replaced by colder, deeper water, a process known as upwelling, from as much as 300 m (1000 ft) down. This deep water is rich in nutrients, and these regions have high biological productivity and provide excellent fishing. Deep water is rich in nutrients because decomposition of organic matter exceeds production in deeper water; plant growth occurs only where photosynthetic organisms have access to light Photosynthesis. When organisms die, their remains sink and are oxidized and consumed in the deeper water, thus returning the valuable nutrients to the cycle. The regions of high productivity are generally regions of strong vertical mixing in the upper regions of the ocean. In addition to the western edges of the continents, the entire region around Antarctica is one of high productivity because the surface water there sinks after being chilled, causing deeper water to replace it.
<P>
<P>Although the surface circulation of the ocean is a function of winds and the rotation of the earth, the deeper circulation in the oceans is a function of density differences between adjacent water masses and is known as thermohaline circulation. Salinity and temperature determine density, and any process that changes the salinity or temperature affects the density. Evaporation increases the salinity, hence the density, and causes the water to become heavier than the water around it, so it will sink. Cooling of seawater also increases its density. Because ice discriminates against sea salts, partial freezing increases the salinity of the remaining cold water, forming a mass of very dense water. This process is occurring in the Weddell Sea, off Antarctica, and is responsible for forming a large part of the deep water of the oceans. Water sinks in the Weddell Sea to form what is known as the Antarctic Bottom water, which flows gradually northward into the Atlantic and eastward into the Indian and Pacific oceans. In the North Atlantic, saline water cools and sinks to a moderate level to form the North Atlantic Deep water, which flows slowly southward; this water mass is less dense than the Antarctic Bottom water, and hence flows at less depth. Whereas speeds of surface currents can reach as high as 250 cm/sec, or 5.5 mph, a maximum for the Gulf Stream, speeds of deep currents vary from 2 to 10 cm/sec or less. Once a water mass sinks below the surface, it loses contact with the atmosphere, and can no longer exchange gases with it. Oxygen, dissolved in the water, is used up in the oxidization of dead organic matter, and it is slowly depleted as the water mass remains below the surface. Thus, the oxygen content gives the oceanographer a qualitative idea of the &quot;age&quot; of the water mass, that is, the time it has been away from the surface. Radioactive carbon-14 is produced in the atmosphere and enters the ocean in the form of carbon dioxide gas, which equilibrates, or keeps in balance, with the bicarbonate ion of seawater. Carbon-14 has a half-life of about 5700 years and decays with time; so its activity in a deep-water mass is largely a measure of the time since that water mass was at the surface.
<P>
<P>The general pattern of deep-ocean circulation that is apparent from these measurements is that the deep-water masses formed in the North Atlantic and off Antarctica mix and flow together through the Indian and Pacific oceans, and that the oldest water found is in the deep North Pacific, which has an age of up to 1500 years.
<P>

<B>Resources</B>
<P>
<P>The oceans are being looked to as a major source of food for the future. High productivity characterizes certain regions in the oceans, but larger regions of low productivity also exist. Production is the amount of organic matter fixed, or changed into stable compounds, by photosynthetic organisms in a given unit of time. Estimates of the yearly world ocean production of organic matter, fixed from inorganic carbon and nutrients, amount to about 130 billion metric tons. This process begins with phytoplankton, which are photosynthetic plants that turn carbon into organic matter with the aid of sunlight; zooplankton and fish feed on phytoplankton, and each member of this part of the food web has its own predator (see Plankton). Most of this organic matter is recycled and reused, so that the standing crop of organic material is only a small fraction of this annual total. The harvestable amount of organic matter is a function of technology, tastes, needs, and the ability of the system to sustain this harvest. Presently, yearly harvests amount to about 52.5 million metric tons of fish, 1.5 million metric tons of large whales, and about 700,000 metric tons of seaweed. Estimates of the maximum harvestable amounts on a sustained-yield basis amount to about 150 million to 200 million metric tons per year. Thus, predictions are that the sea can yield only about three to four times the present amount of organic food resources. The decline of the whaling industry in recent years is a strong case against rapid and unwise exploitation of oceanic food resources (see Whaling). Food from the sea will be a good source of protein, but cannot meet the total world demand for calories in the future. The present yield of about 60 million tons per year supplies about 60 trillion kilocalories, or about 2 percent of the calories needed by the present world population. These 60 million tons yield about 12 million tons of protein, which is nearly 30 percent of the needs of the world at the present time.
<P>
<P>The mineral resources of the sea have only recently begun to be known. The sea is so enormous that the supply of several valuable metals is abundant, but it is difficult to extract these materials. The sea is estimated, for example, to contain 10 billion tons of gold; yet the concentration of the metal is so low that it is impossible to recover this resource. Today the major minerals being obtained from seawater are magnesium, bromine, and sodium chloride, or common salt. The ocean floor yields sand, gravel, and oyster shells for construction purposes, and small quantities of diamonds are found in some submarine gravel bars. Phosphorite is a phosphorous mineral known to be available on the seafloor, which has potential use as an agricultural fertilizer. Much interest has been expressed recently in manganese nodules, which are spherical concretions on the seafloor containing about 20 percent manganese, 10 percent iron, 0.3 percent copper, 0.3 percent nickel, and 0.3 percent cobalt. These are all valuable minerals that have not been obtained yet to any great extent from the seafloor (see Mining: Ocean Metal Mining).
<P>
<P>Offshore oil and gas wells at present supply about 17 percent of the world petroleum production. Most of these wells are in the shallow waters of the continental shelves, but deep-sea drilling techniques are expected to discover petroleum on the outer continental margins. Many geologic structures under the seafloor are reservoirs for petroleum and also contain some commercially exploitable deposits of sulfur. Sulfur-rich waters also arise from deep-sea hydrothermal vents (see Hydrothermal Vent).
<P>

<B>Pollution</B>
<P>
<P>Because the sea is expected to yield still larger quantities of valuable resources in the future, and because the water itself is now being used on a small scale through desalination, the concern for preserving the integrity of the ocean has grown. The contaminative effect of increasing technological development and industrialization has already been known to disrupt and destroy the fragile coastal ecology by indiscriminate discharge of industrial and municipal waste products into the sea. The pollution of the marine environment by petroleum and chemical spillage and sewage disposal has helped focus world attention on the need for controlled use of resources and planned disposal of waste products. Other pollution concerns are the effects of insecticides and pesticides on marine fish and birds, increasing levels of lead in the surface waters, and the disposal of hot water from power plants into the sea with untoward effects on marine life.

<P>Photography, technique of producing permanent images on sensitized surfaces by means of the photochemical action of light or other forms of radiant energy.
<P>In today's society photography plays important roles as an information medium, as a tool in science and technology, and as an art form, and it is also a popular hobby. It is essential at every level of business and industry, being used in advertising, documentation, photojournalism, and many other ways. Scientific research, ranging from the study of outer space to the study of the world of subatomic particles, relies heavily on photography as a tool. In the 19th century photography was the domain of a few professionals because it required large cameras and glass photographic plates; during the first decades of the 20th century, however, with the introduction of roll film and the box camera, it came within the reach of the public as a whole. Today the industry offers amateur and professional photographers a large variety of cameras and accessories. See also Motion Picture.

<P><b>Basic Technology</b>
<P>Light is the essential ingredient in photography. Nearly all forms of photography are based on the light- sensitive properties of silver-halide crystals, chemical compounds of silver and halogens (bromine, chlorine, or iodine). When photographic film, which consists of an emulsion (a thin layer of gelatine) and a base of transparent cellulose acetate or polyester, is exposed to light, silver-halide crystals suspended in the emulsion undergo chemical changes to form what is known as a latent image on the film. When the film is processed in a chemical agent called a developer, particles of metallic silver form in areas that were exposed to light. Intense exposure causes many particles to form; weak exposure, few. The image produced in this manner is called a negative because the tonal values of the subject photographed are reversed; that is, areas in the scene that were relatively dark appear light, and areas that were bright appear dark. The tonal values of the negative are reversed again in the photographic printing process or, when preparing color transparencies (slides), in a second development process.
<P>Photography, then, is based on chemical and physical principles. The sensitivity of silver halides to light is the primary chemical principle. The physical principles are governed by the physics of light (see Optics). The generic term light refers to the visible portion of a broad range of electromagnetic radiation, which includes radio waves, gamma rays, X rays, infrared, and ultraviolet rays. The human eye is sensitive to only a narrow band of electromagnetic wavelengths, the visible spectrum. The spectrum comprises the full range of color tones. To the eye, the longest wavelengths register as red, the shortest as blue.
<P><b>Photographic Film</b>
<P>Photographic films vary in the way they react to different wavelengths of visible light. Early black-and-white films were sensitive only to the shorter wavelengths of the visible spectrum, that is, to light perceived as blue. Later, colored dyes were added to film emulsions to make the silver halides responsive to light of other wavelengths. These dyes absorb light of their own color, making silver halide particles sensitive to light of that color. Orthochromatic film, incorporating yellow dyes in the emulsion and sensitive to all light but red, was the first improvement on simple blue-sensitive film.
<P>In panchromatic film, the next major improvement, red-toned dyes were added to the emulsion, rendering the film sensitive to all visible wavelengths. Although slightly less sensitive to green tones than the orthochromatic type, panchromatic film is better able to reproduce the entire range of color tones. Thus, most films now used by amateur and professional photographers are panchromatic.
<P>Two additional varieties of black-and-white film&Auml;process and chromagenic&Auml;have their special uses. Process film is used primarily for line reproduction of copy in the graphic arts. Such films have extremely high contrast, producing images with no tonal values between black and white. Chromagenic film produces dye images rather than silver images on the negative. Using dye couplers and silver halide in the emulsion, it can be developed by standard color-negative development processes. After development, the silver is bleached out of the film, leaving a black-and-white dye image.
<P>Special-purpose films are sensitive to wavelengths beyond the visible spectrum. In addition to visible light, infrared film also responds to the invisible, infrared portion of the spectrum (see Infrared Photography, below).
<P>Instant film, introduced by the Polaroid Corporation in the late 1940s, provides photographs within seconds or minutes of the taking of the picture, using a camera specially designed for this purpose. In instant film the processing chemicals and emulsion are combined in a self-contained envelope or on the print itself. Exposure, development, and printing all take place inside the camera. Polaroid, the leading manufacturer of this film, uses a conventional silver-halide emulsion. After the film is exposed and a negative image produced, the negative is sandwiched with photographic paper and processing chemicals, and a fogging agent transfers the negative image to the paper, producing a print. A number of instant films are manufactured in a 35-mm format, both in black and white and in color.
<P><b>Color Film</b>
<P>Color films are more complex than black and white because they are designed to reproduce the full range of color tones as color, not as black, white, and gray tones. The design and composition of most color transparency films and color negative films are based on the principles of the subtractive color process, in which the three primary colors, yellow, magenta, and cyan (blue-green), are combined with their complements to reproduce a full range of colors. Such films consist of three silver halide emulsions on a single substrate. The top emulsion is sensitive only to blue. Beneath this is a yellow filter that blocks blues but transmits greens and reds to the second emulsion, which absorbs greens but not red. The bottom emulsion records reds.
<P>When color film is exposed to light by a camera, latent black-and-white images are formed on each of the three emulsions. During processing, the chemical action of the developer creates actual images in metallic silver, just as in black-and-white processing. The developer combines with dye couplers incorporated into each of the emulsions to form cyan, magenta, and yellow images. Then the film is bleached, leaving a negative image in the primary colors. In color transparency film, unexposed silver-halide crystals not converted to metallic silver during the initial development are converted to positive images in dye and silver during a second stage of development. After the development action has been arrested, the film is bleached and the image fixed on it.
<P><b>Film and Camera Formats</b>
<P>Different types of cameras require particular forms and sizes of film. Currently, the most widely used camera format is the 35 mm or small format, which produces 20, 24, or 36 24 x 36 mm images on a roll of film. The film is wound on a spool inside a light-tight magazine or cartridge. Film for 35-mm cameras is also available in bulk, in long rolls that can be fed into individual cartridges and cut to length.
<P>The next larger standard camera format, medium format, uses film sizes designated as either 120 or 220. Medium-format cameras produce images of various sizes, such as 6 x 6 cm or 2[frac14] x 2[frac14] in., 6 x 7 cm, and 6 x 9 cm, depending on the configuration of the camera. Larger cameras, called view cameras, use sheet film. Standard sheet film sizes correspond to standard view-camera formats: 4 x 5 in., 5 x 7 in., and 8 x 10 in. Larger special-purpose view cameras, up to a 20 x 24 in. format, are in limited use.
<P><b>Film Speed</b>
<P>Film is classified by speed as well as by format. Film speed is defined as an emulsion's degree of sensitivity to light, and determines the amount of exposure required to photograph a subject under given lighting conditions. The manufacturer of the film assigns a standardized numerical rating in which high numbers correspond to &quot;fast&quot; emulsions and low numbers to &quot;slow&quot; ones. The standards set by the International Standards Organization (ISO) are used throughout the world, although some European manufacturers still use the German Industrial Standard, or Deutsche Industrie Norm (DIN). The ISO system evolved by combining the DIN system with the ASA (the industry standard previously used in the United States). The first number of an ISO rating, equivalent to an ASA rating, represents an arithmetic measure of film speed, whereas the second number, equivalent to a DIN rating, represents a logarithmic measure.
<P>Low-speed films generally are rated from ISO 25/15 to ISO 100/21, but even slower films exist. Kodak's Rapid Process Copy Film, a special process film, has an ISO rating of 0.06/-12. Films in the ISO 125/22 to 200/24 range are considered medium speed, while films above ISO 200/24 are considered fast. In recent years, many major manufacturers have introduced superfast films with ISO ratings higher than 400/27. And certain films can be pushed well beyond their ratings by exposing them as though they had a higher rating and developing them for a greater length of time to compensate for the underexposure.
<P>DX Coding is a recent innovation in film and camera technology. DX-coded cartridges of 35-mm film have printed on them a characteristic panel corresponding to an electronic code that tells the camera the ISO rating of the film as well as the number of frames on the roll. Many of the newer electronic cameras are equipped with DX sensors that electronically sense this information and automatically adjust exposures accordingly.
<P>Differences in sensitivity of a film emulsion to light depend on various chemical additives. For example, hypersensitizing compounds increase film speed without affecting the film's color sensitivity. High-speed film can also be manufactured by increasing the concentration of large silver-halide crystals in the emulsion. In recent years, a generation of faster, more sensitive films has been created by altering the shape of crystals. Flatter silver-halide crystals offer greater surface area. Films incorporating such crystals, such as Kodak's T-grain Kodacolor films, have a correspondingly greater sensitivity to light.
<P>The grain structure of faster films is generally heavier than that of slower films. Grain structure may give rise to a mottled pattern on prints that have been greatly enlarged. Photographs taken with slower-speed film appear less grainy when enlarged. Because of the small size of their silver-halide grains, slow-speed films generally have a higher resolution (that is, they can render fine details with greater sharpness) and can produce a broader range of tones than fast films. When tonal range and sharpness of detail are not as important as capturing a moving subject without blurring, fast films are used.
<P><b>Exposure Range</b>
<P>Each type of film has a characteristic exposure range, or latitude of exposure. Latitude is basically the margin of error in exposure within which film, when developed and printed, can render the actual color and tonal values of the scene photographed.
<P>The terms overexposure and underexposure are used to characterize deviations, purposeful or unintentional, from the optimum exposure. Film exposed to light longer than optimal will often be &quot;blocked up&quot; with silver in highlight areas, resulting in a loss of contrast and sharpness and an increase in graininess. Underexposure, on the other hand, produces negatives characterized as thin, a condition in which there are not enough silver crystals for accurate rendering of dark and shadowed areas.
<P>With films that have a narrow latitude, an exposure adjusted for a shady area is likely to result in overexposure of adjacent sunny areas. The greater a film's latitude, the greater its ability to provide satisfactory prints despite over- or underexposure. Films from which negatives are made, both color and black and white, generally offer enough latitude to allow the photographer a certain margin of error. Transparency films, from which color slides are made, generally have less latitude.
<P><b>The Camera and Its Accessories</b>
<P>Modern cameras operate on the basic principle of the camera obscura (see Historical Development, below). Light passing through a tiny hole or aperture into an otherwise light-tight box casts an image on the surface opposite the aperture. The addition of a lens sharpens the image, and film makes possible a fixed, reproducible image. The camera is the mechanism by which film can be exposed in a controlled manner. Although they differ in structural details, modern cameras consist of four basic components: body, shutter, diaphragm, and lens. Located in the body is a light-tight chamber in which film is held and exposed. Also in the body, located opposite the film and behind the lens, are the diaphragm and shutter. The lens, which is affixed to the front of the body, is actually a grouping of optical glass lenses. Housed in a metal ring or cylinder, it allows the photographer to focus an image on the film. The lens may be fixed in place or set in a movable mount. Objects located at various distances from the camera can be brought into sharp focus by adjusting the distance between the lens and the film.
<P>The diaphragm, a circular aperture behind the lens, operates in conjunction with the shutter to admit light into the light-tight chamber. This opening may be fixed, as in many amateur cameras, or it may be adjustable. Adjustable diaphragms are composed of overlapping strips of metal or plastic that, when spread apart, form an opening of the same diameter as the lens; when meshed together, they form a small opening behind the center of the lens. The aperture openings correspond to numerical settings, called f-stops, on the camera or the lens.
<P>The shutter, a spring-activated mechanical device, keeps light from entering the camera except during the interval of exposure. Most modern cameras have focal-plane or leaf shutters. Some older amateur cameras use a drop-blade shutter, consisting of a hinged piece that, when released, pulls across the diaphragm opening and exposes the film for about 1/30th of a second.
<P>In the leaf shutter, at the moment of exposure, a cluster of meshed blades springs apart to uncover the full lens aperture and then springs shut. The focal-plane shutter consists of a black shade with a variable-size slit across its width. When released, the shade moves quickly across the film, exposing it progressively as the slit moves.
<P>Most modern cameras also have some sort of viewing system or viewfinder to enable the photographer to see, through the lens of the camera, the scene being photographed. Single-lens reflex cameras all incorporate this design feature, and almost all general-use cameras have some form of focusing system as well as a film- advance mechanism.
<P><b>Exposure Control</b>
<P>By adjusting shutter speed and diaphragm aperture, the photographer
obtains just enough light to ensure a proper exposure. Shutter speed and
aperture setting are directly proportional: a one-increment change in shutter
speed is equal to a change of one f-stop. A &quot;one-stop&quot; adjustment
in exposure can refer to a change in either shutter speed or aperture
setting; the resulting change in the amount of light reaching the film will
be the same. Thus, if the shutter speed is increased, a compensatory increase
must be made in aperture size to allow the same amount of light to reach the
film. Fast shutter speeds, 1/125th of a second or less, can capture objects
in motion. <P>In addition to regulating the intensity of the light that
reaches the film, the diaphragm aperture is also used to control the depth of
field. Also called the zone of focus, depth of field refers to the area in
which objects recorded in the picture will be sharply focused. Decreasing the
size of the aperture increases the overall depth of field; widening the
aperture decreases it. When great depth of field is desired&#150maximum
sharpness of all points in the scene, foreground to background&#150a small
aperture and slow shutter speed are used. Since the faster shutter speeds
needed to capture motion require, in compensation, larger apertures, the
depth of field is reduced. On many cameras, the lens ring contains a
depth-of-field scale that shows the approximate sharp-focus zone for the
different aperture settings. <P><b>Camera Designs</b> <P>Cameras come in a
variety of configurations and sizes. The first cameras, &quot;pinhole&quot;
cameras, had no lens. The flow of light was controlled simply by blocking the
pinhole. The first camera in general use, the box camera, consists of a
wooden or plastic box with a simple lens and a drop-blade shutter at one end
and a holder for roll film at the other. The box camera is equipped with a
simple viewfinder that shows the extent of the picture area; some models
have, in addition, one or two diaphragm apertures and a simple focusing
device. <P>The view camera, used primarily by professionals, is the camera
closest in design to early cameras that is still in widespread use. Despite
the unique capability of the view camera, however, other camera types,
because of their greater versatility, are more commonly used by both amateurs
and professionals. Chief among these are the single-lens reflex (SLR),
twin-lens reflex (TLR), and rangefinder. Most SLR and rangefinder cameras use
the 35-mm film format, while most TLR as well as some SLR and rangefinder
cameras use medium-format film, that is, size 120 or 220. <P><b>View
Cameras</b> <P>View cameras are generally larger and heavier than medium- and
small-format cameras and are most often used for studio, landscape, and
architectural photography. These cameras use large-format films that produce
either negatives or transparencies with far greater detail and sharpness than
smaller format film. View cameras have a metal or wood base with a geared
track on which two metal standards ride, one in front and one in back,
connected by a bellows. The front standard contains the lens and shutter; the
rear holds a framed ground-glass panel, in front of which the film holder is
inserted. The body configuration of the view camera, unlike that of most
general-purpose cameras, is adjustable. The front and rear standards can be
shifted, tilted, raised, or swung, allowing the photographer unparalleled
control of perspective and focus. <P><b>Rangefinder cameras</b>
<P>Rangefinder cameras have a viewfinder through which the photographer sees and frames the subject or scene. The viewfinder does not, however, show the scene through the lens but instead closely approximates what the lens would record. This situation, in which the point of view of the lens does not match that of the viewfinder, results in what is known as parallax. At longer distances, the effects of parallax are negligible; at short distances, they become more pronounced, making it difficult for the photographer to frame a scene or subject with certainty.
<P><b>Reflex cameras</b>
<P>Reflex cameras, both the SLR and the TLR types, are equipped with mirrors that reflect in the viewfinder the scene to be photographed. The twin-lens reflex is box-shaped, with a viewfinder consisting of a horizontal ground-glass screen located at the top of the camera. Mounted vertically on the front panel of the camera are two lenses, one for taking photographs and the other for viewing. The lenses are coupled, so that focusing one automatically focuses the other. The image formed by the upper, or viewing, lens is reflected to the viewing screen by a fixed mirror mounted at a 45 degree angle. The photographer focuses the camera and adjusts the composition while looking at the screen. The image formed by the lower lens is focused on the film at the back of the camera. Like rangefinder cameras, TLRs are subject to parallax.
<P>In the SLR type of reflex camera, a single lens is used for both viewing the scene and taking the photograph. A hinged mirror situated between the lens and the film reflects the image formed by the lens through a five- sided prism and onto a ground-glass screen on top of the camera. At the moment the shutter is opened, a spring automatically pulls the mirror out of the path between lens and film. Because of the prism, the image recorded on the film is almost exactly that which the camera lens &quot;sees,&quot; without any parallax effects.
<P>Most SLRs are precision instruments equipped with focal-plane shutters. Many have automatic exposure- control features and built-in light meters. Most modern SLRs have electronically triggered shutters; apertures, too, may be electronically actuated or they may be adjusted manually. Increasingly, camera manufacturers produce SLRs with automatic focusing, an innovation originally reserved for amateur cameras. Minolta's Maxxum series, Canon's EOS series, and Nikon's advanced professional camera, the F-4, all have autofocus capability and are completely electronic. CPUs (central processing units) control the electronic functions in these cameras (see Microprocessor). Minolta's Maxxum 7000i has software &quot;cards&quot; which, when inserted in a slot on the side of the camera, expand the camera's capabilities (see Computer).
<P>Autofocus cameras use electronics and a CPU to sample automatically the distance between camera and subject and to determine the optimum exposure level. Most autofocus cameras bounce either an infrared light beam or ultrasonic (sonar) waves off the subject to determine distance and set the focus. Some cameras, including Canon's EOS and Nikon's SLRs, use passive autofocus systems. Instead of emitting waves or beams, these cameras automatically adjust the focus of the lens until sensors detect the area of maximum contrast in a rectangular target at the center of the focusing screen.
<P><b>Design comparisons</b>
<P>Of the three most widely used designs, the SLR is the most popular among professionals and amateurs alike. Its greatest advantage is that the image seen through the viewfinder is virtually identical with that on which the lens is focused. In addition, the SLR is generally easy and fast to operate and comes with a greater variety of interchangeable lenses and accessories than the other two camera types.
<P>The rangefinder camera, previously the workhorse of photojournalists because of its compact size and ease of operation (compared with the big, slow 4 x 5 in. press cameras used by an earlier generation) has largely been replaced by the SLR. Rangefinder cameras, however, have a simpler optical system with fewer moving parts and are thus inherently more rugged that SLRs, in addition to being quieter and weighing less. For these reasons, some photographers, mainly professionals, continue to use them.
<P>Compared with the other two designs, TLRs have a relatively slow focusing system. As with rangefinder cameras, fewer interchangeable lenses are available, yet the TLR remains popular. The camera produces larger negatives than most SLRs and rangefinders, an advantage when fine detail must be rendered in the final image. In recognition of this, some manufacturers, including Hasselblad, Mamiya, Bronica, and Rollei, have combined the convenience of the SLR with the medium-film format, further reducing the market for the TLR.
<P>Some cameras are designed primarily for amateurs: they are simple to operate, and they produce photographs acceptable to the average snapshot photographer. Many &quot;point-and-shoot&quot; amateur cameras now employ sophisticated technology, with features such as autofocus and exposure control systems that simplify the process of taking pictures and almost guarantee good-quality photos, while still limiting photographer control.
<P><b>Camera Lenses</b>
<P>The lens is as important a part of a camera as the body. Lenses are referred to in generic terms as wide-angle, normal, and telephoto. The three terms refer to the focal length of the lens, which is customarily measured in millimeters. Focal length is defined as the distance from the center of the lens to the image it forms when the lens is set at infinity. In practice, focal length affects the field of view, magnification, and depth of field of a lens.
<P>Cameras used by professional photographers and serious amateurs are designed to accept all three lens types interchangeably. In 35-mm photography, lenses with focal lengths from 20 to 35 mm are considered wide-angle lenses. They provide greater depth of field and encompass a larger field (or angle) of view but provide relatively low magnification. Extreme wide-angle, or fisheye, lenses provide fields of view of 180 degree or more. A 6-mm fisheye lens made by Nikon has a 220 degree field of view that produces a circular image on film, rather than the normal rectangular or square image.
<P>Lenses with focal lengths of from 45 to 55 mm are referred to as normal lenses because they produce an image that approximates the field of view of the human eye. Lenses with longer focal lengths, called telephoto lenses, constrict the field of view and decrease the depth of field while greatly magnifying the image. For a 35-mm camera, lenses with focal lengths of 85 mm or more are considered telephoto.
<P>A fourth generic lens type, the zoom lens, is designed to have a variable focal length, which can be adjusted continuously between two fixed limits. Zoom lenses are especially useful in conjunction with single-lens reflex cameras, for which they allow continuous control of image scale.
<P><b>Artificial Light Sources</b>
<P>In the absence of adequate sunlight, photographers use artificial light to illuminate scenes, both indoors and outdoors. The most commonly used sources of artificial illumination are the electronic flash, or &quot;strobe&quot;; tungsten lamps called photofloods; and quartz lamps. Another once-popular light source, the flashbulb, a disposable bulb filled with oxygen and a mass of fine magnesium alloy wire that fired only once, is largely obsolete, having been replaced by inexpensive, economical electronic flash units.
<P>The electronic flash (see Stroboscope) consists of a glass quartz tube filled with an inert gas&Auml;a halogen&Auml; at extremely low pressure. When high voltage is applied to the electrodes sealed at the ends of the tube, the gas ionizes and produces an intense burst of light of very short duration, a flash. Although large, special- purpose units can produce a flash of about 1/100,000 of a second, most produce flashes lasting from 1/5000 to 1/1000 of a second. Flash units must be synchronized with the shutter of the camera so that the burst of light covers the entire scene. Synchronization is achieved through an electrical connection between camera and flash unit, either a bracket mounted on top of the camera, called a hot shoe, or a cord called a synch cord that runs from the camera's synchronization socket to the flash.
<P>Automatic flash units are equipped with sensors, photocells that automatically adjust the duration of the flash for a particular scene. The sensor, which measures the intensity of the flash as it occurs, cuts off the light when adequate illumination is obtained. The dedicated flash, a newer type of automatic flash, is designed to function as a unit with a particular camera. The electronic circuitry of the flash and camera are integrated. The sensor is located inside the camera and gauges the amount of light at the film plane, allowing more accurate measurement of flash intensity.
<P>Flash units vary in size from small camera-mounted units to large studio units. Generally speaking, the larger the unit, the greater the intensity of light produced. Camera-mounted flashes are adequate for illuminating small scenes, but to illuminate a large scene evenly, and with a single burst of light, a powerful studio unit is needed.
<P>Photofloods, incandescent bulbs with filaments thinner than those used in ordinary light bulbs, provide continuous light. For normal color rendition in color photography, photofloods must be used with either tungsten-balanced film or a light-balancing filter. Quartz lighting, the standard of the television industry because of the great intensity of light produced and relative longevity of the bulbs when compared to tungsten sources, is also popular among still photographers.
<P><b>Exposure Meters</b>
<P>Serious photographers use exposure meters to measure the intensity of light in a given situation in order to determine the proper combination of shutter speed and diaphragm aperture. Four major types of meters are in use: incident light, reflected light, spot, and flash.
<P>Incident light meters measure the intensity of light falling on a subject. To take an incident light reading, the meter is placed alongside the subject and pointed at the camera. Reflected light meters measure the intensity of light reflected by the subject. They are read with the meter at the camera, pointed toward the subject. Most incident light meters can also be modified for use as reflected light meters.
<P>Spot meters measure reflected light in an area as little as 1 degree, whereas the types mentioned above cover a much broader angular range: from 30 degrees to 50 degrees for a reflected-light meter, to 180 degrees for an incident light meter. Flash meters are designed to measure only the split-second bursts emitted by flash units. Combination meters are designed with incident-light, reflected-light, and flash-metering capability.
<P>The simplest meters contain a photoelectric cell that generates a tiny electric current when exposed to light and moves a pointer across a scale. The meter is equipped with an adjustable dial indicating film speed. When the dial is aligned with the pointer, the meter shows the various combinations of shutter speeds and apertures that will produce equivalent exposures, and the camera can be set accordingly.
<P>In some meters, a photoconductive cadmium sulfide cell serves as the light-sensitive element. Powered by a mercury battery, the cell is extremely sensitive, even under low-light conditions. A late-1980s innovation was the use of silicon diodes as the light receptor (see Diode). Meters equipped with these have even greater sensitivity to light than cadmium sulfide cells.
<P>For studio photography, a special meter that measures the color temperature of light is often used. Different wavelengths of light correspond to particular temperatures, expressed in degrees Kelvin (K), and different kinds of lighting (see Electric Lighting) have their own specific color temperatures. Color-temperature meters allow precise measurement of the light emitted by various kinds of bulbs. This is essential for professional color photography done indoors under artificial lighting because the color temperature of fluorescent and incandescent bulbs varies from manufacturer to manufacturer, and the color temperature of a bulb can also change with age.
<P><b>Filters</b>
<P>Made of gelatin or glass, filters are used in front of a camera lens to alter the color balance of light, to change contrast or brightness, to minimize haze, or to create special effects. In black-and-white photography, color filters are used with panchromatic film to transmit light of the matching color while blocking light of a contrasting color. In a landscape photograph taken with a red filter, for example, some of the blue light of the sky is blocked, causing the sky to appear darker and thereby emphasizing clouds. Under a blue sky, a yellow filter produces a less extreme effect because more blue light is transmitted to the film. The No. 8 yellow filter is often used for outdoor black-and-white photography because it renders the tone of a blue sky in much the same way that the human eye perceives it.
<P>Conversion filters, light-balancing filters, and color-compensating filters are all widely used in color photography. Conversion filters change the color balance of light for a given film. Tungsten films, for example, are designed and balanced for the color temperature of amber tungsten light. Exposed in daylight, they will produce pictures with a bluish cast. A series 85 conversion filter can correct this. Daylight film, on the other hand, balanced for sunlight at noon, which has a greater concentration of blue wavelengths than tungsten light, will have a yellow-amber cast when exposed under tungsten light. A series 80 conversion filter corrects this problem.
<P>Light-balancing filters are generally used to make small adjustments in color. These pale-toned filters eliminate undesirable color casts or add a general warming hue. Color-compensating (CC) magenta filters can balance greenish fluorescent light for daylight or tungsten film. Another type of filter, the polarizer, is used primarily to reduce reflection from the surface of shiny subjects. Polarizing filters are also used in color photography to increase color saturation.
<P><b>Developing and Printing</b>
<P>The latent image on film becomes visible through the process called developing&Auml;the application of certain chemical solutions to transform the film into a negative. The process in which this negative is used to create a positive image is called printing; the image is called a print. Film is developed by treating it with a weak reducing alkaline chemical, the developing solution, or developer. This solution reactivates the process begun by the action of light when the film was exposed. The effect is to further reduce the silver-halide crystals in which metallic silver had already formed, so that large grains of silver form around the minute particles that make up the latent image.
<P>As large particles of silver begin forming, a visible image becomes apparent on the film. The thickness and density of silver deposited in each area depend on the amount of light received by the area during exposure. In order to arrest the action of the developer, the film is then bathed in a weakly acidic solution, which neutralizes the alkaline developer. After rinsing, the negative image is fixed: Residual silver-halide crystals are removed, and remaining metallic silver particles are stabilized. The chemical solution used for fixing, commonly referred to as hypo, or fixer, is usually sodium thiosulfate, although potassium or ammonium thiosulfate may also be used. Fixer remover, or hypo clearing agent, is then used to rinse any remaining fixer from the film. Film must be rinsed thoroughly in water, as residual fixer tends to destroy negatives with time. Finally, bathing the processed film in a washing aid promotes uniform drying and prevents formation of water spots and streaks.
<P>Printing is done by either of two methods: contact or projection. The contact method is used when prints of exactly the same size as the negative are desired. They are made by placing the emulsion side of the negative in contact with the printing material and exposing the two together under a source of light.
<P>In projection printing, the negative is first placed in a type of projector called an enlarger. Light from the enlarger passes through the negative to a lens, which projects an enlarged or reduced image of the negative onto sensitized printing material. The process allows the photographer to reduce or increase the amount of light falling on particular portions of the printing material. Known as dodging and burning, these techniques render the final print lighter or darker in selected areas.
<P>The printing material used in this process is a type of photographic paper similar in composition to that used for film, but much less sensitive to light. After it has been exposed, the print is developed and fixed by a process very similar to that used for developing film. In the finished print, areas exposed to the most light reproduce as dark tones, areas that were blocked from light by the negative reproduce as light tones, and areas exposed to moderate amounts of light reproduce as intermediate tones.
<P>Color prints from color negatives are made either by the projection method or by contact printing. Prints from color transparencies can be made directly by projection using the Cibachrome process or a Type R process, such as Kodak's R-3 or Fuji's Type 34. Alternatively, color transparencies can be printed by first making an intermediate negative, or internegative, which can then be printed either by contact or by projection. A third color printing process, called dye-transfer, is considerably more complex and generally used only for professional work.
<P>Positive color transparencies and color negatives are printed on papers with multilayer emulsions containing color-forming agents. Examples of these are Fujichrome Type 34 process paper and Kodak Ektachrome, which are used for printing from color transparencies; and Ektacolor, Fujicolor, and Agfacolor CN Type A, which are used for printing from negatives. These papers are developed in dye-forming solutions without reversal processing. When color prints of this type are made, errors in exposure can be minimized by varying print exposure time. Color balance is controlled by adjustable filters in the head of the enlarger, between the light source and the negative.
<P>In the dye-transfer process of making color prints, a separate negative is prepared for each of three colors: red, green, and blue. These color-separation negatives are either produced directly from the subject in a one- shot camera, now a relatively obsolete technique, or are produced indirectly from the color transparency. The negatives are then used to produce positive-relief images on gelatin sheets known as matrices. Three positive matrices are produced; one is steeped in red dye, another in blue, and the third in green. After immersion, each matrix is printed in turn on a special easel that ensures precise alignment, or registration, to form a full-color image.
<P><b>Recent Technological Advances</B>
<P>New technologies are beginning to blur the lines between photography and other image-making systems. In some new forms of still photography, silver-halide emulsions have been replaced by electronic methods of recording visual information. The Sony Corporation has developed a still video camera called the Mavica, based on an earlier industrial model, the ProMavica. Unlike the conventional video camera, which uses magnetic tape, the Mavica records visual data&Auml;light reflected from objects in the scene photographed&Auml;on a floppy disk. The images are viewed on a monitor connected to the Mavica's playback unit. Canon U.S.A. has also entered the still-video-camera market. Its RC-470 camera requires a still video player for viewing, but the Xap Shot, which records 50 still images, with 300 to 400 lines of resolution, on a 5-cm (2-in) floppy disk, does not require any special equipment. It can be connected directly to a television receiver. Paper prints of the recorded images can also be made, using a special, laser-driver computer printer.
<P>Digitization of photographic images has begun to revolutionize professional photography, giving rise to a specialized field known as image processing. Digitization of the visual data in a photograph (that is, conversion of the data into binary numbers using a computer) makes it possible to manipulate the photographic image by means of specially developed computer programs. The Scitex image-processing system, the commercial and advertising industry standard in the late 1980s, enables the operator to move or erase elements in a photograph, to change colors, to fashion composite images from several photographs, and to adjust contrast or sharpness. Other, less-sophisticated systems, such as Macintosh's Digital Darkroom, allow similar operations.
<P>The quality of computer-generated images was, until recently, inferior to strictly photographic images. Most nonindustrial color printers and laser printers cannot yet produce images with the tonal range, resolution, and saturation of photographs. Some systems, however, such as Presentation Technologies' Montage Slidewriter and the Linotronic system are capable of producing magazine-quality images.

<U>FOR IMMEDIATE RELEASE</U>
<P>
<center><h3>NEW TEXT PROCESSING TECHNOLOGY AUTOMATES THE PROCESS OF INDEXING AND ABSTRACTING</h3></center>
<P>
Bloomington, MN.   The ICONOVEX Corporation introduces <strong>Syntactica</strong>
-- an automatic indexing system that understands the subtleties
of the English language. This new indexing tool kit can locate
the significant terms and concepts in a document and present the
user with a list which displays those terms and concepts as they
appear in context.
<P>
 &quot;Personal computers, modems, and networks have brought business
into the Information Age.  Unfortunately, most businesses are
simply overwhelmed by the huge volume of information they now
have access to, but which they have no way to sort or prioritize.
 There's an incredible amount of information available,&quot;
says Robert Griggs, vice president of sales and marketing for
ICONOVEX, &quot;and it's doubling every four years.  Syntactica
can quickly turn that information into useful data that will help
companies make profitable decisions.  Any company that uses digital,
textual data will benefit from incorporating Syntactica into existing
document management systems, databases, etc.&quot;
<P>

 Syntactica breaks text down into phrases using semantic and syntactic
rules to rank the phrases and produce indexes at the level of
detail specified by the user. Syntactica's semantic decisions
are based on an extensive lexicon, or word list.  Specialty lexicons,
such as a legal lexicon, can also be added to enhance the output
when processing technical documents.
<P>
 Through the use of Syntactica, ICONOVEX has introduced Indexicon,
the first automatic indexing software available for WordPerfect
for Windows, Microsoft Word, and Word for Mac.  As a demonstration
of Indexicon, ICONOVEX has produced a hyperlinked version of
the NAFTA agreement, complete with an index generated by Indexicon.
 In only 12 minutes, Indexicon referenced all 1300 pages and turned a
large, unwieldy document into easily accessed reference material.
<P>
 &quot;Now, whatever part of NAFTA effects a specific business,
the user can locate any important facts simply by referring to
their newly generated index,&quot; Griggs adds.
<P>
 The raw output of the Syntactic engine may be integrated with
any software application and format.  Working at a speed of up
to 180 pages per minute, Syntactica can generate back-of-the-book
indexes, concept indexes, indicative abstracts, or all three,
at six different levels of detail.  Syntactica has a broad range
of possible applications including imaging, desktop publishing,
on-line, CD-ROM, and multimedia.
<P>
 Syntactica is the first textual tool built specifically for the
Age of Information.  It solves a problem that was thought to be
unsolvable--teaching the computer to recognize the subtleties
of the English language.  In the process, it provides a way to
turn the textual flood of our age into a reservoir of useful information.
<P>
 The ICONOVEX  Corporation is a software development company and
a wholly-owned subsidiary of INNOVEX, Inc., the world's leading
manufacturer of lead-wire assemblies for the thin film disk drive
market.

the ability of a State to impose, on a competitively neutral basis and consistent

of telecommunications services, and safeguard the rights of consumers.

the following new section:
</UL><P>
<H3>`SEC. 336. BROADCAST SPECTRUM FLEXIBILITY.
</H3><P>
<UL><P>`(a) COMMISSION ACTION- If the Commission determines to issue additional
licenses for advanced television services, the Commission--
</UL><P>
<UL><UL><P>`(1) should limit the initial eligibility for such licenses to
persons that, as of the date of such issuance, are licensed to operate a
television broadcast station or hold a permit to construct such a station
(or both); and
</UL></UL><P>
<UL><UL><P>`(2) shall adopt regulations that allow the holders of such licenses
to offer such ancillary or supplementary services on designated frequencies
as may be consistent with the public interest, convenience, and necessity.
</UL></UL><P>
<UL><P>`(b) CONTENTS OF REGULATIONS- In prescribing the regulations required
by subsection (a), the Commission shall--
</UL><P>
<UL><UL><P>`(1) only permit such licensee or permittee to offer ancillary
or supplementary services if the use of a designated frequency for such services
is consistent with the technology or method designated by the Commission
for the provision of advanced television services;
</UL></UL><P>
<UL><UL><P>`(2) limit the broadcasting of ancillary or supplementary services
on designated frequencies so as to avoid derogation of any advanced television
services, including high definition television broadcasts, that the Commission
may require using such frequencies;
</UL></UL><P>
<UL><UL><P>`(3) apply to any other ancillary or supplementary service such
of the Commission's regulations as are applicable to the offering of analogous
services by any other person, except that no ancillary or supplementary service
shall have any rights to carriage under section 614 or 615 or be deemed a
multichannel video programming distributor for purposes of section 628;

<UL><UL><P>`(4) adopt such technical and other requirements as may be necessary
or appropriate to assure the quality of the signal used to provide advanced
television services, and may adopt regulations that stipulate the minimum
number of hours per day that such signal must be transmitted; and

<UL><UL><P>`(5) prescribe such other regulations as may be necessary for
the protection of the public interest, convenience, and necessity.

<UL><P>`(c) RECOVERY OF LICENSE- If the Commission grants a license for advanced
television services to a person that, as of the date of such issuance, is
licensed to operate a television broadcast station or holds a permit to construct
such a station (or both), the Commission shall, as a condition of such license,
require that either the additional license or the original license held by
the licensee be surrendered to the Commission for reallocation or reassignment
(or both) pursuant to Commission regulation.
</UL><P>
<UL><P>`(d) PUBLIC INTEREST REQUIREMENT- Nothing in this section shall be
construed as relieving a television broadcasting station from its obligation
to serve the public interest, convenience, and necessity. In the Commission's
review of any application for renewal of a broadcast license for a television
station that provides ancillary or supplementary services, the television
licensee shall establish that all of its program services on the existing
or advanced television spectrum are in the public interest. Any violation
of the Commission rules applicable to ancillary or supplementary services
shall reflect upon the licensee's qualifications for renewal of its license.

<UL><UL><P>`(1) SERVICES TO WHICH FEES APPLY- If the regulations prescribed
pursuant to subsection (a) permit a licensee to offer ancillary or supplementary
services on a designated frequency--

8 years.  Upon application therefor, a renewal of such license may be granted
from time to time for a term of not to exceed 8 years from the date of expiration
of the preceding license, if the Commission finds that public interest,
convenience, and necessity would be served thereby.  Consistent with the
foregoing provisions of this subsection, the Commission may by rule prescribe
the period or periods for which licenses shall be granted and renewed for
particular classes of stations, but the Commission may not adopt or follow
any rule which would preclude it, in any case involving a station of a particular
class, from granting or renewing a license for a shorter period than that
prescribed for stations of such class if, in its judgment, the public interest,
convenience, or necessity would be served by such action.
</UL></UL><P>
<UL><UL><P>`(2) MATERIALS IN APPLICATION- In order to expedite action on
applications for renewal of broadcasting station licenses and in order to
avoid needless expense to applicants for such renewals, the Commission shall
not require any such applicant to file any information which previously has
been furnished to the Commission or which is not directly material to the
considerations that affect the granting or denial of such application, but
the Commission may require any new or additional facts it deems necessary
to make its findings.
</UL></UL><P>
<UL><UL><P>`(3) CONTINUATION PENDING DECISION- Pending any hearing and final
decision on such an application and the disposition of any petition for rehearing
pursuant to section 405, the Commission shall continue such license in effect.'.

the Commission may deny the application for renewal in accordance with paragraph

including renewal for a term less than the maximum otherwise permitted.

of this section if the operator of such system certifies to the Commission
that such carrier complies with the Commission's regulations under subsection
(b) and the Commission approves such certification. The Commission shall
publish notice of the receipt of any such certification and shall act to
approve or disapprove any such certification within 10 days after receipt
of such certification.
</UL></UL><P>
<UL><UL><P>`(2) DISPUTE RESOLUTION- The Commission shall have the authority
to resolve disputes under this section and the regulations prescribed thereunder.
Any such dispute shall be resolved within 180 days after notice of such dispute
is submitted to the Commission. At that time or subsequently in a separate
damages proceeding, the Commission may, in the case of any violation of this
section, require carriage, award damages to any person denied carriage, or
any combination of such sanctions.  Any aggrieved party may seek any other
remedy available under this Act.
</UL></UL><P>
<UL><P>`(b) COMMISSION ACTIONS-
</UL><P>
<UL><UL><P>`(1) REGULATIONS REQUIRED- Within 6 months after the date of enactment
of the Telecommunications Act of 1996, the Commission shall complete all
actions necessary (including any reconsideration) to prescribe regulations
that--
</UL></UL><P>
<UL><UL><UL><P>`(A) except as required pursuant to section 611, 614, or 615,
prohibit an operator of an open video system from discriminating among video
programming providers with regard to carriage on its open video system, and
ensure that the rates, terms, and conditions for such carriage are just and
reasonable, and are not unjustly or unreasonably discriminatory;
</UL></UL></UL><P>
<UL><UL><UL><P>`(B) if demand exceeds the channel capacity of the open video
system, prohibit an operator of an open video system and its affiliates from
selecting the video programming services for carriage on more than one-third
of the activated channel capacity on such system, but nothing in this
subparagraph shall be construed to limit the number of channels that the
carrier and its affiliates may offer to provide directly to subscribers;
</UL></UL></UL><P>
<UL><UL><UL><P>`(C) permit an operator of an open video system to carry on
only one channel any video programming service that is offered by more than
one video programming provider (including the local exchange carrier's video
programming affiliate): <EM>Provided, </EM>That subscribers have ready and
immediate access to any such video programming service;
</UL></UL></UL><P>
<UL><UL><UL><P>`(D) extend to the distribution of video programming over
open video systems the Commission's regulations concerning sports exclusivity
(47 C.F.R. 76.67), network nonduplication (47 C.F.R. 76.92 et seq.), and
syndicated exclusivity (47 C.F.R. 76.151 et seq.); and
</UL></UL></UL><P>
<UL><UL><UL><P>`(E)(i) prohibit an operator of an open video system from
unreasonably discriminating in favor of the operator or its affiliates with
regard to material or information (including advertising) provided by the
operator to subscribers for the purposes of selecting programming on the
open video system, or in the way such material or information is presented
to subscribers;
</UL></UL></UL><P>
<UL><UL><UL><P>`(ii) require an operator of an open video system to ensure
that video programming providers or copyright holders (or both) are able
suitably and uniquely to identify their programming services to subscribers;

</UL></UL><P>
<UL><P>`(e) UNDUE BURDEN- The term `undue burden' means significant difficulty
or expense. In determining whether the closed captions necessary to comply
with the requirements of this paragraph would result in an undue economic
burden, the factors to be considered include--

in order to ensure the accessibility of video programming to persons with
visual impairments, and report to Congress on its findings.  The Commission's
report shall assess appropriate methods and schedules for phasing video
descriptions into the marketplace, technical and quality standards for video
descriptions, a definition of programming for which video descriptions would
apply, and other technical and legal issues that the Commission deems
appropriate.
