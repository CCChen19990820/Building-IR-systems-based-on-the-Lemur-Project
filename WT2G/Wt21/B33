<P>


secure<A NAME = "AO8693"></A> in his country, and defend himself from external enemies, and 
<P>

never be conspired against by his own citizens; seeing that many 
<P>

others, by means of cruelty, have never been able even in peaceful 
<P>

times to hold the state, still less in the doubtful times of war. I 
<P>

believe that this follows from severities being badly or properly 
<P>

used. Those may be called properly used, if of evil it is lawful to 
<P>

speak well, that are applied at one blow and are necessary to one's 
<P>

security, and that are not persisted in afterwards unless they can 
<P>

be turned to the advantage of the subjects. The badly employed are 
<P>

those which, notwithstanding they may be few in the commencement, 
<P>

multiply with time rather than decrease. Those who practise the 
<P>

first system are able, by aid of God or man, to mitigate in some 
<P>

degree their rule, as Agathocles<A NAME = "AS88111"></A><A NAME = "BB88112"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF7806"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> did. It is impossible for those who 
<P>

follow the other to maintain themselves. 
<P>

Hence it is to be remarked that, in seizing a state, the usurper 
<P>

ought to examine closely into all those injuries which it is necessary 

<P>

for him to inflict, and to do them all at one stroke so as not to have 

<P>

to repeat them daily; and thus by not unsettling men he will be able 
<P>

to reassure them, and win them to himself by benefits. He who does 
<P>

otherwise, either from timidity or evil advice, is always compelled to 

<P>

keep the knife in his hand; neither can he rely on his subjects, nor 
<P>

can they attach themselves to him, owing to their continued and 
<P>

repeated wrongs. For injuries<A NAME = "AO8919"></A><A NAME = "AS89110"></A><A NAME = "BB89111"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF76011"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> ought to be done all at one time, so 
<P>

that, being tasted less, they offend less; benefits ought to be 
<P>

given little by little, so that the flavour of them may last longer. 
<P>

And above all things, a prince ought to live amongst his people in 
<P>

such a way that no unexpected circumstances, whether of good or 
<P>

evil, shall make him change; because if the necessity for this comes 
<P>

in troubled times, you are too late for harsh measures; and mild 
<P>

ones will not help you, for they will be considered as forced from 
<P>
<P>

<P>


causes of their ruin were not different to those alleged by me; at the 

<P>

same time I will only submit for consideration those things that are 
<P>

noteworthy to him who studies the affairs of those times. 
<P>

It seems to me sufficient to take all those emperors who succeeded 
<P>

to the empire from Marcus the philosopher down to Maximinus; they were 

<P>

Marcus<A NAME = "AS19243"></A> and his son Commodus<A NAME = "AB192412"></A><A HREF = "SPP65.HTM#BB195918"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, Pertinax, Julian, Severus and his son 
<P>

Antoninus Caracalla, Macrinus, Heliogabalus, Alexander, and Maximinus. 

<P>

There is first to note that, whereas in other principalities the 
<P>

ambition of the nobles and the insolence of the people only have to be 

<P>

contended with, the Roman<A NAME = "AO19289"></A><A NAME = "AS192810"></A><A NAME = "AB192811"></A> emperors had a third difficulty in having to 

<P>

put up with the cruelty and avarice of their soldiers, a matter so 
<P>

beset with difficulties that it was the ruin of many; for it was a 
<P>

hard thing to give satisfaction both to soldiers and people; because 
<P>

the people loved peace, and for this reason they loved the 
<P>

unaspiring prince, whilst the soldiers loved the warlike prince who 
<P>

was bold, cruel, and rapacious, which qualities they were quite 
<P>

willing he should exercise upon the people, so that they could get 
<P>

double<A NAME = "AO19363"></A> pay and give vent to their greed and cruelty. Hence it arose 
<P>

that those emperors were always overthrown who, either by birth or 
<P>

training, had no great authority, and most of them, especially those 
<P>

who came new to the principality, recognizing the difficulty of 
<P>

these two opposing humours, were inclined to give satisfaction to 
<P>

the soldiers, caring little about injuring the people. Which course 
<P>

was necessary, because, as princes cannot help being hated by someone, 

<P>

they ought, in the first place, to avoid being hated by every one, and 

<P>

when they cannot compass this, they ought to endeavour with the utmost 

<P>

diligence to avoid the hatred of the most powerful. Therefore, those 
<P>

emperors who through inexperience had need of special favour adhered 
<P>

more readily to the soldiers than to the people; a course which turned 

<P>

out advantageous to them or not, accordingly as the prince knew how to 

<P>

<P>The primary benefit of escrowed encryption for law enforcement and national security is that, when properly implemented and 
widely deployed, it provides legitimate users with high degrees of assurance that their sensitive<A NAME = "AO54764"></A><A NAME = "AS54765"></A><A NAME = "AS54766"></A><A NAME = "AS54767"></A> information will remain secure but

authorized by law.  Escrowed<A NAME = "AO547129"></A><A NAME = "AS547130"></A><A NAME = "AS547131"></A> encryption<A NAME = "BB547134"></A><A HREF = "SPP19.HTM#BB547238"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> also enables businesses and individuals to recover encrypted stored data to which access has been 
inadvertently lost, and businesses to exercise a greater degree of control over their encrypted<A NAME = "BB547194"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF225160"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> communications.  In addition, by meeting 
demands for better information security emanating from legitimate business and private interests, escrowed<A NAME = "AO547232"></A><A NAME = "AS547233"></A><A NAME = "AS547234"></A><A NAME = "AS547235"></A> encryption<A NAME = "BB547238"></A><A HREF = "SPP19.HTM#BB54928"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> may dampen the 
market for unescrowed<A NAME = "AB547252"></A> encryption products that would provide similar security without features for government<A NAME = "AB547275"></A> exceptional access that 
law<A NAME = "AO547285"></A><A NAME = "AS547286"></A><A NAME = "AS547287"></A><A NAME = "BB547288"></A><A HREF = "SPP20.HTM#BB57718"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> enforcement and national<A NAME = "BB547295"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF160284"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> security authorities could use for legitimate and lawfully authorized purposes.  <BR>



<P>Some participants<A NAME = "AO5493"></A><A NAME = "AS5494"></A><A NAME = "AS5495"></A><A NAME = "AS5496"></A> in the public<A NAME = "BB54913"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF22527"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> debate appear to believe that escrowed encryption<A NAME = "BB54928"></A><A HREF = "SPP19.HTM#BB54941"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> is necessarily equivalent to weak encryption<A NAME = "BB54941"></A><A HREF = "SPP19.HTM#BB55121"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A>, 
because it does not prevent third parties from having access to the relevant plaintext.  But this is a mischaracterization of the 
intent behind escrowed encryption, since all escrowed<A NAME = "AO549100"></A><A NAME = "AS549101"></A><A NAME = "AS549102"></A><A NAME = "BB549103"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF616"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> encryption schemes proposed to date are intended to provide very strong 
cryptographic<A NAME = "AB549129"></A> confidentiality (strong algorithms, relatively long keys) for users against <I>unauthorized</I> third parties, but no<A NAME = "AO549162"></A> confidentiality 
at all against <I>authorized</I> third parties who have exceptional access.<BR>



<P>The risks of escrowed encryption are also considerable.  Escrowed<A NAME = "AO55117"></A><A NAME = "AS55118"></A> encryption<A NAME = "BB55121"></A><A HREF = "SPP20.HTM#BB5655"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> provides a potentially lower degree of 
confidentiality than does properly implemented unescrowed encryption, because escrowed encryption is specifically designed to permit external 
access and then relies on procedures implemented and executed by human beings to prevent unauthorized use of that access.  While 
policy makers have confidence that procedures can be established and implemented without a significant reduction of information 
security, skeptics place little faith in such procedural safeguards.  Maintaining<A NAME = "AO551164"></A><A NAME = "AS551165"></A> system security is difficult enough without the 
deliberate introduction of a potential security<A NAME = "AB551193"></A> hole, and the introduction of another route of attack on procedures simply complicates the
 job of the information defender.  In addition, the widespread adoption<A NAME = "AO551243"></A><A NAME = "AS551244"></A><A NAME = "AS551245"></A><A NAME = "AB551246"></A> of escrowed encryption, even on a voluntary basis, would 
lay into place mechanisms, procedures, and organizations that could be used to promulgate and/or enforce more restrictive 
cryptography<A NAME = "AB551305"></A> policies.  With such elements in place, some critics of escrowed encryption fear that procedural<A NAME = "AO551334"></A><A NAME = "AS551335"></A> safeguards against government<A NAME = "AB551342"></A> 
abuse that are administrative in nature, or that rest on the personal assurances of government officials, could be eviscerated by a 
future administration or Congress.

against; for, provided it is well known that he is an excellent man 
<P>

and revered by his people, he can only be attacked with difficulty. 
<P>

For this reason a prince ought to have two fears, one from within, 
<P>

on account of his subjects, the other from without, on account of 
<P>

external powers. From the latter he is defended by being well armed 
<P>

and having good allies, and if he is well armed he will have good 
<P>

friends, and affairs will always remain quiet within when they are 
<P>

quiet without, unless they should have been already disturbed by 
<P>

conspiracy; and even should affairs outside be disturbed, if he has 
<P>

carried out his preparations and has lived as I have said, as long 
<P>

as he does not despair, he will resist every attack, as I said Nabis 
<P>

the Spartan did. 
<P>

But concerning his subjects, when affairs outside are disturbed he 
<P>

has only to fear that they will conspire secretly, from which a prince 

<P>

can easily secure himself by avoiding being hated and despised, and by 

<P>

keeping the people satisfied with him, which it is most necessary 
<P>

for him to accomplish, as I said above at length. And one of the 
<P>

most efficacious remedies that a prince can have against 
<P>

conspiracies<A NAME = "AO18473"></A> is not to be hated and despised by the people, for he who 

<P>

conspires against a prince always expects to please them by his 
<P>

removal; but when the conspirator can only look forward to offending 
<P>

them, he will not have the courage to take such a course, for the 
<P>

difficulties that confront a conspirator are infinite. And as 
<P>

experience shows, many have been the conspiracies, but few have been 
<P>

successful; because he who conspires cannot act alone, nor can he take 

<P>

a companion except from those whom he believes to be malcontents, 
<P>

and as soon as you have opened your mind to a malcontent you have 
<P>

given him the material with which to content himself, for by 
<P>

denouncing you he can look for every advantage; so that, seeing the 
<P>

gain from this course to be assured, and seeing the other to be 
<P>

<P>


IT ONLY remains now to speak of ecclesiastical principalities, 
<P>

touching which all difficulties are prior to getting possession, 
<P>

because they are acquired either by capacity or good fortune, and they 

<P>

can be held without either; for they are sustained by the ordinances 
<P>

of religion<A NAME = "AO10835"></A><A NAME = "AS10836"></A><A NAME = "AB10837"></A>, which are so all-powerful, and of such a character that 
<P>

the principalities<A NAME = "AO10845"></A> may be held no matter how their princes behave 
<P>

and live. These princes alone have states and do not defend them, they 

<P>

have subjects and do not rule them; and the states, although 
<P>

unguarded, are not taken from them, and the subjects, although not 
<P>

ruled, do not care, and they have neither the desire nor the ability 
<P>

to alienate themselves. Such principalities only are secure and happy. 

<P>

But being upheld by powers, to which the human mind cannot reach, I 
<P>

shall speak no more of them, because, being exalted and maintained 
<P>

by God, it would be the act of a presumptuous and rash man to 
<P>

discuss them. 
<P>

Nevertheless, if any one should ask of me how comes it that the 
<P>

Church<A NAME = "AO10953"></A> has attained such greatness in temporal power, seeing that from 

<P>

Alexander backwards the Italian potentates (not only those who have 
<P>

been called potentates, but every baron and lord, though the smallest) 

<P>

have valued<A NAME = "AS10985"></A> the temporal power very slightly- yet now a king of France<A NAME = "BB109829"></A><A HREF = "SPP46.HTM#BB138011"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> 

<P>

trembles before it, and it has been able to drive him from Italy, 
<P>

and to ruin the Venetians- although this may be very manifest, it does 

<P>

not appear to me superfluous to recall it in some measure to memory. 
<P>

Before Charles, King<A NAME = "AO11027"></A><A NAME = "AS11028"></A><A NAME = "BB11029"></A><A HREF = "SPP39.HTM#BB118820"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> of France, passed into Italy, this country 
<P>

was under the dominion of the Pope, the Venetians, the King<A NAME = "AS110323"></A><A NAME = "AB110324"></A><A HREF = "SPP82.HTM#BB248320"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> of Naples, 

<P>

the Duke<A NAME = "AS11045"></A><A NAME = "BB11046"></A><A HREF = "SPP47.HTM#BB143217"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> of Milan, and the Florentines. These potentates<A NAME = "AO110421"></A><A NAME = "AS110422"></A><A NAME = "AB110423"></A> had two 
<P>

principal anxieties: the one, that no foreigner should enter Italy 
<P>

under arms; the other, that none of themselves should seize more 
<P>

territory. Those about whom there was the most anxiety were the Pope 
<P>

and the Venetians. To restrain the Venetians the union of all the

commit every kind of iniquity against the people; and all, except 
<P>

Severus, came to a bad end; but in Severus<A NAME = "AO198019"></A><A NAME = "AS198020"></A> there was so much valour<A NAME = "BB198031"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF13806"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> 
<P>

that, keeping the soldiers friendly, although the people were 
<P>

oppressed by him, he reigned successfully; for his valour made him 
<P>

so much admired in the sight of the soldiers and people that the 
<P>

latter were kept in a way astonished and awed and the former 
<P>

respectful and satisfied. And because the actions of this man, as a 
<P>

new prince, were great, I wish to show briefly that he knew well how 
<P>

to counterfeit<A NAME = "AS19875"></A> the fox and the lion<A NAME = "AB198716"></A>, which natures, as I said above, 
<P>

it is necessary for a prince to imitate. 
<P>

Knowing<A NAME = "AS19893"></A> the sloth<A NAME = "AB19898"></A> of the Emperor Julian, he persuaded the army in 
<P>

Sclavonia, of which he was captain, that it would be right to go to 
<P>

Rome<A NAME = "AO19913"></A><A NAME = "AS19914"></A><A NAME = "AS19915"></A><A NAME = "BB19916"></A><A HREF = "SPP66.HTM#BB199322"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> and avenge the death<A NAME = "AB199115"></A> of Pertinax, who had been killed by the 
<P>

praetorian soldiers; and under this pretext, without appearing to 
<P>

aspire to the throne, he moved<A NAME = "AS199313"></A> the army on Rome<A NAME = "BB199322"></A><A HREF = "SPP66.HTM#BB199428"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, and reached Italy 
<P>

before it was known that he had started. On his arrival<A NAME = "AS199423"></A> at Rome<A NAME = "BB199428"></A><A HREF = "SPP67.HTM#BB202424"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, the 
<P>

Senate<A NAME = "AO19953"></A><A NAME = "AS19954"></A><A NAME = "AB19955"></A><A HREF = "SPP66.HTM#BB200418"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, through fear, elected him emperor and killed Julian. After 
<P>

this there remained for Severus, who wished to make himself master 
<P>

of the whole empire, two difficulties; one<A NAME = "AS199715"></A> in Asia<A NAME = "BB199720"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF31312"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, where Niger<A NAME = "AS199725"></A><A NAME = "AB199726"></A><A HREF = "SPP66.HTM#BB200117"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, 
<P>

head of the Asiatic army, had caused himself to be proclaimed emperor; 

<P>

the other<A NAME = "AS19995"></A> in the west where Albinus<A NAME = "AB199916"></A><A HREF = "SPP66.HTM#BB200126"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> was, who also aspired to the 
<P>

throne. And as he considered it dangerous to declare himself hostile 
<P>

to both, he decided<A NAME = "AS20019"></A><A NAME = "AS200110"></A> to attack Niger<A NAME = "BB200117"></A><A HREF = "SPP66.HTM#BB200611"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> and to deceive Albinus<A NAME = "BB200126"></A><A HREF = "SPP66.HTM#BB200425"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>. To the 
<P>

latter he wrote that, being elected emperor by the Senate, he was 
<P>

willing to share that dignity with him and sent him the title of 
<P>

Caesar<A NAME = "AS20043"></A><A NAME = "BB20044"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF15918"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>; and, moreover, that the Senate<A NAME = "AO200415"></A><A NAME = "AS200416"></A><A NAME = "AS200417"></A><A NAME = "BB200418"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF19955"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> had made Albinus<A NAME = "BB200425"></A><A HREF = "SPP66.HTM#BB200722"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> his colleague; 

<P>

which things were accepted by Albinus as true. But after Severus had 
<P>

conquered<A NAME = "AS20063"></A><A NAME = "AS20064"></A> and killed Niger<A NAME = "BB200611"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF199726"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, and settled oriental<A NAME = "AB200618"></A> affairs, he 
<P>

returned to Rome and complained to the Senate that Albinus<A NAME = "AS200721"></A><A NAME = "BB200722"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF199916"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, little

<P>


fortune and by God that men with their wisdom cannot direct them and 
<P>

that no one can even help them; and because of this they would have us 

<P>

believe that it is not necessary to labour much in affairs, but to let 

<P>

chance govern them. This opinion has been more credited in our times 
<P>

because of the great changes in affairs which have been seen, and 
<P>

may still be seen, every day, beyond all human conjecture. Sometimes 
<P>

pondering over this, I am in some degree inclined to their opinion. 
<P>

Nevertheless, not to extinguish our free will, I hold it to be true 
<P>

that Fortune<A NAME = "AO25275"></A> is the arbiter of one-half of our actions, but that she 
<P>

still leaves us to direct the other half, or perhaps a little less. 
<P>

I compare her to one of those raging rivers, which when in flood 
<P>

overflows the plains, sweeping away trees and buildings, bearing 
<P>

away the soil from place to place; everything flies before it, all 
<P>

yield to its violence, without being able in any way to withstand 
<P>

it; and yet, though its nature be such, it does not follow therefore 
<P>

that men, when the weather becomes fair, shall not make provision, 
<P>

both with defences and barriers, in such a manner that, rising 
<P>

again, the waters may pass away by canal, and their force be neither 
<P>

so unrestrained nor so dangerous. So it happens with fortune, who 
<P>

shows her power where valour has not prepared to resist her, and 
<P>

thither she turns her forces where she knows that barriers and 
<P>

defences have not been raised to constrain her. 
<P>

And if you will consider Italy, which is the seat of these 
<P>

changes, and which has given to them their impulse, you will see it to 

<P>

think he was ordained by God for our redemption, nevertheless it was 
<P>

afterwards seen, in the height of his career, that fortune rejected 
<P>

him; so that Italy, left as without life, waits for him who shall 
<P>

yet heal her wounds and put an end to the ravaging and plundering of 
<P>

Lombardy, to the swindling and taxing of the kingdom and of Tuscany, 
<P>

and cleanse those sores that for long have festered. It is seen how 
<P>

she entreats God to send someone who shall deliver her from these 
<P>

wrongs and barbarous insolencies. It is seen also that she is ready 
<P>

and willing to follow a banner if only someone will raise it. 
<P>

Nor is there to be seen at present one in whom she can place more 
<P>

hope than in your illustrious house, with its valour and fortune, 
<P>

favoured by God and by the Church of which it is now the chief, and 
<P>

which could be made the head of this redemption. This will not be 
<P>

difficult if you will recall to yourself the actions and lives of 
<P>

the men I have named. And although they were great and wonderful 
<P>

men, yet they were men<A NAME = "AO265411"></A>, and each one of them had no more opportunity 
<P>

than the present offers, for their enterprises were neither more 
<P>

just nor easier than this, nor was God more their friend than He is 
<P>

yours. 
<P>

With us there is great justice, because that war is just which is 
<P>

necessary, and arms are hallowed when there is no other hope but in 
<P>

them. Here there is the greatest willingness, and where the 
<P>

willingness is great the difficulties cannot be great if you will only 

<P>

follow those men to whom I have directed your attention. Further 
<P>

than this, how extraordinarily the ways<A NAME = "AO266313"></A> of God have been manifested 
<P>

beyond example: the sea is divided, a cloud has led the way, the 
<P>

rock has poured forth water, it has rained manna, everything has 
<P>

contributed to your greatness; you ought to do the rest. God is not 
<P>

willing to do everything, and thus take away our free will and that 
<P>

share of glory which belongs to us.

<h3>CHAPTER<A NAME = "AS24012"></A><A NAME = "AB24013"></A> XXIII 
<P>

HOW FLATTERERS SHOULD BE AVOIDED</h3> 
<P>

<P>

I DO NOT wish to leave out an important branch of this subject, 
<P>

for it is a danger from which princes are with difficulty preserved, 
<P>

unless they are very careful and discriminating. It is that of 
<P>

flatterers, of whom courts arc full, because men are so 
<P>

self-complacent in their own affairs, and in a way so deceived in 
<P>

them, that they are preserved with difficulty from this pest, and if 
<P>

they wish to defend themselves they run the danger of falling into 
<P>

contempt. Because there is no other way of guarding oneself from 
<P>

flatterers except letting men understand that to tell you the truth 
<P>

does not offend you; but when every one may tell you the truth, 
<P>

respect for you abates. 
<P>

Therefore a wise prince ought to hold a third course by choosing the 
<P>

wise men in his state, and giving to them only the liberty of speaking 

<P>

the truth to him, and then only of those things of which he 
<P>

inquires, and of none others; but he ought to question them upon 
<P>

everything, and listen to their opinions, and afterwards form his 
<P>

own conclusions. With these councillors, separately and 
<P>

collectively, he ought to carry himself in such a way that each of 
<P>

them should know that, the more freely he shall speak, the more he 
<P>

shall be preferred; outside of these, he should listen to no one, 
<P>

pursue the thing resolved on, and be steadfast in his resolutions. 
<P>

He who does otherwise is either overthrown by flatterers, or is so 
<P>

often changed by varying opinions that he falls into contempt. 
<P>

I wish on this subject to adduce a modern example. Fra Luca, the man 
<P>

of affairs<A NAME = "AS24285"></A> to Maximilian<A NAME = "AB242810"></A>, the present emperor, speaking of his

Pope; and he ought never to have consented to the election of any 
<P>

cardinal whom he had injured or who had cause to fear him if they 
<P>

became pontiffs. For men<A NAME = "AO7519"></A> injure either from fear or hatred. Those whom 

<P>

he had injured, amongst others, were San Pietro ad Vincula, Colonna, 
<P>

San Giorgio, and Ascanio.* Any one of the others, on becoming Pope, 
<P>

would have had to fear him, Rouen<A NAME = "AO75415"></A><A NAME = "AS75416"></A><A NAME = "BB75417"></A><A HREF = "SPP25.HTM#BB75821"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> and the Spaniards excepted; the

latter from their relationship and obligations, the former from his

influence, the kingdom<A NAME = "AS7567"></A> of France<A NAME = "BB75612"></A><A HREF = "SPP36.HTM#BB109829"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> having relations with him. Therefore, 

<P>

above everything, the duke<A NAME = "AO7579"></A><A NAME = "AS75710"></A> ought to have created a Spaniard<A NAME = "AB75723"></A> Pope, and, 

<P>

failing him, he ought to have consented<A NAME = "AS75815"></A><A NAME = "AS75816"></A> to Rouen<A NAME = "BB75821"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF28530"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> and not San<A NAME = "AB75828"></A> Pietro ad 

<P>

Vincula. He who believes that new benefits will cause great personages 

<P>

to forget<A NAME = "AO7605"></A><A NAME = "AS7606"></A> old injuries<A NAME = "AB76011"></A><A HREF = "SPP29.HTM#BB89111"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> is deceived. Therefore, the duke erred in his 
<P>

choice, and it was the cause of his ultimate ruin. 
<P>

<P>

* Julius<A NAME = "AO7635"></A><A NAME = "AS7636"></A><A NAME = "AB7637"></A> II had been Cardinal of San Pietro ad Vincula; San 
<P>

Giorgio<A NAME = "AO7643"></A><A NAME = "AS7644"></A><A NAME = "AS7645"></A> was Raffaells<A NAME = "AB76410"></A> Riaxis, and Ascanio was Cardinal<A NAME = "AB76421"></A> Ascanio Sforza.

<h3>CHAPTER VIII 
<P>

CONCERNING THOSE WHO HAVE OBTAINED A PRINCIPALITY 

BY WICKEDNESS</h3> 
<P>

<P>

ALTHOUGH a prince<A NAME = "AO7697"></A> may rise from a private station in two ways, 
<P>

neither of which can be entirely attributed to fortune or genius, 
<P>

yet it is manifest to me that I must not be silent on them, although 
<P>

one could be more copiously treated when I discuss republics. These 
<P>

methods are when, either by some wicked or nefarious ways, one ascends 

<P>

to the principality, or when by the favour of his fellow-citizens a 
<P>

private<A NAME = "AO7753"></A> person becomes the prince of his country. And speaking of 
<P>

the first method, it will be illustrated by two examples- one ancient, 

<P>

the other modern- and without entering further into the subject, I 
<P>

consider these two examples will suffice those who may be compelled to

may be attributed to them. From this a general rule is drawn which 
<P>

never or rarely fails: that he who is the cause of another becoming 
<P>

powerful is ruined; because that predominancy has been brought about 
<P>

either by astuteness or else by force, and both are distrusted by 
<P>

him who has been raised to power.

<h3>CHAPTER<A NAME = "AS3082"></A><A NAME = "AS3083"></A><A NAME = "AB3084"></A> IV 
<P>

WHY THE KINGDOM<A NAME = "AB30817"></A> OF DARIUS, CONQUERED BY ALEXANDER, 
<P>

DID NOT REBEL AGAINST THE SUCCESSORS OF ALEXANDER AT HIS DEATH </h3>
<P>

<P>

CONSIDERING the difficulties which men have had to hold a newly 
<P>

acquired state, some might wonder how, seeing that Alexander the Great 

<P>

became<A NAME = "AS3133"></A> the master of Asia<A NAME = "AB31312"></A><A HREF = "SPP66.HTM#BB199720"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> in a few years, and died whilst it was yet 
<P>

scarcely settled (whence it might appear reasonable that the whole 
<P>

empire would have rebelled), nevertheless his successors maintained 
<P>

themselves, and had to meet no other difficulty than that which 
<P>

arose among themselves from their own ambitions. 
<P>

I answer that the principalities of which one has record are found 
<P>

to be governed in two different ways: either by a prince, with a 
<P>

body of servants, who assist him to govern the kingdom as ministers by 

<P>

his favour and permission; or by a prince and barons, who hold that 
<P>

dignity by antiquity of blood and not by the grace of the prince. Such 

<P>

barons have states and their own subjects, who recognize them as lords 

<P>

and hold them in natural affection. Those states that are governed 
<P>

by a prince<A NAME = "AO3257"></A> and his servants hold their prince in more 
<P>

consideration, because in all the country there is no one who is 
<P>

recognized as superior to him, and if they yield obedience to 
<P>

another they do it as to a minister and official, and they do not bear

in the country with friends, he often stopped and reasoned with 
<P>

them: &quot;If the enemy should be upon that hill, and we should find 
<P>

ourselves here with our army, with whom would be the advantage? How 
<P>

should one best advance to meet him, keeping the ranks? If we should 
<P>

wish to retreat, how ought we to set about it? If they should retreat, 

<P>

how ought we to pursue?&quot; And he would set forth to them, as he went, 


<P>

all the chances that could befall an army; he would listen to their 
<P>

opinion and state his, confirming it with reasons, so that by these 
<P>

continual discussions there could never arise, in time of war, any 
<P>

unexpected circumstances that he could deal with. 
<P>

But to exercise the intellect the prince should read histories, 
<P>

and study there the actions of illustrious men, to see how they have 
<P>

borne themselves in war, to examine the causes of their victories 
<P>

and defeat, so as to avoid the latter and imitate the former; and 
<P>

above all do as an illustrious man did, who took as an exemplar one 
<P>

who had been praised and famous before him, and whose achievements and 

<P>

deeds he always kept in his mind, as it is said Alexander the Great 
<P>

imitated Achilles, Caesar Alexander, Scipio Cyrus. And whoever reads 
<P>

the life of Cyrus, written by Xenophon, will recognize afterwards in 
<P>

the life of Scipio how that imitation was his glory, and how in 
<P>

chastity, affability, humanity, and liberality Scipio conformed to 
<P>

those things<A NAME = "AO14905"></A> which have been written of Cyrus by Xenophon. A wise 
<P>

prince ought to observe some such rules, and never in peaceful times 
<P>

stand idle, but increase his resources with industry in such a way 
<P>

that they may be available to him in adversity, so that if fortune 
<P>

changes it may find him prepared to resist her blows.

him any particular affection. 
<P>

The examples<A NAME = "AO3305"></A> of these two governments in our time are the Turk and 
<P>

the King<A NAME = "AS3315"></A><A NAME = "BB3316"></A><A HREF = "SPP36.HTM#BB11029"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> of France. The entire<A NAME = "AO33115"></A><A NAME = "AS33116"></A> monarchy<A NAME = "AB33119"></A> of the Turk is governed by one 

<P>

lord, the others are his servants; and, dividing his kingdom into 
<P>

sanjaks, he sends there different administrators, and shifts and 
<P>

changes them as he chooses. But the King of France is placed in the 
<P>

midst of an ancient body of lords, acknowledged by their own subjects, 

<P>

and beloved by them; they have their own prerogatives, nor can the 
<P>

king take these away except at his peril. Therefore, he who 
<P>

considers both of these states will recognize great difficulties in 
<P>

seizing the state of the Turk, but, once it is conquered, great ease 
<P>

in holding it. The causes of the difficulties in seizing the kingdom 
<P>

of the Turk<A NAME = "AO3417"></A> are that the usurper cannot be called in by the princes of 

<P>

the kingdom, nor can he hope to be assisted in his designs by the 
<P>

revolt of those whom the lord has around him. This arises from the 
<P>

reasons given above; for his ministers, being all slaves and 
<P>

bondmen, can only be corrupted with great difficulty, and one can 
<P>

expect little advantage from them when they have been corrupted, as 
<P>

they cannot carry the people with them, for the reasons assigned. 
<P>

Hence, he who attacks the Turk must bear in mind that he will find him 

<P>

united, and he will have to rely more on his own strength than on 
<P>

the revolt of others; but, if once the Turk has been conquered, and 
<P>

routed in the field in such a way that he cannot replace his armies, 
<P>

there is nothing to fear but the family of the prince, and, this being 

<P>

exterminated, there remains no one to fear, the others having no 
<P>

credit with the people; and as the conqueror did not rely on them 
<P>

before his victory, so he ought not to fear them after it. 
<P>

The contrary happens in kingdoms governed like that of France<A NAME = "AS35621"></A><A NAME = "BB35622"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB37712"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, 
<P>

because one can easily enter there by gaining over some baron of the 
<P>

kingdom, for one always finds malcontents and such as desire a change.

<P>

private but from a low and abject position. This man, the son of a 
<P>

potter, through all the changes in his fortunes always led an infamous 

<P>

life. Nevertheless, he accompanied his infamies with so much ability 
<P>

of mind and body that, having devoted himself to the military 
<P>

profession, he rose through its ranks to be Praetor of Syracuse. Being 

<P>

established in that position, and having deliberately resolved to make 

<P>

himself prince and to seize by violence, without obligation to others, 

<P>

that which had been conceded to him by assent, he came to an 
<P>

understanding for this purpose with Hamilcar, the Carthaginian, who, 
<P>

with his army, was fighting in Sicily. One morning he assembled the 
<P>

people and senate of Syracuse, as if he had to discuss with them 
<P>

things relating to the Republic, and at a given signal the soldiers 
<P>

killed all the senators and the richest of the people; these dead, 
<P>

he seized and held the princedom of that city without any civil 
<P>

commotion. And although he was twice routed by the Carthaginians, 
<P>

and ultimately besieged, yet not only was he able to defend his 
<P>

city, but leaving part of his men for its defence, with the others 
<P>

he attacked<A NAME = "AS7985"></A> Africa<A NAME = "AB7988"></A><A HREF = "SPP75.HTM#BB226612"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, and in a short time raised the siege of 
<P>

Syracuse. The Carthaginians, reduced to extreme necessity, were 
<P>

compelled<A NAME = "AS8003"></A> to come to terms with Agathocles<A NAME = "BB80016"></A><A HREF = "SPP27.HTM#BB8114"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, and, leaving Sicily to 
<P>

him, had to be content<A NAME = "AS80111"></A> with the possession<A NAME = "AB80118"></A> of Africa. 
<P>

Therefore, he who considers the actions and the genius of this man 
<P>

will see nothing, or little, which can be attributed to fortune, 
<P>

inasmuch as he attained pre-eminence, as is shown above, not by the 
<P>

every one will confess that it would be most praiseworthy in a 
<P>

prince to exhibit all the above qualities that are considered good; 
<P>

but because they can neither be entirely possessed nor observed, for 
<P>

human conditions do not permit it, it is necessary for him to be 
<P>

sufficiently prudent that he may know how to avoid the reproach of 
<P>

those vices which would lose him his state; and also to keep 
<P>

himself, if it be possible, from those which would not lose him it; 
<P>

but this not being possible, he may with less hesitation abandon 
<P>

himself to them. And again, he need not make himself uneasy at 
<P>

incurring a reproach for those vices without which the state can 
<P>

only be saved with difficulty, for if everything is considered 
<P>

carefully, it will be found that something which looks like virtue, if 

<P>

followed, would be his ruin; whilst something else, which looks like 
<P>

vice, yet followed brings him security and prosperity. 
<P>

<h3>CHAPTER XVI 
<P>

CONCERNING LIBERALITY AND MEANNESS</h3> 
<P>

<P>

COMMENCING then with the first of the above-named characteristics, I 
<P>

say that it would be well to be reputed liberal. Nevertheless, 
<P>

liberality exercised in a way that does not bring you the reputation 
<P>

for it, injures you; for if one exercises it honestly and as it should 

<P>

be exercised, it may not become known, and you will not avoid the 
<P>

reproach of its opposite. Therefore, any one wishing to maintain among 

<P>

men the name of liberal is obliged to avoid no attribute of 
<P>

magnificence; so that a prince thus inclined will consume in such acts 

<P>

all his property<A NAME = "AO15557"></A>, and will be compelled in the end, if he wish to 
<P>

maintain the name of liberal, to unduly weigh down his people, and tax 

<P>

them, and do everything he can to get money. This will soon make him 
<P>

odious to his subjects, and becoming poor he will be little valued 
<P>

again that which they had acquired, they were compelled, in order to 
<P>

secure themselves, to murder him. They had afterwards for their 
<P>

captains Bartolomeo da Bergamo, Roberto da San Severino, the Count 
<P>

of Pitigliano, and the like, under whom they had to dread loss and not 

<P>

gain, as happened afterwards at Vaila, where in one battle they lost 
<P>

that which in eight hundred years they had acquired with so much 
<P>

trouble. Because from such arms conquests come but slowly, long 
<P>

delayed and inconsiderable, but the losses sudden and portentous. 
<P>

<P>

* As Sir John Hawkwood, the English leader of mercenaries, was 
<P>

called by the Italians. 
<P>

<P>

And as with these examples I have reached Italy, which has been 
<P>

ruled for many years by mercenaries, I wish to discuss them more 
<P>

seriously, in order that, having seen their rise and progress, one may 

<P>

be better prepared to counteract them. You must understand that the 
<P>

empire has recently come to be repudiated in Italy, that the Pope 
<P>

has acquired more temporal power, and that Italy has been divided up 
<P>

into more states, for the reason that many of the great cities took up 

<P>

arms<A NAME = "AO12783"></A> against their nobles, who, formerly favoured by the emperor, were 

<P>

oppressing them, whilst the Church was favouring them so as to gain 
<P>

authority in temporal power: in many others their citizens became 
<P>

princes. From this it came to pass that Italy fell partly into the 
<P>

hands of the Church and of republics, and, the Church consisting of 
<P>

priests and the republic of citizens unaccustomed to arms, both 
<P>

commenced to enlist foreigners. 
<P>

The first who gave renown to this soldiery was Alberigo da Conio, 
<P>

a native of the Romagna. From the school of this man sprang, among 
<P>

others, Braccio and Sforza, who in their time were the arbiters of 
<P>

Italy. After these came all the other captains who till now have

times have this difficulty of giving inordinate satisfaction to 
<P>

their soldiers in a far less degree, because, notwithstanding one 
<P>

has to give them some indulgence, that is soon done; none of these 
<P>

princes have armies that are veterans in the governance and 
<P>

administration of provinces, as were the armies of the Roman Empire; 
<P>

and whereas it was then more necessary to give satisfaction to the 
<P>

soldiers than to the people, it is now more necessary to all 
<P>

princes, except the Turk and the Soldan, to satisfy the people 
<P>

rather than the soldiers, because the people are the more powerful. 
<P>

From the above I have excepted the Turk, who always keeps round 
<P>

him twelve infantry and fifteen thousand cavalry on which depend the 
<P>

security and strength of the kingdom, and it is necessary that, 
<P>

putting aside every consideration for the people, he should keep 
<P>

them his friends. The kingdom of the Soldan is similar; being entirely 

<P>

in the hands of soldiers, follows again that, without regard to the 
<P>

people, he must keep them his friends. But you must note that the 
<P>

state<A NAME = "AO20853"></A> of the Soldan is unlike all other principalities, for the reason 

<P>

that it is like the Christian pontificate, which cannot be called 
<P>

either an hereditary or a newly formed principality; because the 
<P>

sons of the old prince not the heirs, but he who is elected to that 
<P>

position by those who have authority, and the sons remain only 
<P>

noblemen. And this being an ancient custom, it cannot be called a 
<P>

new principality, because there are none of those difficulties in it 
<P>

that are met with in new ones; for although the prince is new, the 
<P>

constitution of the state is old, and it is framed so as to receive 
<P>

him as if he were its hereditary lord. 
<P>

But returning to the subject of our discourse, I say that whoever 
<P>

will consider it will acknowledge that either hatred or contempt has 
<P>

been fatal to the above-named emperors, and it will be recognized also 

<P>

how it happened that, a number of them acting in one way and a

friends, to be without faith, without mercy, without religion; such 
<P>

methods may gain empire, but not glory. Still, if the courage of 
<P>

Agathocles<A NAME = "AS8113"></A><A NAME = "BB8114"></A><A HREF = "SPP28.HTM#BB8626"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> in entering into and extricating himself from dangers be 
<P>

considered, together with his greatness of mind in enduring overcoming 

<P>

hardships, it cannot be seen why he should be esteemed less than the 
<P>

most notable captain. Nevertheless, his barbarous cruelty and 
<P>

inhumanity<A NAME = "AO8153"></A><A NAME = "AS8154"></A> with infinite<A NAME = "AB8159"></A> wickednesses do not permit him to be 
<P>

celebrated among the most excellent men. What he achieved cannot be 
<P>

attributed either to fortune or to genius. 
<P>

In our times, during the rule of Alexander VI, Oliverotto da 
<P>

Fermo, having been left an orphan many years before, was brought up by 

<P>

his maternal uncle, Giovanni Fogliani, and in the early days of his 
<P>

youth<A NAME = "AO8213"></A><A NAME = "AS8214"></A> sent to fight under Paolo<A NAME = "AB82115"></A> Vitelli, that, being trained under his 

<P>

discipline, he might attain some high position in the military 
<P>

profession. After Paolo died, he fought under his brother 
<P>

Vitellozzo, and in a very short time, being endowed with wit and a 
<P>

vigorous body and mind, he became the first man in his profession. But 

<P>

it appearing to him a paltry thing to serve under others, he resolved, 

<P>

with the aid of some citizens of Fermo, to whom the slavery of their 
<P>

country was dearer than its liberty, and with the help of the Vitelli, 

<P>

to seize Fermo. So he wrote to Giovanni Fogliani that, having been 
<P>

away from home for many years, he wished to visit him and his city, 
<P>

and in some measure to look into his patrimony; and although he had 
<P>

not laboured to acquire anything except honour, yet, in order that the 

<P>

citizens should see he had not spent his time in vain, he desired to 
<P>

come honourably, so would be accompanied by one hundred horsemen, 
<P>

his friends and retainers; and he entreated Giovanni to arrange that 
<P>

he should be received honourably by the citizens of Fermo, all of 
<P>

which would be not only to his honour, but also to that of Giovanni 
<P>

himself, who had brought him up.

<P>


I shall never hesitate to cite Cesare Borgia and his actions. This 
<P>

duke<A NAME = "AO13503"></A> entered the Romagna with auxiliaries, taking there only French 
<P>

soldiers, and with them he captured Imola and Forli; but afterwards, 
<P>

such forces not appearing to him reliable, he turned to mercenaries, 
<P>

discerning less danger in them, and enlisted the Orsini and Vitelli; 
<P>

whom presently, on handling and finding them doubtful, unfaithful, and 

<P>

dangerous, he destroyed and turned to his own men. And the 
<P>

difference between one and the other of these forces can easily be 
<P>

seen when one considers the difference there was in the reputation 
<P>

of the duke, when he had the French, when he had the Orsini and 
<P>

Vitelli, and when he relied on his own soldiers, on whose fidelity 
<P>

he could always count and found it ever increasing; he was never 
<P>

esteemed more highly than when every one saw that he was complete 
<P>

master of his own forces. 
<P>

I was not intending to go beyond Italian and recent examples, but 
<P>

I am unwilling to leave out Hiero, the Syracusan, he being one of 
<P>

those I have named above. This man, as I have said, made head of the 
<P>

army by the Syracusans, soon found out that a mercenary soldiery, 
<P>

constituted like our Italian condottieri, was of no use; and it 
<P>

appearing to him that he could neither keep them nor let them go, he 
<P>

had them all cut<A NAME = "AO13699"></A> to pieces, and afterwards made war with his own 
<P>

forces and not with aliens. 
<P>

I wish also to recall to memory an instance from the Old Testament 
<P>

applicable to this subject. David offered himself to Saul to fight 
<P>

with Goliath, the Philistine champion, and, to give him courage, 
<P>

Saul<A NAME = "AO13743"></A><A NAME = "AS13744"></A><A NAME = "AB13745"></A> armed him with his own weapons; which David rejected as soon as 
<P>

he had them on his back, saying he could make no use of them, and that 

<P>

he wished to meet the enemy with his sling and his knife. In 
<P>

conclusion, the arms of others either fall from your back, or they 
<P>

weigh you down, or they bind you fast.

and your subjects become your adherents. And whereas all subjects 
<P>

cannot be armed, yet when those whom you do arm are benefited, the 
<P>

others can be handled more freely, and this difference in their 
<P>

treatment, which they quite understand, makes the former your 
<P>

dependants, and the latter, considering it to be necessary that 
<P>

those who have the most danger and service should have the most 
<P>

reward, excuse you. But when you disarm them, you at once offend 
<P>

them by showing that you distrust them, either for cowardice or for 
<P>

want<A NAME = "AO21373"></A> of loyalty, and either of these opinions breeds hatred against 
<P>

you. And because you cannot remain unarmed, it follows that you turn 
<P>

to mercenaries, which are of the character already shown; even if they 

<P>

should be good they would not be sufficient to defend you against 
<P>

powerful enemies and distrusted subjects. Therefore, as I have said, a 

<P>

new<A NAME = "AO21423"></A> prince in a new principality has always distributed arms. 
<P>

Histories are full of examples. But when a prince acquires a new 
<P>

state, which he adds as a province to his old one, then it is 
<P>

necessary to disarm the men of that state, except those who have 
<P>

been his adherents in acquiring it; and these again, with time and 
<P>

opportunity, should be rendered soft and effeminate; and matters 
<P>

should be managed in such a way that all the armed men in the state 
<P>

shall be your own soldiers who in your old state were living near you. 

<P>

3. Our forefathers, and those who were reckoned wise, were 
<P>

accustomed to say that it was necessary to hold Pistoia by factions 
<P>

and Pisa by fortresses; and with this idea they fostered quarrels in 
<P>

some of their tributary towns so as to keep possession of them the 
<P>

more easily. This may have been well enough in those times when 
<P>

Italy was in a way balanced, but I do not believe that it can be 
<P>

accepted as a precept for to-day, because I do not believe that 
<P>

factions can ever be of use; rather it is certain that when the 
<P>

enemy comes upon you in divided cities you are quickly lost, because

ruined. But when a prince declares himself gallantly in favour of 
<P>

one side, if the party with whom he allies himself conquers, 
<P>

although the victor may be powerful and may have him at his mercy, yet 

<P>

he is indebted to him, and there is established a bond of amity; and 
<P>

men are never so shameless as to become a monument of ingratitude by 
<P>

oppressing you. Victories after all are never so complete that the 
<P>

victor must not show some regard, especially to justice. But if he 
<P>

with whom you ally yourself loses, you may be sheltered by him, and 
<P>

whilst he is able he may aid you, and you become companions in a 
<P>

fortune that may rise again. 
<P>

In the second case, when those who fight are of such a character 
<P>

that you have no anxiety as to who may conquer, so much the more is it 

<P>

greater prudence to be allied, because you assist at the destruction 
<P>

of one by the aid of another who, if he had been wise, would have 
<P>

saved him; and conquering, as it is impossible that he should not with 

<P>

your assistance, he remains at your discretion. And here it is to be 
<P>

noted that a prince ought to take care never to make an alliance 
<P>

with one more powerful than himself for the purpose of attacking 
<P>

others, unless necessity compels him, as is said above; because if 
<P>

he conquers you are at his discretion, and princes ought to avoid as 
<P>

much as possible being at the discretion of any one. The Venetians 
<P>

joined with France against the Duke of Milan, and this alliance, which 

<P>

caused their ruin, could have been avoided. But when it cannot be 
<P>

avoided, as happened<A NAME = "AS23327"></A> to the Florentines when the Pope and Spain<A NAME = "BB233224"></A><A HREF = "SPP84.HTM#BB254425"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> sent 
<P>

armies to attack Lombardy, then in such a case, for the above reasons, 

<P>

the prince ought to favour one of the parties. 
<P>

Never let any Government imagine that it can choose perfectly safe 
<P>

courses; rather let it expect to have to take very doubtful ones, 
<P>

because it is found in ordinary affairs that one never seeks to 
<P>

avoid one trouble without running into another; but prudence

number<A NAME = "AO20993"></A> in another, only one in each way came to a happy end and the 
<P>

rest to unhappy ones. Because it would have been useless and dangerous 

<P>

for Pertinax and Alexander, being new princes, to imitate Marcus, 
<P>

who was heir to the principality; and likewise it would have been 
<P>

utterly destructive<A NAME = "AS21035"></A><A NAME = "AS21036"></A> to Caracalla<A NAME = "AB210311"></A>, Commodus<A NAME = "BB210314"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF192412"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, and Maximinus to have 
<P>

imitated Severus, they not having sufficient valour to enable them 
<P>

to tread in his footsteps. Therefore a prince, new to the 
<P>

principality, cannot imitate the actions of Marcus, nor, again, is 
<P>

it necessary to follow those of Severus, but he ought to take from 
<P>

Severus those parts which are necessary to found his state, and from 
<P>

Marcus those which are proper and glorious to keep a state that may 
<P>

already be stable and firm.

<P>

ARE FORTRESSES, AND MANY OTHER<A NAME = "AB211222"></A> THINGS TO WHICH 

PRINCES<A NAME = "AB211233"></A> OFTEN RESORT, ADVANTAGEOUS OR HURTFUL?</h3> 
<P>

<P>

1. SOME princes, so as to hold securely the state, have disarmed 
<P>

their subjects; others have kept their subject towns by factions; 
<P>

others have fostered enmities against themselves; others have laid 
<P>

themselves out to gain over those whom they distrusted in the 
<P>

beginning of their governments; some have built fortresses; some 
<P>

have overthrown and destroyed them. And although one cannot give a 
<P>

final judgment on all one of these things unless one possesses the 
<P>

particulars of those states in which a decision has to be made, 
<P>

nevertheless I will speak as comprehensively as the matter of itself 
<P>

will admit. 
<P>

2. There never was a new prince who has disarmed his subjects; 
<P>

rather when he has found them disarmed he has always armed them, 
<P>

because, by arming them, those arms become yours, those men who were 
<P>

distrusted become faithful, and those who were faithful are kept so,

Giovanni<A NAME = "AO8393"></A>, therefore, did not fail in any attentions due to his 
<P>

nephew, and he caused him to be honourably received by the Fermans, 
<P>

and he lodged him in his own house, where, having passed some days, 
<P>

and having arranged what was necessary for his wicked designs, 
<P>

Oliverotto gave a solemn banquet to which he invited Giovanni Fogliani 

<P>

and the chiefs of Fermo. When the viands and all the other 
<P>

entertainments that are usual in such banquets were finished, 
<P>

Oliverotto<A NAME = "AO8463"></A><A NAME = "AS8464"></A> artfully began certain grave<A NAME = "AB84613"></A> discourses, speaking of the 
<P>

greatness of Pope Alexander and his son Cesare, and of their 
<P>

enterprises, to which discourse Giovanni and others answered; but he 
<P>

rose at once, saying that such matters ought to be discussed in a more 

<P>

private place, and he betook himself to a chamber, whither Giovanni 
<P>

and the rest of the citizens went in after him. No sooner were they 
<P>

seated than soldiers issued from secret places and slaughtered 
<P>

Giovanni and the rest. After these murders Oliverotto, mounted on 
<P>

horseback, rode up and down the town and besieged the chief magistrate 

<P>

in the palace, so that in fear the people were forced to obey him, and 

<P>

to form a government, of which he made himself the prince. He killed 
<P>

all the malcontents<A NAME = "AO8577"></A> who were able to injure him, and strengthened 
<P>

himself with new civil and military ordinances, in such a way that, in 

<P>

the year during which he held the principality, not only was he secure 

<P>

in the city of Fermo, but he had become formidable to all his 
<P>

neighbours. And his destruction would have been as difficult as that 
<P>

of Agathocles<A NAME = "AS8625"></A><A NAME = "BB8626"></A><A HREF = "SPP28.HTM#BB86720"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> if he had not allowed himself to be overreached by 
<P>

Cesare Borgia, who took him with the Orsini and Vitelli at Sinigaglia, 

<P>

as was stated above. Thus one year after he had committed this 
<P>

parricide, he was strangled, together with Vitellozzo, whom he had 
<P>

made his leader in valour and wickedness. 
<P>

Some may wonder how it can happen<A NAME = "AS86715"></A> that Agathocles<A NAME = "BB86720"></A><A HREF = "SPP29.HTM#BB88112"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, and his like, 
<P>

after infinite treacheries and cruelties, should live for long

<P>


Therefore, a prince who has a strong city, and had not made 
<P>

himself odious, will not be attacked, or if any one should attack he 
<P>

will only be driven off with disgrace; again, because that affairs 
<P>

of this world are so changeable, it is almost impossible to keep an 
<P>

army a whole year in the field without being interfered with. And 
<P>

whoever should reply: If the people have property outside the city, 
<P>

and see it burnt, they will not remain patient, and the long siege and 

<P>

self-interest will make them forget their prince; to this I answer 
<P>

that a powerful and courageous prince will overcome all such 
<P>

difficulties by giving at one time hope to his subjects that the 
<P>

evil will not be for long, at another time fear of the cruelty of 
<P>

the enemy, then preserving himself adroitly from those subjects who 
<P>

seem to him to be too bold. 
<P>

Further, the enemy<A NAME = "AO10627"></A> would naturally on his arrival at once burn and 
<P>

ruin the country at the time when the spirits of the people are 
<P>

still hot and ready for the defence; and, therefore, so much the 
<P>

less ought the prince to hesitate; because after a time, when 
<P>

spirits have cooled, the damage is already done, the ills are 
<P>

incurred, and there is no longer any remedy; and therefore they are so 

<P>

much the more ready to unite with their prince, he appearing to be 
<P>

under obligations to them now that their houses have been burnt and 
<P>

their possessions ruined in his defence. For it is the nature of men 
<P>

to be bound by the benefits they confer as much as by those they 
<P>

receive. Therefore, if everything is well considered, it wilt not be 
<P>

difficult for a wise prince to keep the minds of his citizens 
<P>

steadfast from first to last, when he does not fail to support and 
<P>

defend them.

consider that it is better to be adventurous than cautious, because 
<P>

fortune is a woman, and if you wish to keep her under it is 
<P>

necessary to beat and ill-use her; and it is seen that she allows

herself to be mastered by the adventurous rather than by those who 
<P>

go to work more coldly. She is, therefore, always, woman-like, a lover

<h3>CHAPTER XXVI 
<P>

AN EXHORTATION TO LIBERATE ITALY FROM THE BARBARIANS</h3> 
<P>

<P>

HAVING carefully considered the subject of the above discourses, and 
<P>

wondering within myself whether the present times were propitious to a 

<P>

new prince, and whether there were the elements that would give an 
<P>

opportunity to a wise and virtuous one to introduce a new order of 
<P>

things which would do honour to him and good to the people of this 
<P>

country, it appears to me that so many things concur to favour a new 
<P>

prince that I never knew a time more fit than the present. 
<P>

And if, as I said, it was necessary that the people<A NAME = "AS262723"></A> of Israel<A NAME = "BB262728"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF4778"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> should 
<P>

be captive so as to make manifest the ability of Moses; that the 
<P>

Persians<A NAME = "AO26293"></A> should be oppressed by the Medes so as to discover the 
<P>

greatness of the soul of Cyrus; and that the Athenians should be 
<P>

dispersed to illustrate the capabilities of Theseus: then at the 
<P>

present time, in order to discover the virtue of an Italian spirit, it 

<P>

was necessary that Italy should be reduced to the extremity she is now 

<P>

in, that she should be more enslaved than the Hebrews, more 
<P>

oppressed than the Persians, more scattered than the Athenians; 
<P>

without head, without order, beaten, despoiled, torn, overrun; and 
<P>

to have endured every kind of desolation.

Although lately some spark may have been shown by one, which made us

<P>
While the committee's<A NAME = "AO2995"></A><A NAME = "AS2996"></A> basic thrust is toward a wider use of cryptography<A NAME = "BB29925"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB332301"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> throughout society, considerable time can be expected 
to elapse before cryptography is truly ubiquitous.  Thus, law<A NAME = "AO29959"></A><A NAME = "AS29960"></A><A NAME = "AS29961"></A><A NAME = "BB29962"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB332161"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> enforcement and national<A NAME = "BB29969"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB3033"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> security authorities have a window in which
 to develop new capabilities for addressing future challenges.  Such development should be supported, because these capabilities 
are almost certain to have a greater impact on their future information collection efforts than will aggressive<A NAME = "AO299152"></A><A NAME = "AS299153"></A> attempts to promote
 escrowed encryption<A NAME = "BB299165"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB301137"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> to a resistant market.<BR>



<P>An example of such support would be the establishment of a technical center for helping federal, state<A NAME = "AO30133"></A><A NAME = "AS30134"></A><A NAME = "AS30135"></A>, and local law<A NAME = "BB30142"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB301280"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> 
enforcement authorities with technical<A NAME = "AB30152"></A> problems associated with new information technologies.      This recommendation<A NAME = "AO30169"></A><A NAME = "AS30170"></A><A NAME = "AS30171"></A><A NAME = "AS30172"></A><A NAME = "AS30173"></A><A NAME = "AS30174"></A><A NAME = "AS30175"></A> is consistent with 
the FBI<A NAME = "AB30187"></A> proposal for a technical<A NAME = "AB30196"></A> support center (TSC) to serve as a central national law<A NAME = "AB301119"></A> enforcement resource to address problems 
related to encryption<A NAME = "BB301137"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB301255"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> and to technological<A NAME = "AB301144"></A> problems with an impact on access to electronic<A NAME = "BB301161"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF283312"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> communications and stored information [4].  
Such a center<A NAME = "AO301181"></A><A NAME = "AS301182"></A><A NAME = "AS301183"></A> would of course address individuals' use of unescrowed<A NAME = "BB301200"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF10928"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> encryption in the commission of criminal<A NAME = "AB301213"></A> acts; capabilities 
usable in open<A NAME = "AO301225"></A><A NAME = "AS301226"></A> court to deal with this problem will be necessary whether or not escrowed encryption<A NAME = "BB301255"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB30354"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> is widely deployed.  A second<A NAME = "AO301266"></A><A NAME = "AS301267"></A><A NAME = "AS301268"></A> 
problem of concern to law<A NAME = "BB301280"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB301341"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> enforcement authorities is obtaining the digital<A NAME = "AB301293"></A> stream carrying the targeted communications, a task that 
will grow more complex as the sophistication of applications and technology increases.  Law<A NAME = "AO301337"></A><A NAME = "AS301338"></A><A NAME = "AS301339"></A><A NAME = "AS301340"></A><A NAME = "BB301341"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB301412"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> enforcement authorities will need access
 to considerable technical<A NAME = "AB301359"></A> skill to extract useful information out of the digital<A NAME = "AB301378"></A> streams involved.  Such a center<A NAME = "AO301389"></A><A NAME = "AS301390"></A><A NAME = "AS301391"></A><A NAME = "AS301392"></A> could be quite
 useful to state and local law<A NAME = "BB301412"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF57260"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> enforcement authorities who currently lack the level of access to National<A NAME = "AB301435"></A> Security Agency (NSA)

<H2><B>THE POLICY RELATIONSHIP BETWEEN</B></H2>

<H2><B>INFORMATION SECURITY AND CRYPTOGRAPHY</B></H2>

<P>Although the committee<A NAME = "AO3125"></A><A NAME = "AS3126"></A> was asked to address national cryptography<A NAME = "BB31219"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB31283"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy, any such policy is necessarily only one component of a
 national information security policy.  Without a forward-looking and comprehensive national information security policy, changes<A NAME = "AO31273"></A><A NAME = "AS31274"></A><A NAME = "AS31275"></A>
 in national cryptography<A NAME = "BB31283"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB320259"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy may have little operational<A NAME = "AB31294"></A> impact on U.S. information security.  Thus, the committee believes 
it cannot leave unaddressed the question of a national information security policy, although it recognizes that it was not 
specifically chartered with such a broad issue in mind.<BR>



<P><U><B>Recommendation 6:</U>  The U.S<A NAME = "AO31411"></A><A NAME = "AS31412"></A>. government should develop a mechanism to promote information security in the private<A NAME = "BB31437"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB31690"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> sector.</B><BR>



<P>The committee<A NAME = "AO3163"></A><A NAME = "AS3164"></A> makes Recommendation<A NAME = "AB3169"></A> 6 based on the observation that the U.S. government itself is not well organized to meet the 
challenges posed by an information society.  Indeed, no<A NAME = "AO31661"></A><A NAME = "AS31662"></A><A NAME = "AS31663"></A> government<A NAME = "AB31666"></A> agency has the responsibility to promote information security in the 
private<A NAME = "BB31690"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB31848"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> sector.  The information<A NAME = "AO31697"></A><A NAME = "AS31698"></A> security<A NAME = "AB316101"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB322179"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> interests of most of the private sector have no formal place at the policy-making table: the 
National<A NAME = "AO316139"></A><A NAME = "AS316140"></A><A NAME = "AS316141"></A><A NAME = "AB316142"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB44428"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> Security Agency represents the classified government<A NAME = "AB316155"></A> community, while the charter<A NAME = "AO316164"></A><A NAME = "AS316165"></A> of the National<A NAME = "AB316172"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB502203"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> Institute of Standards and 
Technology directs it to focus on the unclassified needs of the government (and its budget is inadequate to do more than that).  Other 
organizations such as the Information<A NAME = "AO316241"></A><A NAME = "AS316242"></A><A NAME = "AS316243"></A><A NAME = "AS316244"></A><A NAME = "AB316245"></A> Infrastructure Task Force and the Office<A NAME = "AB316258"></A> of Management and Budget have broad influence but few 
operational<A NAME = "AB316280"></A> responsibilities.  As a result, business<A NAME = "AO316291"></A><A NAME = "AS316292"></A><A NAME = "AS316293"></A> and individual stakeholders do not have adequate representation in the development of 
information security<A NAME = "AB316323"></A> standards and export<A NAME = "AB316330"></A> regimes.<BR>



<P>For these reasons, the nation<A NAME = "AO3189"></A><A NAME = "AS31810"></A> requires a mechanism that will provide accountability and focus for efforts to promote information
 security in the private<A NAME = "BB31848"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB32017"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> sector.  The need for information security cuts across many dimensions of the economy and the national 
interest, suggesting that absent a coordinated approach to promoting information security, the needs of many stakeholders may well be 
given inadequate attention and notice.<BR>



<P>The importance<A NAME = "AO3203"></A><A NAME = "AS3204"></A> of close cooperation with the private<A NAME = "BB32017"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB32076"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> sector cannot be overemphasized.  While the U.S<A NAME = "AO32032"></A>. government has played an 
important role in promoting information security in the past, information<A NAME = "AO32062"></A><A NAME = "AS32063"></A><A NAME = "AS32064"></A> security<A NAME = "BB32067"></A><A HREF = "SPAP3.HTM#AF12564"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> needs in the private<A NAME = "BB32076"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB320130"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> sector in the information age 
will be larger than ever before (as argued in Recommendation 3).  Thus, close<A NAME = "AO320116"></A><A NAME = "AS320117"></A> consultations between government and the private<A NAME = "BB320130"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB32231"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> 
sector are needed before policy decisions are made that affect how those needs can be addressed.  Many stakeholders outside government
 have criticized what they believe to be an inadequate representation of the private sector at the decision-making table.  The 
committee<A NAME = "AO320216"></A><A NAME = "AS320217"></A><A NAME = "AS320218"></A> believes that the policy-making process requires better ways for representing broadly both government and nongovernment<A NAME = "BB320251"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF12119"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> 
interests in cryptography<A NAME = "BB320259"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB322216"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy.  Those who are pursuing enhanced information security and those who have a need for legal access to 
stored or communicated information must both be included in a robust process for managing the often-competing issues and interests 
that will inevitably arise over time.  <BR>



<P>How might the policy<A NAME = "AO3227"></A><A NAME = "AS3228"></A>-making process include better representation<A NAME = "AB32219"></A> of nongovernment interests?  Private<A NAME = "AO32229"></A><A NAME = "AS32230"></A><A NAME = "BB32231"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB322134"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> sector advisors or 
representatives are often used when policy cuts across many functional and organizational boundaries and interests both inside<A NAME = "AO32273"></A> and outside 
government, and information security certainly falls into this &quot;cross-cutting&quot; category.  The government<A NAME = "AO322107"></A><A NAME = "AS322108"></A><A NAME = "AS322109"></A><A NAME = "AS322110"></A> might consider the 
appointment of fully cleared parties from the private<A NAME = "BB322134"></A><A HREF = "SPP10.HTM#BB326329"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> sector who could participate in government<A NAME = "AB322147"></A> policy discussions relevant to export 
control decisions and/or decisions that affect the information security<A NAME = "BB322179"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF316101"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> interests of the private sector.  (Despite the committee's 
conclusion that the broad<A NAME = "AO322206"></A><A NAME = "AS322207"></A> outlines of national cryptography<A NAME = "BB322216"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB34016"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy can be argued on an unclassified basis, classified information may 
nevertheless be invoked in such discussions and uncleared participants would be unable to contribute.  Clearances for these individuals are 
necessary to preclude this possibility.)<BR>



<P>In those areas in which the secure operation of information systems is critical to the nation's welfare--information systems 
that are invested with the public trust, such as those of the banking and financial system, the public<A NAME = "AO32474"></A><A NAME = "AS32475"></A> switched telecommunications<A NAME = "BB32480"></A><A HREF = "SPAP3.HTM#AF4143"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> 
network, the air traffic control system, and the electric power grid--government has an important role in actively promoting security
.  In other sectors of the economy, the role of the U.S. government should be limited to providing information and expertise.  
Building on existing private-public partnerships and private sector efforts in disseminating information, the government<A NAME = "AO324194"></A><A NAME = "AS324195"></A> should take a 
vigorous and proactive role in collecting and disseminating information to promote awareness of the information security<A NAME = "AB324235"></A> threat.<BR>



<P>The committee does not make a recommendation on its specific form because its charter did not call for it to address the 
question of government organization.  Such a mechanism<A NAME = "AO32658"></A><A NAME = "AS32659"></A> could be a new coordinating office for information security in the Executive<A NAME = "AB32684"></A> 
Office of the President.  It could be one or more existing agencies or organizations with a new charter or set of responsibilities.  
It could be a new government agency or organization, although in the current political climate such an agency would demand the 
most compelling justification.  It could be a quasi-governmental body or a governmentally chartered private organization, examples 
of which are described in Chapter 6.  Because of the NSA's role within the defense and intelligence communities and its consequent
 concern about defense and intelligence threats and systems, the committee<A NAME = "AO326272"></A><A NAME = "AS326273"></A><A NAME = "AS326274"></A> believes that the NSA<A NAME = "AB326283"></A> is not the proper agency to 
assume primary responsibility for a mission that is primarily oriented toward the needs of the private<A NAME = "BB326329"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB36438"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> sector.  At the same time, 
experts from all parts of the U.S. government should be encouraged to assist in analyzing vulnerabilities; if such assistance<A NAME = "AO326379"></A><A NAME = "AS326380"></A> requires 
new legislative<A NAME = "AB326388"></A> authority, such authority should be sought from Congress.<BR>

of Alexander. He was no sooner in Milan<A NAME = "AO60917"></A><A NAME = "AS60918"></A><A NAME = "BB60919"></A><A HREF = "SPP74.HTM#BB223422"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> than the Pope had soldiers 
<P>

from him for the attempt on the Romagna, which yielded to him on the 
<P>

reputation of the king. The duke, therefore, having acquired the 
<P>

Romagna<A NAME = "AO6123"></A> and beaten the Colonna, while wishing to hold that and to 
<P>

advance further, was hindered by two things: the one, his forces did 
<P>

not appear loyal to him, the other, the goodwill<A NAME = "AS61419"></A><A NAME = "AB61420"></A> of France: that is to 

<P>

say, he feared that the forces of the Orsini, which was using, would 
<P>

not stand to him, that not only might they hinder him from winning 
<P>

more, but might themselves seize what he had won, and that the King 
<P>

might also do the same. Of the Orsini he had a warning when, after 
<P>

taking<A NAME = "AS6193"></A> Faenza and attacking Bologna<A NAME = "AB61912"></A><A HREF = "SPP37.HTM#BB113724"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, he saw them go very unwillingly 
<P>

to that attack. And as to the king, he learned his mind when he 
<P>

himself, after taking<A NAME = "AS6217"></A> the duchy of Urbino<A NAME = "AB62116"></A><A HREF = "SPP21.HTM#BB63421"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, attacked Tuscany, and the 
<P>

king made him desist from that undertaking; hence the duke decided 
<P>

to depend no more upon the arms and the luck of others. 
<P>

For the first thing he weakened the Orsini and Colonna parties in 
<P>

Rome<A NAME = "AS6253"></A><A NAME = "AB6254"></A><A HREF = "SPP22.HTM#BB68818"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, by gaining to himself all their adherents who were gentlemen, 
<P>

making them his gentlemen, giving them good pay, and, according to 
<P>

their rank, honouring them with office and command in such a way 
<P>

that in a few months all attachment to the factions was destroyed

<P>


doubtful and full of dangers, he must be a very rare friend, or a 
<P>

thoroughly obstinate enemy of the prince, to keep faith with you. 
<P>

And, to reduce the matter into a small compass, I say that, on the 
<P>

side of the conspirator, there is nothing but fear, jealousy, prospect 

<P>

of punishment to terrify him; but on the side of the prince there is 
<P>

the majesty of the principality, the laws, the protection of friends 
<P>

and the state to defend him; so that, adding to all these things the 
<P>

popular goodwill, it is impossible that any one should be so rash as 
<P>

to conspire. For whereas in general the conspirator has to fear before 

<P>

the execution of his plot, in this case he has also to fear the sequel 

<P>

to the crime; because on account of it he has the people for an enemy, 

<P>

and thus cannot hope for any escape. 
<P>

Endless examples could be given on this subject, but I will be 
<P>

content with one, brought to pass within the memory of our fathers. 
<P>

Messer Annibale Bentivoglio, who was prince<A NAME = "AS187313"></A> in Bologna<A NAME = "BB187318"></A><A HREF = "SPP62.HTM#BB18798"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> (grandfather of 

<P>

the present Annibale), having been murdered by the Canneschi, who 
<P>

had conspired against him, not one of his family survived but Messer 
<P>

Giovanni, who was in childhood: immediately after his assassination 
<P>

the people rose and murdered all the Canneschi. This sprung from the 
<P>

popular goodwill which the house of Bentivoglio enjoyed in those 
<P>

days<A NAME = "AS18793"></A> in Bologna<A NAME = "BB18798"></A><A HREF = "SPP73.HTM#BB221820"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>; which was so great that, although none remained there 

<P>

after the death<A NAME = "AO18807"></A><A NAME = "AS18808"></A><A NAME = "AB18809"></A> of Annibale who were able to rule the state, the 
<P>

Bolognese, having information that there was one of the Bentivoglio 
<P>

family in Florence, who up to that time had been considered the son of 

<P>

a blacksmith, sent to Florence for him and gave him the government 
<P>

of their city, and it was ruled by him until Messer Giovanni came in 
<P>

due course to the government. 
<P>

For this reason I consider that a prince ought to reckon 
<P>

conspiracies of little account when his people hold him in esteem; but 

<P>

when it is hostile to him, and bears hatred towards him, he ought to

fear everything and everybody. And well-ordered states and wise 
<P>

princes have taken every care not to drive the nobles to 
<P>

desperation, and to keep the people satisfied and contented, for 
<P>

this is one of the most important objects a prince can have. 
<P>

Among the best<A NAME = "AS18937"></A> ordered and governed kingdoms of our times is France<A NAME = "BB189326"></A><A HREF = "SPP67.HTM#BB201024"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, 
<P>

and in it are found many good institutions on which depend the liberty 

<P>

and security of the king; of these the first is the parliament and its 

<P>

authority, because he who founded the kingdom, knowing the ambition of 

<P>

the nobility and their boldness, considered that a bit in their mouths 

<P>

would be necessary to hold them in; and, on the other side, knowing 
<P>

the hatred of the people, founded in fear, against the nobles, he 
<P>

wished to protect them, yet he was not anxious for this to be the 
<P>

particular care of the king; therefore, to take away the reproach 
<P>

which he would be liable to from the nobles for favouring the 
<P>

people, and from the people for favouring the nobles, he set up an 
<P>

arbiter, who should be one who could beat down the great and favour 
<P>

the lesser without reproach to the king. Neither could you have a 
<P>

better or a more prudent arrangement, or a greater source of 
<P>

security to the king and kingdom. From this one can draw another 
<P>

important conclusion, that princes ought to leave affairs of 
<P>

reproach<A NAME = "AO19093"></A><A NAME = "AS19094"></A><A NAME = "AB19095"></A> to the management of others, and keep those of grace in their 

<P>

own hands. And further, I consider that a prince ought to cherish 
<P>

the nobles, but not so as to make himself hated by the people. 
<P>

It may appear, perhaps, to some who have examined the lives and 
<P>

deaths of the Roman emperors that many of them would be an example 
<P>

contrary to my opinion, seeing that some of them lived nobly and 
<P>

showed great qualities of soul, nevertheless they have lost their 
<P>

empire or have been killed by subjects who have conspired against 
<P>

them. Wishing, therefore, to answer these objections, I will recall 
<P>

the characters<A NAME = "AO19185"></A> of some of the emperors, and will show that the

Office of the Office of Naval Research, Kevin<A NAME = "AB50464"></A> Hale and Kimberly<A NAME = "AB50471"></A> Striker of the NRC's National Security Office had the complex task of 
facilitating the prompt processing of security<A NAME = "BB504109"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB504141"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> clearances necessary to complete this study in a timely manner and otherwise managing these

 was assigned.  She sat with the committee during the great majority of its meetings, providing not only essential insight into 
the NRC process but also an indispensable long-term perspective on how this report could build on other CSTB work, most notably the
 1991 NRC report <I>Computers at Risk</I>.  John Godfrey, research associate for CSTB, was responsible for developing most of the 
factual material in most of the appendixes as well as for tracking down hundreds of loose ends; his prior<A NAME = "AO504436"></A><A NAME = "AS504437"></A><A NAME = "AS504438"></A> work on a previous NRC<A NAME = "AB504449"></A> report
 on standards also provided an important point of departure for the committee's discussion on standards as they apply to 
cryptography<A NAME = "BB504494"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB504554"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy.  Frank Pittelli is a consultant to CSTB, whose prior<A NAME = "AO504515"></A><A NAME = "AS504516"></A><A NAME = "AS504517"></A> experience in computer and information security was invaluable in 
framing a discussion of technical<A NAME = "AB504547"></A> issues in cryptography<A NAME = "BB504554"></A><A HREF = "SPP25.HTM#BB670109"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy.  Gail Pritchard, project assistant for CSTB, handled logistical 
matters for the committee with the utmost skill and patience as well as providing some research support to the committee.  Finally, 
Herb Lin, senior staff officer for CSTB and study director on this project, arranged briefings, crafted meeting agendas, and turned 
the thoughts of committee members into drafts and then report text.  I

t <A NAME = "AO504686"></A>is fair to say that this study could not have been carried out nor this report written, especially on our accelerated 
schedule, without his prodigious energy and his extraordinary talents as study director, committee coordinator, writer, and editor.<BR>

Alexander, being all men of modest life, lovers of justice, enemies to

thus, having given cause for hatred, to which hatred there was added 
<P>

contempt for his old age, he was overthrown at the very beginning of 
<P>

his administration. And here it should be noted that hatred is 
<P>

acquired as much by good works as by bad ones, therefore, as I said 
<P>

before, a prince wishing to keep his state is very often forced to 
<P>

do evil; for when that body is corrupt whom you think you have need of 

<P>

to maintain yourself- it may be either the people or the soldiers or 
<P>

the nobles- you have to submit to its humours and to gratify them, and 

<P>

then good works will do you harm. 
<P>

But let us come to Alexander, who was a man of such great 
<P>

goodness, that among the other praises which are accorded him is this, 

<P>

that in the fourteen years he held the empire no one was ever put to 
<P>

death by him unjudged; nevertheless, being considered effeminate and a 

<P>

man who allowed himself to be governed by his mother, he became 
<P>

despised, the army conspired against him, and murdered him.

<strong>This is a full-text facsimile of the original document.</STRONG>
<P>


one will never find himself deceived in them, and it will be shown 
<P>

that he has laid his foundations well. 
<P>

These principalities are liable to danger when they are passing from 
<P>

the civil to the absolute order of government, for such princes either 

<P>

rule personally or through magistrates. In the latter case their 
<P>

government is weaker and more insecure, because it rests entirely on 
<P>

the goodwill<A NAME = "AO9955"></A><A NAME = "AS9956"></A> of those citizens who are raised to the magistracy<A NAME = "AB99525"></A>, and 
<P>

who, especially in troubled times, can destroy the government with 
<P>

great ease, either by intrigue or open defiance; and the prince has 
<P>

not the chance amid tumults to exercise absolute authority, because 
<P>

the citizens and subjects, accustomed to receive orders from 
<P>

magistrates, are not of a mind to obey him amid these confusions, 
<P>

and there will always be in doubtful times a scarcity of men whom he 
<P>

can trust. For such a prince cannot rely upon what he observes in 
<P>

quiet times, when citizens had need of the state, because then every 
<P>

one agrees with him; they all promise, and when death is far distant 
<P>

they all wish to die for him; but in troubled times, when the state 
<P>

has need of its citizens, then he finds but few. And so much the 
<P>

more is this experiment dangerous, inasmuch as it can only be tried 
<P>

once. Therefore a wise prince ought to adopt such a course that his 
<P>

citizens will always in every sort and kind of circumstance have 
<P>

need of the state and of him, and then he will always find them 
<P>

faithful. 
<P>

<h3>CHAPTER<A NAME = "AS10132"></A><A NAME = "AS10133"></A><A NAME = "AB10134"></A> X 
<P>

CONCERNING THE WAY IN WHICH THE STRENGTH<A NAME = "AB101325"></A> 

OF ALL PRINCIPALITIES OUGHT TO BE MEASURED</h3> 
<P>

<P>

IT IS necessary to consider another point in examining the character 
<P>

of these principalities: that is, whether a prince has such power 
<P>

that, in case of need, he can support himself with his own 
<P>
<P>

be seen happy to-day and ruined to-morrow without having shown any 
<P>

change of disposition or character. This, I believe, arises firstly 
<P>

from causes that have already been discussed at length, namely, that 
<P>

the prince who relies entirely upon fortune is lost when it changes. I 

<P>

believe also that he will be successful who directs his actions 
<P>

according to the spirit of the times, and that he whose actions do not 

<P>

accord with the times will not be successful. Because men are seen, in 

<P>

affairs that lead to the end which every man has before him, namely, 
<P>

glory and riches, to get there by various methods; one with caution, 
<P>

another with haste; one by force, another by skill; one by patience, 
<P>

another by its opposite; and each one succeeds in reaching the goal by 

<P>

a different method. One can also see of two cautious men the one 
<P>

attain his end, the other fail; and similarly, two men by different 
<P>

observances are equally successful, the one being cautious, the 
<P>

other impetuous; all this arises from nothing else than whether or not 

<P>

they conform in their methods to the spirit of the times. This follows 

<P>

from what I have said, that two men working differently bring about 
<P>

the same effect, and of two working similarly, one attains his 
<P>

object and the other does not. 
<P>

Changes<A NAME = "AS25683"></A> in estate<A NAME = "AB25688"></A> also issue from this, for if, to one who governs 
<P>

himself with caution and patience, times and affairs converge in 
<P>

such a way that his administration is successful, his fortune is made; 

<P>

but if times and affairs change, he is ruined if he does not change 
<P>

his course of action. But a man is not often found sufficiently 
<P>

circumspect to know how to accommodate himself to the change, both 
<P>

because he cannot deviate from what nature inclines him to, and also 
<P>

because, having always prospered by acting in one way, he cannot be 
<P>

persuaded that it is well to leave it; and, therefore, the cautious 
<P>

man, when it is time to turn adventurous, does not know how to do 
<P>

it, hence he is ruined; but had he changed his conduct with the

<P>


And although ancient histories may be full of examples, I do not 
<P>

wish to leave this recent one of Pope Julius II, the peril of which 
<P>

cannot fall to be perceived; for he, wishing to get Ferrara, threw 
<P>

himself entirely into the hands of the foreigner. But his good fortune 

<P>

brought about a third event, so that he did not reap the fruit of 
<P>

his rash choice; because, having auxiliaries routed at Ravenna, and 
<P>

the Switzers having risen and driven out the conquerors (against all 
<P>

expectation, both his and others), it so came to pass that he did 
<P>

not become prisoner to his enemies, they having fled, nor to his 
<P>

auxiliaries, he having conquered by other arms than theirs. 
<P>

The Florentines, being entirely without arms, sent ten thousand 
<P>

Frenchmen to take Pisa, whereby they ran more danger than at any other 

<P>

time of their troubles. 
<P>

The Emperor<A NAME = "AS13325"></A><A NAME = "AB13326"></A> of Constantinople, to oppose his neighbours, sent ten 
<P>

thousand<A NAME = "AS13333"></A> Turks into Greece<A NAME = "BB133310"></A><A HREF = "SPP76.HTM#BB229513"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, who, on the war being finished, were not 
<P>

willing to quit; this was the beginning<A NAME = "AS133415"></A> of the servitude<A NAME = "AB133422"></A> of Greece 
<P>

to the infidels. 
<P>

Therefore, let him who has no desire to conquer make use of these 
<P>

arms, for they are much more hazardous than mercenaries, because 
<P>

with them the ruin is ready made; they are all united, all yield 
<P>

obedience to others; but with mercenaries, when they have conquered, 
<P>

more time and better opportunities are needed to injure you; they 
<P>

are not all of one community, they are found and paid by you, and a 
<P>

third party, which you have made their head, is not able all at once 
<P>

to assume enough authority to injure you. In conclusion, in 
<P>

mercenaries<A NAME = "AO13443"></A><A NAME = "AS13444"></A> dastardy<A NAME = "AB13447"></A> is most dangerous; in auxiliaries, valour. The 
<P>

wise prince, therefore, has always avoided these arms and turned to 
<P>

his own; and has been willing rather to lose with them than to conquer 

<P>

with others, not deeming that a real victory which is gained with 
<P>

the arms of others.

expense. Therefore it is necessary to be prepared with such arms, so 
<P>

that you can be defended against foreigners by Italian valour. 
<P>

And although Swiss<A NAME = "AO27017"></A><A NAME = "AS27018"></A> and Spanish<A NAME = "AB270113"></A> infantry may be considered very 
<P>

formidable, nevertheless there is a defect in both, by reason of which 

<P>

a third order would not only be able to oppose them, but might be 
<P>

relied upon to overthrow them. For the Spaniards cannot resist 
<P>

cavalry<A NAME = "AO27053"></A>, and the Switzers are afraid of infantry whenever they 
<P>

encounter them in close combat. Owing to this, as has been and may 
<P>

again be seen, the Spaniards<A NAME = "AO270711"></A><A NAME = "AS270712"></A> are unable to resist French<A NAME = "AB270723"></A> cavalry, 
<P>

and the Switzers<A NAME = "AO27087"></A> are overthrown by infantry. And although a complete 
<P>

proof of this latter cannot be shown, nevertheless there was some 
<P>

evidence of it at the battle of Ravenna, when the Spanish infantry 
<P>

were confronted by German battalions, who follow the same tactics as 
<P>

the Swiss; when the Spaniards, by agility of body and with the aid 
<P>

of their shields, got in under the pikes of the Germans and stood 
<P>

out of danger, able to attack, while the Germans<A NAME = "AO271419"></A> stood helpless, 
<P>

and, if the cavalry had not dashed up, all would have been over with 
<P>

them. It is possible, therefore, knowing the defects of both these 
<P>

infantries<A NAME = "AO27173"></A><A NAME = "AS27174"></A><A NAME = "AB27175"></A>, to invent a new one, which will resist cavalry and not 
<P>

be afraid of infantry; this need not create a new order of arms, but a 

<P>

variation upon the old. And these are the kind of improvements which 
<P>

confer reputation and power upon a new prince. 
<P>

This opportunity, therefore, ought not to be allowed to pass for 
<P>

letting Italy at last see her liberator appear. Nor can one express 
<P>

the love with which he would be received in all those provinces 
<P>

which have suffered so much from these foreign scourings, with what 
<P>

thirst for revenge, with what stubborn faith, with what devotion, with 

<P>

what tears. What door would be closed to him? Who would refuse 
<P>

obedience to him? What envy would hinder him? What Italian would 
<P>

refuse him homage? To all of us this barbarous dominion stinks. Let,

<P>


to be prepared at once to hold that which fortune has thrown into 
<P>

their laps, and that those foundations, which others have laid 
<P>

before they became princes, they must lay afterwards. 
<P>

Concerning these two methods of rising to be a prince by ability 
<P>

or fortune, I wish to adduce two examples within our own recollection, 

<P>

and these are Francesco Sforza and Cesare Borgia. Francesco, by proper 

<P>

means and with great ability, from being a private person rose to be 
<P>

Duke<A NAME = "AS5763"></A><A NAME = "AB5764"></A><A HREF = "SPP19.HTM#BB5975"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> of Milan, and that which he had acquired with a thousand 
<P>

anxieties he kept with little trouble. On the other hand, Cesare 
<P>

Borgia, called by the people Duke Valentino, acquired his state during 

<P>

the ascendancy of his father, and on its decline he lost it, 
<P>

notwithstanding that he had taken every measure and done all that 
<P>

ought to be done by a wise and able man to fix firmly his roots in the 

<P>

states which the arms and fortunes of others had bestowed on him. 
<P>

Because, as is stated above, he who has not first laid his 
<P>

foundations may be able with great ability to lay them afterwards, but 

<P>

they will be laid with trouble to the architect and danger to the 
<P>

building. If, therefore, all the steps taken by the duke be 
<P>

considered, it will be seen that he laid solid foundations for his 
<P>

future power, and I do not consider it superfluous to discuss them, 
<P>

because I do not know what better precepts to give a new prince than 
<P>

the example of his actions; and if his dispositions were of no 
<P>

avail, that was not his fault, but the extraordinary and extreme 
<P>

malignity of fortune. 
<P>

Alexander VI, in wishing to aggrandize the duke, his son, had many 
<P>

immediate and prospective difficulties. Firstly, he did not see his 
<P>

way to make him master of any state that was not a state of the 
<P>

Church; and if he was willing to rob the Church he knew that the 
<P>

Duke<A NAME = "AO5973"></A><A NAME = "AS5974"></A><A NAME = "BB5975"></A><A HREF = "SPP36.HTM#BB11046"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> of Milan and the Venetians would not consent, because Faenza 
<P>

and Rimini were already under the protection of the Venetians. Besides

to hold the empire, for, being the son of Marcus, he had inherited it, 

<P>

and he had only to follow in the footsteps of his father to please his 

<P>

people and soldiers; but, being by nature cruel and brutal, he gave 
<P>

himself up to amusing the soldiers and corrupting them, so that he 
<P>

might indulge his rapacity upon the people; on the other hand, not 
<P>

maintaining his dignity, often descending to the theatre to compete 
<P>

with gladiators, and doing other vile things, little worthy of the 
<P>

imperial majesty, he fell into contempt with the soldiers, and being 
<P>

hated by one party and despised by the other, he was conspired against 

<P>

and killed. 
<P>

It remains to discuss the character of Maximinus. He was a very 
<P>

warlike man, and the armies, being disgusted with the effeminacy of 
<P>

Alexander, of whom I have already spoken, killed him and elected 
<P>

Maximinus to the throne. This he did not possess for long, for two 
<P>

things made him hated and despised; the one, his having kept sheep 
<P>

in Thrace, which brought him into contempt (it being well known to 
<P>

all, and considered a great indignity by every one), and the other, 
<P>

his having at the accession<A NAME = "AO205611"></A><A NAME = "AS205612"></A> to his dominions deferred going to Rome<A NAME = "BB205627"></A><A HREF = "SPP68.HTM#BB20597"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> 
<P>

and taking possession of the imperial seat; he had also gained a 
<P>

reputation for the utmost ferocity by having, through his prefects 
<P>

in Rome<A NAME = "AO20595"></A><A NAME = "AS20596"></A><A NAME = "BB20597"></A><A HREF = "SPP86.HTM#BB259526"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> and elsewhere in the empire, practised many cruelties, so that 

<P>

the whole world was moved to anger at the meanness of his birth and to 

<P>

fear at his barbarity. First Africa rebelled, then the Senate with all 

<P>

the people of Rome, and all Italy conspired against him, to which 
<P>

may be added his own army: this latter, besieging<A NAME = "AS206319"></A> Aquileia<A NAME = "AB206322"></A> and meeting 

<P>

with difficulties in taking it, were disgusted with his cruelties, and 

<P>

fearing him less when they found so many against him, murdered him. 
<P>

I do not<A NAME = "AO20667"></A> wish to discuss Heliogabalus, Macrinus, or Julian, who, 
<P>

being thoroughly contemptible, were quickly wiped out; but I will 
<P>

bring this discourse to a conclusion by saying that princes in our

<P>


therefore, your illustrious house take up this charge with that 
<P>

courage and hope with which all just enterprises are undertaken, so 
<P>

that under its standard our native country may be ennobled, and 
<P>

under its auspices may be verified that saying of Petrarch: 
<P>

<P>

Virtu contro al Furore 
<P>

Prendera l'arme, e fia il combatter corto: 
<P>

Che l'antico valore 
<P>

Negli italici cuor non e ancor morto.* 
<P>

<P>

* Virtue against fury shall advance the fight, 
<P>

And it i' th'<A NAME = "AO27409"></A><A NAME = "AS274010"></A><A NAME = "AB274011"></A> combat soon shall put to flight; 
<P>

For the old Roman, valour is not dead, 
<P>

Nor in th' Italians' breasts extinguished. 
<P>



THE END

snares<A NAME = "AO17393"></A><A NAME = "AS17394"></A> and the fox cannot defend himself against wolves<A NAME = "AB173921"></A>. Therefore, it 

<P>

is necessary to be a fox<A NAME = "AS174013"></A> to discover the snares and a lion<A NAME = "BB174028"></A><A HREF = "SPP67.HTM#BB20134"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> to 
<P>

terrify the wolves. Those who rely simply on the lion do not 
<P>

understand what they are about. Therefore a wise lord cannot, nor 
<P>

ought he to, keep faith when such observance may be turned against 
<P>

him, and when the reasons that caused him to pledge it exist no 
<P>

longer. If men were entirely good this precept would not hold, but 
<P>

because they are bad, and will not keep faith with you, you too are 
<P>

not bound to observe it with them. Nor will there ever be wanting to a 

<P>

prince legitimate reasons to excuse this nonobservance. Of this 
<P>

endless modern examples could be given, showing how many treaties 
<P>

and engagements have been made void and of no effect through the 
<P>

faithlessness of princes; and he who has known best how to employ 
<P>

the fox<A NAME = "AO17525"></A> has succeeded best. 
<P>

But it is necessary to know well how to disguise this 
<P>

characteristic, and to be a great pretender and dissembler; and men 
<P>

are so simple, and so subject to present necessities, that he who 
<P>

seeks to deceive will always find someone who will allow himself to be 

<P>

deceived. One recent example I cannot pass over in silence. 
<P>

Alexander VI did nothing else but deceive men, nor ever thought of 
<P>

doing otherwise, and he always found victims; for there never was a 
<P>

man<A NAME = "AO17603"></A> who had greater power in asserting, or who with greater oaths 
<P>

would affirm a thing, yet would observe it less; nevertheless his 
<P>

deceits always succeeded according to his wishes, because he well 
<P>

understood this side of mankind. 
<P>

Therefore it is unnecessary for a prince to have all the good 
<P>

qualities I have enumerated, but it is very necessary to appear to 
<P>

have them. And I shall dare to say this also, that to have them and 
<P>

always to observe them is injurious, and that to appear to have them 
<P>

is useful; to appear merciful, faithful, humane, religious, upright, 
<P>
<P>

being a great and remarkable man. 
<P>

A prince is also respected when he is either a true friend or a 
<P>

downright enemy, that to say, when, without any reservation, he 
<P>

declares himself in favour of one party against the other; which 
<P>

course will always be more advantageous than standing neutral; because 

<P>

if two<A NAME = "AO22845"></A><A NAME = "AS22846"></A> of your powerful neighbours<A NAME = "AB228415"></A> come to blows, they are of such a 
<P>

character that, if one of them conquers, you have either to fear him 
<P>

or not. In either case it will always be more advantageous for you 
<P>

to declare yourself and to make war strenuously; because, in the first 

<P>

case, if you do not declare yourself, you will invariably fall a 
<P>

prey to the conqueror, to the pleasure and satisfaction of him who has 

<P>

been conquered, and you will have no reasons to offer, nor anything to 

<P>

protect or to shelter you. Because he who conquers does not want 
<P>

doubtful<A NAME = "AO22923"></A> friends who will not aid him in the time of trial; and he who 

<P>

loses will not harbour you because you did not willingly, sword in 
<P>

hand, court his fate. 
<P>

Antiochus<A NAME = "AO22953"></A><A NAME = "AS22954"></A><A NAME = "AS22955"></A><A NAME = "BB22956"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF17712"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> went into Greece<A NAME = "BB229513"></A><A HREF = "SPP83.HTM#BB249319"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, being sent for by the Aetolians to drive 
<P>

out the Romans. He sent envoys to the Achaeans, who were friends of 
<P>

the Romans, exhorting them to remain neutral; and on the other hand 
<P>

the Romans<A NAME = "AO22985"></A> urged them to take up arms. This question came to be 
<P>

discussed in the council of the Achaeans, where the legate of 
<P>

Antiochus urged them to stand neutral. To this the Roman legate 
<P>

answered: &quot;As for that which has been said, that it is better and 
more 

<P>

advantageous for your state not to interfere in our war, nothing can 
<P>

be more erroneous; because by not interfering you will be left, 
<P>

without favour or consideration, the guerdon of the conqueror.&quot; Thus 


<P>

it will always happen that he who is not your friend will demand 
<P>

your neutrality, whilst he who is your friend will entreat you to 
<P>

declare yourself with arms. And irresolute princes, to avoid present 
<P>

dangers, generally follow the neutral path, and are generally

<strong>This is a full-text facsimile of the original document.</STRONG>
<P>


well armed they have good laws. I shall leave the laws out of the 
<P>

discussion and shall speak of the arms. 
<P>

I say, therefore, that the arms with which a prince defends his 
<P>

state are either his own, or they are mercenaries, auxiliaries, or 
<P>

mixed. Mercenaries and auxiliaries are useless and dangerous; and if 
<P>

one holds his state based on these arms, he will stand neither firm 
<P>

nor safe; for they are disunited, ambitious and without discipline, 
<P>

unfaithful, valiant before friends, cowardly before enemies; they have 

<P>

neither the fear of God nor fidelity to men, and destruction is 
<P>

deferred only so long as the attack is; for in peace one is robbed 
<P>

by them, and in war by the enemy. The fact is, they have no other 
<P>

attraction or reason for keeping the field than a trifle of stipend, 
<P>

which is not sufficient to make them willing to die for you. They 
<P>

are ready enough to be your soldiers whilst you do not make war, but 
<P>

if war comes they take themselves off or run from the foe; which I 
<P>

should have little trouble to prove, for the ruin of Italy has been 
<P>

caused by nothing else than by resting all her hopes for many years on 

<P>

mercenaries, and although they formerly made some display and appeared 

<P>

valiant amongst themselves, yet when the foreigners came they showed 
<P>

what they were. Thus it was that Charles<A NAME = "AS118817"></A>, King<A NAME = "BB118820"></A><A HREF = "SPP86.HTM#BB25864"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> of France, was 
<P>

allowed to seize Italy with chalk in hand;* and he who told us that 
<P>

our sins were the cause of it told the truth, but they were not the 
<P>

sins he imagined, but those which I have related. And as they were the 

<P>

sins of princes, it is the princes who have also suffered the penalty. 

<P>

<P>

* With which to chalk up the billets for his soldiers. 
<P>

<P>

I wish to demonstrate further the infelicity of these arms. The 
<P>

mercenary captains are either capable men or they are not; if they 
<P>

are, you cannot trust them, because they always aspire to their own 
<P>

<P>


these enterprises prospered with him, and so much the more to his 
<P>

credit, inasmuch as he did everything to strengthen the Church and not 

<P>

any private person. He kept also the Orsini and Colonna factions 
<P>

within the bounds in which he found them; and although there was among 

<P>

them some mind to make disturbance, nevertheless he held two things 
<P>

firm: the one, the greatness of the church, with which he terrified 
<P>

them; and the other, not allowing them to have their own cardinals, 
<P>

who caused the disorders among them. For whenever these factions 
<P>

have their cardinals they do not remain quiet for long, because 
<P>

cardinals<A NAME = "AO11483"></A><A NAME = "AS11484"></A> foster the factions in Rome<A NAME = "BB114815"></A><A HREF = "SPP40.HTM#BB12138"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> and out of it, and the barons 
<P>

are compelled to support them, and thus from the ambitions of prelates 

<P>

arise disorders and tumults among the barons. For these reasons his 
<P>

Holiness<A NAME = "AO11513"></A><A NAME = "AS11514"></A><A NAME = "AB11515"></A> Pope Leo found the pontificate most powerful, and it is to be 

<P>

hoped that, if others made it great in arms, he will make it still 
<P>

greater and more venerated by his goodness and infinite other virtues. 

<P>

<h3>CHAPTER XII 
<P>

HOW MANY KINDS OF SOLDIERY THERE ARE, 
AND CONCERNING MERCENARIES</h3> 
<P>

<P>

HAVING discoursed particularly on the characteristics of such 
<P>

principalities as in the beginning I proposed to discuss, and having 
<P>

considered in some degree the causes of their being good or bad, and 
<P>

having shown the methods by which many have sought to acquire them and 

<P>

to hold them, it now remains for me to discuss generally the means 
<P>

of offence and defence which belong to each of them. 
<P>

We have seen above how necessary it is for a prince to have his 
<P>

foundations well laid, otherwise it follows of necessity he will go to 

<P>

ruin. The chief foundations of all states, new as well as old or 
<P>

composite, are good laws and good arms; and as there cannot be good 
<P>

laws where the state is not well armed, it follows that where they are

similar decision. Fortresses, therefore, are useful or not according 
<P>

to circumstances; if they do you good in one way they injure you in 
<P>

another. And this question can be reasoned thus: the prince who has 
<P>

more to fear from the people than from foreigners ought to build 
<P>

fortresses, but he who has more to fear from foreigners than from 
<P>

the people ought to leave them alone. The castle<A NAME = "AS222419"></A><A NAME = "AB222420"></A> of Milan, built by 
<P>

Francesco Sforza, has made, and will make, more trouble for the 
<P>

house of Sforza than any other disorder in the state. For this 
<P>

reason the best possible fortress is- not to be hated by the people, 
<P>

because, although you may hold the fortresses, yet they will not 
<P>

save you if the people hate you, for there will never be wanting 
<P>

foreigners to assist a people who have taken arms against you. It 
<P>

has not been seen in our times that such fortresses have been of use 
<P>

to any prince, unless to the Countess of Forli, when the Count 
<P>

Girolamo, her consort, was killed; for by that means she was able to 
<P>

withstand<A NAME = "AS22343"></A> the popular attack and wait for assistance from Milan<A NAME = "BB223422"></A><A HREF = "SPP82.HTM#BB24844"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, and 
<P>

thus recover her state; and the posture of affairs was such at that 
<P>

time that the foreigners could not assist the people. But fortresses 
<P>

were of little value to her afterwards when Cesare Borgia attacked 
<P>

her, and when the people, her enemy, were allied with foreigners. 
<P>

Therefore it would have been safer for her, both then and before, 
<P>

not to have been hated by the people than to have had the fortresses. 
<P>

All these things considered then, I shall praise him who builds 
<P>

fortresses as well as him who does not, and I shall blame whoever, 
<P>

trusting in them, cares little about being hated by the people.

whilst the Baglioni, the Vitelli<A NAME = "AO71911"></A><A NAME = "AS71912"></A>, and the Orsini might come to Rome<A NAME = "BB71927"></A><A HREF = "SPP32.HTM#BB98420"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, 
<P>

they could not effect anything against him. If he could not have 
<P>

made Pope him whom he wished, at least the one whom he did not wish 
<P>

would not have been elected. But if he had been in sound<A NAME = "AS72225"></A> health<A NAME = "BB72228"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF71532"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> at the 

<P>

death of Alexander, everything would have been easy to him. On the day 

<P>

that Julius II was elected, he told me that he had thought of 
<P>

everything that might occur at the death of his father, and had 
<P>

provided a remedy for all, except that he had never anticipated 
<P>

that, when the death did happen, he himself would be on the point to 
<P>

die. 
<P>

When all the actions of the duke are recalled, I do not know how 
<P>

to blame him, but rather it appears to me, as I have said, that I 
<P>

ought to offer him for imitation to all those who, by the fortune or 
<P>

the arms of others, are raised to government. Because he, having a 
<P>

lofty spirit and far-reaching aims, could not have regulated his 
<P>

conduct otherwise, and only the shortness of the life of Alexander and 

<P>

his own sickness frustrated his designs. Therefore, he who considers 
<P>

it necessary to secure himself in his new principality, to win 
<P>

friends, to overcome either by force or fraud, to make himself beloved 

<P>

and feared by the people, to be followed and revered by the 
<P>

soldiers, to exterminate those who have power or reason to hurt him, 
<P>

to change the old order of things for new, to be severe and 
<P>

gracious, magnanimous and liberal, to destroy a disloyal soldiery 
<P>

and to create new, to maintain friendship with kings and princes in 
<P>

such a way that they must help him with zeal and offend with 
<P>

caution, cannot find a more lively example than the actions of this 
<P>

man. 
<P>

Only can he be blamed for the election of Julius II, in whom he made 
<P>

a bad choice, because, as is said, not being able to elect a Pope to 
<P>

his own mind, he could have hindered any other from being elected

<H2><B>NATIONAL CRYPTOGRAPHY POLICY</B></H2>

<P>At the request of the U.S. Congress in November 1993, the National<A NAME = "AO41623"></A><A NAME = "AS41624"></A><A NAME = "AS41625"></A><A NAME = "AS41626"></A><A NAME = "AB41627"></A> Research Council's Computer Science and Telecommunications<A NAME = "AB41640"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB504239"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> 
Board (CSTB) formed the Committee to Study<A NAME = "BB41658"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB4909"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> National Cryptography Policy.  In accordance with its legislative charge (<A HREF="28e6.html">Box P.1</A>), the 
committee undertook the following tasks:<BR>



<P><LI>  <I>Framing the problem.</I>  What are the technology<A NAME = "AO41818"></A><A NAME = "AS41819"></A> trends with which national cryptography<A NAME = "BB41830"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB42257"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy must keep pace?  What is the 
political environment?  What are the significant changes in the post-Cold War environment that call attention to the need for, and should
 have an impact on, cryptography policy?<BR>



<P><LI>  <I>Understanding the underlying technology issues and their expected development and impact on policy over time.</I>  What is and is 
not possible with current cryptographic (and related) technologies?   How could these capabilities have an impact on various U.S. 
interests?<BR>



<P><LI>  <I>Describing current cryptography policy.</I>  To the committee's knowledge, there is no single document, classified or unclassified
, within the U.S<A NAME = "AO42243"></A><A NAME = "AS42244"></A>. government that fully describes national cryptography<A NAME = "BB42257"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB42434"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy.<BR>



<P><LI>  <I>Articulating a framework for thinking about cryptography policy.</I>  The interests<A NAME = "AO42424"></A><A NAME = "AS42425"></A> affected by national cryptography<A NAME = "BB42434"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB42628"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy are 
multiple, varied, and related:  they include personal liberties and constitutional rights, the maintenance of public order and national 
security, technology development, and U.S. economic competitiveness and markets.  At a minimum, policy makers (and their critics) must 
understand how these interests interrelate, although they may decide that one particular policy configuration better serves the overall 
national interest than does another.<BR>



<P><LI>  <I>Identifying a range of feasible policy options.</I>  The debate<A NAME = "AO42622"></A><A NAME = "AS42623"></A> over cryptography<A NAME = "BB42628"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB43017"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy has been hampered by an incomplete 
analysis and discussion of various policy options--both proponents<A NAME = "AO42662"></A> of current policy and of alternative policies are forced into 
debating positions in which it is difficult or impossible to acknowledge that a competing view might have some merit.  This report 
attempts to discuss fairly the pros and cons of a number of options.<BR>



<P><LI>  <I>Making recommendations regarding cryptography policy.</I>  No cryptography policy will be stable for all time.  That is, it is 
unrealistic to imagine that this committee or any set of policy makers could craft a policy that would not have to evolve over time as the 
technological and political milieu itself changes.  Thus, the committee's recommendations are framed in the context of a transition, from a 
world characterized by slowly evolving technology, well<A NAME = "AO428149"></A><A NAME = "AS428150"></A>-defined enemies, and unquestioned U.S. technological, economic, and 
geopolitical<A NAME = "AB428170"></A> dominance to one characterized by rapidly evolving technology, fuzzy lines between friend and foe, and increasing technological
, economic, and political interdependencies between the United States and other nations of the world.<BR>



<P>Given the diverse applications of cryptography, national<A NAME = "AO43013"></A><A NAME = "AS43014"></A> cryptography<A NAME = "BB43017"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB43049"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy involves a very large number of important issues.  
Important<A NAME = "AO43039"></A><A NAME = "AS43040"></A><A NAME = "AS43041"></A><A NAME = "AS43042"></A> to national cryptography<A NAME = "BB43049"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB434149"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy as well are issues related to the deployment of a large-scale infrastructure for cryptography<A NAME = "BB43082"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB430106"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> 
and legislation and regulations to support the widespread use of cryptography<A NAME = "BB430106"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB43223"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> for authentication and data integrity purposes (i.e.
, collateral applications of cryptography), even though these issues have not taken center stage in the policy debate.  <BR>



<P>The committee<A NAME = "AO4323"></A><A NAME = "AS4324"></A> focused its efforts primarily on issues related to cryptography<A NAME = "BB43223"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB43283"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> for confidentiality, because the contentious 
problem that this committee<A NAME = "AO43243"></A><A NAME = "AS43244"></A><A NAME = "AS43245"></A> was assembled to address at the center of the public<A NAME = "AB43266"></A> policy debate relates to the use of cryptography<A NAME = "BB43283"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB434254"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> in 
confidentiality applications.  It also addressed issues of cryptography policy related to authentication and data integrity at a relatively 
high level, casting its findings and recommendations in these areas in fairly general terms.  However, it notes that detailed 
consideration of issues and policy options in these collateral areas requires additional study at a level of detail and thoroughness 
comparable to that of this report.<BR>



<P>In preparing this report, the committee<A NAME = "AO43411"></A> reviewed and synthesized relevant material from recent reports, took written and oral 
testimony from government, industry, and private individuals, reached out extensively to the affected stakeholders to solicit input, and 
met seven times to discuss the input from these sources as well as the independent observations and findings of the committee 
members themselves.  In addition, this study<A NAME = "AO434129"></A><A NAME = "AS434130"></A> built upon three prior efforts to examine national cryptography<A NAME = "BB434149"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB44011"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy:  the Association 
for Computing Machinery report <I>Codes, Keys, and Conflicts:  Issues in U.S. Crypto </I>Policy,[1]  the Office of Technology Assessment 
report <I>Information Security and Privacy in Network Environments</I>,[2]  and the JASON encryption study. [3]<A NAME = "AO434236"></A><A NAME = "AS434237"></A><A NAME = "AS434238"></A>  A number of other 
examinations of cryptography<A NAME = "BB434254"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB442153"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> and/or information security<A NAME = "AB434263"></A> policy were also important to the committee's work.[4]<BR>



<P>

<P>

<H2><B>WHAT THIS REPORT IS NOT</B></H2>

<P>The subject<A NAME = "AO4403"></A><A NAME = "AS4404"></A> of national cryptography<A NAME = "BB44011"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB44260"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy is quite complex, as it figures importantly in many areas of national interest.  To 
keep the project manageable within the time, resources, and expertise available, the committee chose not to address in detail a 
number of issues that arose with some nontrivial frequency during the course of its study.<BR>



<P><LI>  This report<A NAME = "AO4425"></A><A NAME = "AS4426"></A> is not a comprehensive study of the grand trade-offs that might be made in other dimensions of national policy to 
compensate for changes in cryptography<A NAME = "BB44260"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB442258"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy.  For example, this report does not address matters such as relaxing<A NAME = "AO44285"></A><A NAME = "AS44286"></A><A NAME = "AS44287"></A><A NAME = "AS44288"></A><A NAME = "AS44289"></A><A NAME = "AS44290"></A> exclusionary<A NAME = "AB44293"></A> rules that
 govern the court admissibility<A NAME = "AB442107"></A> of evidence or installing video<A NAME = "AB442118"></A> cameras in every police<A NAME = "AB442127"></A> helmet as part of a package that also 
eliminates restrictions on cryptography<A NAME = "BB442153"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB444142"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A>, though such packages are in principle possible.  Similarly, it does not address options such as 
increasing the budget for counterterrorist operations as a quid pro quo for relaxations on export controls of cryptography.  The report<A NAME = "AO442225"></A><A NAME = "AS442226"></A> 
does provide information that would help to assess the impact of various approaches to cryptography<A NAME = "BB442258"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB448251"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy, although how that impact<A NAME = "AO442269"></A>
 should be weighed against the impact of policies related to other areas is outside the scope of this study and the expertise of 
the committee assembled for it. <BR>

belongs to others; but reasons for taking life, on the contrary, are 
<P>

more difficult to find and sooner lapse. But when a prince is with his 

<P>

army, and has under control a multitude of soldiers, then it is 
<P>

quite necessary for him to disregard the reputation of cruelty, for 
<P>

without it he would never hold his army united or disposed to its 
<P>

duties. 
<P>

Among the wonderful deeds<A NAME = "AS16859"></A><A NAME = "AB168510"></A> of Hannibal this one is enumerated: that 
<P>

having led an enormous army, composed of many various races of men, to 

<P>

fight in foreign lands, no dissensions arose either among them or 
<P>

against the prince, whether in his bad or in his good fortune. This 
<P>

arose from nothing else than his inhuman cruelty, which, with his 
<P>

boundless valour, made him revered and terrible in the sight of his 
<P>

soldiers, but without that cruelty, his other virtues were not 
<P>

sufficient to produce this effect. And shortsighted writers admire his 

<P>

deeds<A NAME = "AO16933"></A> from one point of view and from another condemn the principal 
<P>

cause of them. That it is true his other virtues would not have been 
<P>

sufficient for him may be proved by the case of Scipio, that most 
<P>

excellent man, not of his own times but within the memory of man, 
<P>

against whom, nevertheless, his army rebelled in Spain; this arose 
<P>

from nothing but his too great forbearance, which gave his soldiers 
<P>

more<A NAME = "AO16993"></A><A NAME = "AS16994"></A> licence than is consistent with military<A NAME = "AB169917"></A> discipline. For this 
<P>

he was upbraided in the Senate by Fabius Maximus, and called the 
<P>

corrupter of the Roman soldiery. The Locrians were laid waste by a 
<P>

legate of Scipio, yet they were not avenged by him, nor was the 
<P>

insolence of the legate punished, owing entirely to his easy nature. 
<P>

Insomuch that someone in the Senate, wishing to excuse him, said there 

<P>

were many men who knew much better how not to err than to correct 
<P>

the errors of others. This disposition, if he had been continued in 
<P>

the command, would have destroyed in time the fame and glory of 
<P>

Scipio; but, he being under the control of the Senate, this 
<P>

<P>


And it is not to be wondered at if none of the above-named 
<P>

Italians have been able to accomplish all that is expected from your 
<P>

illustrious house; and if in so many revolutions in Italy, and in so 
<P>

many campaigns, it has always appeared as if military virtue were 
<P>

exhausted, this has happened because the old order of things was not 
<P>

good, and none of us have known how to find a new one. And nothing 
<P>

honours a man more than to establish new laws and new ordinances 
<P>

when he himself was newly risen. Such things when they are well 
<P>

founded and dignified will make him revered and admired, and in 
<P>

Italy there are not wanting opportunities to bring such into use in 
<P>

every form. 
<P>

Here there is great valour in the limbs whilst it fails in the head. 
<P>

Look attentively at the duels and the hand-to-hand combats, how 
<P>

superior<A NAME = "AO26823"></A> the Italians are in strength, dexterity, and subtlety. But 
<P>

when it comes to armies they do not bear comparison, and this 
<P>

springs entirely from the insufficiency of the leaders, since those 
<P>

who are capable are not obedient, and each one seems to himself to 
<P>

know, there having never been any one so distinguished above the rest, 

<P>

either by valour or fortune, that others would yield to him. Hence 
<P>

it is that for so long a time, and during so much fighting in the past 

<P>

twenty years, whenever there has been an army wholly Italian, it has 
<P>

always given a poor account of itself; as witness Taro, Alessandria, 
<P>

Capua<A NAME = "AS26913"></A>, Genoa, Vaila, Bologna<A NAME = "BB269110"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF61912"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, Mestre. 
<P>

If, therefore, your illustrious house wishes to follow those 
<P>

remarkable men who have redeemed their country, it is necessary before 

<P>

all things, as a true foundation for every enterprise, to be 
<P>

provided with your own forces, because there can be no more 
<P>

faithful, truer, or better soldiers. And although singly they are 
<P>

good, altogether they will be much better when they find themselves 
<P>

commanded by their prince, honoured by him, and maintained at his 
<P>

<P>


defects states that have power enough to keep an army in the field 
<P>

cannot be lost. 
<P>

Philip of Macedon, not the father of Alexander the Great, but he who 
<P>

was conquered by Titus Quintius, had not much territory compared to 
<P>

the greatness<A NAME = "AO24935"></A><A NAME = "AS24936"></A> of the Romans and of Greece<A NAME = "BB249319"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF11216"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> who attacked him, yet 
<P>

being a warlike man who knew how to attract the people and secure 
<P>

the nobles, he sustained the war against his enemies for many years, 
<P>

and if in the end he lost the dominion of some cities, nevertheless he 

<P>

retained the kingdom. 
<P>

Therefore, do not let our princes accuse fortune for the loss of 
<P>

their principalities after so many years' possession, but rather their 

<P>

own sloth, because in quiet times they never thought there could be 
<P>

a change (it is a common defect in man not to make any provision in 
<P>

the calm against the tempest), and when afterwards the bad times 
<P>

came they thought of flight and not of defending themselves, and 
<P>

they hoped that the people, disgusted with the insolence of the 
<P>

conquerors, would recall them. This course, when others fail, may be 
<P>

good, but it is very bad to have neglected all other expedients for 
<P>

that, since you would never wish to fall because you trusted to be 
<P>

able to find someone later on to restore you. This again either does 
<P>

not happen, or, if it does, it will not be for your security, 
<P>

because that deliverance is of no avail which does not depend upon 
<P>

yourself; those only are reliable, certain, and durable that depend on 

<P>

yourself and your valour.

princedom<A NAME = "AO21893"></A><A NAME = "AS21894"></A><A NAME = "AB21895"></A> have been hostile, if they are of a description to need 
<P>

assistance to support themselves, can always be gained over with the 
<P>

greatest ease, and they will be tightly held to serve the prince 
<P>

with fidelity, inasmuch as they know it to be very necessary for 
<P>

them to cancel by deeds the bad impression which he had formed of 
<P>

them; and thus the prince always extracts more profit from them than 
<P>

from those who, serving him in too much security, may neglect his 
<P>

affairs. And since the matter demands it, I must not fail to warn a 
<P>

prince, who by means<A NAME = "AO21979"></A> of secret favours has acquired a new state, 
<P>

that he must well consider the reasons which induced those to favour 
<P>

him who did so; and if it be not a natural affection towards him, 
<P>

but only discontent with their government, then he will only keep them 

<P>

friendly with great trouble and difficulty, for it will be 
<P>

impossible to satisfy them. And weighing well the reasons for this 
<P>

in those examples which can be taken from ancient and modern 
<P>

affairs, we shall find that it is easier for the prince to make 
<P>

friends<A NAME = "AO22053"></A> of those men who were contented under the former government, 
<P>

and are therefore his enemies, than of those who, being discontented 
<P>

with it, were favourable to him and encouraged him to seize it. 
<P>

6. It has been a custom with princes, in order to hold their 
<P>

states more securely, to build fortresses that may serve as a bridle 
<P>

and bit to those who might design to work against them, and as a place 

<P>

of refuge from a first attack. I praise this system because it has 
<P>

been made use of formerly. Notwithstanding that, Messer Nicolo Vitelli 

<P>

in our times<A NAME = "AO22137"></A><A NAME = "AS22138"></A> has been seen to demolish two fortresses in Citta<A NAME = "AB221327"></A> di 
<P>

Castello so that he might keep that state; Guidubaldo<A NAME = "AS221419"></A>, Duke<A NAME = "AB221422"></A> of Urbino, 

<P>

on returning to his dominion, whence he had been driven by Cesare 
<P>

Borgia<A NAME = "AS22163"></A><A NAME = "AB22164"></A>, razed to the foundations all the fortresses in that 
<P>

province, and considered that without them it would be more 
<P>

difficult to lose it; the Bentivoglio<A NAME = "AS221813"></A> returning to Bologna<A NAME = "BB221820"></A><A HREF = "SPP86.HTM#BB25839"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> came to a

<P>

been, that she has been overrun by Charles, robbed by Louis, ravaged 
<P>

by Ferdinand<A NAME = "AO12915"></A>, and insulted by the Switzers. The principle that has 
<P>

guided them has been, first, to lower the credit of infantry so that 
<P>

they might increase their own. They did this because, subsisting on 
<P>

their pay and without territory, they were unable to support many 
<P>

soldiers, and a few infantry did not give them any authority; so 
<P>

they were led to employ cavalry, with a moderate force of which they 
<P>

were maintained and honoured; and affairs were brought to such a 
<P>

pass that, in an army of twenty thousand soldiers, there were not to 
<P>

be found two thousand foot soldiers. They had, besides this, used 
<P>

every art to lessen fatigue and danger to themselves and their 
<P>

soldiers, not killing in the fray, but taking prisoners and liberating 

<P>

without ransom. They did not attack towns at night, nor did the

surround the camp either with stockade or ditch, nor did they campaign 

<P>

in the winter. All these things were permitted by their military 
<P>

rules, and devised by them to avoid, as I have said, both fatigue 
<P>

and dangers; thus they have brought Italy to slavery and contempt.

<h3>CHAPTER XIII 
<P>

CONCERNING AUXILIARIES, MIXED SOLDIERY, AND ONE'S OWN 

AUXILIARIES</h3>, which are the other useless arm, are employed when a 
<P>

prince is called in with his forces to aid and defend, as was done 
<P>

by Pope Julius in the most recent times; for he, having, in the 
<P>

enterprise against Ferrara, had poor proof of his mercenaries, 
<P>

turned to auxiliaries, and stipulated with Ferdinand, King of Spain, 
<P>

for his assistance with men and arms. These arms may be useful and 
<P>

good in themselves, but for him who calls them in they are always 
<P>

disadvantageous; for losing, one is undone, and winning, one is 
<P>

their captive.

<P>


setting a fine example. We have in our time Ferdinand of Aragon, the 
<P>

present<A NAME = "AS22503"></A> King<A NAME = "BB22506"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF158"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> of Spain. He can almost be called a new prince, because 
<P>

he has risen, by fame and glory, from being an insignificant king to 
<P>

be the foremost king in Christendom; and if you will consider his 
<P>

deeds you will find them all great and some of them extraordinary. 
<P>

In the beginning of his reign he attacked Granada, and this enterprise 

<P>

was the foundation of his dominions. He did this quietly at first 
<P>

and without any fear of hindrance, for he held the minds of the barons 

<P>

of Castile<A NAME = "AO22575"></A> occupied in thinking of the war and not anticipating any 
<P>

innovations; thus they did not perceive that by these means he was 
<P>

acquiring power and authority over them. He was able with the money of 

<P>

the Church and of the people to sustain his armies, and by that long 
<P>

war to lay the foundation for the military skill which has since 
<P>

distinguished him. Further, always using religion as a plea, so as 
<P>

to undertake greater schemes, he devoted himself with a pious 
<P>

cruelty to driving out and clearing his kingdom of the Moors; nor 
<P>

could there be a more admirable example, nor one more rare. Under this 

<P>

same cloak he assailed<A NAME = "AS22669"></A> Africa<A NAME = "BB226612"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF7988"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, he came down on Italy, he has finally 
<P>

attacked<A NAME = "AS22673"></A> France<A NAME = "BB22676"></A><A HREF = "SPP84.HTM#BB254430"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>; and thus his achievements and designs have always 
<P>

been great, and have kept the minds of his people in suspense and 
<P>

admiration and occupied with the issue of them. And his actions have 
<P>

arisen in such a way, one out of the other, that men have never been 
<P>

given time to work steadily against him. 
<P>

Again, it much assists a prince to set unusual examples in 
<P>

internal affairs, similar to those which are related of Messer Bernabo 

<P>

da Milano, who, when he had the opportunity, by any one in civil 
<P>

life doing some extraordinary thing, either good or bad, would take 
<P>

some method of rewarding or punishing him, which would be much 
<P>

spoken about. And a prince ought, above all things, always to 
<P>

endeavour in every action to gain for himself the reputation of 
<P>

The Arabian Nights
<P>

<P>

<P>

In the chronicles of the ancient dynasty of the Sassanidae,
<P>

who reigned<A NAME = "AS45"></A> for about four hundred years, from Persia<A NAME = "AB420"></A><A HREF = "SPP1.HTM#BB4720"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> to the borders
<P>

of China<A NAME = "AS55"></A><A NAME = "AB56"></A><A HREF = "SPP192.HTM#BB577610"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, beyond the great river<A NAME = "AS515"></A><A NAME = "AB516"></A> Ganges itself, we read the praises
<P>

of one<A NAME = "AO65"></A> of the kings of this race, who was said to be the best
<P>

monarch of his time.  His subjects loved him, and his neighbors
<P>

feared him, and when he died he left his kingdom in a more prosperous
<P>

and powerful condition than any king had done before him.
<P>

<P>

The two sons who survived him loved each other tenderly, and it was
<P>

a real grief to the elder, Schahriar, that the laws of the empire
<P>

forbade him to share his dominions with his brother Schahzeman. 
<P>

Indeed, after ten years, during which this state of things had
<P>

not ceased to trouble him, Schahriar cut off the country of Great
<P>

Tartary<A NAME = "AO163"></A><A NAME = "AS164"></A> from the Persian<A NAME = "AB1611"></A> Empire and made his brother king.
<P>

<P>

Now the Sultan<A NAME = "AO187"></A><A NAME = "AS188"></A><A NAME = "AB189"></A> Schahriar had a wife whom he loved more than all the world,

<P>

and his greatest happiness was to surround her with splendour,
<P>

and to give her the finest dresses and the most beautiful jewels. 
<P>

It was therefore with the deepest shame and sorrow that he
<P>

accidentally discovered, after several years, that she had deceived
<P>

him completely, and her whole conduct turned out to have been so bad,
<P>

that he felt himself obliged to carry out the law of the land,
<P>

and order the grand-vizir to put her to death.  The blow was so
<P>

heavy that his mind almost gave way, and he declared that he was
<P>

quite sure that at bottom all women were as wicked as the sultana,
<P>

if you could only find them out, and that the fewer the world

or in a way to become one. In the first case this liberality is 
<P>

dangerous, in the second it is very necessary to be considered 
<P>

liberal; and Caesar<A NAME = "AS15917"></A><A NAME = "AB15918"></A><A HREF = "SPP53.HTM#BB160320"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> was one of those who wished to become 
<P>

pre<A NAME = "AS15923"></A>-eminent in Rome<A NAME = "BB159210"></A><A HREF = "SPP66.HTM#BB19916"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>; but if he had survived after becoming so, and had 

<P>

not moderated his expenses, he would have destroyed his government. 
<P>

And if any one should reply: Many have been princes, and have done 
<P>

great things with armies, who have been considered very liberal, I 
<P>

reply: Either a prince spends that which is his own or his subjects' 
<P>

or else that of others. In the first case he ought to be sparing, in 
<P>

the second he ought not to neglect any opportunity for liberality. And 

<P>

to the price who goes forth with his army, supporting it by pillage, 
<P>

sack<A NAME = "AS16003"></A>, and extortion<A NAME = "AB16008"></A>, handling that which belongs to others, this 
<P>

liberality is necessary, otherwise he would not be followed by 
<P>

soldiers. And of that which is neither yours nor your subjects' you 
<P>

can be a ready giver, as were Cyrus, Caesar<A NAME = "AS160319"></A><A NAME = "BB160320"></A><A HREF = "SPP66.HTM#BB20044"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, and Alexander; because it 

<P>

does not take away your reputation if you squander that of others, but 

<P>

adds to it; it is only squandering your own that injures you. 
<P>

And there is nothing wastes so rapidly as liberality, for even 
<P>

whilst you exercise it you lose the power to do so, and so become 
<P>

either poor or despised, or else, in avoiding poverty, rapacious and 
<P>

hated. And a prince should guard himself, above all things, against 
<P>

being despised and hated; and liberality leads you to both. 
<P>

Therefore it is wiser to have a reputation for meanness which brings 
<P>

reproach without hatred, than to be compelled through seeking a 
<P>

reputation for liberality to incur a name for rapacity which begets 
<P>

reproach with hatred.

Charles VII, the father of King Louis XI, having by good fortune and 
<P>

valour<A NAME = "AO13803"></A><A NAME = "AS13804"></A><A NAME = "AS13805"></A><A NAME = "AB13806"></A><A HREF = "SPP46.HTM#BB14065"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> liberated France<A NAME = "BB138011"></A><A HREF = "SPP46.HTM#BB139614"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> from the English, recognized the necessity 
<P>

of being armed with forces of his own, and he established in his 
<P>

kingdom ordinances concerning men-at-arms and infantry. Afterwards his 

<P>

son<A NAME = "AO13833"></A>, King Louis, abolished the infantry and began to enlist the 
<P>

Switzers, which mistake, followed by others, is, as is now seen, a 
<P>

source of peril to that kingdom; because, having raised the reputation 

<P>

of the Switzers, he has entirely diminished the value of his own arms, 

<P>

for he has destroyed the infantry altogether; and his men-at-arms he 
<P>

has subordinated to others, for, being as they are so accustomed to 
<P>

fight along with Switzers, it does not appear that they can now 
<P>

conquer without them. Hence it arises that the French cannot stand 
<P>

against the Switzers, and without the Switzers they do not come off 
<P>

well against others. The armies of the French have thus become 
<P>

mixed, partly mercenary and partly national, both of which arms 
<P>

together are much better than mercenaries alone or auxiliaries 
<P>

alone, yet much inferior to one's own forces. And this example 
<P>

proves it, the kingdom<A NAME = "AS13969"></A> of France<A NAME = "BB139614"></A><A HREF = "SPP63.HTM#BB189326"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> would be unconquerable if the 
<P>

ordinance of Charles had been enlarged or maintained. 
<P>

But the scanty wisdom of man, on entering into an affair which looks 
<P>

well at first, cannot discern the poison that is hidden in it, as I 
<P>

have said above of hectic fevers. Therefore, if he who rules a 
<P>

principality<A NAME = "AO14013"></A> cannot recognize evils until they are upon him, he is not 

<P>

truly wise; and this insight is given to few. And if the first 
<P>

disaster<A NAME = "AO14033"></A><A NAME = "AS14034"></A> to the Roman<A NAME = "AB140311"></A> Empire should be examined, it will be found to 
<P>

have commenced only with the enlisting of the Goths; because from that 

<P>

time the vigour of the Roman Empire began to decline, and all that 
<P>

valour<A NAME = "AO14063"></A><A NAME = "AS14064"></A><A NAME = "BB14065"></A><A HREF = "SPP66.HTM#BB198031"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> which had raised it passed away to others. 
<P>

I conclude, therefore, that no principality is secure without having 
<P>

its own forces; on the contrary, it is entirely dependent on good 
<P>
<P>

gave up old alliances, made new ones; and as he had his own soldiers 
<P>

and allies, on such foundations he was able to build any edifice: 
<P>

thus, whilst he had endured much trouble in acquiring, he had but 
<P>

little in keeping. 
<P>

<h3>CHAPTER<A NAME = "AS5442"></A><A NAME = "AS5443"></A><A NAME = "AS5444"></A><A NAME = "AS5445"></A><A NAME = "AB5446"></A> VII

CONCERNING NEW PRINCIPALITIES WHICH ARE ACQUIRED<A NAME = "AB54425"></A> 
EITHER BY THE ARMS<A NAME = "AB54435"></A> OF OTHERS OR BY GOOD<A NAME = "AB54446"></A> FORTUNE</h3> 
<P>

<P>

THOSE who solely by good<A NAME = "AO54711"></A> fortune become princes from being private 
<P>

citizens have little trouble in rising, but much in keeping atop; they 

<P>

have not any difficulties on the way up, because they fly, but they 
<P>

have many when they reach the summit. Such are those to whom some 
<P>

state is given either for money or by the favour of him who bestows 
<P>

it; as happened<A NAME = "AS5527"></A> to many in Greece<A NAME = "BB55216"></A><A HREF = "SPP32.HTM#BB97424"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, in the cities of Ionia and of the 
<P>

Hellespont, where princes were made by Darius, in order that they 
<P>

might hold the cities both for his security and his glory; as also 
<P>

were those emperors who, by the corruption of the soldiers, from being 

<P>

citizens came to empire. Such stand simply upon the goodwill and the 
<P>

fortune of him who has elevated them- two most inconstant and unstable 

<P>

things. Neither have they the knowledge requisite for the position; 
<P>

because, unless they are men of great worth and ability, it is not 
<P>

reasonable to expect that they should know how to command, having 
<P>

always lived in a private condition; besides, they cannot hold it 
<P>

because they have not forces which they can keep friendly and 
<P>

faithful. 
<P>

States that rise unexpectedly, then, like all other things in nature 
<P>

which are born and grow rapidly, cannot have their foundations and 
<P>

relations with other states fixed in such a way that the first storm 
<P>

will not overthrow them; unless, as is said, those who unexpectedly 
<P>

become princes are men of so much ability that they know they have

Such men, for the reasons given, can open the way into the state and 
<P>

render the victory easy; but if you wish to hold it afterwards, you 
<P>

meet with infinite difficulties, both from those who have assisted you 

<P>

and from those you have crushed. Nor is it enough for you to have 
<P>

exterminated the family of the prince, because the lords that remain 
<P>

make themselves the heads of fresh movements against you, and as you 
<P>

are unable either to satisfy or exterminate them, that state is lost 
<P>

whenever time brings the opportunity. 
<P>

Now if you will consider what was the nature of the government of 
<P>

Darius<A NAME = "AS3683"></A><A NAME = "AB3684"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB3716"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, you will find it similar to the kingdom of the Turk, and 
<P>

therefore it was only necessary for Alexander, first to overthrow 
<P>

him in the field, and then to take the country from him. After which 
<P>

victory, Darius<A NAME = "AS3715"></A><A NAME = "BB3716"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF3684"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> being killed, the state remained secure to 
<P>

Alexander, for the above reasons. And if his successors had been 
<P>

united they would have enjoyed it securely and at their ease, for 
<P>

there were no<A NAME = "AO3747"></A><A NAME = "AS3748"></A> tumults<A NAME = "AB37411"></A><A HREF = "SPP21.HTM#BB63428"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> raised in the kingdom except those they provoked 

<P>

themselves. 
<P>

But it is impossible to hold with such tranquillity states 
<P>

constituted like that of France<A NAME = "AS37711"></A><A NAME = "BB37712"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB37817"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>. Hence arose those frequent rebellions 

<P>

against the Romans<A NAME = "AS3787"></A> in Spain<A NAME = "BB37812"></A><A HREF = "SPP77.HTM#BB233224"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, France<A NAME = "AS37815"></A><A NAME = "AS37816"></A><A NAME = "BB37817"></A><A HREF = "SPP22.HTM#BB6764"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, and Greece<A NAME = "BB37822"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB41110"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, owing to the many 
<P>

principalities there were in these states, of which, as long as the 
<P>

memory of them endured, the Romans<A NAME = "AO38013"></A> always held an insecure possession; 

<P>

but with the power and long continuance of the empire the memory of 
<P>

them passed away, and the Romans then became secure possessors. And 
<P>

when fighting afterwards amongst themselves, each one was able to 
<P>

attach to himself his own parts of the country, according to the 
<P>

authority he had assumed there; and the family of the former lord 
<P>

being exterminated, none<A NAME = "AO3867"></A> other than the Romans were acknowledged. 
<P>

When these things are remembered no one will marvel at the ease with 
<P>

which Alexander<A NAME = "AO3885"></A><A NAME = "AS3886"></A> held the Empire<A NAME = "AB38813"></A> of Asia, or at the difficulties

treachery sought to murder him, and for this ingratitude he was 
<P>

compelled to punish him. Afterwards he sought<A NAME = "AS201015"></A> him out in France<A NAME = "BB201024"></A><A HREF = "SPP75.HTM#BB22676"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, and 
<P>

took from him his government and life. He who will, therefore, 
<P>

carefully examine the actions of this man will find him a most valiant 

<P>

lion<A NAME = "AS20133"></A><A NAME = "BB20134"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF173810"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> and a most cunning fox; he will find him feared and respected 
<P>

by every one, and not hated by the army; and it need not be wondered 
<P>

at that he, the new man, well, because his supreme renown always 
<P>

protected him from that hatred which the people might have conceived 
<P>

against him for his violence. 
<P>

But his son<A NAME = "AO20187"></A><A NAME = "AS20188"></A><A NAME = "AS20189"></A> Antoninus<A NAME = "AB201812"></A><A HREF = "SPP67.HTM#BB203324"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> was a most eminent<A NAME = "AB201821"></A> man, and had very excellent 
<P>

qualities, which made him admirable in the sight of the people and 
<P>

acceptable to the soldiers, for he was a warlike man, most enduring of 

<P>

fatigue, a despiser of all delicate food and other luxuries, which 
<P>

caused him to be beloved by the armies. Nevertheless, his ferocity and 

<P>

cruelties were so great and so unheard of that, after endless single 
<P>

murders, he killed<A NAME = "AS20247"></A> a large number of the people of Rome<A NAME = "BB202424"></A><A HREF = "SPP68.HTM#BB205627"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> and all 
<P>

those of Alexandria<A NAME = "AS20257"></A><A NAME = "AB20258"></A>. He became hated by the whole world, and also 
<P>

feared by those he had around him, to such an extent that he was 
<P>

murdered in the midst of his army by a centurion. And here it must 
<P>

be noted that such-like deaths, which are deliberately inflicted 
<P>

with a resolved and desperate courage, cannot be avoided by princes, 
<P>

because any one who does not fear to die can inflict them; but a 
<P>

prince may fear them the less because they are very rare; he has 
<P>

only to be careful not to do any grave injury to those whom he employs 

<P>

or has around him in the service of the state. Antoninus<A NAME = "AS203323"></A><A NAME = "BB203324"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF201812"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> had not taken 

<P>

this care, but had contumeliously killed a brother of that 
<P>

centurion, whom also he daily threatened, yet retained in his 
<P>

bodyguard; which, as it turned out, was a rash thing to do, and proved 

<P>

the emperor's ruin. 
<P>

But let us come<A NAME = "AS20389"></A> to Commodus<A NAME = "BB203814"></A><A HREF = "SPP70.HTM#BB210314"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, to whom it should have been very easy

consists in knowing how to distinguish the character of troubles, 
<P>

and for choice to take the lesser evil. 
<P>

A prince ought also to show himself a patron of ability, and to 
<P>

honour the proficient in every art. At the same time he should 
<P>

encourage his citizens to practise their callings peaceably, both in 
<P>

commerce<A NAME = "AS23443"></A> and agriculture<A NAME = "AB23448"></A>, and in every other following, so that the 
<P>

one should not be deterred from improving his possessions for fear 
<P>

lest they be taken away from him or another from opening up trade 
<P>

for fear of taxes; but the prince ought to offer rewards to whoever 
<P>

wishes to do these things and designs in any way to honour his city or 

<P>

state. 
<P>

Further, he ought to entertain the people with festivals and 
<P>

spectacles at convenient seasons of the year; and as every city is 
<P>

divided into guilds or into societies, he ought to hold such bodies in 

<P>

esteem, and associate with them sometimes, and show himself an example 

<P>

of courtesy and liberality; nevertheless, always maintaining the 
<P>

majesty of his rank, for this he must never consent to abate in 
<P>

anything. 
<P>

<h3>CHAPTER XXII 
<P>

CONCERNING THE SECRETARIES OF PRINCES</h3> 
<P>

<P>

THE choice of servants is of no little importance to a prince, and 
<P>

they are good or not according to the discrimination of the prince. 
<P>

And the first opinion which one forms of a prince, and of his 
<P>

understanding, is by observing the men he has around him; and when 
<P>

they are capable and faithful he may always be considered wise, 
<P>

because he has known how to recognize the capable and to keep them 
<P>

faithful. But when they are otherwise one cannot form a good opinion 
<P>

of him, for the prime error which he made was in choosing them.

COMING<A NAME = "AO16193"></A> now to the other qualities mentioned above, I say that 
<P>

every<A NAME = "AO16203"></A> prince ought to desire to be considered clement and not cruel. 
<P>

Nevertheless he ought to take care not to misuse this clemency. Cesare 

<P>

Borgia was considered cruel; notwithstanding, his cruelty reconciled 
<P>

the Romagna, unified it, and restored it to peace and loyalty. And 
<P>

if this be rightly considered, he will be seen to have been much 
<P>

more merciful than the Florentine people, who, to avoid a reputation 
<P>

for cruelty, permitted Pistoia to be destroyed. Therefore a prince, so 

<P>

long as he keeps his subjects united and loyal, ought not to mind 
<P>

the reproach of cruelty; because with a few examples he will be more 
<P>

merciful than those who, through too much mercy, allow disorders to 
<P>

arise, from which follow murders or robberies; for these are wont to 
<P>

injure the whole people, whilst those executions which originate 
<P>

with a prince offend the individual only. 
<P>

And of all princes, it is impossible for the new prince to avoid the 
<P>

imputation of cruelty, owing to new states being full of dangers. 
<P>

Hence Virgil, through the mouth of Dido, excuses the inhumanity of her 

<P>

reign owing to its being new, saying: 
<P>

<P>

Res dura, et regni novitas me talia cogunt 
<P>

Moliri, et late fines custode tueri.* 
<P>

<P>

* ...against my will, my fate, 
<P>

A throne unsettled, and an infant state, 
<P>

Bid me defend my realms with all my pow'rs, 
<P>

And guard with these severities my shores. 
<P>

<P>

Nevertheless he ought to be slow to believe and to act, nor should 
<P>

he himself show fear, but proceed in a temperate manner with 
<P>

prudence and humanity, so that too much confidence may not make him

<P><B>BOX 1  The Foreign Threat to U.S. Business Interests</B><BR>



<P>Of the wide<A NAME = "AO6125"></A> variety of information risks facing U.S. companies operating internationally, those resulting from electronic 
vulnerabilities appear to be the most significant.  The National Counterintelligence Center (NACIC), an arm of the U.S. intelligence community
, concluded that &quot;specialized technical operations (including computer intrusions, telecommunications targeting and intercept
, and private-sector encryption weaknesses) account for the largest portion of economic and industrial information lost by U.S. 
corporations.&quot;  Specifically, the NACIC noted, <BR>



<P><li>  Because they are so easily accessed and intercepted, corporate<A NAME = "AO61419"></A><A NAME = "AS61420"></A><A NAME = "AS61421"></A><A NAME = "AS61422"></A><A NAME = "AB61423"></A> telecommunications--particularly international<A NAME = "AB61430"></A> 
telecommunications--provide a highly vulnerable and lucrative source for anyone interested in obtaining trade<A NAME = "BB61460"></A><A HREF = "SPAP3.HTM#AF65262"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> secrets or competitive information
.  Because of the increased usage of these links for bulk computer data transmission and electronic mail, intelligence<A NAME = "AO614104"></A><A NAME = "AS614105"></A><A NAME = "AS614106"></A><A NAME = "AB614107"></A><A HREF = "SPP22.HTM#BB614134"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> collectors 
find telecommunications<A NAME = "BB614115"></A><A HREF = "SPP23.HTM#BB6403"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> intercepts cost-effective. For example, foreign<A NAME = "AO614128"></A><A NAME = "AS614129"></A><A NAME = "AS614130"></A><A NAME = "AS614131"></A> intelligence<A NAME = "BB614134"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF614107"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> collectors intercept facsimile<A NAME = "AB614141"></A> transmissions 
through government<A NAME = "AB614149"></A>-owned telephone companies, and the stakes are large--approximately half of all overseas telecommunications are 
facsimile transmissions.  Innovative<A NAME = "AO614187"></A> &quot;hackers&quot; connected to computers containing competitive information evade the controls and
 access companies' information.  In addition, many American<A NAME = "AO614227"></A><A NAME = "AS614228"></A><A NAME = "AS614229"></A><A NAME = "AB614230"></A> companies have begun using electronic<A NAME = "AB614241"></A> data interchange, a system of 
transferring corporate bidding, invoice, and pricing data electronically overseas.  Many foreign<A NAME = "AO614275"></A><A NAME = "AS614276"></A> government and corporate<A NAME = "AB614283"></A> intelligence 
collectors find this information invaluable.<BR>

greatness, either by oppressing you, who are their master, or others 
<P>

contrary to your intentions; but if the captain is not skilful, you 
<P>

are ruined in the usual way. 
<P>

And if it be urged that whoever is armed will act in the same way, 
<P>

whether mercenary or not, I reply that when arms have to be resorted 
<P>

to, either by a prince or a republic, then the prince ought to go in 
<P>

person and perform the duty of captain; the republic has to send its 
<P>

citizens, and when one is sent who does not turn out satisfactorily, 
<P>

it ought to recall him, and when one is worthy, to hold him by the 
<P>

laws so that he does not leave the command. And experience has shown 
<P>

princes and republics, single-handed, making the greatest progress, 
<P>

and mercenaries doing nothing except damage; and it is more 
<P>

difficult to bring a republic, armed with its own arms, under the sway 

<P>

of one of its citizens than it is to bring one armed with foreign 
<P>

arms. Rome<A NAME = "AO12135"></A><A NAME = "AS12136"></A><A NAME = "AS12137"></A><A NAME = "BB12138"></A><A HREF = "SPP53.HTM#BB159210"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> and Sparta<A NAME = "AB121313"></A> stood for many ages armed and free. The Switzers 

<P>

are completely armed and quite free. 
<P>

Of ancient mercenaries, for example, there are the Carthaginians, 
<P>

who were oppressed by their mercenary soldiers after the first war 
<P>

with the Romans, although the Carthaginians<A NAME = "AO121713"></A> had their own citizens for 

<P>

captains. After the death of Epaminondas, Philip of Macedon was made 
<P>

captain of their soldiers by the Thebans, and after victory he took 
<P>

away their liberty. 
<P>

Duke Filippo being dead, the Milanese<A NAME = "AO122113"></A> enlisted Francesco Sforza 
<P>

against the Venetians, and he, having overcome the enemy at 
<P>

Caravaggio<A NAME = "AS12233"></A><A NAME = "AB12234"></A>, allied himself with them to crush the Milanese, his 
<P>

masters. His father, Sforza, having been engaged by Queen Johanna of 
<P>

Naples<A NAME = "AS12253"></A><A NAME = "BB12254"></A><A HREF = "SPP41.HTM#BB123824"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, left her unprotected, so that she was forced to throw 
<P>

herself into the arms of the King of Aragon, in order to save her 
<P>

kingdom. And if the Venetians and Florentines formerly extended 
<P>

their dominions by these arms, and yet their captains did not make

themselves princes, but have defended them, I reply that the 
<P>

Florentines<A NAME = "AO12303"></A> in this case have been favoured by chance, for of the able 

<P>

captains, of whom they might have stood in fear, some have not 
<P>

conquered, some have been opposed, and others have turned their 
<P>

ambitions elsewhere. One who did not conquer was Giovanni Acuto,* 
<P>

and since he did not conquer his fidelity cannot be proved; but 
<P>

every<A NAME = "AO12353"></A> one will acknowledge that, had he conquered, the Florentines 
<P>

would have stood at his discretion. Sforza had the Bracceschi always 
<P>

against him, so they watched each other. Francesco turned his ambition 

<P>

to Lombardy; Braccio<A NAME = "AS12387"></A> against the Church and the kingdom of Naples<A NAME = "BB123824"></A><A HREF = "SPP86.HTM#BB258924"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>. But 

<P>

let us come to that which happened a short while ago. The 
<P>

Florentines<A NAME = "AO12403"></A><A NAME = "AS12404"></A> appointed as their captain<A NAME = "AB124013"></A> Paolo Vitelli, a most prudent 
<P>

man, who from a private position had risen to the greatest renown. 
<P>

If this man had taken Pisa, nobody can deny that it would have been 
<P>

proper for the Florentines to keep in with him, for if he became the 
<P>

soldier of their enemies they had no means of resisting, and if they 
<P>

held to him they must obey him. The Venetians, if their achievements 
<P>

are considered, will be seen to have acted safely and gloriously so 
<P>

long as they sent to war their own men, when with armed gentlemen 
<P>

and plebeians they did valiantly. This was before they turned to 
<P>

enterprises on land, but when they began to fight on land they forsook 

<P>

this virtue and followed the custom of Italy. And in the beginning 
<P>

of their expansion on land, through not having much territory, and 
<P>

because of their great reputation, they had not much to fear from 
<P>

their captains; but when they expanded, as under Carmignola, they 
<P>

had a taste of this mistake; for, having found him a most valiant 
<P>

man (they beat the Duke of Milan under his leadership), and, on the 
<P>

other hand, knowing how lukewarm he was in the war, they feared they 
<P>

would no longer conquer under him, and for this reason they were not 
<P>

willing, nor were they able, to let him go; and so, not to lose 
<P>

the Pope with their aid, as has been observed. Thirdly, by 
<P>

converting the college more to himself. Fourthly, by acquiring so much 

<P>

power<A NAME = "AO6913"></A> before the Pope should die that he could by his own measures 
<P>

resist the first shock. Of these four things, at the death of 
<P>

Alexander, he had accomplished three. For he had killed as many of the 

<P>

dispossessed lords as he could lay hands on, and few had escaped; he 
<P>

had won over the Roman gentlemen, and he had the most numerous party 
<P>

in the college. And as to any fresh acquisition, he intended to become 

<P>

master of Tuscany, for he already possessed Perugia and Piombino, 
<P>

and Pisa was under his protection. And as he had no longer to study 
<P>

France<A NAME = "AS6993"></A><A NAME = "BB6994"></A><A HREF = "SPP25.HTM#BB75612"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> (for the French were already driven out of the kingdom of 
<P>

Naples<A NAME = "AS7003"></A><A NAME = "BB7004"></A><A HREF = "SPP40.HTM#BB12254"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> by the Spaniards, and in this way both were compelled to buy 
<P>

his goodwill), he pounced down upon Pisa. After this, Lucca and 
<P>

Siena yielded at once, partly through hatred and partly through fear 
<P>

of the Florentines; and the Florentines would have had no remedy had 
<P>

he continued to prosper, as he was prospering the year that 
<P>

Alexander died, for he had acquired so much power and reputation 
<P>

that he would have stood by himself, and no longer have depended on 
<P>

the luck and the forces of others, but solely on his own power and 
<P>

ability. 
<P>

But Alexander<A NAME = "AO7095"></A> died five years after he had first drawn the sword. He 
<P>

left the duke with the state of Romagna alone consolidated, with the 
<P>

rest in the air, between two most powerful hostile armies, and sick 
<P>

unto death. Yet there were in the duke such boldness and ability, 
<P>

and he knew so well how men are to be won or lost, and so firm were 
<P>

the foundations which in so short a time he had laid, that if he had 
<P>

not had those armies on his back, or if he had been in good<A NAME = "AS71529"></A> health<A NAME = "AB71532"></A><A HREF = "SPP24.HTM#BB72228"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, he 

<P>

would have overcome all difficulties. And it is seen that his 
<P>

foundations were good, for the Romagna awaited him for more than a 
<P>

month. In Rome<A NAME = "AS7187"></A><A NAME = "BB7188"></A><A HREF = "SPP24.HTM#BB71927"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, although but half alive, he remained secure; and

<h3>CHAPTER IX 
<P>

CONCERNING A CIVIL PRINCIPALITY </h3>
<P>

<P>

BUT coming to the other point- where a leading citizen becomes the 
<P>

prince of his country, not by wickedness or any intolerable 
<P>

violence, but by the favour of his fellow citizens- this may be called 

<P>

a civil principality: nor is genius or fortune altogether necessary to 

<P>

attain to it, but rather a happy shrewdness. I say then that such a 
<P>

principality<A NAME = "AO9093"></A> is obtained either by the favour of the people or by 
<P>

the favour of the nobles. Because in all cities these two distinct 
<P>

parties are found, and from this it arises that the people do not wish 

<P>

to be ruled nor oppressed by the nobles, and the nobles wish to rule 
<P>

and oppress the people; and from these two opposite desires there 
<P>

arises in cities one of three results, either a principality, 
<P>

self-government, or anarchy. 
<P>

A principality<A NAME = "AO9165"></A> is created either by the people or by the nobles, 
<P>

accordingly as one or other of them has the opportunity; for the 
<P>

nobles, seeing they cannot withstand the people, begin to cry up the 
<P>

reputation of one of themselves, and they make him a prince, so that 
<P>

under his shadow they can give vent to their ambitions. The people, 
<P>

finding they cannot resist the nobles, also cry up the reputation of 
<P>

one of themselves, and make him a prince so as to be defended by his 
<P>

authority. He who obtains sovereignty by the assistance of the 
<P>

nobles maintains himself with more difficulty than he who comes to 
<P>

it by the aid of the people, because the former finds himself with 
<P>

many around him who consider themselves his equals, and because of 
<P>

this he can neither rule nor manage them to his liking. But he who 
<P>

reaches sovereignty by popular favour finds himself alone, and has 
<P>

<H2><B>CONCLUSION</B></H2>

<P>The committee<A NAME = "AO3323"></A><A NAME = "AS3324"></A><A NAME = "AS3325"></A> believes that its recommendations will lead to enhanced confidentiality and protection of information for 
individuals and companies, thereby reducing economic and financial<A NAME = "AB33251"></A> crimes and economic<A NAME = "BB33258"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF65284"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> espionage from both domestic and foreign sources.  
While the recommendations<A NAME = "AO33280"></A><A NAME = "AS33281"></A> will to that extent contribute to the prevention of crime and enhance national<A NAME = "BB332108"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB35237"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> security, the committee 
recognizes that the spread of cryptography will increase the burden of those in government<A NAME = "AO332144"></A><A NAME = "AS332145"></A><A NAME = "AS332146"></A> charged with carrying out certain specific law<A NAME = "BB332161"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB35230"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> 
enforcement and intelligence<A NAME = "AB332169"></A> activities.  It believes that widespread commercial and private use of cryptography in the United States and 
abroad is inevitable in the long run and that its advantages, on balance, outweigh its disadvantages.  The committee<A NAME = "AO332239"></A><A NAME = "AS332240"></A> concluded that 
the overall interests of the government and the nation would best be served by a policy that fosters a judicious transition toward 
the broad use of cryptography<A NAME = "BB332301"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB35040"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A>.<BR>

<H2><B>THE TEXT OF THE RECOMMENDATIONS</B></H2>

<P><U><B>Recommendation 1:</U></B>  No<A NAME = "AO33810"></A><A NAME = "AS33811"></A><A NAME = "AS33812"></A> law should bar the manufacture, sale, or use of any form of encryption<A NAME = "BB33839"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB35836"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> within the United<A NAME = "BB33846"></A><A HREF = "SPP15.HTM#BB470413"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> States. <BR>

open public<A NAME = "BB34051"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF11349"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> discussion and governed by the rule of law.<BR>



<P><U><B>Recommendation 3:</U></B>  National<A NAME = "AO34210"></A><A NAME = "AS34211"></A><A NAME = "AS34212"></A><A NAME = "AS34213"></A> cryptography<A NAME = "BB34216"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB40198"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy affecting the development and use of commercial<A NAME = "BB34233"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF11932"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> cryptography should be more 
closely aligned with market<A NAME = "BB34251"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF11950"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> forces.<BR>



<P><U><B>Recommendation 4:</U></B>  Export controls on cryptography should be progressively relaxed but not eliminated.<BR>



<P><B>     4.1<A NAME = "AO3463"></A><A NAME = "AS3464"></A></B>--Products providing confidentiality at a level that meets most general commercial<A NAME = "BB34628"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF17430"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> requirements should be easily 
exportable.  Today, products<A NAME = "AO34644"></A><A NAME = "AS34645"></A> with encryption<A NAME = "BB34650"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF138205"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> capabilities that incorporate 56-bit DES provide this level of confidentiality and should be 
easily exportable.<BR>



<P><B>     4.2<A NAME = "AO3483"></A></B>--Products providing stronger confidentiality should be exportable on an expedited basis to a list of approved companies
 if the proposed product user is willing to provide access to decrypted information upon legally authorized request.<BR>



<P><B>     4.3</B>--The U.S<A NAME = "AO3508"></A><A NAME = "AS3509"></A><A NAME = "AS35010"></A>. government should streamline and increase the transparency<A NAME = "BB35025"></A><A HREF = "SPAP3.HTM#AF21227"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> of the export licensing process for cryptography<A NAME = "BB35040"></A><A HREF = "SPP11.HTM#BB35426"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A>.<BR>



<P><U><B>Recommendation 5:</U></B>  The U.S<A NAME = "AO35212"></A><A NAME = "AS35213"></A><A NAME = "AS35214"></A><A NAME = "AS35215"></A>. government should take steps to assist law<A NAME = "BB35230"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB36244"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> enforcement and national<A NAME = "BB35237"></A><A HREF = "SPP12.HTM#BB36252"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> security to adjust to new 
technical<A NAME = "BB35251"></A><A HREF = "SPAP3.HTM#AF23750"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> realities of the information age.  <BR>



<P><B>     5.1</B>--The U.S<A NAME = "AO3548"></A><A NAME = "AS3549"></A>. government should actively encourage the use of cryptography<A NAME = "BB35426"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB40113"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> in nonconfidentiality applications such as user 
authentication and integrity checks.<BR>



<P><B>     5.2</B>--The U.S<A NAME = "AO3568"></A><A NAME = "AS3569"></A>. government should promote the security<A NAME = "BB35620"></A><A HREF = "SPAP3.HTM#AF25122"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> of the telecommunications networks more actively.  At a minimum, the 
U.S<A NAME = "AO35644"></A><A NAME = "AS35645"></A><A NAME = "AS35646"></A>. government should promote the link encryption<A NAME = "AB35659"></A> of cellular communications and the improvement of security at telephone<A NAME = "BB35680"></A><A HREF = "SPAP3.HTM#AF25188"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> switches
.<BR>



<P><B>     5.3</B>--To better understand how escrowed encryption might operate, the U.S<A NAME = "AO35824"></A><A NAME = "AS35825"></A>. government should explore escrowed encryption<A NAME = "BB35836"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB401233"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> for
 its own uses.  To address the critical international dimensions of escrowed communications, the U.S. government should work with
 other nations on this topic.<BR>

and turned entirely to the duke. After this he awaited an 
<P>

opportunity to crush the Orsini, having scattered the adherents of the 

<P>

Colonna. This came to him soon and he used it well; for the Orsini, 
<P>

perceiving at length that the aggrandizement of the duke and the 
<P>

Church was ruin to them, called a meeting at Magione, in the territory 

<P>

of Perugia. From this sprung<A NAME = "AS63411"></A><A NAME = "AS63412"></A> the rebellion at Urbino<A NAME = "BB63421"></A><A HREF = "SPP21.HTM#BB6464"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> and the tumults<A NAME = "BB63428"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF37411"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>

<P>

overcame with the help of the French. Having restored his authority,

not to leave it at risk by trusting either to the French or other 
<P>

outside forces, he had recourse to his wiles, and he knew so well 
<P>

how to conceal his mind that, by the mediation of Signor Paolo

[Orsini]- whom the duke did not fail to secure with all kinds of 
<P>

attention, giving him money, apparel, and horses<A NAME = "AS64115"></A><A NAME = "AB64116"></A>- the Orsini were 
<P>

reconciled, so that their simplicity brought them into his power at 
<P>

Sinigaglia. Having exterminated the leaders, and turned their 
<P>

partisans into his friends, the duke had laid sufficiently good 
<P>

foundations to his power, having all the Romagna and the duchy of 
<P>

When the duke occupied the Romagna he found it under the rule of

weak masters, who rather plundered their subjects than ruled them, and 

<P>

gave them more cause for disunion than for union, so that the

country<A NAME = "AO6533"></A> was full of robbery, quarrels, and every kind of violence; and 

<P>

so, wishing to bring back peace and obedience to authority, he

considered it necessary to give it a good governor. Thereupon he 
<P>

promoted Messer Ramiro d'Orco [de Lorqua], a swift and cruel man, to

whom he gave the fullest power. This man in a short time restored

<P>For most of history, cryptography<A NAME = "AO4019"></A><A NAME = "AS40110"></A><A NAME = "AS40111"></A><A NAME = "AS40112"></A><A NAME = "BB40113"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB43082"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A>--the art and science of secret writing--has belonged to governments concerned about protecting
 their own secrets and about asserting their prerogatives for access to information relevant to national<A NAME = "BB40173"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB490156"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> security and public<A NAME = "BB40180"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF93119"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> 
safety.  In the United States, cryptography<A NAME = "AO40194"></A><A NAME = "AS40195"></A><A NAME = "AS40196"></A><A NAME = "AS40197"></A><A NAME = "BB40198"></A><A HREF = "SPP14.HTM#BB41830"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> policy has reflected the U.S. government's<A NAME = "AB401111"></A> needs for effective cryptographic<A NAME = "BB401120"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF129275"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> protection of
 classified and other sensitive communications as well as its needs to gather intelligence for national security purposes, needs 
that would be damaged by the widespread use of cryptography.  National<A NAME = "AO401185"></A><A NAME = "AS401186"></A><A NAME = "AS401187"></A><A NAME = "AS401188"></A><A NAME = "AS401189"></A><A NAME = "AB401190"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB40762"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> security concerns have motivated such actions as development 
of cryptographic<A NAME = "BB401212"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB401242"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> technologies, development of countermeasures to reverse the effects of encryption<A NAME = "BB401233"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB40367"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A>, and control of cryptographic<A NAME = "BB401242"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB40575"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> 
technologies for export.  <BR>



<P>In the last 20 years, a number of developments have brought about what could be called the popularization of cryptography.  
First, some industries<A NAME = "AO40346"></A><A NAME = "AS40347"></A><A NAME = "AS40348"></A>--notably financial services--have come to rely on encryption<A NAME = "BB40367"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB403106"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> as an enabler of secure electronic<A NAME = "AB40380"></A> funds 
transfers.  Second, other<A NAME = "AO40390"></A><A NAME = "AS40391"></A> industries have developed an interest in encryption<A NAME = "BB403106"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB40541"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> for protection of proprietary and other sensitive 
information.  Third, the broadening<A NAME = "AO403130"></A><A NAME = "AS403131"></A><A NAME = "AS403132"></A> use of computers and computer<A NAME = "AB403143"></A> networks has generalized the demand for technologies to secure 
communications down to the level of individual citizens and assure the privacy and security<A NAME = "AB403191"></A> of their electronic records and transmissions.  
Fourth, the sharply increased<A NAME = "AO403213"></A> use of wireless communications (e.g., cellular telephones) has highlighted the greater vulnerability of 
such communications to unauthorized intercept as well as the difficulty of detecting these intercepts.<BR>



<P>As a result, efforts<A NAME = "AO4057"></A><A NAME = "AS4058"></A><A NAME = "AS4059"></A><A NAME = "AS40510"></A> have increased to develop encryption<A NAME = "AB40521"></A> systems for private<A NAME = "AB40528"></A> sector use and to integrate encryption<A NAME = "BB40541"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB40725"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> with other 
information technology products.  Interest<A NAME = "AO40555"></A><A NAME = "AS40556"></A><A NAME = "AS40557"></A> has grown in the commercial<A NAME = "AB40568"></A> market for cryptographic<A NAME = "BB40575"></A><A HREF = "SPP13.HTM#BB407147"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> technologies and systems incorporating such
 technologies, and the nation has witnessed a heightened debate over individual need for and access to technologies to protect 
individual privacy.  <BR>



<P>Still another<A NAME = "AO4073"></A><A NAME = "AS4074"></A><A NAME = "AS4075"></A><A NAME = "AS4076"></A> consequence of the expectation of widespread use of encryption<A NAME = "BB40725"></A><A HREF = "SPP17.HTM#BB528164"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> is the emergence of law<A NAME = "AB40736"></A> enforcement concerns that 
parallel, on a civilian basis, some of the national<A NAME = "BB40762"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF401190"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> security concerns.  Law<A NAME = "AO40769"></A><A NAME = "AS40770"></A><A NAME = "AS40771"></A><A NAME = "AS40772"></A><A NAME = "BB40773"></A><A HREF = "SPP16.HTM#BB48447"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> enforcement officials fear that wide dissemination<A NAME = "AB40786"></A> of 
effective cryptographic technologies will impede their efforts to collect information necessary for pursuing criminal<A NAME = "AB407118"></A> investigations.  On
 the other side, civil<A NAME = "AO407132"></A><A NAME = "AS407133"></A><A NAME = "AS407134"></A> libertarians fear that controls on cryptographic<A NAME = "BB407147"></A><A HREF = "SPP25.HTM#BB670100"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> technologies will give government<A NAME = "BB407156"></A><A HREF = "SPAP1.HTM#AF37200"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> authorities both in the
 United States and abroad unprecedented and unwarranted capabilities for intrusion into the private lives of citizens.<BR>

mark, not to reach by their strength or arrow to so great a height, 
<P>

but to be able with the aid of so high an aim to hit the mark they 
<P>

wish to reach. 
<P>

I say, therefore, that in entirely new principalities, where there 
<P>

is a new prince, more or less difficulty is found in keeping them, 
<P>

accordingly as there is more or less ability in him who has acquired 
<P>

the state. Now, as the fact of becoming a prince from a private 
<P>

station presupposes either ability or fortune, it is clear that one or 

<P>

other of these two things will mitigate in some degree many 
<P>

difficulties. Nevertheless, he who has relied least on fortune is 
<P>

established the strongest. Further, it facilitates matters when the 
<P>

prince, having no other state, is compelled to reside there in person. 

<P>

But to come to those who, by their own ability and not through 
<P>

fortune, have risen to be princes, I say that Moses, Cyrus, Romulus, 
<P>

Theseus, and such like are the most excellent examples. And although 
<P>

one may not discuss Moses, he having been a mere executor of the 
<P>

will of God, yet he ought to be admired, if only for that favour which 

<P>

made him worthy to speak with God. But in considering Cyrus and others 

<P>

who have acquired or founded kingdoms, all will be found admirable; 
<P>

and if their particular deeds and conduct shall be considered, they 
<P>

will not be found inferior to those of Moses, although he had so great 

<P>

a preceptor. And in examining their actions and lives one cannot see 
<P>

that they owed anything to fortune beyond opportunity, which brought 
<P>

them the material to mould into the form which seemed best to them. 
<P>

Without that opportunity their powers of mind would have been 
<P>

extinguished, and without those powers the opportunity would have come 

<P>

in vain. 
<P>

It was necessary, therefore, to Moses that he should find the people 
<P>

of Israel<A NAME = "AO4775"></A><A NAME = "AS4776"></A><A NAME = "AS4777"></A><A NAME = "AB4778"></A><A HREF = "SPP87.HTM#BB262728"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> in Egypt<A NAME = "AB47713"></A> enslaved and oppressed by the Egyptians, in order

considered that it was not advisable to confer such excessive 
<P>

authority, for he had no doubt but that he would become odious, so 
<P>

he set up a court of judgment in the country, under a most excellent 
<P>

president, wherein all cities had their advocates. And because he knew 

<P>

that the past severity had caused some hatred against himself, so, 
<P>

to clear himself in the minds of the people, and gain them entirely to 

<P>

himself, he desired to show that, if any cruelty had been practised, 
<P>

it had not originated with him, but in the natural sternness of the 
<P>

minister. Under this pretence he took Ramiro, and one morning caused 
<P>

him to be executed and left on the piazza at Cesena with the block and 

<P>

a bloody knife at his side. The barbarity of this spectacle caused the 

<P>

people to be at once satisfied and dismayed. 
<P>

But let us return whence we started. I say that the duke, finding 
<P>

himself now sufficiently powerful and partly secured from immediate 
<P>

dangers by having armed himself in his own way, and having in a 
<P>

great measure crushed those forces in his vicinity that could injure 
<P>

him if he wished to proceed with his conquest, had next to consider 
<P>

France<A NAME = "AS6763"></A><A NAME = "BB6764"></A><A HREF = "SPP22.HTM#BB67816"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, for he knew that the king, who too late was aware of his 
<P>

mistake, would not support him. And from this time he began to seek 
<P>

new<A NAME = "AS6783"></A> alliances and to temporize with France<A NAME = "BB67816"></A><A HREF = "SPP23.HTM#BB6994"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> in the expedition which she 

<P>

was making<A NAME = "AS6795"></A> towards the kingdom of Naples<A NAME = "BB67916"></A><A HREF = "SPP23.HTM#BB7004"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> against the Spaniards who 
<P>

were besieging Gaeta. It was his intention to secure himself against 
<P>

them, and this he would have quickly accomplished had Alexander lived. 

<P>

Such was his line of action as to present affairs. But as to the 
<P>

future he had to fear, in the first place, that a new successor to the 

<P>

Church might not be friendly to him and might seek to take from him 
<P>

that which Alexander had given him, so he decided to act in four ways. 

<P>

Firstly, by exterminating the families of those lords whom he had 
<P>

despoiled, so as to take away that pretext from the Pope. Secondly, by 

<P>

winning to himself all the gentlemen<A NAME = "AS68813"></A> of Rome<A NAME = "BB68818"></A><A HREF = "SPP23.HTM#BB7188"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, so as to be able to curb

<P>

dispersed but at every chance they immediately rally to them, as 
<P>

Pisa after the hundred years she had been held in bondage by the 
<P>

Florentines. 
<P>

But when cities or countries are accustomed to live under a 
<P>

prince, and his family is exterminated, they, being on the one hand 
<P>

accustomed to obey and on the other hand not having the old prince, 
<P>

cannot agree in making one from amongst themselves, and they do not 
<P>

know how to govern themselves. For this reason they are very slow to 
<P>

take up arms, and a prince can gain them to himself and secure them 
<P>

much more easily. But in republics there is more vitality, greater 
<P>

hatred, and more desire for vengeance, which will never permit them to 

<P>

allow the memory of their former liberty to rest; so that the safest

LET no one be surprised if, in speaking of entirely new

beaten by others, and following by imitation their deeds, are yet 
<P>

unable to keep entirely to the ways of others or attain to the power 
<P>

of those they imitate. A wise man ought always to follow the paths 
<P>

beaten by great men, and to imitate those who have been supreme, so 
<P>

that if his ability does not equal theirs, at least it will savour 
<P>

of it. Let him act like the clever archers who, designing to hit the

which the strength of their bow attains, take aim much higher than the

<P>Historically, cryptography<A NAME = "AO5943"></A><A NAME = "AS5944"></A><A NAME = "BB5945"></A><A HREF = "SPP21.HTM#BB59446"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> is rooted in the desire to keep information secret from those not authorized to see it.  Modern<A NAME = "AO59440"></A><A NAME = "AS59441"></A><A NAME = "AS59442"></A> 
cryptography<A NAME = "BB59446"></A><A HREF = "SPP21.HTM#BB5965"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> is based on the operation of mathematical algorithms on digital<A NAME = "BB59467"></A><A HREF = "SPAP0.HTM#AF249221"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> data.  The basic idea is that any message can be represented as
 a set of numbers (the plaintext).  A mathematical<A NAME = "AO594111"></A><A NAME = "AS594112"></A> algorithm, combined with a user-chosen number called an encrypting &quot;key,
&quot; is then used to transform the plaintext<A NAME = "BB594153"></A><A HREF = "SPAP2.HTM#AF196196"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> into a different set of numbers (the ciphertext).  By undertaking other mathematical 
operations on the ciphertext in combination with a decrypting key, the meaningful plaintext can be recovered.  The strength of 
cryptography rests on the fact that for certain choices of algorithm, going from the ciphertext to the plaintext without knowing the 
decrypting key is very difficult and takes an impractically long time if knowledge of the key is not available.<BR>



<P>Today, cryptography<A NAME = "AO5963"></A><A NAME = "AS5964"></A><A NAME = "BB5965"></A><A HREF = "SPP21.HTM#BB59890"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> has become an enabling tool in other areas.  Cryptographic techniques continue to be used to ensure data 
confidentiality (keeping data private), but they are also applicable for purposes of maintaining data integrity (ensuring that data retrieved 
or received is identical to data originally stored or sent) and providing subject authentication (verification that the purported 
sender or author of a message is indeed its real sender or author).<BR>



<P>These capabilities for protecting data confidentiality, data integrity, and user authentication are logically separate; that is
, a given cryptographic product may implement functionality for any or all of these capabilities.  For example, a &quot;groupware<A NAME = "AO59869"></A><A NAME = "AS59870"></A><A NAME = "AS59871"></A><A NAME = "AS59872"></A><A NAME = "AB59873"></A>
&quot; program for remote collaboration may implement cryptography<A NAME = "BB59890"></A><A HREF = "SPP21.HTM#BB598114"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> for confidentiality (by encrypting messages sent between users) and
 cryptography<A NAME = "BB598114"></A><A HREF = "SPP23.HTM#BB6483"><img src="CIRCLINK.GIF"></A> for data integrity and user authentication (by appending a digital signature to all messages sent between users).  
Further, this program may be implemented in a way that these features can operate independently (either, both, or neither may be 
operative at the same time).

enemies, because in adversity they always help to ruin him. 
<P>

Therefore, one who becomes a prince through the favour of the people 
<P>

ought to keep them friendly, and this he can easily do seeing they 
<P>

only ask not to be oppressed by him. But one who, in opposition to the 

<P>

people, becomes a prince by the favour of the nobles, ought, above 
<P>

everything, to seek to win the people over to himself, and this he may 

<P>

easily do if he takes them under his protection. Because men, when 
<P>

they receive good from him of whom they were expecting evil, are bound 

<P>

more closely to their benefactor; thus the people quickly become 
<P>

more devoted to him than if he had been raised to the principality 
<P>

by their favours; and the prince can win their affections in many 
<P>

ways, but as these vary according to the circumstances one cannot give 

<P>

fixed rules, so I omit them; but, I repeat, it is necessary for a 
<P>

prince to have the people friendly, otherwise he has no security in 
<P>

adversity. 
<P>

Nabis, Prince of the Spartans, sustained<A NAME = "AS97413"></A> the attack of all Greece<A NAME = "BB97424"></A><A HREF = "SPP44.HTM#BB133310"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A>, 
<P>

and of a victorious Roman army, and against them he defended his 
<P>

country and his government; and for the overcoming of this peril it 
<P>

was only necessary for him to make himself secure against a few, but 
<P>

this would not have been sufficient if the people had been hostile. 
<P>

And do not let any one impugn this statement with the trite proverb 
<P>

that 'He who builds on the people, builds on the mud,' for this is 
<P>

true<A NAME = "AO9813"></A> when a private citizen makes a foundation there, and persuades 
<P>

himself that the people will free him when he is oppressed by his 
<P>

enemies or by the magistrates; wherein he would find himself very 
<P>

often deceived, as happened<A NAME = "AS9849"></A> to the Gracchi in Rome<A NAME = "BB98420"></A><A HREF = "SPP37.HTM#BB111026"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> and to Messer 
<P>

Giorgio Scali in Florence. But granted a prince who has established 
<P>

himself as above, who can command, and is a man of courage, undismayed 

<P>

in adversity, who does not fail in other qualifications, and who, by 
<P>

his resolution and energy, keeps the whole people encouraged- such a

which others have had to keep an acquisition, such as Pyrrhus<A NAME = "AS38923"></A><A NAME = "AB38924"></A> and many 

<P>

more; this is not occasioned by the little or abundance of ability 
<P>

in the conqueror, but by the want of uniformity in the subject state. 
<P>

<h3>CHAPTER<A NAME = "AS3932"></A><A NAME = "AS3933"></A><A NAME = "AS3934"></A><A NAME = "AB3935"></A> V 
<P>

CONCERNING THE WAY TO GOVERN<A NAME = "AB39322"></A> CITIES OR PRINCIPALITIES WHICH 

LIVED UNDER THEIR OWN<A NAME = "AB39341"></A> LAWS BEFORE THEY WERE ANNEXED</h3> 
<P>

<P>

WHENEVER those states which have been acquired as stated have been 
<P>

accustomed to live under their own laws and in freedom, there are 
<P>

three courses for those who wish to hold them: the first is to ruin 
<P>

them, the next is to reside there in person, the third is to permit 
<P>

them to live under their own laws, drawing a tribute, and establishing 

<P>

within it an oligarchy<A NAME = "AO4019"></A><A NAME = "AS40110"></A><A NAME = "AB40111"></A> which will keep it friendly to you. Because 
<P>

such a government, being created by the prince, knows that it cannot 
<P>

stand without his friendship and interest, and does its utmost to 
<P>

support him; and therefore he who would keep a city accustomed to 
<P>

freedom<A NAME = "AO4053"></A> will hold it more easily by the means of its own citizens than 

<P>

in any other way. 
<P>

There are, for example, the Spartans and the Romans. The Spartans 
<P>

held<A NAME = "AS4083"></A><A NAME = "AS4084"></A> Athens<A NAME = "AB4087"></A> and Thebes<A NAME = "AB40812"></A>, establishing there an oligarchy, 
<P>

nevertheless they lost them. The Romans, in order to hold Capua, 
<P>

Carthage<A NAME = "AS4103"></A><A NAME = "AB4104"></A>, and Numantia, dismantled them, and did not lose them. They 
<P>

wished<A NAME = "AS4113"></A> to hold Greece<A NAME = "BB41110"></A><A HREF = "SPP18.HTM#BB55216"><img src="circlink.GIF"></A> as the Spartans held it, making it free and 
<P>

permitting its laws, and did not succeed. So to hold it they were 
<P>

compelled to dismantle many cities in the country, for in truth 
<P>

there is no safe way to retain them otherwise than by ruining them. 
<P>

And he who becomes master of a city accustomed to freedom and does not 

<P>

destroy it, may expect to be destroyed by it, for in rebellion it 
<P>

has always the watch-word of liberty and its ancient privileges as a 
<P>

rallying point, which neither time nor benefits will ever cause it 
<P>

After all I had gone through, and my fear of being recognised
<P>

by some enemy, I could only travel very slowly and cautiously,
<P>

generally resting in some out-of-the-way place by day, and walking
<P>

as far as I was able by night, but at length I arrived in the kingdom
<P>

of my uncle, of whose protection I was sure.
<P>

<P>

I found him in great trouble about the disappearance of his son,
<P>

who had, he said, vanished without leaving a trace; but his own grief
<P>

did not prevent him sharing mine.  We mingled our tears, for the loss
<P>

of one was the loss of the other, and then I made up my mind that it
<P>

was my duty to break the solemn oath I had sworn to the prince. 
<P>

I therefore lost no time in telling my uncle everything I knew,
<P>

and I observed that even before I had ended his sorrow appeared to be
<P>

lightened a little.
<P>

<P>

&quot;My dear nephew,&quot; he said, &quot;your story gives me some hope. 

<P>

I was aware that my son was building a tomb, and I think I can find
<P>

the spot.  But as he wished to keep the matter secret, let us go
<P>

alone and seek the place ourselves.&quot;
<P>

<P>

He then bade me disguise myself, and we both slipped out of a
<P>

garden<A NAME = "AO18803"></A><A NAME = "AS18804"></A><A NAME = "AB18805"></A> door which opened on to the cemetery.  It did not take
<P>

long for us to arrive at the scene of the prince's disappearance,
<P>

or to discover the tomb I had sought so vainly before. 
<P>

We entered it, and found the trap-door which led to the staircase,
<P>

but we had great difficulty in raising it, because the prince had
<P>

fastened it down underneath with the plaster he had brought with him.
<P>

<P>

My uncle went first, and I followed him.  When we reached the bottom
<P>

of the stairs we stepped into a sort of ante-room, filled with
<P>
<P>

and never to lose sight of him.  One<A NAME = "AO86917"></A><A NAME = "AS86918"></A><A NAME = "AS86919"></A> day the huntsman<A NAME = "AB86926"></A> roused a stag<A NAME = "AB86933"></A>,
<P>

and the prince, thinking that the vizir was behind, gave chase,
<P>

and rode so hard that he found himself alone.  He stopped,
<P>

and having lost sight of it, he turned to rejoin the vizir,
<P>

who had not been careful enough to follow him.  But he lost his way. 
<P>

Whilst he was trying to find it, he saw on the side of the road
<P>

a beautiful lady who was crying bitterly.  He drew his horse's rein,
<P>

and asked her who she was and what she was doing in this place,
<P>

and if she needed help.  &quot;I am the daughter of an Indian king,&quot;

<P>

she answered, &quot;and whilst riding in the country I fell asleep and
<P>

tumbled off.  My horse has run away, and I do not know what has become
<P>

of him.&quot;
<P>

<P>

The young prince had pity on her, and offered to take her behind him,
<P>

which he did.  As they passed by a ruined building the lady dismounted
<P>

and went in.  The prince also dismounted and followed her. 
<P>

To his great surprise, he heard her saying to some one inside,
<P>

&quot;Rejoice my children; I am bringing you a nice fat youth.&quot;  And 
other
<P>

voices<A NAME = "AO8873"></A><A NAME = "AS8874"></A> replied, &quot;Where is he, mamma<A NAME = "AB88716"></A>, that we may eat him at once,
<P>

as we are very hungry?&quot;
<P>

<P>

The prince at once saw the danger he was in.  He now knew that the
<P>

lady<A NAME = "AO8913"></A><A NAME = "AS8914"></A> who said she was the daughter of an Indian king was an ogress<A NAME = "AB89131"></A>,
<P>

who lived in desolate places, and who by a thousand wiles surprised
<P>

and devoured passers-by. He was terrified, and threw himself on
<P>

his horse.  The pretended princess appeared at this moment, and seeing
<P>

that she had lost her prey, she said to him, &quot;Do not be afraid. 
<P>

What do you want?&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;I am lost,&quot; he answered, &quot;and I am looking for the road.

and soon reappeared leading two black dogs by a chain, which he
<P>

brought into the centre of the hall.  Zobeida<A NAME = "AS159017"></A><A NAME = "BB159018"></A><A HREF = "SPP53.HTM#BB159732"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> then got up from her
<P>

seat<A NAME = "AO15913"></A> between the Calenders and the Caliph and walked slowly across
<P>

to where the porter stood with the dogs.  &quot;We must do our duty,&quot;

<P>

she said with a deep sigh, pushing back her sleeves, and, taking a
<P>

whip from Sadie, she said to the man, &quot;Take one of those dogs to my

<P>

sister Amina and give me the other.&quot;
<P>

<P>

The porter did as he was bid, but as he led<A NAME = "AS159723"></A> the dog to Zobeida<A NAME = "BB159732"></A><A HREF = "SPP53.HTM#BB15997"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> it
<P>

uttered piercing howls, and gazed up at her with looks of entreaty. 
<P>

But Zobeida<A NAME = "AO15995"></A><A NAME = "AS15996"></A><A NAME = "BB15997"></A><A HREF = "SPP53.HTM#BB160222"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> took no notice, and whipped the dog till she was
<P>

out of breath.  She then took the chain from the porter, and,
<P>

raising the dog on its hind legs, they looked into each other's eyes
<P>

sorrowfully till tears began to fall from both.  Then Zobeida<A NAME = "AS160221"></A><A NAME = "BB160222"></A><A HREF = "SPP53.HTM#BB16135"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> took
<P>

her handkerchief<A NAME = "AO16035"></A> and wiped the dog's eyes tenderly, after which she
<P>

kissed it, then, putting the chain into the porter's hand she said,
<P>

&quot;Take it back to the closet and bring me the other.&quot;
<P>

<P>

The same<A NAME = "AO16075"></A> ceremony was gone through with the second dog,
<P>

and all the while the whole company looked on with astonishment. 
<P>

The Caliph in particular could hardly contain himself, and made
<P>

signs to the vizir to ask what it all meant.  But the vizir
<P>

pretended not to see, and turned his head away.
<P>

<P>

Zobeida<A NAME = "AO16133"></A><A NAME = "AS16134"></A><A NAME = "BB16135"></A><A HREF = "SPP54.HTM#BB16289"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> remained for some time in the middle of the room, till at
<P>

last Sadie went up to her and begged her to sit down, as she
<P>

also had her part to play.  At these words<A NAME = "AO161519"></A><A NAME = "AS161520"></A> Amina fetched a lute<A NAME = "AB161529"></A><A HREF = "SPP255.HTM#BB766617"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
<P>

from a case<A NAME = "AO16167"></A> of yellow satin and gave it to Sadie, who sang several
<P>

songs to its accompaniment.  When she was tired she said to Amina,
<P>

&quot;My sister, I can do no more; come, I pray you, and take my place.
&quot;

The lady did not answer, but silently descended the staircase,
<P>

the prince following her.  At the top, however, he looked at me. 
<P>

&quot;My cousin,&quot; he exclaimed, &quot;I do not know how to thank you 
for
<P>

your kindness.  Farewell.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;What do you mean?&quot;  I cried.  &quot;I don't understand.&quot;

<P>

<P>

&quot;No matter,&quot; he replied, &quot;go back by the path that you came.
&quot;
<P>

<P>

He would say no more, and, greatly puzzled, I returned to my room
<P>

in the palace and went to bed.  When I woke, and considered
<P>

my adventure, I thought that I must have been dreaming, and sent
<P>

a servant to ask if the prince was dressed and could see me. 
<P>

But on hearing that he had not slept at home I was much alarmed,
<P>

and hastened to the cemetery, where, unluckily, the tombs were all so
<P>

alike that I could not discover which was the one I was in search of,
<P>

though I spent four days in looking for it.
<P>

<P>

You must know that all this time the king, my uncle, was absent
<P>

on a hunting expedition, and as no one knew when he would be back,
<P>

I at last decided to return home, leaving the ministers to make
<P>

my excuses.  I longed to tell them what had become of the prince,
<P>

about whose fate they felt the most dreadful anxiety, but the oath I
<P>

had sworn kept me silent.
<P>

<P>

On my arrival at my father's capital, I was astonished to find
<P>

a large<A NAME = "AO18265"></A><A NAME = "AS18266"></A> detachment of guards drawn up before the gate<A NAME = "AB182623"></A><A HREF = "SPP372.HTM#BB1117923"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> of the palace;
<P>

they surrounded me directly I entered.  I asked the officers in command

<P>

the reason of this strange behaviour, and was horrified to learn
<P>

who had dearly loved the princess, shared his grief.  For seven
<P>

days<A NAME = "AO27003"></A> the whole nation mourned, and then the ashes of the princess
<P>

were buried with great pomp, and a superb tomb was raised over her.
<P>

<P>

As soon as the Sultan<A NAME = "AO270311"></A> recovered from the severe illness which
<P>

had seized him after the death of the princess he sent for me
<P>

and plainly, though politely, informed me that my presence would
<P>

always remind him of his loss, and he begged that I would instantly
<P>

quit his kingdom, and on pain of death never return to it.  I was,
<P>

of course, bound to obey, and not knowing what was to become of me
<P>

I shaved my beard and eyebrows and put on the dress of a calender. 
<P>

After wandering aimlessly through several countries, I resolved to come

<P>

to Bagdad<A NAME = "AO27115"></A><A NAME = "AS27116"></A><A NAME = "AS27117"></A><A NAME = "BB27118"></A><A HREF = "SPP106.HTM#BB318429"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> and request an audience of the Commander<A NAME = "AB271123"></A> of the Faithful.
<P>

<P>

And that, madam, is my story.
<P>

<P>

The other<A NAME = "AO27155"></A> Calender then told his story.
<P>

<P>

<P>

<P>

<H2>Story of the Third Calendar, Son of a King</H2>

<P>

<P>

My story, said the Third Calender, is quite different from those
<P>

of my two friends.  It was fate that deprived them of the sight
<P>

of their right eyes, but mine was lost by my own folly.
<P>

<P>

My name<A NAME = "AO27275"></A> is Agib, and I am the son of a king called Cassib,
<P>

who reigned over a large kingdom, which had for its capital

choosing various kinds of scents and spices from a druggist's store,
<P>

she halted before a magnificent palace, at the door of which
<P>

she knocked gently.  The porteress who opened it was of such
<P>

beauty that the eyes of the man were quite dazzled, and he was
<P>

the more astonished as he saw clearly that she was no slave. 
<P>

The lady who had led him hither stood watching him with amusement,
<P>

till the porteress exclaimed, &quot;Why don't you come in, my sister? 
<P>

This poor man is so heavily weighed down that he is ready to drop.&quot;

<P>

<P>

When they were both inside the door was fastened, and they all
<P>

three<A NAME = "AO14193"></A> entered a large court, surrounded by an open-work gallery. 
<P>

At one end of the court was a platform, and on the platform stood
<P>

an amber<A NAME = "AO14215"></A><A NAME = "AS14216"></A> throne supported by four ebony<A NAME = "AB142117"></A> columns, garnished with
<P>

pearls and diamonds.  In the middle<A NAME = "AO142213"></A><A NAME = "AS142214"></A> of the court stood a marble<A NAME = "BB142227"></A><A HREF = "SPP273.HTM#BB81907"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
<P>

basin<A NAME = "AO14233"></A><A NAME = "AS14234"></A> filled with water from the mouth of a golden<A NAME = "AB142323"></A> lion.
<P>

<P>

The porter looked about him, noticing and admiring everything;
<P>

but his attention was specially attracted by a third lady sitting
<P>

on the throne, who was even more beautiful than the other two. 
<P>

By the respect shown to her by the others, he judged that she must be
<P>

the eldest, and in this he was right.  This lady's<A NAME = "AS142921"></A> name was Zobeida<A NAME = "AB142928"></A><A HREF = "SPP47.HTM#BB14316"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>,
<P>

the porteress<A NAME = "AO14305"></A><A NAME = "AS14306"></A><A NAME = "AS14307"></A><A NAME = "AB14308"></A> was Sadie, and the housekeeper<A NAME = "AB143019"></A> was Amina.  At a word
<P>

from Zobeida<A NAME = "AS14315"></A><A NAME = "BB14316"></A><A HREF = "SPP47.HTM#BB143426"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, Sadie<A NAME = "AO14319"></A> and Amina took the basket from the porter,
<P>

who was glad enough to be relieved from its weight; and when it
<P>

was emptied, paid him handsomely for its use.  But instead of taking
<P>

up his basket and going away, the man still lingered, till<A NAME = "AS143423"></A> Zobeida<A NAME = "BB143426"></A><A HREF = "SPP48.HTM#BB14486"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
<P>

inquired what he was waiting for, and if he expected more money. 
<P>

&quot;Oh, madam,&quot; returned he, &quot;you have already given me too 
much,
<P>

and I fear I may have been guilty of rudeness in not taking my
<P>

departure at once.  But, if you will pardon my saying so, I was lost

that the army<A NAME = "AO18297"></A> had mutinied and put to death the king, my father,
<P>

and had placed the grand-vizir on the throne.  Further, that by his
<P>

orders I was placed under arrest.
<P>

<P>

Now this rebel<A NAME = "AO18337"></A><A NAME = "AS18338"></A> vizir<A NAME = "BB183311"></A><A HREF = "SPP63.HTM#BB191627"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> had hated me from my boy-hood, because once,
<P>

when shooting at a bird with a bow, I had shot out his eye by accident. 

<P>

Of course I not only sent a servant at once to offer him my regrets
<P>

and apologies, but I made them in person.  It was all of no use. 
<P>

He cherished an undying hatred towards me, and lost no occasion
<P>

of showing it.  Having once got me in his power I felt he could
<P>

show no mercy, and I was right.  Mad with triumph and fury he
<P>

came to me in my prison and tore out my right eye.  That is how I
<P>

lost it.
<P>

<P>

My persecutor, however, did not stop here.  He shut me up in a large
<P>

case<A NAME = "AO18443"></A><A NAME = "AS18444"></A> and ordered his executioner<A NAME = "AB184413"></A><A HREF = "SPP61.HTM#BB18479"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> to carry me into a desert place,
<P>

to cut off my head, and then to abandon my body to the birds of prey. 
<P>

The case, with me inside it, was accordingly placed on a horse,
<P>

and the executioner<A NAME = "AO18477"></A><A NAME = "AS18478"></A><A NAME = "BB18479"></A><A HREF = "SPP163.HTM#BB489619"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, accompanied by another man, rode into the country
<P>

until they found a spot suitable for the purpose.  But their hearts
<P>

were not so hard as they seemed, and my tears and prayers made
<P>

them waver.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Forsake the kingdom instantly,&quot; said the executioner at last,

<P>

&quot;and take care never to come back, for you will not only lose
<P>

your head, but make us lose ours.&quot;  I thanked him gratefully,
<P>

and tried to console myself for the loss of my eye by thinking
<P>

of the other misfortunes I had escaped.
<P>

accompanied by his grand-vizir, Giafar, and Mesrour, chief of the eunuchs,

<P>

all three wearing the dresses of merchants.  Passing down the street,
<P>

the Caliph<A NAME = "AO15315"></A><A NAME = "AS15316"></A> had been attracted by the music<A NAME = "AB153119"></A> of instruments and the sound

<P>

of laughter<A NAME = "AO15325"></A><A NAME = "AS15326"></A>, and had ordered his vizir<A NAME = "BB153217"></A><A HREF = "SPP51.HTM#BB153323"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> to go and knock at the door
<P>

of the house, as he wished to enter.  The vizir<A NAME = "AO153321"></A><A NAME = "AS153322"></A><A NAME = "BB153323"></A><A HREF = "SPP51.HTM#BB15399"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> replied that the ladies

<P>

who lived there seemed to be entertaining their friends, and he thought

<P>

his master would do well not to intrude on them; but the Caliph had
<P>

taken it into his head to see for himself, and insisted on being obeyed.

<P>

<P>

The knock was answered by Sadie, with a taper in her hand,
<P>

and the vizir<A NAME = "AO15397"></A><A NAME = "AS15398"></A><A NAME = "BB15399"></A><A HREF = "SPP61.HTM#BB183311"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, who was surprised at her beauty, bowed low before her,
<P>

and said respectfully, &quot;Madam, we are three merchants who have
<P>

lately arrived from Moussoul, and, owing to a misadventure which
<P>

befel us this very night, only reached our inn to find that the
<P>

doors were closed to us till to-morrow morning.  Not knowing
<P>

what to do, we wandered in the streets till we happened to pass
<P>

your house, when, seeing lights and hearing the sound of voices,
<P>

we resolved to ask you to give us shelter till the dawn. 
<P>

If you will grant us this favour, we will, with your permission,
<P>

do all in our power to help you spend the time pleasantly.&quot;
<P>

<P>

Sadie answered the merchant that she must first consult her sisters;
<P>

and after having talked over the matter with them, she returned to tell

<P>

him that he and his two friends would be welcome to join their company. 

<P>

They entered and bowed politely to the ladies and their guests. 
<P>

Then Zobeida<A NAME = "AS15545"></A><A NAME = "BB15546"></A><A HREF = "SPP52.HTM#BB157512"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, as the mistress, came forward and said gravely,
<P>

&quot;You are welcome here, but I hope you will allow me to beg one thing

<P>

of you--have as many eyes as you like, but no tongues; and ask
<P>

no questions about anything you see, however strange it may appear
<P>

to you.&quot;

At last I begged her to cease grieving for him, for although he could
<P>

not speak or move, by her enchantments she just kept him alive. 
<P>

She turned upon me in a rage, and said over me some magic words,
<P>

and I instantly became as you see me now, half<A NAME = "AS126321"></A> man and half marble<A NAME = "BB126330"></A><A HREF = "SPP47.HTM#BB142227"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.
<P>

<P>

Then this wicked enchantress<A NAME = "AO12659"></A><A NAME = "AS126510"></A><A NAME = "AB126511"></A><A HREF = "SPP42.HTM#BB12705"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> changed the capital, which was
<P>

a very populous and flourishing city, into the lake and desert
<P>

plain you saw.  The fish of four colours which are in it are
<P>

the different races who lived in the town; the four hills are
<P>

the four<A NAME = "AO12695"></A> islands which give the name to my kingdom.  All this the
<P>

enchantress<A NAME = "AO12703"></A><A NAME = "AS12704"></A><A NAME = "BB12705"></A><A HREF = "SPP44.HTM#BB13228"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> told me to add to my troubles.  And this is not all. 
<P>

Every day she comes<A NAME = "AO12719"></A><A NAME = "AS127110"></A> and beats me with a whip<A NAME = "AB127123"></A> of buffalo hide.
<P>

<P>

When the young king had finished his sad story he burst once more
<P>

into tears<A NAME = "AO12745"></A>, and the Sultan was much moved.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Tell me,&quot; he cried, &quot;where is this wicked woman, and where 
is
<P>

the miserable object of her affection, whom she just manages
<P>

to keep alive?&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;Where she lives I do not know,&quot; answered the unhappy prince, 

<P>

&quot;but she goes every day at sunrise to see if the slave can yet speak

<P>

to her, after she has beaten me.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;Unfortunate king,&quot; said the Sultan, &quot;I will do what I can

<P>

to avenge you.&quot;
<P>

<P>

So he consulted with the young king over the best way to bring
<P>

this about, and they agreed their plan should be put in effect

VIOLATION-- Before imposing a penalty against a State under subsection (a)
with respect to a violation of this part, the Secretary shall notify the

continuing compliance with this part.</ul></ul></ul> <p><ul><ul><ul>   (B)
60-DAY PERIOD TO PROPOSE A CORRECTIVE COMPLIANCE PLAN-- During the 60<A NAME = "AO88032"></A>-day

CORRECT VIOLATION-- The Secretary shall assess some or all of a penalty<A NAME = "AO88439"></A>

corrective compliance plan accepted by the Secretary.</ul></ul> <p><ul><ul>
 (4) INAPPLICABILITY<A NAME = "AO8859"></A><A NAME = "AS88510"></A><A NAME = "AS88511"></A><A NAME = "AS88512"></A> TO FAILURE<A NAME = "AB88517"></A> TO TIMELY REPAY<A NAME = "AB88524"></A> A FEDERAL LOAN FUND FOR A

apply any remaining amount of such penalties to the grant payable to the
State under section 403(a)(1) for the immediately succeeding fiscal
year.</ul></ul> <p><h3> SEC. 410. APPEAL OF ADVERSE DECISION.</h3>

one of the finest seaport towns in the world.
<P>

<P>

When I succeeded to my father's throne my first care was to visit
<P>

the provinces on the mainland, and then to sail to the numerous
<P>

islands which lay off the shore, in order to gain the hearts
<P>

of my subjects.  These voyages gave me such a taste for sailing
<P>

that I soon determined to explore more distant seas, and commanded
<P>

a fleet of large ships to be got ready without delay.  When they
<P>

were properly fitted out I embarked on my expedition.
<P>

<P>

For forty days wind and weather were all in our favour, but the
<P>

next night a terrific storm arose, which blew us hither and thither
<P>

for ten days, till the pilot confessed that he had quite lost
<P>

his bearings.  Accordingly a sailor was sent up to the masthead to try
<P>

to catch<A NAME = "AO27435"></A> a sight of land, and reported that nothing was to be seen
<P>

but the sea and sky, except a huge mass of blackness that lay astern.
<P>

<P>

On hearing this the pilot grew white, and, beating his breast,
<P>

he cried, &quot;Oh, sir, we are lost, lost!&quot; till the ship's crew 
trembled
<P>

at they knew not what.  When he had recovered himself a little,
<P>

and was able to explain the cause of his terror, he replied,
<P>

in answer to my question, that we had drifted far out of our course,
<P>

and that the following day about noon we should come near that mass
<P>

of darkness, which, said he, is nothing but the famous Black Mountain. 

<P>

This mountain is composed of adamant, which attracts to itself
<P>

all the iron and nails in your ship; and as we are helplessly
<P>

drawn nearer, the force of attraction will become so great that the
<P>

iron<A NAME = "AO27563"></A><A NAME = "AS27564"></A><A NAME = "AB27565"></A> and nails will fall out of the ships and cling to the mountain,
<P>

and the ships<A NAME = "AO27577"></A> will sink to the bottom with all that are in them. 
<P>

This it is that causes the side of the mountain towards the sea to

<P>

The three<A NAME = "AO15015"></A> Calenders bowed low on entering, and thanked the ladies
<P>

for their kindness and hospitality.  The ladies replied with words
<P>

of welcome, and they were all about to seat themselves when the eyes
<P>

of the Calenders fell on the porter, whose dress was not so very unlike

<P>

their own, though he still wore all the hair that nature had given him. 

<P>

&quot;This,&quot; said one of them, &quot;is apparently one of our Arab 
brothers,
<P>

who has rebelled against our ruler.&quot;
<P>

<P>

The porter, although half asleep from the wine he had drunk,
<P>

heard the words, and without moving cried angrily to the Calender,
<P>

&quot;Sit down and mind your own business.  Did you not read the inscription

<P>

over the door?  Everybody is not obliged to live in the same way.&quot;

<P>

<P>

&quot;Do not be so angry, my good man,&quot; replied the Calender; &quot;we 
should
<P>

be very sorry to displease you;&quot; so the quarrel was smoothed over,

<P>

and supper began in good earnest.  When the Calenders had satisfied
<P>

their hunger, they offered to play to their hostesses, if there were
<P>

any instruments in the house.  The ladies were delighted at the idea,
<P>

and Sadie went to see what she could find, returning in a few
<P>

moments<A NAME = "AO15203"></A><A NAME = "AS15204"></A> laden with two different kinds of flutes and a tambourine<A NAME = "AB152025"></A><A HREF = "SPP158.HTM#BB474429"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>. 
<P>

Each<A NAME = "AO15213"></A> Calender took the one he preferred, and began to play
<P>

a well-known air, while the ladies sang the words of the song. 
<P>

These words<A NAME = "AO15235"></A><A NAME = "AS15236"></A> were the gayest<A NAME = "AB152313"></A> and liveliest possible, and every now
<P>

and then the singers had to stop to indulge the laughter which almost
<P>

choked them.  In the midst of all their noise, a knock was heard
<P>

at the door.
<P>

<P>

Now early that evening<A NAME = "AO15289"></A> the Caliph secretly left the palace,

The Sultan<A NAME = "AO12305"></A> was horrified, and begged the young man to tell him

his story.

<H2>The Story of the Young King of the Black Isles</H2>

<P>

<P>

You must know, sire, that my father was Mahmoud, the king of this
<P>

country, the Black<A NAME = "AO12427"></A><A NAME = "AS12428"></A><A NAME = "AB12429"></A> Isles, so called from the four little mountains
<P>

which were once islands, while the capital was the place where now
<P>

the great lake lies.  My story will tell you how these changes came about.

<P>

<P>

My father died when he was sixty-six, and I succeeded him. 
<P>

I married my cousin, whom I loved tenderly, and I thought she loved
<P>

me too.
<P>

<P>

But one afternoon, when I was half asleep, and was being fanned
<P>

by two of her maids, I heard one say to the other, &quot;What a pity it

<P>

is that our mistress<A NAME = "AO12529"></A><A NAME = "AS125210"></A><A NAME = "AB125211"></A> no longer loves our master!  I believe she
<P>

would like to kill him if she could, for she is an enchantress.&quot;
<P>

<P>

I soon found by watching that they were right, and when I
<P>

mortally wounded a favourite slave of hers for a great crime,
<P>

she begged that she might build a palace in the garden, where she
<P>

This, madam, is my story.

&quot;Madam,&quot; said the young man, addressing Zobeida, &quot;if you wish

<P>

to know how I lost my right eye, I shall have to tell you the story
<P>

of my whole life.&quot;
<P>

<P>

I was scarcely more than a baby, when the king my father,
<P>

finding me unusually quick and clever for my age, turned his
<P>

thoughts to my education.  I was taught first to read and write,
<P>

and then to learn<A NAME = "AS19729"></A> the Koran<A NAME = "AB197214"></A><A HREF = "SPP191.HTM#BB573318"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, which is the basis of our holy religion,
<P>

and the better to understand it, I read with my tutors the ablest
<P>

commentators on its teaching, and committed to memory all the
<P>

traditions respecting the Prophet, which have been gathered from
<P>

the mouth of those who were his friends.  I also learnt history,
<P>

and was instructed in poetry, versification, geography<A NAME = "AS197715"></A><A NAME = "AB197716"></A><A HREF = "SPP356.HTM#BB1068714"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, chronology,

and in all the outdoor exercises in which every prince should excel.

in a splendid room, with a fountain<A NAME = "AO120115"></A><A NAME = "AS120116"></A> supported by golden<A NAME = "AB120123"></A> lions.

The palace<A NAME = "AO12045"></A> was surrounded on three sides by magnificent gardens,
<P>

little lakes, and woods.  Birds sang in the trees, which were netted
<P>

over to keep them always there.
<P>

<P>

Still the Sultan<A NAME = "AO12087"></A> saw no one, till he heard a plaintive cry,
<P>

and a voice which said, &quot;Oh that I could die, for I am too unhappy

<P>

to wish to live any longer!&quot;
<P>

<P>

The Sultan<A NAME = "AO12125"></A> looked round to discover who it was who thus bemoaned
<P>

his fate, and at last saw a handsome young man, richly clothed,
<P>

who was sitting on a throne raised slightly from the ground. 
<P>

His face was very sad.
<P>

<P>

The sultan approached him and bowed to him.  The young man bent
<P>

his head very low, but did not rise.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Sire,&quot; he said to the Sultan, &quot;I cannot rise and do you

<P>

the reverence that I am sure should be paid to your rank.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;Sir,&quot; answered the Sultan, &quot;I am sure you have a good reason

<P>

for not doing so, and having heard your cry of distress, I am come
<P>

to offer you my help.  Whose is this palace, and why is it thus empty?&quot;

<P>

<P>

Instead of answering the young man lifted up his robe, and showed
<P>

the Sultan that, from the waist downwards, he was a block<A NAME = "AS122823"></A> of black marble<A NAME = "BB122830"></A><A HREF = "SPP42.HTM#BB126330"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.

The physician<A NAME = "AO7495"></A><A NAME = "AS7496"></A> went to his house and made a polo<A NAME = "AB74923"></A> club, the handle
<P>

of which he hollowed out, and put in it the drug he wished to use. 
<P>

Then he made a ball, and with these things he went the next day to
<P>

the king.
<P>

<P>

He told him that he wished him to play at polo.  Accordingly the
<P>

king mounted his horse and went into the place where he played. 
<P>

There the physician<A NAME = "AO7567"></A> approached him with the bat he had made, saying,
<P>

&quot;Take this, sire, and strike the ball till you feel your hand and whole

<P>

body in a glow.  When the remedy that is in the handle of the club
<P>

is warmed by your hand it will penetrate throughout your body. 
<P>

The you must return to your palace, bathe, and go to sleep,
<P>

and when you awake to-morrow morning you will be cured.&quot;
<P>

<P>

The king took the club and urged his horse after the ball which he
<P>

had thrown.  He struck it, and then it was hit back by the courtiers
<P>

who were playing with him.  When he felt very hot he stopped playing,
<P>

and went back to the palace, went into the bath, and did all that
<P>

the physician had said.  The next day when he arose he found,
<P>

to his great joy and astonishment, that he was completely cured. 
<P>

When he entered his audience-chamber all his courtiers, who were
<P>

eager to see if the wonderful cure had been effected, were overwhelmed
<P>

with joy.
<P>

<P>

The physician<A NAME = "AO7735"></A><A NAME = "AS7736"></A><A NAME = "AB7737"></A> Douban entered the hall and bowed low to the ground. 
<P>

The king, seeing him, called him, made him sit by his side, and showed
<P>

him every mark of honour.
<P>

<P>

That evening he gave him a long and rich robe of state, and presented
<P>

him with two thousand sequins.  The following day he continued

As none<A NAME = "AO29695"></A> of the sofas could hold more than one person, they bade me
<P>

place myself on the carpet, and to ask no questions about anything I
<P>

should see.
<P>

<P>

After a little while the old man rose and brought in supper, which I
<P>

ate heartily, for I was very hungry.  Then one of the young men begged
<P>

me to repeat my story, which had struck them all with astonishment,
<P>

and when I had ended, the old man was bidden to &quot;do his duty,&quot;

<P>

as it was late, and they wished to go to bed.  At these words
<P>

he rose, and went to a closet, from which he brought out ten basins,
<P>

all covered with blue stuff.  He set one before each of the young men,
<P>

together with a lighted taper.
<P>

<P>

When the covers were taken off the basins, I saw they were filled
<P>

with ashes, coal-dust, and lamp-black. The young men mixed these
<P>

all together, and smeared the whole over their heads and faces. 
<P>

They then wept<A NAME = "AO29857"></A><A NAME = "AS29858"></A><A NAME = "BB29859"></A><A HREF = "SPP250.HTM#BB750821"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> and beat their breasts, crying, &quot;This is the fruit
<P>

of idleness, and of our wicked lives.&quot;
<P>

<P>

This ceremony lasted nearly the whole night, and when it stopped
<P>

they washed themselves carefully, and put on fresh clothes,
<P>

and lay down to sleep.
<P>

<P>

All this while I had refrained from questions, though my curiosity
<P>

almost seemed to burn a hole in me, but the following day, when we went

<P>

out to walk, I said to them, &quot;Gentlemen, I must disobey your wishes,

<P>

been at the tears of the cow.
<P>

<P>

&quot;Go,&quot; I said to the steward, &quot;take back this calf, take great
care
<P>

of it, and bring me another in its place instantly.&quot;
<P>

<P>

As soon as my wife heard me speak this she at once cried out,
<P>

&quot;What are you doing, husband?  Do not sacrifice any calf but this.
&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;Wife,&quot; I answered, &quot;I will not sacrifice this calf,&quot; 
and in spite
<P>

of all her remonstrances, I remained firm.
<P>

<P>

I had another calf killed; this one was led away.  The next day
<P>

the steward asked to speak to me in private.
<P>

<P>

&quot;I have come,&quot; he said, &quot;to tell you some news which I think 
you will
<P>

like to hear.  I have a daughter who knows magic.  Yesterday, when I
<P>

was leading back the calf which you refused to sacrifice, I noticed
<P>

that she smiled, and then directly afterwards began to cry. 
<P>

I asked her why she did so.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;Father,&quot; she answered, &quot;this calf is the son of our master. 

<P>

I smile with joy at seeing him still alive, and I weep to think
<P>

of his mother<A NAME = "AO4117"></A><A NAME = "AS4118"></A>, who was sacrificed yesterday as a cow<A NAME = "AB41123"></A><A HREF = "SPP128.HTM#BB386619"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>.  These changes
<P>

have been wrought by our master's wife, who hated the mother
<P>

and son.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;At these words<A NAME = "AO4158"></A>, of Genius,&quot; continued the old man, &quot;I leave 
you
<P>

to imagine my astonishment.  I went immediately with the steward
<P>

to speak with his daughter myself.  First<A NAME = "AO41715"></A><A NAME = "AS41716"></A><A NAME = "AB41717"></A> of all I went to the stable
<P>

to see my son, and he replied in his dumb way to all my caresses.

&quot;Certainly,&quot; I answered, taking the sabre in my hands, and making

<P>

a sign to the princess to fear nothing, as it was my own life that I
<P>

was about to sacrifice, and not hers.  But the look of gratitude
<P>

she gave me shook my courage, and I flung the sabre to the earth.
<P>

<P>

&quot;I should not deserve to live,&quot; I said to the genius, &quot;if I 
were
<P>

such a coward as to slay a lady who is not only unknown to me,
<P>

but who is at this moment half dead herself.  Do with me as you will--
<P>

I am in your power--but I refuse to obey your cruel command.&quot;
<P>

<P>

&quot;I see,&quot; said the genius, &quot;that you have both made up your 
minds
<P>

to brave me, but I will give you a sample of what you may expect.&quot;

<P>

So saying, with one sweep of his sabre he cut off a hand of the princess,

<P>

who was just able to lift the other to wave me an eternal farewell. 
<P>

Then I lost consciousness for several minutes.
<P>

<P>

When I came to myself I implored the genius to keep me no longer
<P>

in this state of suspense, but to lose no time in putting an end to
<P>

my sufferings.  The genius, however, paid no attention to my prayers,
<P>

but said sternly, &quot;That is the way in which a genius treats the woman

<P>

who has betrayed him.  If I chose, I could kill you also; but I
<P>

will be merciful, and content myself with changing you into a dog,
<P>

an ass, a lion<A NAME = "AS22419"></A><A NAME = "AB224110"></A><A HREF = "SPP87.HTM#BB26106"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, or a bird--whichever you prefer.&quot;
<P>

<P>

I caught eagerly at these words, as giving me a faint hope
<P>

of softening his wrath.  &quot;O genius!&quot;  I cried, &quot;as you wish

<P>

to spare my life, be generous, and spare it altogether. 
<P>

Grant my prayer, and pardon my crime, as the best man in the whole
<P>

world<A NAME = "AO22473"></A><A NAME = "AS22474"></A> forgave his neighbour<A NAME = "AB224711"></A> who was eaten up with envy of him.&quot; 
<P>

Contrary to my hopes, the genius seemed interested in my words,

As the fisherman said it was only three hours' journey away,
<P>

the sultan ordered his whole court to mount and ride thither,
<P>

and the fisherman led them.
<P>

<P>

They climbed the mountain, and then, on the other side, saw the
<P>

lake as the fisherman had described.  The water was so clear
<P>

that they could see the four kinds of fish swimming about in it. 
<P>

They looked at them for some time, and then the Sultan ordered them
<P>

to make a camp by the edge of the water.
<P>

<P>

When night<A NAME = "AO11795"></A><A NAME = "AS11796"></A> came the Sultan called his vizir<A NAME = "BB117919"></A><A HREF = "SPP51.HTM#BB153217"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, and said to him,
<P>

&quot;I have resolved to clear up this mystery.  I am going out alone,
<P>

and do you stay here in my tent, and when my ministers come to-morrow,
<P>

say I am not well, and cannot see them.  Do this each day till
<P>

I return.&quot;
<P>

<P>

The grand-vizir tried to persuade the Sultan not to go, but in vain. 
<P>

The Sultan<A NAME = "AO11865"></A> took off his state robe and put on his sword, and when he
<P>

saw all was quiet in the camp he set forth alone.
<P>

<P>

He climbed one of the hills, and then crossed the great plain, till,
<P>

just as the sun rose, he beheld far in front of him a large building. 
<P>

When he came near to it he saw it was a splendid palace of beautiful
<P>

black<A NAME = "AO11923"></A><A NAME = "AS11924"></A><A NAME = "AS11925"></A> polished marble<A NAME = "AB119210"></A><A HREF = "SPP40.HTM#BB122830"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>, covered with steel<A NAME = "AB119217"></A><A HREF = "SPP193.HTM#BB579016"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A> as smooth as a mirror.
<P>

<P>

He went to the gate, which stood half open, and went in, as nobody
<P>

came when he knocked.  He passed through a magnificent courtyard
<P>

and still saw no one, though he called aloud several times.
<P>

<P>

He entered large halls where the carpets were of silk, the lounges

<H2>Story of the Three Calenders, Sons of Kings, and of Five Ladies</H2>

In the reign<A NAME = "AO13847"></A><A NAME = "AS13848"></A> of the Caliph Haroun-al-Raschid, there lived at Bagdad<A NAME = "BB138429"></A><A HREF = "SPP49.HTM#BB148622"><img src="LINK.GIF"></A>
<P>

a porter who, in spite of his humble calling, was an intelligent
<P>

and sensible man.  One morning he was sitting in his usual place with
<P>

his basket before him, waiting to be hired, when a tall young lady,
<P>

covered with a long muslin veil, came up to him and said, &quot;Pick up

<P>

your basket and follow me.&quot;  The porter, who was greatly pleased
<P>

by her appearance and voice, jumped up at once, poised his basket
<P>

on his head, and accompanied the lady, saying to himself as he went,
<P>

&quot;Oh, happy day!  Oh, lucky meeting!&quot;
<P>

<P>

The lady soon stopped before a closed door, at which she knocked. 
<P>

It was opened by an old man with a long white beard, to whom
<P>

the lady held out money without speaking.  The old man, who seemed
<P>

to understand what she wanted, vanished into the house, and returned
<P>

bringing a large jar of wine, which the porter placed in his basket. 
<P>

Then the lady signed to him to follow, and they went their way.
<P>

<P>

The next place she stopped at was a fruit and flower shop, and here she

<P>

bought<A NAME = "AO14023"></A><A NAME = "AS14024"></A><A NAME = "AS14025"></A><A NAME = "AS14026"></A> a large quantity of apples<A NAME = "AB140217"></A>, apricots<A NAME = "AB140220"></A>, peaches<A NAME = "AB140223"></A>, and other things,

<P>

with lilies, jasmine, and all sorts of sweet-smelling plants. 
<P>

From this shop she went to a butcher's, a grocer's, and a poulterer's,
<P>

till at last the porter exclaimed in despair, &quot;My good lady,
<P>

if you had only told me you were going to buy enough provisions
<P>

to stock a town, I would have brought a horse, or rather a camel.&quot; 

<P>

The lady laughed, and told him she had not finished yet, but after
