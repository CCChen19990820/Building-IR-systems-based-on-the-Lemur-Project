<center><b><font size =6>"Bioneers" Promote Passionate<BR>Defense of Environment</font></center></b>

<P>

<font size =3>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>



Some years ago, one of my cousins, an organic gardener, became interested in "biodynamic farming." She goes to seminars and meetings and tours farms that are run according to the newly-developed system. She hopes to make a second career of it, and keeps me up to date on developments in alternative agriculture.<P>

Although as a gardener I try to use the land responsibly, I've been known to use Roundup on the poison ivy, Sevin on the Japanese beetles, and put chicken bones in the compost pile. Not quite up to her standards. Oh, well. <P>

<img src=quadrants.gif width=192 height=192 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left><P>

Still, I'm fascinated by the news she brings from the front. When I found the <a href="http://www.bioneers.org/">Bioneers Home Page</a> on the Internet the other day, I realized that she is part of a significant and growing movement.<P>

(READER ALERT: if you think the EPA is a terrorist organization and treasure your recipe for Braised Spotted Owl, you should stop reading right now. These guys won't make you happy if you worry about tree-huggers and the government threatening your rights to use your own property as you wish.)<P>

On the other hand, if you are like me, moderately interested in using natural resources wisely, or like my cousin, who is passionately devoted to ecologically correct practices, this site is for you.<P>

It was developed to promote the Bioneers annual conference in San Francisco on the last weekend in October, but it will be a resource for weeks and months to come for those who couldn't make it to the meeting. <P>

Who are the Bioneers? Here's what they say about themselves: "The Bioneers are impassioned individuals who offer a positive vision of restoration. They ... herald a coming Age of Biology, one in which as human beings we weave our lives into a balance with the natural world."<P>

The site is a fascinating mixture of spiritualism, activism, and science. One section, <a href="http://www.bioneers.org/htdocs/restore.html">Restoration Generator v 1.0</a>, starts with a picture of the earth which divides into four quarters illustrating earth, water, air and fire when you click on it. Click on each quadrant for a meditation on that "element" and links labeled "Action" and "Resources."<P>

Click on fire, and the action link leads to Greenpeace's home site and information about protests against nuclear testing. The fire resource link leads to the <a href="http://www.nci.org/nci/">Nuclear Control Institute</a> home site, with an animation of a house exploding. A note at the site says the photographs come from actual nuclear weapons testing, but gives no further details. <P>

The earth quadrant leads you to the<a href="http://www.ran.org/ran/what_you/index.html">Rainforest Action Network</a>. There you can find a list of all the boycotts currently being staged by social and environmental activists. It's useful if you'd like to know why various groups are annoyed with various corporate entities, and decide if you agree with them, before giving up something you like. Not all the causes are equally valid. Surprise.<P>

The conference <a href="http://www.bioneers.org/htdocs/events.html">schedule</a> gives a good picture of what the Bioneers care about. From biodynamic farming, permaculture, restorative farming, and community supported agriculture to nutraceuticals, green medicine, native American vision and Whole Earth ecological design, these people are looking into all the ways humans live on earth and are searching for solutions to many of the problems that face us.<P>

For people who missed the conference, but want to know more about the participants and other organizations devoted to these issues, the page has a section called "<a href="http://www.bioneers.org/htdocs/biolinks.html">Biolinks</a>" with more than 100 links to homepages of individuals like Tom Hayden, magazines like Mother Jones, companies like Tom's of Maine and Real Goods, and lots of leagues, societies, foundations and networks. <P>

It's a major resource in itself.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Movie Buffs Find<BR>Treasure Trove</font></center></b>

<P>

<font size =3>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


When I was in college, twenty-some years ago, all the new movies, and lots of foreign and obscure ones too, came to the theaters in that college town. <P>

I'd see several films a week, and I loved it. Since then, what with work, children, and all the trappings of real life, my film-going has slowed considerably.<P>

<img src=movie.gif width=253 height=130 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right><P>

Six or seven dollars for a movie is a lot of money. When the children were small, the cost of a baby-sitter was added to that. When you're spending that kind of money, you might as well add dinner out, and soon the cost of a movie was so high, we couldn't afford to risk a dud! If we went out to six movies a year, that was a lot. <P>

At the same time, we severely limited television and video watching in the house. Such videos as we did watch were pulled from the children's or humor sections at the video emporium. Eventually the VCR broke down. It wasn't mended until our son got his driver's license and hauled it to the repair place by himself. (Was that child abuse or what?)<P>

I wish I'd had the Internet in those days. There are so many sites where you can find out all you need to know about a movie before investing time or money in it.<P>

I want to know the plot, the rating, why the movie got that rating and what a variety of reviewers said about it. <P>

The <a href="http://us.imdb.com/">Internet Movie Database</a> (IMDb) is a great tool for everyone from movie buffs to people like me who don't want to waste their time. It's also so much fun that you might get caught looking up movies you've seen, researching the careers of actors you like, and even submitting your own little offerings to the site. If the film is in print in video, the site has links to places where you can buy a copy.<P>

I don't know if the site lists every movie ever made. Still, there is a large and diverse selection of U.S.-made and foreign films--more than 75,000, according to their introductory blurb.<P>

Each film is rated on a scale of 1 to 10 stars, based on votes by visitors to the site. The entire cast and all the other people who worked on the film, from director to costume designer to crew are listed. Most names are hyperlinked to more information about that person's career.<P>

There are links to reviews that have been posted on the Web on other sites, lists of goofs, trivia nuggets, hyperlinks to other web sites and so on. I followed one link to a set of audio clips from the 1987 film, <a href="http://www.moviesounds.com/prbride.html">Princess Bride</a>. If you remember that movie, you'll probably want to download a few clips, for example: "Hello. My name is Inigo Montoya. You killed my father. Prepare to die." or "Life is pain, Highness. Anyone who says differently is selling something." or "Inconceivable." <P>

If you haven't seen the movie, you won't know what I'm talking about. Sorry about that. The video is apparently out of print.<P>

Movie fanatics will want to spend a little time at <a href="http://www.moviesounds.com">The Movie Sounds Page</a> where I found those questionable treasures. They'll find clips from Clueless... or Casablanca; Blazing Saddles... or Gone With The Wind. As they wish.<P>

In the case of brand new releases such as <a href="http://www.spe.sony.com/Pictures/SonyMovies/movies/Gillian/movie.html">To Gillian on her 37th Birthday, Official Site</a> (with the star of the gone-but-not-forgotten TV show, "My So Called Life," 17-year-old Clare Danes), reviews and plot summaries may not yet be available at IMDb. As a consolation prize, you'll find the link to the movie studio's official site. <P>

Hmmm. That sounds like a good movie. But I think I'll wait for the reviews.<P>

 <P>

<center><b><font size =6>Design Resources Are Online<BR>
For the Graphically Challenged</font></center></b>


<font size =3>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


Your small business needs some printed pieces -- brochures, business cards, letterhead. After all, when you call on a potential client, or send out a business letter, you want to make a good impression. But at what cost? A professional design firm may charge thousands. <P>

Your boss is a tightwad. He's also constantly changing his mind.<P>

At one point he says you might just as well include a shirt cardboard with your business proposals for all the good a firm brochure does. <P>

Then he says he's just not comfortable without something to leave behind or send out to introduce the firm's services. And he doesn't want it to look cheap.<P>

If you have a PC, a decent laser printer, and a limited budget, you may be tempted to design and produce your own materials. Your computer software probably even came with prepared layouts: just plug in your own text and pictures for a "professional-looking" piece.<P>

Anyone who has actually tried out the templates that come with Word Perfect or Microsoft Word knows that designing and producing a handsome newsletter or brochure isn't that easy.<P>

The talents required for appealing design are not the same as those required for inspired writing or tight editing. The number of individuals with comprehensive, integrated creative skills is very small.<P>

You see, the devil's in the details. Not only does the text need to be well written, the words and spaces have to be placed on the page in a way that is pleasing to the eye. The spaces between the lines (leading) or the letters (tracking) makes an enormous difference. Getting it right requires some training, and much practice, even for the most gifted.<P>

A well-spaced block of type is so easy to read, most people don't even notice the design. On the other hand, badly spaced text will distress your reader, no matter how wonderful the prose. <P>

Then there is the font -- the size and design of the individual letters. <P>

You might have seen type you adore on a poster or in a magazine advertisement. You can't wait to use it in your newsletter. Whoa back, Nellie! Don't do it. <P>

A bold, dramatic display face, or a zippy, wild new font may look wonderful in small doses, but unless you know what you are doing, no one will want to read your brochure.<P>

If you have time, and really are going to do a lot of the design yourself, shame your boss into paying for some classes. In the meantime, there are wonderful graphics resources on the Internet.<P>

<img src=ca.gif width=175 height=219 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left><P>

The <a href="http://www.commarts.com/index.html">Communication Arts</a> Website is full examples of superb design. It may be a bit more sophisticated than most people need, but it doesn't hurt to look at the best of the best in graphic design, even if you don't aspire to those heights. From the CA site, you can jump to their <a href="http://www.commarts.com/wr_home.html">Web Resources</a> page which has links to dozens of useful sites with desktop publishing information, descriptions of various fonts, and a wide variety of design resources. <P>

For example, visit the "graphics intensive" <a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/browser/main.html">Adobe Type Browser</a> to learn about <a href="http://www.adobe.com/type/usingtype.html">using type</a> and to look at gazillions of fonts.<P>

You can also visit the <a href="http://www.rit.edu/~goudyctr/goudycenter.html">Goudy International Center</a> site and <a href="http://www.slip.net/~graphion/museum.html">Graphion's Online Type Museum</a> with information about famous typeface designers.<P>

This is just the beginning. For more information, start with <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Desktop_Publishing/">Yahoo's Desktop Publishing</a> links.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Access the Web<BR>Using Only Email</font></center></b>


<font size =3>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>

For many people, email is a quick, convenient method of communication. You can ask a question, write a brief thank-you note, arrange a meeting, receive regular newsletters or engage in long distance collaboration on a project.<P>

Staying in touch and transmitting documents are not the only ways email can be useful. <P>

A person who has ONLY email can also access lots of World Wide Web information, even without an Internet browser. You can get information from web pages, stock quotes, weather, and business news. You can even send faxes from email to someone who doesn't have an Internet hookup.<P>

<img src=Dr.Bob.gif width=135 height=214 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right><P>

I learned all this from Bob Rankin, who with his colleague, Patrick Crispen, produces <a href="http://www.worldvillage.com/tourbus.htm">Tourbus</a>, a regular email newsletter that provides guided tours of Internet Web sites.<P>

Ever since I subscribed to the newsletter months ago, I have noticed an occasional plug advertising Dr. Bob ("I'm not a real doctor, I only play one on the Internet") Rankin's free "<a href="ftp://rtfm.mit.edu/pub/usenet/news.answers/internet-services/access-via-email">Internet Access via email</a>" guide. <P>

You get the guide by sending an email to "mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu". In the body of the message, type the following line: "send usenet/news.answers/internet-services/access-via-email". (Leave out the quotation marks.)<P>

The message comes in two long parts. I got the second part first, and the first part didn't come for a while. Have patience. If you have Web access, you can get the whole document from <a href="http://www1.mhv.net/~bobrankin/">Dr. Bob's Home Page</a> (where you can also subscribe to Tourbus).<P>

Whether you get the emails or visit the Web site, don't be put off by all the mysterious addresses and commands. You don't have to understand them in order to use them.<P>

It's a good idea to scan the whole thing, though, because there is so much you can do.<P>

For example, you can send a fax from the Internet. That's right. An email to someone's fax machine!<P>

For information, check out the <a href="http://www.northcoast.com/savetz/fax-faq.html">FAX faq</a>, compiled and copyright by one Kevin M. Savetz, or visit it on the Internet.<P>

To get  it by email, send the following message in the body of an email to "mail-server@rtfm.mit.edu": "send usenet/news.answers/internet-services/fax-faq."<P>

The Fax FAQ is also available on the World Wide Web.  Although most free fax services are only available to limited areas (you can send FROM anywhere), if you really need this service, there may be a pay-for-use fax service that can help.<P>

If you're limited to email, and want to get some information from the Internet, you can retrieve Web content by email. Even if you do have Web access, it is fun to try. <P>

You don't get the pretty graphics, instead the word IMAGE appears in brackets, but you do get all the text and all the URLs in the web page. It's a time saver if you are interested in information on a heavily illustrated Web site, but don't have a fast connection or the patience to wait for the pictures to download.<P>

To request the text contents of a Web page, you send a message to an agora server (in the U.S., try "agora@info.lanic.utexas.edu"; there's a list of  them in Rankin's email-access article), with the message "send http://www.whatever.com" in the body, (where "www.whatever.com" is an actual Web address).<P>

All of this may seem strange to people who are enchanted by the brilliant graphics and cutting edge design prevalent on the World Wide Web, but for those who want to use the Internet for research or communication ,without all the bells and whistles, it's worth looking into.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Halloween Trick or Treat</font></center></b>

<P>

<font size =3>

<center>by Robin Lind</center>


When retailers hijacked Halloween as a national marketing event we should have known it would never retain the innocence of its rural, harvest-festival beginnings<P>

<img src=bat.gif width=268 height=150 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right><P>

With the national media's annual reports involving razor blades, pins, poisons and urban arson many communities have begun to restrict or discourage the old festival. In some places you may be arrested for wearing a mask if you're over a certain age; in others you can be picked up for breaking curfew on Halloween if you're between the ages of 12 and 18 when the little children are roaming the streets. The parent who sends out a child unattended for Halloween trick-or-treating nowadays runs a terrible risk.<P>

So how do you have a safe Halloween in the notorious nineties? Internet to the rescue!<P>

The Web is one place where Halloween sites have proliferated like mold in a dank basement. Want to have some fun without going out on the streets? Want some ideas about how to entertain your children at home? Want some last minute ideas about costumes? How about the actual history of All Hallows Eve that precedes All Soul's Day? It's all on the Web.<P>

A simple search for "Hallowe'en" on Alta Vista produced more than 700 sites -- a lot more than last year. But searching again without the old-fashioned apostrophe yielded over 20,000 sites! Yahoo! <P>

With an embarrassment of riches like this one has to ask: where to start?<P>

Scanning the list I saw <a href="http://www.databits.com/noframe/nfrhallow.html">Halloween Links</a> from DataBits in Newfoundland: what better place to start than that windswept island that kept its isolated Celtic heritage well into the mid-20th century and only "joined" North America in 1949? <P>

The site's a little garish I must say (reflecting the love of bright color peculiar to those who spend much time in the fog) but it has treats such as The <a href="http://aztec.lib.utk.edu/~michie/hallorig.html">Origins of Halloween</a> by Rowan Moonstone and a wee history of "<a href="http://www.algonet.se/~bernadot/christmas/16.html">mummering</a>" in Newfoundland which was a Newfie cousin to Halloween dressing-up that occurred during the Christmas 12 Nights.<P>

Skipping across Canada to that other island, Vancouver, you can visit Bonnie Bedford's <a href="http://www.islandnet.com/~bedford/hallow.html">Haunted House</a> which offers Halloween Fun for Kids: stuff to do, party ideas, history lessons, and even clip art to use on your computer.<P>

Rather have something a little less tame and recreational? Jump south to Austin, Texas for a tour of <a href="http://www.nightmarefactory.com/corners.html">Haunted Corners of the World Wide Web</a> from the Nightmare Factory. The quality of entertainment can be summed up by the caption under the repulsive illustration "poke the empty eye-socket to enter the Factory."<P>

Not looking for something so gross? Try <a href="http://www.shadeslanding.com/hms/hallo/ghost-game.html">Heather's Scary Halloween Page</a>, Kids Only !!!<P>

created by 6-year-old Heather Shade, daughter of Gary & Susan Shade of Apple Valley. Minnesota. She offers her own Halloween game and a link to a site for downloading <a href="ftp://ftp.netcom.com/pub/ob/obiwan/GhostStories">ghost stories</a>.<P>

Want to see something truly frightening? How about the <a href="http://www.accessnv.com/halloween/">Halloween Mart</a> where you can order costumes, props and body parts? There's a full range of scary masks including Ross Perot, Bob Dole, Newt Gingrich and Presidents Clinton, Nixon and Kennedy.<P>

Wondering what to give out to the costumed creatures that come calling at your house? How about all those AOL disks that have been piling up over the past year? They're definitely not fattening and won't rot their teeth. <P>

<center><b><font size =6>Check Your Options<BR>
For Investment Strategies</font></center></b>



<font size =3>

<center>by Robin Lind</center>

Feeling a little flush with cash and wondering where to invest it? Stocks? Bonds? Derivatives? Options?<P>

You've got a treat in store if you've never visited the <a href="http://www.cboe.com">Chicago Board Options Exchange</a> Web site -- an abundant resource of information with <a href="http://www.cboe.com/new/contents.html">links</a> to more 200 sub-pages packed with news, information, explanations and the obligatory warnings for the faint-hearted and weak of wallet. <P>

<img src=cboe.gif width=248 height=151 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left><P>

(Check out the ever-popular <a href="http://www.cboe.com/intro/faq.html">Frequently Asked Questions</a> for definitions that let you sprinkle your conversation with key phrases that show you can bear a little bull on your own account).<P>

Options -- in case you're wondering -- are financial contracts to buy or sell shares of stock at a set price on a future date. You don't have to own stocks or bonds, you can enjoy all the fun of playing the market and only "own" the obligation to buy or sell.<P>

For instance, if you think SuperGizmo Inc. shares will rise from $5 to $10 in six months you can buy 1000 shares of stock for $5000 and, if you're right, six months later sell them for $10,000 and pocket a $5,000 profit. <P>

However, if you only have $500 you might pay that for the option to buy 1000 shares at the $5 share price six months from now. If you're right, you exercise the option and sell the shares for $10,000 making a profit of $4,500. You are, as they say in the market's technical jargon: "in the money."<P>

Of course, you might have guessed wrong: if SuperGizmo's share price fell to $2.50 after six months you would have lost $2,500 in the first example but only $500 in the second. You are -- right, you guessed it --  "out of the money."<P>

The difference is risk. "Options involve risks and are not suitable for all investors," as the disclaimer puts it.<P>

A lot of investors apparently do find options suitable. Last year more than 185 million contracts (a contract is 100 shares) were traded at the Exchange and business volume continues to grow.<P>

You don't have to trade only in specific stocks either. If you have a hunch about an entire industry (but don't know which company will break into the lead) you can buy or sell options on an <a href="http://www.cboe.com/products/cm/cmmenu.html">Industry Composite Index</a> such as automotive, oil, or telecommunications.<P>

With the introduction in late September of seven new <a href="http://www.cboe.com:80/index/gsti/gsti.html">technology indexes</a> from the Goldman Sachs investment bank, CBOE now offers options on 35 indexes. <P>

Between April and September Goldman Sachs's composite index of 178 technology stocks rose about one and a half percent; the best performer was computer software: up over six and a half per cent; the worst: semiconductor index -- down almost nine per cent.<P>

Hey, you win some, you lose some. <P>

If you want to know more about CBOE you can take the <a href="http://www.cboe.com/visit/visit.html">Virtual Visit</a>, listen to audio files of transactions and click on small pictures to make bigger pictures.<P>

If you want to play with options for fun before you play with them for real, try the <a href="http://www.cboe.com/tooldemo/">Options Toolbox Demo</a> -- a software program that lets you set up the "what-ifs" types of scenarios that can make you rich (or impoverished) overnight. <P>

The actual software program costs $29.95. It's a sort of option on options. If you don't want to risk the $29.95, well that's your option.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Enjoy The Adventure<BR>
Following Along</font></center></b>



<font size =3>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>

Three years ago my husband and son set out on an adventure .They pedaled old bicycles in the middle of a July heatwave from our Central Virginia home 750 miles northwards to Canada.<P>

I thought they were nuts, but the best I could do was insist that they phone me from the road and wear bicycle helmets no matter how dorky they looked. You may have heard the story broadcast on NPR but you can read all about their trip at the slow-loading, but  -- I'm not biased or anything  ;-) -- attractive and entertaining website, <a href="http://www.infi.net/~catbird/">Pedaling Northwards</a>.<P>

When Robin and Frankie went off on their adventure, I was impressed by their ambitious goal, and even more impressed when they made it, battered but unbowed. True relief comes only when an adventure like this is over and I have great sympathy for the wives and mothers of other adventurers.<P>

<img src=mapusa.gif width=250 height=365 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right><P>

The <a href="http://www.mobilchallenge.ihost.com/index.html">Mobil Around the World Challenge</a>, and competitor <a href="http://www.mobilchallenge.ihost.com/nick/nick.html">Nick Sanders</a>' other journeys by bike and motorcycle, makes their trip sound like a peaceful stroll in the country on a balmy day.<P>

Thirty-eight-year old Sanders has taken several challenging trips. In the most recent, he traveled by Triumph motorcycle from <a href="http://www.mobilchallenge.ihost.com/routes/america.html">Tierra del Fuego in Argentina to Point Barrow in Alaska</a>, slightly under 14,000 miles. He was trying to beat the world record time of 23 days.<P>

Sanders didn't beat the record -- he was slowed by riots, avalanches, a dislocated foot, and a "completely cream crackered bike socket" -- but he transmitted a daily written and photographic account of his trip to an Internet website. It's well worth reading, even though the trip is over.<P>

If you want to know more about the <a href="http://www.mobilchallenge.ihost.com/chalnges/bike.html">Triumph Daytona 900 motorcycle</a> that carried him on this punishing journey, you can read all about compression ratios and bore/stroke and the digital-induction type ignition and all those thrilling numbers at the site. Works for some people. Gibberish to me.<P>

If the transportation doesn't excite you, how about the <a href="http://www.mobilchallenge.ihost.com/chalnges/techno.html">technology</a> Sanders used to transmit news of the trip. He used: "an IBM model 755CX Thinkpad with a 540Mb hard drive, 16Mb of RAM and a 75Mhz Pentium processor. PCMCIA telecommunications adapters support a GSM wireless/cellular telephone link to the IBM Global Network, as well as a traditional modem connection for land-line communication." They lost me after the Pentium processor part, but I'm willing to learn. <P>

The Thinkpad also included audio recording equipment with a digital camera plugged into it, so he could upload pictures and sounds. <P>

He can keep the motorbike, but I'd sure love to stuff one of those Thinkpads into my backpack and walk the Appalachian Trail, or <a href="http://www.servicom.es/horseback/2pag01.html">ride horseback</a> on the old Roman roads in Spain. Good grief, someone already is on the AT with a Texas Microsystems Hardbody computer in his backpack. Go visit Waldo L. Jacquith's site, <a href="http://www.comet.net/Apptrail/">Waldo takes a Walk</a>, for more on that. Waldo broke his foot on the trail. According to the site, he's scheduled to resume his 2,159.1 mile trek any day now.<P>

(Wouldn't it be fun if Robert Louis Stevenson or Jack Kerouac or Thoreau had had a setup like that when they kept their journals ? In fact, any number of wonderful travel writers would have had fun with this technology.)<P>

Back to Sanders. He plans to take off again this month to try ride his motorbike around the world, 18,000 miles, in 21 days. News of that trip will be posted on the website, as well. I'm going to keep an eye out for it. <P>

By the way, Sanders has already been around the world, by bicycle, twice. The first time, in 1981, it took him 138 days. The second time he made it in 78 days, averaging 171 miles a day. I guess he doesn't sleep a lot.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>The Royals Web<BR>Includes Princess Di</font></center></b>

<img src=diana.gif width=131 height=600 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left><P>

<font size =3>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


What is it about the Royals? Particularly, what is it about the British Royals?<P>

This summer, I saw a friend at the grocery store. He's veddy British -- the way only those Brits who've lived in the States for several decades can be. You know the type: portly-but-athletic, sports a proper "Guards" mustache and most Saturday mornings in season can be found foxhunting. <P>

Anyway, he was muttering fiercely about how Princess Diana should be hanged for treason. At the same time, he gathered up an armful of tabloids newspapers featuring scandalous allegations about the soon-to-be-former wife of the heir to the throne of England. It was the perfect combination of outrage and amusement that the House of Windsor seems to elicit these days, at least from loyal subjects.<P>

In spite of producing two perfect children, one of whom is apparently the leading heart-throb for the middle school set, the royal marriage which began with a fairy-tale wedding 15 years ago, has self-destructed. What a pity. Diana is charming and had developed into a real public relations asset for the awkward Windsors. Perhaps that's why my friend is so annoyed with her.<P>

Diana fervor is alive and well on the Internet. Her sojourn with the royal family, not to mention the fact that her son, the heart-throb, may one day be king, have left her with a lasting aura.<P>

Adoring and not so adoring fans can find a variety of sites.<P>

Depending on whether your interest in royalty is wide-ranging or limited to Princess Di, you can start with <a href="http://www.royalnetwork.com/clubdi/index.html">Club Di</a>, the (Unauthorized) Princess Diana Page, or The Ultimate Royal Web Page, with links to world royalty.<P>

For a giggle, visit Club Di. Club Di has links to news, biography, and the Living Doll (you'll need the Shockwave plug-in). The Living Doll is fun for a few minutes. The screen shows a drawing of Di in a bathing suit. You can click buttons marked "Totally Different Head" or "Work that Body" to change her hats and outfits, from cowgirl to nun to racecar driver to Phantom of the Opera to Chinese peasant, to dominatrix. Mix and match hats and outfits for a nun in a cowboy hat, for example. The experience is enhanced (?) by a monotonous, eight-note, bump-and-grind soundtrack that set my teeth on edge after a couple of minutes. Still, it's clever.<P>

Don't leave Club Di without a visit to the <a href="http://www.royalnetwork.com/rnn/index.html">Royal News Network</a>. There you'll find another interactive diversion, <a href="http://www.royalnetwork.com/palace/tabloid.html">Fleet Street A la Carte</a> ("Whip up your own tabloid frenzy"). RNN also has news from Phil Dampier, the "world's first Royal cyber correspondent," bios of the Royals, and an archive.<P>

<a href="http://members.aol.com/douglasb52/index.html">The (Unauthorized) Princess Diana Page</a> is more serious Diana adulation. The page also has a soundtrack, but this one is quite tolerable and varied. The songs all sound vaguely familiar, and the site has lots of great stuff, news, photographs, and links. Worth a visit is the fascinating <a href="http://www.coi.gov.uk/coi/depts/GQB/GQB.html">The Buckingham Palace Central Office of Information</a>, which includes the  Royal Diary of Engagements. Sadly, Di doesn't figure in the more recent releases from the Palace.<P>

You want more <a href="http://boss.cpcnet.com/personal/michael/diana.htm">photos?</a> Michael Rienhart has assembled a dozen or so. Don't miss the princess in a Pat Nixon pink pillbox hat and fitted jacket at the bottom of the first page! <P>

If Di seems like thin broth, and you hunger for more information on royal families and individuals, visit Lisa Marie Landrum's <a href="http://walden.mo.net/~landrum/royal.html">Ultimate Royal Web Page</a>. It's huge. True royalty aficionados will want to take in the full experience. You'll find books, news groups, information about magazines and journals, residences, past and current Royals, fairy tales and lots more. Less dedicated folks might prefer to go directly to the section on <a href="http://walden.mo.net/~landrum/people.htm">families and individuals</a> by clicking on Past and Current Royals.<P>

It might turn you into a royalist!<P>

<center><b><font size =6>
Where do Politicians<BR>
Get Their Figures?</font></center></b>



<font size =3>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


As I listen to the debates and follow the political campaigns leading up the elections in November, I often wonder where candidates get the figures on which they base their campaign promises.<P>

Of course, I assume that there is at least a kernel of truth in the assertions made by both sides, but is it the whole truth and nothing but the truth? Probably not.<P>

Most of us seem to glaze over when faced with economic data and statistics. Our leaders and would-be leaders count on our fitful, hazy understanding. Seldom do you see a footnote.<P>

But, in the last election, Ross Perot proved, with his pie charts and bar charts, that many of us are actually interested in economic information if it's presented in a comprehensible manner.<P>

If you worry about a lack of hard facts during this campaign, don't despair. A lot of economic information is available on the Internet for people who want to explore the facts behind the speeches.<P>

Of course, this information is also extremely useful in business if you're trying to plan for the future of your enterprise. And you can bet that federal regulations for your industry are going to be affected by this election.<P>

At the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/fsbr/esbr.html">Economic Statistics Briefing Room</a> at the White House you will find links to non-partisan information produced by Federal agencies on output, income, employment, unemployment, earnings, production and business activity, prices, money, credit, securities markets, transportation, and international statistics. Phew!<P>

If this seems like a lot to digest at one time, don't worry. It's all available in easy to read charts with brief, clear explanations, plus a link to more comprehensive information from the agency producing the figures.<P>

The Output page includes information on Gross Domestic Product, non-residential fixed investment, personal savings rate, personal consumption, total US expenditures for research and development, and more. You'll find thumbnail charts for each category, which you can click on to get a larger version with supporting figures, a few lines of commentary, a comparison to previous figures, and a link to home pages of agencies such as the <a href="http://www.bea.doc.gov">Bureau of Economic Analysis</a>, <a href="http://www.econ.ag.gov">Economic Research Service, USDA</a>, and <a href="http://www.census.gov">US Bureau of the Census</a>.<P>

If you want to know the actual figures on disposable personal income, per capita income, farm sector income, household income, poverty, or household wealth, for example, click on Income on the ESBR home page.<P>

If you don't find the figures you are looking for at the ESBR site, there are many, many other sources of economic data on the 'Net.<P>

Goffe of the Department of Economics and International Business at the University of Southern Mississippi has assembled lots of links on his site, <a href="http://econwpa.wustl.edu/EconFAQ/EconFAQ.html">Resources for Economist on the Internet</a>. The site is very simply designed, almost clunky, but don't let that put you off. It's useful and it loads fast.<P>

The table of contents on the opening page provides links to information about Internet Resources, and thence, a link to the resource itself. Click on Shortcut to All Resources to get a straight list of all his Internet links without editorial comment.<P>

Click on World and Non-US Data to find links to a variety of World Bank links, the Inter-American Development Bank, the Australian Bureau of Statistics, Japanese Macro Data, and even the Scottish Economic History Database (1580-1780), with information on weather, wages, prices, and crop yields for that period. This is where you might go to gain a global perspective on the economy...<P>

The Newsletters hyperlink contains information on subscribing to a handful of email letters for economists, there are links to information about upcoming meetings of groups with names like The Society for Computational Economics, The Econometric Society and The International Association for the Economics of Participation.<P>

The information out there for folks who want to know whether candidates are making up all those numbers they throw at each other. You can look it up or let the would-be leaders count you among the voters with a "hazy" understanding.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>
Origins Debate Revives<BR>
With Evolving Web Pages</font></center></b>



<font size =3>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>
<P>


In a perhaps apocryphal tale, a noted 19th century Catholic paleontologist was challenged by an agnostic colleague to defend his acceptance of both church teachings and his findings for the age of the famed pre-historic cave paintings at Lascaux in France. "A God who could create the world in six days," replied the faithful scientist, "could certainly create one with a past."<P>

The story recurred to me this week as I considered the revival of national efforts to teach "Creationism" alongside -- or instead of -- evolution as part of school science programs.<P>

Creationists believe that the world was created by God, as described in the Bible's Book of Genesis. They want that theory of the origins of the earth to be given (at least) the same weight as the theory of evolution.<P>

The idea makes me very uncomfortable. I read the Bible, attend church fairly regularly, know a few psalms by heart, even recite the Nicene Creed aloud. My children received religious instruction at church from their earliest ages. When it comes to learning about origins, though, I want them taught more conventional scientific theory in school. <P>

The creation of the Internet has led to an evolution of the arguments: you can check them out on the Web. Bright, serious people have taken up the banner on both sides. Proponents on both sides are nothing if not earnest.<P>


The <a href="http://www.indirect.com/www/wbrown/index.html">Center for Scientific Creation</a> has a humdinger of a site based on a book by Dr. Walt Brown, "In the Beginning: Compelling Evidence for Creation and the Flood." According to his <a href="http://www.indirect.com/www/wbrown/walt.html">bio</a>, Dr. Brown  is a retired Air Force Colonel, a graduate of West Point, and holds a Ph.D. in Mechanical Engineering from M.I.T. His site comes up with credible explanations in support of creationism, but since I'm not a scientist myself, I can't say whether the material holds up under scientific scrutiny.<P>

Heavier on the inerrancy of the Bible, but equally "scientific" is the <a href="http://www.icr.org/">Institute for Creation Research</a> in Santee, California. An excerpt from the ICR tenets of creationism puts it in a nutshell: "All things in the universe were created and made by God in the six literal days of the creation week described in Genesis 1:1-2:3, and confirmed in Exodus 20:8-11. The creation record is factual, historical, and perspicuous; thus all theories of origins or development which involve evolution in any form are false." <P>

The ICR runs a graduate school which has been under fire since 1989 from the Office of the State Superintendent of Public Instruction, but has managed to retain state approval, according to a <a href="http://www.icr.org/grad/describe.htm">school description</a> at the site.<P>

On the other side of the debate, the People for the American Way have issued a report, <a href="http://www.pfaw.org/createf.htm">"Bad Policy, Bad Science,"</a> to examine the resurgence of creationism in the public schools. In a <a href="http://www.pfaw.org/press/create.htm">press release</a> about the report, various instances of school board and state legislatures seriously considering proposals to teach creationism and even, in Tennessee, to allow schools to fire teachers who teach evolution as fact.<P>

According to PFAW Research Director Matthew Freeman, "One of the most troubling aspects of the return of Creationism is the rise in self-censorship among science teachers. Many fear losing their jobs if they discuss evolution."<P>

People for the American Way's report is hard work, without any of the spinning icons and nifty hyperlinks that ornament the ICR and CSC sites. It is very much worth reading, however, because it discusses the various stages in the current debate, including <a href="http://cns-web.bu.edu/pub/dorman/edwards_v_aguillard.html">Edwards v. Aguillard</a>, the 1987 Supreme Court ruling that found unconstitutional a 1981 Louisiana law requiring that any public school teaching evolution must grant equal time to Creationism.<P>

The report also quotes the National Academy of Sciences' declaration "to reintroduce [Creationism] into the public schools at this time as an element of science teaching would be akin to requiring the teaching of Ptolemaic astronomy or pre-Columbian geography...In rejecting evidence for the great age of the universe, [C]reationists are in conflict with data from astronomy, astrophysics, nuclear physics, geology, geochemistry and geophysics" as well as evidence provided by "paleontology, comparative anatomy, biogeography, embryology, biochemistry, [and] molecular genetics."<P>

I only wish the gentle humor of the faithful scientist could return to the debate.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>
State Fairs Continue<BR>
Year-round On The Web</font></center></b>



<font size =3>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


We went to the <a href="http://www.statefair.com">State Fair</a> the other day. It rained, of course, but it always does when we go.<P>

This year, all the midway games of "skill" offered huge red bulldogs as prizes. Rank on rank of them glowered down on us as we walked by, while road-toughened hawkers tried to entice us to take a chance. Only two dollars for three darts! <P>

<img src=ferris.gif width=150 height=213 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left><P>

It was Red Dog, eponymous canine of the new Miller beer. Just as cute and good-looking as our friend Joe Camel.<P>

We strolled by the rides and the thrill palaces decorated with gory, bosomy, mutant alien creatures.<P>

The rain finally drove us inside, where we saw perfectly canned carrots, pickles and tomatoes, mouthwatering cakes and pies, needlework, some very odd paintings, some VERY odd dresses, including a purple suit with silvery stars appliqueed on the top, and furniture including a chest of drawers on rockers with half a wooden horse protruding from each side.<P>

Then there were the vendors selling pots and pans, hippie jewelry, computerized personality tests, special waxes and cleaners, hats, whirlpool bathtubs, massaging chairs, garden stuff and pickles on a stick. <P>

Soon we were all worn out and we still had to eat and check out the livestock and horticulture exhibits before the Pig Races began. <P>

Have you never heard of racing pigs? Never seen five massive potbelly pigs meander down a racetrack or four feisty piglets careen after one another toward a bowlful of cookies at the finish line? Well take a look at the <a href="http://midas.org/mfair/allpig.html">All-Alaskan Racing Pigs at the Marin County Fair</a>, if you don't believe me.<P>

Choosing lunch at a fair is not easy. There are elephant ears, blooming onions, pizza, sausages, shish kebab, ice-cream, alligator burgers and ostrich steaks. Food smells at the fair are simultaneously nauseating and  mouthwatering. For an exhaustive list of offerings, read the Western Fairs Association <a href="http://www.ns.net/fairsnet/bdir-fdc.html">concessionaires directory</a> at FairNet.<P>

Finally, we chose barbecue. It's a good thing we ate BEFORE we went into the livestock barn to look at the drowsy sheep, pigs and cattle all brushed and prettied up for competition.<P>

We watched the selection of champion yearling ewes from among some handsome, feisty young critters. The judge explained his criteria--size, weight, body length--but they all looked like champions to me. After cooing over some brand new calves, patting a lop-eared rabbit, and wondering if the just-hatched quail chicks were alive or dead (they were so limp and still), we left the livestock area for the horticulture building.<P>

I must have been a farmer in a previous life, because <a href="http://hortwww-2.ag.ohio-state.edu/hvp/TMI/HORT210/WhatsHort/BaileyHort-1.html">horticulture</a> fascinates me. There were beautiful sheaves of wheat, oats and rye, stacks of tobacco leaves, massive pumpkins and squashes, and vegetables of every sort: blue-ribbon tomatoes slowly collapsing in their dishes and wrinkled carrots which, when freshly pulled, outshone their competition. <P>

We started toward the car, only to be hooked by the sheepdog trials. A competent dog was herding her sheep around the cones, through the gates, and splitting them into pairs before deftly shepherding them into a pen. Lovers of the movie Babe won't be surprised that her name was "Fly." I recognized her at once.<P>

At last we staggered away, stopping briefly for some dismal ostrich races (one contestant sat down and refused to move, the other refused to stop) and a wine-tasting to give us strength for the long ride home.<P>

Most fairs are over by now, but there's a lot of Internet information available to help you plan for next year. Two sites are particularly worthwhile, FairsNet and <a href="http://www.agr.state.nc.us/fair/othfairs.htm">Fairs with World Wide Web Links</a>. The <a href="http://www.ns.net/fairsnet/fdir.html">Fair Date List</a> has clickable maps of the United States and Canada, listing dates and contact information of fairs in every state and province.<P>

<a href="http://www.ns.net/fairsnet/index.html">FairsNet:A guide to North American Fairs</a>, although still under construction, is developing a souvenir stand to sell merchandise from fairs all over North America. I can't wait!<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Issues '96 Helps Us Figure<BR>Where We Stand</font></center></b>



<font size =3>



<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


"Don't confuse me with the facts. I know what I think!"<P>



As the presidential elections get closer, we're all tempted to say that from time to time.<P>


<img src=96.gif width=160 height=170 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

An emotional reaction to a few clear issues is easier to sustain -- and easier to campaign for.<P>

Well, just because some charismatic speechifier has tugged your heartstrings doesn't get you off the hook. Just because your parents always voted Republican, or your best friend convinced you that the Democrats really have the answers, doesn't give you the right to go into that voting booth November 5th and pull the same levers you've always pulled. Ya gotta get to know the issues.<P>

Bleah, you say. <P>

I know, I know. <P>

Those dense columns of type by newspaper pundits are hard to get excited about. My own personal eyes slide right off some of those national columnists' prose, no matter how hard I try to pay attention. And as far as I'm concerned, all editorial writers are off their rockers: so partisan you simply can't trust them to make an objective assessment. <P>

The issues are certainly complicated, but a normal person ought to be able to understand them.<P>

How? <P>

<img src=npr.jpeg width=160 height=85 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

The New York Times and National Public Radio have teamed up on the Web to help you figure out the issues and decide why you should stand where on what.<P>

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/issues/">Issues '96</a> is as non-partisan an effort to explore all sides of the major issues in this campaign as I can imagine. Some of you will roll your eyes heavenward upon reading that, and remark on my naivete.  Well, suit yourself -- but go see, even if you already know what you think.<P>

The Website concentrates on five major areas, Community, Rights, Safety, World, and Money. Click on any main topic to visit a series of subsections including a Forum where discussions on different questions are hosted by distinguished journalists such as Margaret Steinfels, editor of Commonweal Magazine, whose topic is "Can Democracy Survive the Rights Revolution?" Special Forum software allows participants to quickly post their thoughts.<P>

But before you start telling people what you think, you can "clarify" your thoughts. Take quizzes in each of the sections to make sure the "facts" you've based your opinions on are accurate. Find out where the candidates stand on various issues using the side by side "<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/specials/issues/rights/righome/where.html#plat">Issues '96 Platform Computer</a>"  You'll be asked to register but it's free.<P>

You click on a topic of interest, from Abortion to Welfare Reform, and the computer returns the appropriate passages from the Democratic and Republican Party platforms, so you can see what these guys have actually committed to supporting.<P>

<a href="http://www.nytimes.com/specials/issues/rights/righome/where.html#votesm">Project Vote Smart</a> is a handy tool using the databases of Vote Smart Web. You enter your ZIP code, and then you can find out all sorts of information about your federal and state Representatives including biographical data and contact information. The data on U.S. Senators and Congressmen also includes stands on issues, voting records, sources of campaign funding and ratings by various special interest groups.<P>

Finally, you can access Thomas, the Library of Congress' searchable database of the Congressional Record, from this site. Use Thomas to find out what legislation your representatives have sponsored, and what they've said in their speeches.<P>

When you've stuffed your head with all the facts, and explored what the candidates have said and left unsaid, you can create your own personal platform and then email it to all your friends -- or perhaps the government officials you wish to influence. <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/specials/issues/ihome/perplat.html">Your Personal Platform</a> is actually an interactive ballot that allows you to choose a position on juvenile crime, the federal deficit, the economy, the American family, America's global role, immigration, poverty and welfare, and race and opportunity.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Look It Up <BR>Before You Look Up</font></center></b>



<font size =3>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


My aunt was born before the <a href="http://www.brooklyn.cuny.edu/rec/air/history/wright/wright.html">Wright Brothers' successful flight</a> at Kitty Hawk, and she lived to see men walk on the Moon. In fact, she live to see quite a few other things before she died at the age of 80.<P>

<img src=glider.jpeg width=175 height=118 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

When I was a girl, I peered up at the night sky and I'm sure I saw <a href="http://nauts.com/histpace/vehiclesNT/histsputnikNT.html">Sputnik</a> passing overhead.<P>

Ten years ago, I watched the Challenger Space Shuttle's launch and its horrifying explosion.<P>

Yesterday, I logged onto my computer to learn about <a href="http://shuttle.nasa.gov/sts-79/crew/lucid.html">Astronaut Shannon Lucid's</a> return to earth after six months in orbit on the Russian Space Station Mir.<P>

<img src=lucid.gif width=115 height=150 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

We humans have always scanned the skies for signs and marvels. We've dreamed of flying, walking on the moon, exploring Mars, meeting alien beings, learning news ways of seeing. In this century, many of our dreams have come true.<P>

Few of us are immune to the excitement, even if we, ourselves, wouldn't particularly like to spend time all cooped up in a metal and ceramic tube with a bunch of scientists, craving M&Ms and potato chips (as Lucid reportedly did). <P>

The Internet allows us to experience the thrills, vicariously, without any of the boredom and discomfort. You can even download <a href="http://www.m-ms.com/candy/index.html">digital M&Ms</a>, if you like.<P>

NASA could be counted on to put together some spectacular web sites to furnish those thrills. After all, their funding, their very existence, depends on the enthusiasm of the American people to continue forking over tax dollars.<P>

The <a href="http://shuttle.nasa.gov/index.html">NASA Shuttle Web STS-79</a> provided up to the minute news about the Space Shuttle Atlantis flight that brought <a href="http://shuttle.nasa.gov/sts-79/crew/blaha.html">Astronaut John Blaha</a> and fresh supplies to the Space Station Mir, and retrieved Lucid after her record-breaking tour of duty aloft.<P>

Click on the button labeled Crew to find out who the astronauts are, what they ate, where they sat on launch and re-entry, what they wore, and read interviews.<P>

Photos, videos, and audio clips are available to download, and you can find out as much or as little about the mission as you want. For example, indepth information about the Shuttle's scientific experiments is available. You can link to the <a href="http://shuttle-mir.nasa.gov/">NASA Shuttle-Mir Web</a> for the history and mission of that program and a <a href="http://shuttle-mir.nasa.gov/ops/mir/tracking/target.txt">tracking schedule</a> showing when Mir will be visible overhead from your house (or at least a nearby big city).<P>

When you have seen and read all you want about the shuttle and the space station, go to the <a href="http://www.nasa.gov/">The NASA Homepage</a> for links to information about all the other NASA programs.<P>

There's something there for everyone, from the budding scientist, to the researcher, to folks like me who are just curious. <P>

I spent a happy half hour exploring the <a href="http://www.hq.nasa.gov/office/pao/NewsRoom/today.html">Today@NASA</a> site. There I found the expected press releases and news updates, but there is a lot more. Glorious Hubble Space Telescope photographs are here, including the deepest views yet of the Universe, a dying star, Pluto's surface and earlier photographs. There are also links to other sources of Hubble images.<P>

If you are interested in the possible evidence of life on Mars, you can link to NASA's press releases and statements on the subject, as well learn more about NASA's planned missions to Mars. <P>

<a href="http://jwocky.gsfc.nasa.gov/eptoms/ep.html">NASA's Total Ozone Mapping Spectrometer (TOMS)</a>, launched aboard a Japanese satellite this summer, is monitoring the ozone hole above the Antarctic and sending back "near real-time" images. You can link to that site to see what it is finding, and for more information on the project.<P>

Don't overlook the <a href="http://newproducts.jpl.nasa.gov/calendar/calendar.html">Space Calendar</a> for a source of fascinating information and a treasure-trove of interesting links. There are the obvious conferences and symposia and news of spacecraft activities, but the calendar also includes eclipses, meteor showers, planetary movements and anniversaries of important discoveries and space-related events. Each listing, whenever appropriate, contains hyperlinks to further information or related Websites.  <P>

Just remember the most important thing is go outside and LOOK UP!<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Martha Stewart has "Fans"<BR>Even on The Web</font></center></b>



<font size =3>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>

I heard Martha Stewart speak once. A friend had a extra ticket and invited me to go with her. At the time, I had no idea what a Martha Stewart was, but I was ready for some fun, so I went.<P>

<img src=martha.gif width=186 height=200 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

Martha was 45 minutes late. The hall was packed with upper crust socialites from Richmond, Va. These were the ladies who run the big money volunteer organizations -- Junior League, Hospital Auxiliary, Garden Club -- and they were all sitting patiently in their pearls and twin-sets waiting for herself to arrive. Turned out she'd gotten onto a plane to Rochester, New York, by mistake, and didn't realize until the thing landed. I guess her head was churning with great ideas.<P>

Before I left the auditorium (I was on my lunch hour and had to duck out early), two new images were etched on my brain. The first was some soup bowls Martha had invented.<P>

Martha set her visiting sister to work gilding little pie pumpkins. She floated a layer of gold paint on bucketful of water, then holding the pumpkins by the stem, submerged them one at a time in the concoction. Hung them to dry, sliced off the top, scooped out the seeds, et voila: an elegant individual soup bowl, with lid. <P>

I've never tried it. I'd rather imagine that it could be done, than have a mess of water and paint and pumpkin goo all over the place and know for sure it couldn't.<P>

The other, much simpler, idea was slipping a little Johnny-Jump-Up or violet onto the rim of a glass of iced tea. Since then, edible flowers have come in and out of style; for a while they were everywhere. Back then, though, when Martha and the world were new, it was a charming idea.<P>

Martha doesn't seem quite real. "Fraud" is a word some people have used. Still, she appeals to the little girl I once was. I spent quiet hours at doll tea parties, carefully setting the tree-stump table with acorn cups and leaves for dishes, and interesting rocks and sticks and flowers for party food. I knew it was all pretend, and I know Martha is mostly pretend, too. So what?<P>

Martha's a thriving industry. So is making fun of her. After all, she's an easy mark.<P>

Martha, herself, doesn't have a web page. However, as one fan writes on her "<a href="http://www.cjnetworks.com/~jessa/me/love/martha.html">My Martha Stewart Page</a>": "... somehow we all know that if she wanted to, she'd learn HTML and have pages fit for Cool Site of the Day in less than a week." <P>

This anonymous fan raves on about Martha, then points her faithful reader to the unofficial <a href="http://tear.cybercash.com/kerry/martha/index.html">Web Guide to Martha Stewart</a>. There you'll find links to satisfy your urges both to laugh at and to admire this weird person. Click on <a href="http://tear.cybercash.com/kerry/martha/media.html">Martha in the Media</a> for feature articles, parodies, gossipy bits, and a bibliography. <P>

Glance at the Lexington Herald-Leader article about Tasha Tudor, another one who appeals to us aging little girls, with her reaction to being compared to Martha: "A magazine? I have never seen her magazine. The only thing I subscribe to is the Dairy Goat Journal and the Corgi Crier."<P>

Read the fictional contest between <a href="http://www.fc.net/~zarathus/andrew/andrew_of_america_versus_martha_stewart.txt">Andrew of America and Martha</a> for title of Ultimate Housewife of All Time. It has the two of them trying to one-up each other in wilder and wilder claims of creativity and resourcefulness, until Andrews shuts Martha up with a cheap shot. Bad taste.<P>

Do you think Martha should have been a suspect in the OJ trial? You'll find her listed at a humorous site called <a href="http://holly.colostate.edu/~sapienza/oj/suspects/suspects.html">The Leading Suspects</a>. <P>

Instructions for turning your American Express card into an Anti-Martha fetish are at the <a href="http://www.cris.com/~akiyama/martha.html">The Lair of the Anti-Martha</a>. <P>

Martha Stewart parodies are often very funny, perhaps because most of the folks who go after her are secretly fond of her. <P>

Just like me.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Doing Business Abroad?<BR>Use the Web Advantage</font></center></b>



<font size =3>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


Your boss, in her wisdom, has decided that Acme SuperGizmo Company's growth and profits depend on developing business in developing countries. <P>

You've been chosen to scout out new markets for the company's eponymous supergizmo. Great! You speak four languages fairly well, and you're personable and charming. Problem is, you haven't been abroad since college, and you don't remember how to get a passport.<P>

<img src=travel.gif width=145 height=215 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

Besides, if you're going to have a successful trip, you'll have to do a little research. Most of these countries didn't exist in their current form the last time you studied geography. Some were colonies, others were part of the former Soviet Union. Still others have merged or split apart. They all have unique customs and possibilities. The last thing you want to do is make a stupid mistake that would ruin your chances.<P>

Finally, what are our country's diplomatic relations with that country? What's the currency exchange? What's the best way to carry money: a credit card? traveler's checks? Should you bring extra cash to give as "gifts" so your projects will gain official approval?<P>

How in the world are you going to find out all this stuff?<P>

Not surprisingly, the Internet is a fine place to start. Go directly to the <a href="http://www.state.gov/index.html">U.S. Department of State Home Page</a> for information and links to other sites with additional information. <P>

Let's begin with that passport. On the State Department home page, click on the hyperlink labeled Travel Information and <a href="http://travel.state.gov/">U.S. Consular Affairs</a>. Click the button labeled Passport Information, and you'll be taken to a site with all the instructions you'll need to apply for a new passport or renew your existing one. <P>

There are even downloadable passport applications you can print out, and a  nationwide list of places to apply for a passport. The list is a big one, so be prepared to wait if your state is toward the end of the alphabet. Also, it lacks phone numbers. (You'll probably find out where to go faster by looking in the telephone directory "blue pages" under U.S. Government, Postal Service, Passport Information.)<P>

Click on Visa Information to learn what additional documents you'll need to visit other countries and how to get them.<P>

Travel warnings and other travel publications are also available at the site, and contain regularly updated information about political and social unrest, if it exists, and whether the U.S. government discourages travel to various countries and why.<P>

You can find other background information about US policies and diplomatic relations, global issues that might affect the marketing of your gizmos, and more.<P>

<a href="http://www.state.gov/www/about_state/business/index.html">The America Desk: Support for US Business</a> is another invaluable Website. Among its offerings is a series of <a href="gopher://dosfan.lib.uic.edu:70/1D-1%3A8210%3A4country%20commer">Country Commercial Guides</a>, from Algeria to Yemen. <P>

If a guide has been prepared for the country you intend to visit, it will make instructive reading. They're quite extensive, and include the country's history, an analysis of its economy and current political climate, and notes on its business culture. <P>

You'll find sections on prospects for marketing U.S. goods and services, trade regulations and standards, and the investment climate. You can find out about the country's infrastructure, work week, and other details that could make the difference between arriving prepared to do business or not.<P>

The reports also have information about how to set up an office, find a business partner, and the need for representation by local attorneys.  <P>

For historical and background information about countries, look over the <a href="http://www.state.gov/www/background_notes/index.html">Background Notes</a> prepared by the State Department. These are updated periodically, and include countries for which Commercial Guides may not be available, such as, for a random example, Eritrea and Zimbabwe.<P>

If you are traveling to Australia, Azerbijan, Canada, Chile, Indonesia, Israel, Japan or, Malaysia, the <a href="http://travel.state.gov/links.html">U.S. Embassies or Consulates</a> have home pages in those countries.<P>

For all the fussing we Americans do about our government, it would be very hard to complain about the wholehearted support for international commerce that this government operated web site represents. <P>

<center><b><font size =6>Wired Launches<BR>New Research Source</font></center></b>



<font size =3>




<I>"This week we launch the research tool of research tools, Wired Source, the WIRED editors' gateway to real info on the Net. Finally, an Uzi for librarians."</I> --HotFlash 3.40
<P>

<font size =2>
(An announcement in the September 16 edition of HotFlash, the weekly newsletter from Wired Magazine and its online incarnation, Hot Wired).<P>

<font size =3>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>
Oh, gee whiz, says I to myself. "An Uzi for librarians!" Yeah, right. I'm sure it's what librarians everywhere have been longing for, especially to deal with those hoodlums who raise their voices in the sacred precinct.<P>

<img src=source.gif width=132 height=57 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

Feeling rather dubious, I went to have a look. A cousin had just emailed asking me to tap my Internet expertise to search out Vice President Al Gore's mailing address.<P>

So, I went to <a href="http://www.hotwired.com/wiredsource/">Wired Source</a>, wishing I had a virtual bullet proof vest nearby. It wasn't scary at all, just extremely well designed, and very useful. After a few minutes at the site, I bookmarked it, and moved the bookmark up to the top of my list. I expect to be back often.<P>

Along the left side of the screen is a set of 24 rainbow colored tabs. They bear labels such as Search Engines, News, Cyberrights, Web Zines, Business, Stock Market, Government, Science, Television, and Literature.<P>

Click on any tab to go to a page full of links, each with a short description of what you'll find.  <P>

I could have used one of the search engines to find Al Gore's address. There's a choice of HotBot, AltaVista, Excite, Infoseek, Lycos, or any of eleven others. Instead, I clicked on the Government tab. The current administration has a commitment to the development of the Information Superhighway, and I figured I'd find out something at the <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov">White House</a> Home Page.<P>

There it was, below GovBot ("hundreds of thousands of Web pages from US government and military sites around the country, although the engine's not exactly stellar") and the Foreign Affairs Guide to International Affairs: The White House. I clicked the link labeled The President & The Vice President, and was taken to <a href="http://www.whitehouse.gov/WH/EOP/html/principals.html">The Executive Office of the President</a>. The EOP "includes senior policy advisors and offices responsible for the President's correspondence and communications, the Office of the Vice President, the Office of the First Lady, as well as the Office of Mrs. Gore." There at the bottom was the mailing address: 1600 Pennsylvania Ave., Washington, DC 20500. That was easy. The page also has email address for President & Mrs. Clinton and Mr. Gore.<P>

I emailed the information back to my cousin, who by that time had already found the same site through Yahoo, and had telephoned the White House and the Old Executive Office Building for the information. It was her third time out Web surfing. So much for my expertise.<P>

(She did try Wired Source after I told her about it, but its connection to the White House wasn't working at the time. Don't you love the Web?)<P>

Wired Source's Government section has links to the US House of Representatives and Senate home pages, Fed World, THOMAS: Legislative Info on the Net, Federal Aviation Administration File Search, Federal Communications Commission and just about everything else you'd expect to be on the Web including the IRS, CIA and <a href="http://flamestrike.hacks.arizona.edu/~tv/government.html">Cool Government Site of the Week</a> (?!).<P>

Each of the rainbow colored tabs reveals an equally finely-honed selection of useful sites. Reference Desk takes you to a variety of searchable reference books including Webster's Dictionary, Roget's Thesaurus, Supreme Court decisions, Morse Code translator, Complete Works of William Shakespeare, currency and measurement converters, Xerox PARC Map Server, Patent Searches -- and that's only the tip of the iceberg and only one tab.<P>

In its role as one of the first hot print and electronic guides to the Internet, Wired really couldn't have done less than create this site. Developed by Roderick Simpson, Associate Producer of Wired Online while he was research editor for the magazine, it's a keeper -- though it's been rather slow each time I've used it. Could be everyone is checking it out at the same time.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Web Offers Restful Stroll<BR>Through Virtual Cemeteries</font></center></b>



<font size =3>



<center>by Kitty Williams</center>



How about taking a picnic and visiting a nice cemetery this afternoon? Perhaps a stroll among the weeping angels and sleeping lambs after a nice glass of chardonnay and  some cucumber sandwiches? <P>

We could admire the bright blue periwinkle blossoms, and smell the sweet lemony scent of magnolia blossoms on the huge old trees. Peek in through the wrought iron door of that elaborate mausoleum to see the stained glass window on the other side. Trace the skull and willow branches etched on the slate marker over there. Gaze at the averted, lichen-stained face of Grief, herself.<P>

Unlike the modern memorial gardens where flat grave markers permit easy maintenance and low cost "perpetual care," many nineteenth century cemeteries were designed to serve as elaborate parks. Elaborate grave markers and mausoleums reflected the wealth of the deceased.<P>

<img src=tyler.gif width=226 height=344 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

Visiting one of these parks can be a somber delight, as I discovered years ago, when I used to wander in the park like City Cemetery in <a href="http://www.jewishgen.org/cemetery/usms.htm">Natchez</a>, Mississippi.<P>

Here were the opulent statuary marking the final resting place of the wealthy cotton merchants from the city's ante-bellum prime, there were the Civil War veterans, across the way, in chronological ranks, the stones of the once-thriving Jewish community, many entirely in Hebrew. <P>

Today, we live near another great cemetery in the Victorian style. <a href="http://freenet.vcu.edu/tourism/histrich/rvadir0.html#holly">Hollywood</a> Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia, is the final resting place for all sorts of interesting folks. On top of that, it's perfectly lovely, spread over a tree-covered hillside overlooking the noisy James River. Tourists and mourners share the winding paths among the family plots and significant monuments.<P>

Although information on the Internet about Natchez City and Hollywood Cemeteries is rather scanty, there is a great deal else to satisfy those interested in such things. Surprisingly, most of what I found was carefully researched, well designed, and neither ghoulish nor goofy.<P>

Two sites caught my interest initially. The most extensive is <a href="http://www.best.com/~gazissax/city.html">City of the Silent</a>, with segments on "Cemeteries as Culture," "Cemeteries through Time," "Cemeteries in Art," and "Cemeteries on the Internet." In the last category, The <a href="http://www.best.com/~gazissax/silence/altfunin.html">WWW Post-Mortem Page</a>, a guide to web sites, rates other web sites on a scale of one to four tombstones. <P>

Joel GAzis-SAx (yes, that's the way he capitalizes his name) created and maintains this site. A visit is almost as refreshing and thought-provoking as stroll through a good old-fashioned city cemetery.<P>

The other site that caught my browser's virtual eye is <a href="http://www.teleport.com/~stanton/">Tombstone Tourist</a>, the work of Scott Stanton. It's a little less serious than City of the Silent, and opens with a quote attributed to actress Brooke Shields at a Senate subcommittee hearing: "If you're killed, you've lost a very important part of your life." Heavy.<P>

The site has several features including "Gravesite of the Month" with gravesites of musicians like Stevie Ray Vaughan, Hank Williams, Buddy Holly and Andy Gibb.<P>

Don't overlook the site's link to the <a href="http://www.cemetery.org/Lachaise/lachaise.intro.html">Cimetiere du Pere Lachaise</a> in Paris, final resting place of Oscar Wilde, Frederick Chopin, Jim Morrison , Marcel Proust,   Dominique Perignon, and Simone Signoret. There are a few lovely photographs, and links to biographies of these notables.<P>

Stanton also has a link to the <a href="http://www.csn.net./%7Emhand/Presidents/">Dead President's</a> Page, the creation of Manus Hand (sounds like a pseudonym to me) who has visited the gravesites of all but four of the late presidents, and offers photographs to prove it. Whoop-dee-doo! <P>

It would be as useless a site as M. Hand claims it is, except for one thing. American history enthusiasts will find the original obituaries for presidents Fillmore through Hayes, as well as Chester Arthur and Benjamin Harrison. Hand promises to add more.<P>

The <a href="http://www.cemetery.org/">World Wide Cemetery</a> offers "a place where Internet users, their friends and families, can erect permanent monuments to our dead." That's right. A virtual cemetery. I guess it had to happen. You can view monuments, leave flowers, or include a monument to your loved one. Go figure.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Bluffer's Guide <BR>Helps Business Novices</font></center></b>



<font size =3>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


Even if you aren't involved in the world of high finance, you may be aware that there is more to the world of money than your own personal budget. <P>

When the stock market falls at the news of an improving job market, when world wide markets hold their breath as the Federal Reserve Board of Governors discusses interest rates, when radio news announcers talk cryptically about the international stock exchanges, many of us scratch our heads and wonder whether we ought to be able to understand what's going on.<P>

The Internet has help for everyone from the most dismally innumerate to wannabe tycoons and robber barons. There's even a lot for everyday, hard-working stockbrokers and bankers.<P>

Before embarking on a tour of financial Web sites, however, I recommend a trip to PRI's Marketplace site. In case you haven't heard, <a href="http://www.usc.edu/marketplace/">Marketplace</a> is a business news radio program from the University of Southern California that airs on Public Radio stations. <P>

I just love it, even when I have no idea what they're talking about. Apparently I'm not alone. Marketplace says it aims at "individuals who may be business novices;" 43% of its audience is female and three quarters are between the ages of 18 and 54.<P>

In spite of (because of?) its cheeky attitude towards business reporting, Washingtonian Magazine says it is in the top four "most-listened to" radio programs among business leaders.<P>

It is now carried by more than 280 stations but if you can't get Marketplace in your radio listening area you can still see the news stories in their <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/IPC/marketplace/DIRarchives.shtml">archives</a> or order them by cassette. (They promise that printed transcripts will be available soon.)<P>

If you're already a fan you might want to check out the <a href="http://www.usc.edu/marketplace/DIR/cast-crew.html">Cast & Crew</a> page which gives biographical backgrounds of these voices you've learned to love, or go <a href="http://www.usc.edu/marketplace/DIRbackstage.html">Backstage</a> to find out just who puts this whole thing together.<P>

A typical Marketplace Web offering is the <a href="http://www.usc.edu/dept/IPC/marketplace/misc/bluffers.html">Bluffer's Guide to Investing and Finance</a> created by Anchor/Senior Editor David Brancaccio and Texas stockbroker David Johnson. Stockbrokers and financiers could skip this, but the rest of us get a hint of what the heck stockbrokers and financiers are talking about.<P>

For example, one entry, "The capacity utilization numbers have totally tanked the bond market." could be a random collection of vaguely familiar sounding words, as far as I'm concerned. I was pleased to learn that it means "Bond traders are sad because the economy is too good."<P>

The Guide goes on to offer definitions for exotic terms like:<P>
<UL>

<li>"Derivative": A synthetic security that's derived from another natural security. These are commonly so complex that many have no idea what they're buying and selling or what the possible consequences might be.<P>

<li>"I.P.O.": Initial Public Offering or "It's Probably Over-Priced." The first batch of stock sold on the day company goes public. Some new issues show a meteoric rise the first day; some do not. The rule of thumb is "If you can get it, you don't want it. If you can't get it, you want it a lot."<P>

 <li>"Sell-short": A bet that an investment will fall in value. Short-seller's aphorism: 'He who sells what isn't his'n, must buy it back or go to prison.'<P>

<li>"Settlement": The day you buy a stock is the trade date. The money you pay for stock is due three days later, the settlement date. The rule is 'Three days to pay; three years if you don't.'<P>
</UL>
After you've visited the Marketplace guide, you'll not only be ready to talk "knowledgeably about financial terms, you'll be able to see through what the other guys are saying too.<P>

Marketplace is a 30-minute program broadcast five evenings a week, Monday through Friday. It also offers nine-minute segments in the morning that are inserted into regular Morning Edition and Monitor Radio programming. <P>

<center><b><font size =6>Powerful Photographs<BR>Are Linked on The Web</font></center></b>



<font size =3>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


People who have never seen photographs before are said to be both frightened and delighted by them. It's no wonder. Though we are surrounded by photographs everywhere we go, the magic of capturing light on paper doesn't really fade. Photographs can also be a powerful aid to memory, of both pleasant and terrible events.<P>

Some fascinating photography exhibits and resources are on the Internet. Personal photography pages have proliferated on the World Wide Web. Some are pretty good. Some are pretty dull. Most are in between. <P>

The Yahoo list of <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/Arts/Photography/Photographers/Personal_Exhibits/">personal online photography exhibits</a> seems endless. An exhibit of photographs taken in the <a href="http://www.pvv.ntnu.no/~mkje/gallery/gallery.html">Lofoten Islands</a> of Norway is typical: some lovely photographs, too many versions of the same scene, not enough information about the photographer or his (her?) work. It's sort of an electronic photo album.<P>

Fortunately, personal shows aren't the only things on the Web.<P>

Two wonderful sites, are <a href="http://darwin.clas.virginia.edu/~ds8s/home.html">Fixing Shadows</a>, compiled and maintained by J. David Sapir of the University of Virginia's Anthropology Department, and <a href="http://humanitas.ucsb.edu/shuttle/photog.html">Voice of the Shuttle Photography Page</a>, a subsection of Alan Liu's marvelous Voice of the Shuttle: <a href="http://humanitas.ucsb.edu/humanitas_home.html">Web Page</a> for Humanities Research. Liu is a member of the English Department at the 
University of California, Santa Barbara.<P>

Fixing Shadows is a collection that reveals the reasons many people take photographs. From Charles Dodson's (Lewis Carroll) haunting 19th century photographs of Alice Liddell and her friends, to Moses Vorobeichic's <a href="http://darwin.clas.virginia.edu/~ds8s/wilna.html">photographs of the Wilna [Vilnius]  Ghetto</a> from the late 1920s, to Secure the Shadow, Jay Ruby's study of mortuary photography, to photographic studies of modern Nepal, children in Central Park, parades in Texas -- it's definitely worth a visit. <P>

Of course, you should either have a pretty fast modem, or plenty to do while you wait for the images to download.<P>

Of all the collections Sapir has brought together at this site, the most moving is The Ghetto Lane in Wilna, black and white photographs by the Polish photographer and painter Vorobeich, also known as Moi Ver, and later, in Israel, as Moshe Raviv. <P>

Originally published in 1931, the photographs seem almost modern in the way Moi Ver has manipulated them, cut them up and reassembled them to create strange and meaningful juxtapositions. <P>

Although most of the text is in German, the photographs don't need translation. All of them -- for example #50, <a href="ftp://bh1.anth.virginia.edu/photo/wilna/gp50.jpg">Jung und Alt</a>, showing young boys horsing around while an older man sleeps against a post nearby -- are heart-wrenching. Ten years later, virtually all the subjects were "liquidated" by the Nazi SS. <P>

Here is an example of the extraordinary power of the Internet: I wanted to know more about Wilna. What happened? When? How?<P>

A quick AltaVista search on Wilna turned up <a href="http://www.writething.com/cybrary/fact.fin.mul.html">the report of the Commander of the security police</a> and the SD Einsatzkommando 3 Kauen. Executions in Wilna began on August 9, 1941. The report included a complete list of executions carried out in the EK 3 area up to  December 1, 1941. <P>

I felt a strange feeling in my throat, somewhere between grief and nausea, as I read.<P>

After contemplating the doomed faces captured on film by Moi Ver, it's almost a relief to visit another exhibit at the site: <a href="http://darwin.clas.virginia.edu/~ds8s/jay.html">Secure the Shadow</a>: Death and Photography in America. The accompanying essay, by Jay Ruby, explains that the exhibit "focuses upon the ways in which people have taken and used photographs of deceased loved ones and their funerals to mitigate the finality of death." <P>

There's some strange stuff here, but it's overpowering confirmation of the human urge to remember and to grieve.<P>

The Voice of the Shuttle is a more complete photography resource than Fixing Shadows, with links to everything from U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics <a href="http://stats.bls.gov/oco/ocos091.htm">Occupational Outlook Handbook</a> section on Photographers and Camera Operators, to online exhibits, to listservs and newsgroups.<P>

There are links to photographs by <a href="http://www.book.uci.edu/AdamsHome.html">Ansel Adams</a>, <a href="http://192.253.114.31/Projects/stereograms/Stereoscopic_Photographs/Stereoscopic_Photographs.html">stereoscopic photographs</a>; pictures of <a href="http://www.exploratorium.edu/nagasaki/">Nagasaki</a>, and <a href="http://www.i3tele.com/photo_perspectives_museum/faces/exhibition.html">former Yugoslavia</a>; and such a wide variety of other links that anyone mildly interested should at least scan the page. <P>

Be warned that, as with many such wide ranging and ambitious Internet efforts, some of the links have been broken.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Mr. Potato Head Meets<BR>Virtual Bubble Wrap</font></center></b>



<font size =3>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>

Ever since your mother threw out the Mr. Potato Head and gave your Lego blocks to the church daycare program, you've felt a little bereft. <P>

When your own children were little, you could play with their toys. But now they've lost interest, and cleared out their toy cabinets to make room for sports equipment or a sound system or power tools or, even, school stuff.<P>

No matter that you're a bona fide grownup now and you can go to the toy store and buy a Mr. Potato Head for yourself. You won't. It's just too weird. You'd embarrass the kids.<P>

Well the Internet is there to satisfy the childish urges of the most outwardly mature among us. You don't need a plastic Mr. P-head -- <a href="http://www.westnet.com/~crywalt/pothead/pothead.html">Virtual Mr. Spud Head</a> is just a mouse click away. <P>

The opening screen reveals a plain potato with all the features you remember so well neatly arranged to one side. There are round white eyes with beady black dots for pupils. There are heavy black-rimmed eyeglass frames, a bowler hat, big red lips, a couple of toothy grins, a choice of noses, a mustache, and some splay-toed feet. Click the dot next to the feature, then click the place on the potato you'd like it to appear. If you don't like the placement, there's a button marked "pluck" which you click to remove an offending feature.<P>

Once you've got an arrangement that pleases you, you can click a bar at the bottom labeled "Change Vegetable." Click the pumpkin, the carrot, the Gingrich, the Clinton, the artichoke, the apple or the eggplant, to see how they'd look with the face you've created. No Dole, though. Not even a pineapple. How strange.<P>

The official <a href="http://www.lego.com/">World Wide Web Lego site</a> isn't as entertaining as I'd hoped it would be. The only fun stuff you can do there is create your own home page with Lego block links to your favorite web sites. I guess an actual child would get a kick out of this, though, because it's quite easy. All you have to do is register, fill in some information about your age, sex, and where you live, and type in the Website URLs you want linked to your site. A small child will need help, but any web-savvy 10-year-old should be able to manage.<P>

The rest of the site, in spite of neat graphics, is nothing but a corporate brochure with news of new products, press releases, contact (snail mail) addresses and so on.<P>

<a href="http://www.mackerel.com/bubble.html">Virtual Bubble Wrap</a> is a lot more fun. It will appeal, even, to serious bureaucrats and office administrators. <P>

I know this from experience. <P>

Several years ago, I was sitting at my downtown office desk on a quiet corridor in the bowels of a skyscraper. Most of the offices around me were empty, but I heard a strange, rhythmic sound coming from down the hall. I couldn't quite identify it, so I went out to investigate. <P>

The source was the large, corner office of a senior bureaucrat, known for her cool authoritarianism and no-nonsense control of the document-processing empire. She was sitting there, popping bubble wrap just like a young girl.<P>

Not quite like a young girl, actually. When my children were younger, they wouldn't use their fingers to pop bubble wrap. Oh, no. They put sheets of the stuff on the floor and danced on it.<P>

For those of us who don't have easy access to the real thing, Virtual Bubble Wrap may be the solution.<P>

Produced by <a href="http://www.mackerel.com">Mackerel Interactive Media</a> from Toronto, the game takes bubble popping to new heights. You can keep score! There are "stubborn bubbles" that won't pop until you hit them just right. You burst bubbles with mouse clicks, or hold down your mouse button and drag across a whole row. Each bubble, as it pops, emits the characteristic noise we bubble-poppers so admire. 
You'll need the Shockwave plug-in for your browser to make this work but you can download it free onsite. (Didn't you always want a reason to download Shockwave?)<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Email Discussion Groups<BR>Are Internet Assets</font></center></b>



<font size =3>

<center>by Robin Lind</center>

Access to unlimited information has to be one of the Internet's greatest assets. Trying to sort out what's valuable has to be one of its greatest liabilities.<P>

After all, what a business manager really needs is not information but intelligence based upon the information gathered. <P>

Entrepreneurs in small businesses must filter out what's useful to their niche within a specific industry. Managers in large corporations have to stay up on developments both technical and competitive across a broad spectrum. Both can benefit from email discussions.<P>

If you value personal networking, industry association, group interaction and serendipitous encounter you will probably want to be a regular subscriber to at least one email discussion group. These are groups of people -- most of whom have never met -- who exchange email in a public forum about subjects that interest them. The subjects can be broad or esoteric. They can generate a few email messages a week or a hundred in a day.<P>

Imagine an email discussion group being an electronic version of a college dorm bull session, an industry conference idea exchange or a neighborhood bar chat. You can't control the mix but you often get something interesting, provocative or even insightful. (It helps to pick the right dorm, association or bar).<P>

<img src=liszt.gif width=73 height=102 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

The place to start on the Internet is "<a href="http://www.liszt.com/">Liszt: a Directory of Email Discussion Groups</a>" created by Indiana University graduate Scott Southwick. <P>

Under broad category headings, ranging from "Arts" to "Social" you can select a subject that interests you and find email groups discussing it.<P>

Choose "<a href="http://www.liszt.com/select/Business">Business</a>" and you'll find 23 subcategories. <P>

Choose "<a href="http://www.liszt.com/select/Business/Electronic_Commerce/">Electronic Commerce</a>" and you'll find 3 separate discussion groups.<P>

Choose "tbtf" and find out how to subscribe to "Tasty Bits from The Technology Front" which fosters discussion on "trends and clever ideas in using the Web effectively for marketing, selling, and distribution ... updates on the growth of the Internet commercial infrastructure: transaction brokers ... emerging standards and contenders in secure transactions and electronic cash..."<P>

Growing drowsy just thinking about it? Well, this may not be the discussion group for you but don't kid yourself. The folks who are trading ideas here are reinventing the way you'll be using your credit card (or its replacement) in the next few years.<P>

If you choose the subcategory "Finance" you'll find 16 topics, all of which are maintained by <a href="http://www.financenet.gov">FinanceNet</a>, established by Vice President Al Gore's National Performance Review in 1994. FinanceNet encourages participants to exchange "ideas, successes, news, lessons learned, best practices and experiences" in an effort to improve government financial management. <P>

If you are a financial policy wonk you might have fun here. At the very least you'll be able to pick up some current jargon to drop at the water-cooler.<P>

Most lists are "unmoderated", which means there's no one driving the bus: it's all automatic. You send your email: it appears on the computers of everyone who subscribes to the list. Fellow listmembers may reply encouragingly, rudely, or even ignore you. <P>

A "moderated" list is one that has a live person attending to its messages. You may need permission to join and can be bounced if you overstep the "netiquette" established for list users.<P>

In the most useful of lists "flaming" (the practice of sending grossly insulting replies) is kept to a minimum. Messages are on topic and you very quickly get to "know" the other members who contribute to the discussion.<P>

Words of advice: spend a few days "lurking" on an email list before you participate to get a sense of the tone and level of discussion. Practice the golden rule. Be brief. Restrain yourself from copying an entire previous message just to add "Attaboy!" <P>

And, whatever you do, keep the instructions for unsubscribing. You don't want to end up on what turns out to be a useless list with hundreds of emails cascading into your computer every day, hiding the one or two essential messages from your boss that need to be attended to immediately.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>The Internet Revives<BR>Letter-Writing Arts</font></center></b>



<font size =3>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


This fall, a new group of young men and women are off to college, leaving parents behind, craving regular communication.<P>

Some are excellent correspondents, but for others writing a letter taps finely-honed procrastination skills.<P>

As an alternative to pricey long-distance telephoning, increasing numbers of parents are relying on email to stay in touch. Email allows the writer and the recipient to read and respond to messages at leisure, much like (surprise!) paper letters. <P>

In the old days, you'd treasure personal letters from family and friends. When you'd read them, you'd eagerly respond. Naturally, you always had paper, envelopes, stamps, and black or blue ink in your fountain pen. <P>

You'd send your children to college with fully-stocked leather-bound writing kits which they were expected to use regularly to stay in touch. Somewhere, the telephone took over. The art of letter-writing fell out of vogue.<P>

Today, letter writing is back, and the credit goes to email and the Internet. All you need is a computer with a modem, something becoming more and more prevalent in American homes. Best of all, you don't need to rummage around for stamps. <P>

At today's colleges computers are everywhere. Many students bring their own, and most institutions of higher learning have computer labs with Internet connections, open 24/7 (that means 24 hours a day, seven days a week, for the uninitiated.) When students get an email, the temptation to dash off an immediate answer is almost irresistible. <P>

A recent email to our son at college consisted of standard motherly questions, and elicited a prompt reply quoting the original text with answers after each question. Very satisfactory.<P>

Some people subscribe to online services such as <a href="http://www.aol.com">America Online</a>, <a href="http://www.compuserve.com">Compuserve</a> or <a href="http://www.prodigy.com">Prodigy</a> just for email. That can be expensive, unless you know all the tricks, such as composing messages off-line and using "flash sessions" to retrieve and transmit email with minimum connect time. <P>

Others pay a monthly fee (ranging from $10-$20) to an Internet service provider for unlimited Internet access and gain email facilities from one of the popular free browsers like <a href="http://www.netscape.com">Netscape Navigator</a> or <a href="http://www.microsoft.com">Microsoft Explorer</a>.<P>

Now there's a third option, particularly suited for people who want to use the Internet exclusively for email. Two companies currently offering free email service are <a href="http://www.juno.com">Juno</a> and <a href="http://www.freemark.com">Freemark</a> and by free we mean not only is the software free but the connect time is free too. You pay nothing at all.<P>

How can they do this, you ask? They are using the television industry model: the theory is that advertising revenues will make it all possible and profitable. They will append small advertising banners to your emails and the advertisers will pay for the privilege of appearing before you.<P>

Juno, which I've tried, looks just fine. The software comes by mail, and installs easily. The only tedious part is a questionnaire asking about your age, income, interests, etc. This allows their marketing department to send you ads that are targeted to your wants and needs.<P>

Either I'm not a typical Juno user, or they don't have a lot of ads yet. So far I haven't seen any. Not a one.<P>

You may send each message as it is finished, or you can wait and send them all at the end of the session, via a quick local phone call. It's an elegant, simple, attractively-designed program for anyone who wants the convenience of email without Internet access. Juno also has a spellchecker, which I love. <P>

Freemark appears to be almost identical, though I haven't tried it yet. <P>

Demonstrations of both are available at the web sites, where you may order the free software. Both encourage users to freely copy and share the software. <P>

The one "disadvantage" to staying in touch with a college student by email is that you can't (yet) send money by email. That may soon change. Considering the number of students involved in computer engineering and software programming, you can bet that scores of bright minds are working on the problem at this very moment.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Youthful Humor Ages Online</font></center></b>



<font size =3>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>

Twenty and more years ago I found Monty Python's Flying Circus utterly delightful. I'd even stay up late to watch it on television, laughing helplessly at skits involving exploding penguins and men dressed up as middle-aged matrons.<P>

I still giggle at the memory of the one about kilted Scotsmen who won at Wimbledon by turning their opponents into blancmanges. It was the epitome of that bizarre exhibition known as "British" humor.<P>

Perhaps I grew old too fast, but somewhere along the line I found I was staying up less frequently. The last time I watched a Monty Python video with my teenage son, I discovered I'd lost tolerance for bosom and bottom humor. The pure silliness I'd remembered didn't overcome the ick factor.<P>

<img src=python.gif width=181 height=258 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

Thus, it was with some trepidation that I accessed the Python World Wide Web site, <a href="http://www.pythonline.com/">PythOnline</a>.<P>

The old fogey in me shook her head. This sort of thing was funnier when it was still shocking. Now it's just gross. <P>

I downloaded a free demonstration version of the CD ROM game based on the movie, <a href="http://www.7thlevel.com/products/strategy/grail/">Monty Python and the Quest for the Holy Grail</a>. It took several tries. My Internet connection kept hanging up when I was almost done -- oh , the joys of traffic jams on the Information Superhighway.<P>

While I waited, I toured the site. It opens with a <a href="http://www.7thlevel.com/warning.htm">warning</a>: "The PythOnline web site contains material that we hope is objectionable and unsuitable for children..." If you have the stomach for it, continue. The very first page I came to convinced me that this site is probably aimed exclusively at 13-year-old boys. <P>

The fogey fog descended on me like a gray miasma.<P>

Finally, the demo downloaded successfully. Then Hurricane Fran hit, and we were without power for a little over 48 hours. When I finally got back to my PC, my modem was kaput. In a futile attempt to cheer myself up, I unzipped the Holy Grail demo. It takes up 10 meg, and it isn't even a demo. It's just an ad with a couple of neat animations, and some music. Pfui! <P>

Skip this site altogether if you are not a fan of juvenile humor, heavy on body parts and bathroom functions.  It is rather cleverly designed, but the slow downloads make the humor seem even stupider. At least to me.<P>

So where to go for silliness on the Internet? Is the Web's reputation as a home for nerdy kids based on the available sites? Perhaps.<P>

I stopped by a site called "<a href="http://www.linksahoy.com/be/index.html">The Bard's Entrails</a>." Not much better. Partly because it's still under development, and most links lead nowhere.<P>

<a href="http://www.ieor.berkeley.edu/~andryan/fridge/">The Virtual Refrigerator</a> was a little more to my taste. My actual refrigerator (cleaner than it's ever been since Hurricane F. spoiled all my food and I had to wash it out) is littered with little magnetic words from a <a href="http://www.bitstream.net/poetry/">Magnetic Poetry</a> kit my sister-in-law gave me for Christmas a couple of years ago. Visitors often stop, open-mouthed, to read the absurd, faintly naughty, verses our family has scattered among the other magnetic debris on the metal door. Some of them are even funny<P>

For the times when I need a quick creative pick-me-up, the refrigerator isn't always available or appropriate. That's when Virtual Refrigerator, with a link to the Magnetic Poetry site,  is a godsend.<P>

You can find several versions of the refrigerator poetry kits, including SciFi, Biblical language and Romantic. Each gives you a "word heap," a list of words you can click on to create your opus. If one set of words doesn't have the right one, you can switch around, hopping from kit to kit until you've "written" the perfect poem. If you are satisfied, you can even submit it to be published on the Virtual Refrigerator.<P>

Of course, you can also find out how to buy the actual magnetic sets at the site. Just keep them away from your computer diskettes!<P>

<center><b><font size =6> <BR>Support Network<BR>Growing for Homeworkers</font></center></b>

<font size =3>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>

Working from home, whether as a an employee of a large company or as a self-employed entrepreneur, is a dream more and more Americans share. <P>

Forward-looking companies are making it possible for many people to telecommute. The recent spate of layoffs in other companies' moves toward leanness and meanness euphemistically known as "right-sizing" has propelled others willy-nilly into small offices and home offices. <P>

As the number of people with home offices grows, a network of support also grows. Magazines, Internet home pages, news groups, and books all offer help and encouragement to this new generation of workers.<P>

At first, the freedom of working at home can be almost intoxicating. You don't have to wear that stupid suit anymore - heavens, you don't even have to wash your face or brush your teeth before you log onto the computer. If you're 15 minutes late to work, no supervisor is going to come chugging up, breathing fire. You can work when you like. You can eat when you like. It's like Heaven! <P>

Not so fast. One of the very first things a home office worker learns, whether from sad experience or from one who has traveled the road before, is that the external discipline of a "real" office has to be replaced by your own self-discipline.<P>

Working at home is, for me at least, a joy that outweighs the occasional negatives. I love the silence of the countryside, coffee breaks in my own kitchen, and eating lunch on the porch with my husband. I even like having the Springer spaniel talking in her sleep under my desk.<P>

Everyone who works at home has equivalent pleasures. <P>

In order to earn a living doing what we enjoy in a place we want to be, we also have to learn to identify and avoid the pitfalls. <P>

For me, the hardest thing is to resist garden and household chores. As a deadline looms, many of us, in fact, are overwhelmed by the urge to clean the refrigerator or weed the front walk. It's a well-known problem. Another difficulty is in setting a beginning and an end to the work day. It's hard for some people to leave their work behind at the end of the day and turn their attention to family and friends and community service. It's even harder if the office is just a few steps from the living room.<P>

How do we establish a productive routine? And how do we establish goals and priorities so our home operations thrive and survive? Those are the two primary issues faced by small office and home office (SoHo) workers alike.<P>

That and other questions are addressed by sites like America Online's Home Office Computing Online and, on the Web, <a href="http://www.smalloffice.com">Your Small Office</a>, from the editors of Small Business Computing and Home Office Computing magazines.<P>

Message boards and bulletin boards on each allow home office workers to share tips and problems. An area devoted to keeping the balance between home and work offers ideas on how to be polite, but firm, with your friends and neighbors when they want to drop by and chat, or ask you to do favors for them.<P>

Other sections offer advice and information about computers and software, how to set your rates, how to project a professional image, and how an "intranet" or internal network can allow geographically scattered workers to collaborate on a single project.<P>

There are war stories, amusing anecdotes, and expert help as well as links to government resources for home and small business people.<P>

<a href="http://www.inc.com/">Inc. Online</a> from Inc. Magazine is another extremely useful resource for entrepreneurs and folks trying to operate small businesses. Like the other sites, it has articles and interviews. It also has a nifty area called "<a href="http://www.inc.com/virtualconsult/reference_desk/">The Virtual Consultant</a>," with interactive worksheets, a reference desk with links to Small Business Administration resources, U.S. Chambers of Commerce, banks, and searchable <a href="http://www.inc.com/virtualconsult/databases/">databases</a> including ZIP codes, SIC codes, glossaries of financial and marketing terms and buzzwords.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>National Geographic<BR>Exploits the Web</font></center></b>

<font size =3>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


Online technology can be an end in itself, deeply fascinating to a small section of the population, not so thrilling to the rest of us.<P>

But when online technology is used well, as a vehicle for information or entertainment with broad appeal, we can all see what the fuss is about.<P>

<img src=natgeo.gif width=167 height=69 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

The National Geographic Society, which has made armchair adventurers of many of us since childhood, is using online technology to further enrich our experience.<P>

Whether you're a subscriber, a former subscriber or (is it possible?) have never seen the bright-yellow bordered magazine, you'll enjoy this exploration.<P>

Although it is a bit slow, the online version of the <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/main.wd">National Geographic</a> has nicely adapted to the strengths and weakness of web technology. <P>

In the magazine, large, glorious photographs of exotic places, paintings imaginatively recreating historic scenes, and clearly rendered diagrams and charts are combined with stories and articles written in an easy-to-follow style that hasn't changed for decades.<P>

The Website uses the magazine's tried and true technique of main story plus by-ways the visitor can explore at will.<P>

Currently at the site you can go to modern Mexico City, a Peruvian mountain, or on a whitewater rafting trip in Idaho, among many other places. <P>

The Geographic's online producer Richard Olsenius visited Mexico City in mid-August to collect sights and sounds of everyday life. His <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/ngs/mags/ng_online/ng_aug96/mexico/daily/a008.html">daily dispatches</a> from parks, markets, parties, the 16th century neighborhood of Coyoacan, and ancient ruins at Teotihuacan, gives us Web potatoes a many-dimensional picture of life in this vibrant, teeming city with its deep roots in pre-Colombian culture.<P>

Each day's installment includes text, small photographs you can click on if you want to see a full-size image, and sounds, such as an interview with a guide or marimba music.<P>

In <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/modules/mummy/index.html">Ice Treasures of the Inca</a>, Johan Reinhard recreates his trip to the top of 20,700-foot Mt. Ampato in the Peruvian Andes. There, in 1995, he found the mummified corpse of a young woman sacrificed to the mountain 500 years ago.  <P>

The archaeologist describes the difficult trip up, the discovery of the body (which had been shaken from its original resting place by the eruption of a neighboring volcano), and the hair-raising retrieval involving lashing the 80-pound mummy to his backpack to get it down the mountain and rushing it, by overnight bus, to a research center in Arequipa. <P>

If you want to get through the story quickly, click on the llama icon at the bottom of each page, to go on to the next. If you want more, click on the journal icon, instead, for brief explorations of different themes, such as the religion of the Andean people or the history of the Inca Empire or photographs and more information about objects found at other archaeological sites.<P>

Click the icon of a tape recorder to hear the volcano erupting or the squeak of hiking boots on ash-covered ice;. <P>

Want a change of pace? Take a trip on <a href="http://www.nationalgeographic.com/modules/selway/index.html">the River Wild</a>:whitewater rafting down the Selway River in Idaho. After you tour the site,  you'll be ready to go for real! The trip is divided into eight sections, each with its own theme. <P>

On one, you learn about the various boats used by whitewater rafters, on another you can listen to a RealAudio thrush song, or the drumming of a Ruffed Grouse. A third describes the various classes of rapid, from Class I (smile) through Class III (Yahoo!) to Class VI (silent prayer). You can even study animated illustrations of paddling techniques or the way water rushes over a hidden obstacle. <P>

This is a great use of Web bells and whistles -- beats those blinking lights and flipping pages on other sites by a length and a half!<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Never Say Diet!</font></center></b>



<font size =3>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>

The other day, a character in Rex Morgan, M.D., a newspaper comic strip I read faithfully, announced that she planned to lose 30 pounds. She was surfing the Internet for diet plans. <P>

I was intrigued. For one thing, she was clearly using Dr. Morgan's office computer to surf the 'Net--on company time, yet!<P>

Most women, even those who don't carry that many extra pounds, have a drawerful of diet plans and a bookshelf full of dog-eared paperbacks promising spectacular results from this plan or that.<P>

As a survivor (though perhaps not a victor) of the quest for slimness, I can attest that the problem isn't finding a good plan -- your own common sense can do as well as any fancy program -- the problem is sticking to your project.<P>

Still, I was curious about what Berna, the comfortably-padded comic strip character, would be likely to turn up. I went for a little surfing safari of my own. <P>

As is my habit, I started with a simple search on the Altavista search engine. The words "diet plan" turned up about 600 hits. As you might expect, they range from sensible to strange (though possibly healthy), to scary. Some are actual diets, others are sale pitches for plans and potions. Lots of people are trying to sell you something.<P>

Among the free offerings is <a href="http://www.cs.bc.edu/~satot/diet.html">Tak's Ultimate Diet</a>, which involves vegetable soup and lots of  fruit and vegetables, with occasional binges on bananas or beefsteak or skim milk. Although it sounds fairly rigid and complicated, and is certainly not a diet anyone would care to follow for the rest of their lives, I guess you wouldn't do yourself any damage by trying it. <P>

Though serious dieters might not be amused, the "<a href="http://www.gse.rmit.edu.au/~rsedc/diet.plan.html">Diet Plan for the Gravitationally Challenged</a>" made me giggle, even though I already know that: "If you drink a diet soda with a candy bar, they cancel each other out." Uh-huh. And if you believe that......<P>

There are ads for other diets that sound just as loony, but unfortunately the promoters are serious. There's the one-day-on, one-day-off diet with 20 pills a day, or the growth hormone releasers that supposedly turn fat into muscle while you sleep. Strange. I though fat cells and muscle cells were distinct, and that turning one into the other was like turning straw into gold. <P>

Although I've been eating all my life, I'm not a trained nutritionist. Still, I think that any diet that goes against the common sense advice to eat a variety of wholesome food in moderate amounts and exercise regularly, is suspect if not dangerous. Pills, particularly those that make claims of incredible efficacy, could cause problems and will waste money. <P>

I was beginning to get discouraged. Poor fictional Berna. <P>

Then I came across something actually useful: <a href="http://www.ionet.net/~kchurch/asd/asd-faq.html">alt.support.diet Freqently Asked Questions (FAQ) List</a>. It's a World Wide Web site for the alt.support.diet newsgroup. Although it's not a scholarly or professional endeavor, it is full of good information about how to tell if you are overweight, the meaning of a low fat diet, and many other questions a dieter faces. There's information on what exercises to choose, how various commercial diet plans work, and much more. Go there, Berna. They even have a link to <a href="http://www.weight-watchers.com">Weight Watchers</a>, if you can't do it on your own (or if you have an urge to spend money).<P>

In addition, the FAQ has several useful links to other Web sites, including the free Web-based <a href="http://www.ag.uiuc.edu/~food-lab/nat/">Nutrition Analysis Tool</a> from the University of Illinois. You enter information about yourself, check the nutrients you want to track, then enter different kinds of food into your personal database.<P>

I got frustrated when I was only partway through my day's report -- the program is kind of slow --  so I went ahead and clicked analyze. The results astonished me until I realized I'd confused it somewhere. It thought I was an infant under 6 months, though I'd clearly told it I was a female between the ages of 25 and 50!  This tool could be very useful if you need to watch your diet, but don't be surprised to discover you've used 171 percent of you recommended calories by lunch time -- make sure it's talking about you before you have a fit!<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Won't You Please <BR>Come to Chicago</font></center></b>

<font size =3>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>

There was a time when Americans paid attention to national political conventions. Perhaps, if you were deeply partisan, you'd only follow your own party's convention, but you'd keep up with the news.<P>

<img src=1884.jpeg width=246 height=307 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

Things have changed. Perhaps it's because the platform and nominees have already been decided and discussed to death. Who is going to sit up and watch speeches, if the only suspense is whether the speaker will flub his or her lines?<P>

The Republican version in San Diego was so carefully rehearsed and stage-managed, it seemed strictly for entertainment. The Democratic convention may not be any more substantial, except technologically.<P>

My own reaction is a plaintive "Whatever." Is there any redemption?<P>

<a href="http://www.chicago96.org/">Chicago 96</a>: An American Celebration, is a non-partisan Web site, developed by Chicago-based Ameritech to promote Chicago (and hype the Democratic convention). It's a delightful melange of history, politics and chamber of commerce boosterism, offering entertainment combined with painless voter education and politicana  (Did I make that word up, Mr. Safire?) -- Politics + arcana with a nod to Americana -- Even before the convention opened, there was plenty at the site for everyone, even those who aren't thrilled by politics, per se.<P>

Quiz yourself on your knowledge of politics, the US Constitution or Chicago. The Chicago quiz has links to other  Web pages, including the city's <a href="http://www.msichicago.org/">Mueum of Science and Industry</a>.<P>

Since 1860, Chicago has hosted 24 conventions, 14 Republican including the one in 1860 when Abraham Lincoln defeated Hannibal Hamlin for his party's nomination. Ten were Democratic, including the controversial one in 1968.<P>

There are summaries of the convention platforms held in Chicago since 1860. Photographs and campaign memorabilia from the Chicago Historical Society's exhibit "Parades, Protests, Politics: Chicago's Political Conventions," include everything from a wooden axe used in a parade in support of Lincoln to news photographs of military police in 1968. It's fascinating.<P>

Listen to campaign songs and speeches in a choice of audio formats.<P>

Songs include Breckinridge & Lane (1860), There are no Flies on Harrison (1888), The Silver Lion Came Tearin' Out of the Wilderness (1896), We're Madly for Adlai (1952), and Here Comes Nixon (1960). Campaign songs aren't art, but what do you expect?<P>

Speeches, on the other hand, once were an art form. Successful speeches were repeated by the orator long after the event; even memorized by school children. Examples here include a 1923 recording of William Jennings Bryan "performing" his famous Cross of Gold speech (originally made at the 1896 Democratic convention) and two versions of Theodore Roosevelt's 1912 Bull Moose speech. You can also hear John F. Kennedy nominating Adlai Stevenson in 1956 and a re-creation of the 1920 "smoke filled room" convention which nominated Warren G. Harding.<P>

The pictures, songs and speeches, games and quizzes clips are enough reason to visit this site, even before the 1996 Democratic Convention opens next week, but don't forget the main attraction.<P>

Visitors to the site will get up to the minute convention news, which one would expect. The extent to which the convention will be "wired" though, is ambitious, and if it works, impressive. According to a Chicago Sun Times <a href="http://www.suntimes.com/dem96/current/TECH_Aug21.html">article</a> at the site, "The plans include first-ever Internet access from a convention floor, capacity for 20,000 mobile phones, and pagers inside and around the United Center..."<P>

About those pagers: you'll be able to click on an image of a pager on the Chicago96 web page to send an alphanumeric (words and numbers to you and me) page to your delegate. Whether the delegates answer or even read their pages is another matter.<P>

This is one of the most entertaining political Web sites around, IMHO (in my humble (yeah, right) opinion).  <P>

If all the sights and sounds on the page aren't enough for a true political aficionado, it also has links to a couple of other amusing sites, including <a href="http://www.iguide.com/pol_govt/cyberpol/cgi-bin/bite.pl">Name that  Bite</a> where you match the statement to the speaker -- don't be so sure you can do it.<P>

<a href="http://www.cbsnews.com/camp96/Phoebe/phoebe_home1a.htm">Phoebe for President</a>, a site created by CBS to interest the teenage crowd in the campaign of a fictional 15-year old, contains snippets of useful information with a heavy sugar coating.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Even Farmers Are Plowing<BR>Onto the Net</font></center></b>

<font size =3>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>

Farming. It's one of the world's oldest occupations, and one that touches everyone in some way or other, even the most city-bound. <P>

Where we live in the James River Valley of Virginia, farms are everywhere, in various stages of economic health. The scrubby woods around our house are ridged with corn rows, evidence that they were once open fields. Nearby, abandoned fields are pocked with thistles and small cedar trees, or sprouting huge shopping malls.<P>

But it's not all disappearing. When I drive into town I pass thriving soybean, corn and hayfields, pastures with well-tended cattle and horses. Sometimes traffic is slowed by dusty folks in hats driving tractors towing wagons piled high with hay, or beaten-up trucks with hand lettered signs reading Farm Vehicle in place of a license plate. They don't get much rest at this time of year.<P>

If you don't know a lot of farmers, you might assume that these hardworking folks, who rise before dawn and work hard until well after dark, would be the last to look to the Internet for advice, information, or a medium for doing business.<P>

You'd be wrong. Of course the farmer still looks at the sky and sniffs the wind before deciding to cut the hayfield, but the same farmer is likely to check Internet weather forecasts and study online satellite photographs. <P>

When the hay is ready for market, the farmer can advertise it, free, on the <a href="http://www.iol.ie/~jrd/hay">Internet Hay Exchange</a>, or check the <a href="http://www.morgan-research.com/forages/hay/pricewkly/index.html">Weekly Hay Price Summary</a> from Kansas-based Morgan Research. If the hay crop is too big for the barn, <a href="http://www.morgan-research.com/beefit/index.html">Beefit Blankets</a>, those big white plastic bale covers, are available for sale online.<P>

Well-known farming magazines, like <a href="http://www.farmjournal.com/">Farm Journal </a> and <a href="http://pathfinder.com/PF/today/">Progressive Farmer Today</a> have a presence on the World Wide Web, because they know their readers will find them there. The same cozy, chatty exchange of information that earlier in the century flowed over the radio waves to farmers everywhere, has established a foothold on the Internet.<P>

In order to remain competitive, farmers have embraced new technologies, including computers and the Internet, to keep their books, track long-range plans, and research markets and new developments in agriculture. Farming, even on a small scale, requires a degree of sophistication that might surprise non-farmers.<P>

Progressive Farmer Today, a daily report from Progressive Farmer Online, brings news of commodities markets, developments of interest to rural Americans, and business and legislative updates. It has a special section on the Farm Bill, a Drought Report, and a link to the Weather Channel Online for local weather information. Farmers can join live online chats with representatives of major seed companies, beginning September 9th at the site.<P>

Farmer's Journal Today also has daily news and weather reports and links for farmers. Features include Beef Today, Hogs Today, and Dairy Today, and pieces about debt and farm safety, matters close to the hearts of farmers. From the site, you can read archived articles, visit the main site of Farmer's Journal Online, and get together with others in the agriculture industry though online chats and discussions.<P>

Another useful site is the <a href="http://www.fb.com/">American Farm Bureau's "Voice of Agriculture"</a> with news, information about the Farm Bureau, and links to web sites of state Farm Bureau affiliates.<P>

<a href="http://www.ffa.org/">Future Farmers of America</a>, for young people exploring careers in farming and agriculture, has educational material, news, project suggestions and advice, and of course, sweatshirts and T-shirts with FFA logos for sale.<P>

In addition to US and Canadian news, weather and market updates, Successful Farming's <a href="http://www.agriculture.com/">@griculture Online</a> site offers business and agricultural technology. At the site, you can take a free tour of <a href="http://www.agriculture.com/tour/technology/index.html">@g/Innovator Online Tour</a>, a site that calls itself "the premier authoritative resource for ag information technologies, including ag computing and site-specific precision farming."<P>

Many farmers will find the University of California's <a href="http://www.sarep.ucdavis.edu/">Sustainable Research and Education Project</a> site fascinating. Sustainable agriculture is a farming method focused on "environmental health, economic profitability, and social and economic equity." The fully searchable site has information about financial and educational resources and conferences.

<center><b><font size =6>Back to School <BR>(And Onto the Net)</font></center></b>

<font size =3>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>

The calendar may say that the year begins in January, but we all know it begins with the start of school.<P>

Even before the first nip of fall is in the air, high school kids are laying aside their burger flippers, kissing their summer loves good-bye, praying for a few nice days before the pool closes, and wondering if their well-rested brain cells will function in math class or English or, worse and worse, science.<P>



Teachers are bracing themselves for the first few weeks while their students regain their mental acuity.<P>

College students have packed up their trunks for another challenging, exciting (one hopes) year in the halls of academe.<P>

Parents, even the most office-bound, find the end of summer sharpens the senses and focuses the mind.<P>

Going back to school also means using the Internet for more than simple entertainment.<P>

How, you ask, can a student spend valuable time in front of a computer screen, surfing the 'Net?<P>

Isn't it better if kids confine their computer activities to word processing, and stick to the library for research?<P>

<img src=Dickens.jpeg width=189 height=293 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

No. Not entirely, though my son might argue with me. Last year, one of his friends, a bright, computer-literate high school junior, tried to use the Internet to research a paper on Charles Dickens. The young man was discouraged and disappointed. Although there was no shortage of material, he complained that very little was useful. <P>

My recent AltaVista search on "<a href="http://www.helsinki.fi/kasv/nokol/dickens.html">Charles Dickens</a>" (use the quotation marks if you try this) turned up 3000 hits. True, most of it was junk -- or bookstores. <P>

So what if all the great man's novels are on-line and interactive? They're easier to carry around in the Penguin paperback version, anyway. <P>

But even on the first page of the AltaVista search results, I found a page (from Helsinki, Finland) titled "Charles Dickens" with some stuff I could have used if I were working on a Dickens paper. Another site I turned up is the University of California's <a href="http://hum.ucsc.edu/dickens/index.html">Dickens Project</a>, a terrific site, packed with info. <P>

As an indifferent typist, I find the best thing about researching on the 'Net is that if you find something you want to quote, you don't have to retype it, just copy and paste it into your paper (with proper citations, of course!)<P>

A school or university librarian is still a better resource, when starting a research project, than a faceless search engine like AltaVista. An Internet-savvy librarian is the best of all. <P>

High school kids may not realize it, but generations of  their peers have reported on Dickens. Any good high school library will have lots of books about him. The Internet can enrich and broaden research, but without a guide, you could end up flailing around in a surfeit of raw information.<P>

In addition to lit crit, there's help with math, science and history homework on the 'Net. <P>

<a href="http://forum.swarthmore.edu/dr.math/">Ask Dr. Math</a> offers online homework help for elementary through college level math students. The student posts a question and one of the math doctors (Swarthmore College math students) posts a response. The doctors don't give answers, but they jog the young mathematician's brain so he or she can figure it out. It's like calling the teacher at home, only not as scary.<P>

The <a href="http://medinfo.wustl.edu/~ysp/MSN/">Mad Scientists Network</a> at Washington University in St. Louis, is a similar science resource. Students seeking help or advice with science questions and projects post questions, and the appropriate scientist offers a response. More than <a href="http://medinfo.wustl.edu/~ysp/MSN/MAD.scilist.html">200</a> scientists from around the world, in fields from Anatomy to Zoology, are in the network.<P>

<a href="http://www.hyperhistory.com">HyperHistory Online</a> is a bookmark all history students and teachers ought to have in their web browser. HyperHistory Online consists of "<a href="http://www.hyperhistory.com/chart/synchro.html">synchronoptic</a>" maps, and time lines of people and events. You can see at once what was happening during a period in history around the Globe. (E.G.: Why should we refer to a time period as "The Dark Ages" when Chinese civilization was actually flowering?) This one's a keeper.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Cyberlaw Is Still Evolving</font></center></b><P>

<font size =3>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>




Unhindered by local or national boundaries, defined by chaos, the 'Net sometimes seems a little frightening -- especially for those doing business in cyberspace.<P>

Naturally there are questions: Who has jurisdiction over international commerce conducted over the Web? Where does a victim of fraud or harassment go for recourse? What about privacy? How can you protect intellectual property or copyrighted material? How about your domain name? <P>

At present, there are few clear answers. <P>

According to the August 15 edition of Educom's e-mail news summary, <a href="http://www.educom.edu/">Edupage</a>, "Network Solutions Inc., which hands out domain names under an agreement with the U.S. National Science Foundation, said it would shut down a site within 90 days if someone holding a registered trademark to the site's name makes a challenge." <P>

Yahoo has a whole section on <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/Computers_and_Internet/Internet/Domain_Registration/Domain_Name_Controversies/">domain name controversies</a>, for anyone who is interested. <a href="http://www.muchmusic.com/muchmusic/cyberfax/trademark.html">Trademark Wars On The Web</a> is a site developed to "document what may be an increasing trend toward the use and abuse of intellectual property law as a form of online censorship."<P>

Internet service providers can bump users who misuse the Information Super Highway, but how can an ISP police all its users? Criminals who use computer bulletin boards to disseminate child pornography, for example, have been caught and prosecuted by the FBI, but on the whole, the law of the Internet is still evolving.<P>

<img src=cybercop.gif width=169 height=168 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

In the meantime, consumer watchdog groups like ICAN (Internet Consumer Action Network) have sprung up to provide a forum for complaints and discussion of questionable practices on the Internet. Visit ICAN's site, the <a href="http://www.ucan.org/">CyberCop Precinct House</a> (Keeping Cyberspace Safe for Consumers), to learn about complaints that have been made or make a complaint yourself. Three lawyers, three support staffers and a team of "retained experts" provide advocacy in areas including fraud, deceptive advertising, pyramid schemes, breach of contract, violation of state or federal law, junk email, harassment, and children's issues. You can also pick up tips for surfing the 'Net safely, and find out about proposed laws governing cyberspace. <P>

If you go nowhere else on the CyberCop site, you should at least check out the <a href="http://www.ucan.org/neighbor.htm">Neighborhood Watch</a> area. Their "Ten Tips for Preventing Information Highway-Robbery" is a must-read for anyone contemplating doing business on the Internet.  <P>

"How Much do they Know About You" is an eye-opener for anyone who imagines that netsurfing is an anonymous activity. It links you to the Center for Democracy and Technology's <a href="http://www.cdt.org./privacy/">Privacy Issues and Demo Site</a>, which answers the question "Who's watching you and what are you telling them?"<P>

Another interesting site dealing with the issues of law in cyberspace is <a href="http://vmag.law.vill.edu:8080/">Virtual Magistrate</a> from the Villanova Center for Information Law and Policy. It's "a specialized, on-line arbitration and fact-finding system for disputes involving: Users of on-line systems; Those who claim to be harmed by wrongful messages; and System operators (to the extent that complaints or demands for remedies are directed at the System Operator)." <P>

Although it may seem a bit dry and technical, it is notable for its seriousness. It may well be the first glimpse of the future of cyberspace dispute resolution. There are forms for submitting disputes for resolutions, via the web or email, and an online discussion area. The <a href="http://vmag.law.vill.edu:8080/home/">eight Virtual Magistrates</a> include law professors and attorneys in private practice from California, New York, Texas, New Hampshire, Arkansas, Washington, DC., and Massachusetts.<P>

Another place to go for help with an Internet dispute is the <a href="http://www.ombuds.org">Online Ombuds Office</a>, currently still being developed. Directed by two law professors at the University of Massachusetts at Amherst, Ethan Katsh (who's also one of the Virtual Magistrates) and Janet Rifkin, the OOO provides information for those who want to help themselves, an online discussion site, and ombudspersons to help with individual cases. Currently they do not intend to charge for the services at this site.<P>

A tour of these sites provides a fascinating sampling of the varied ways people try to inject some order and accountability into the burgeoning Internet.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>This Trip Was Better in Print</font></center></b><P>

<font size =3>

<center>by Robin Lind</center>


<P>

Sometimes we see breakthrough technology on the Web and sometimes... well, sometimes we don't. <P>

<img src=sto.gif width=210 height=281 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

A case in point is the republication this month of "<a href="http://www.startribune.com/stonline/html/userguide/newspaperland/">A Trip through Newspaperland</a>" by the Star Tribune in Minneapolis, Minnesota. It is a charming and evocative portrait of middle America from almost a half century ago that is a treat to read. <P>

In its original form "Trip" was a 12-page comic book, printed in full color on newsprint. It was published in the July 3, 1949 Sunday edition and apparently also distributed at the State Fair and to visitors touring the new Star and Tribune building. <P>

There's something here for everyone. <P>

A description of newspapering from initial report to editing to typesetting to printing to home delivery includes an <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stonline/html/userguide/newspaperland/npl.39.html">explanation</a> of color printing that's still accurate.<P>

This was still very much a man's world where women appear as elevator operators, secretaries, waitresses and (<a href="http://www.startribune.com/stonline/html/userguide/newspaperland/npl.18.html">in the newsroom</a>) travel and food columnists. Gender inclusive language? Sorry, Mabel, back then they still had the rewrite "man" and copy editors called out "<a href="http://www.startribune.com/stonline/html/userguide/newspaperland/npl.13.html">B-o-o-y!</a>" when he wanted to have stories run from the city desk to the news editor. (The <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stonline/html/userguide/newspaperland/npl.61.html">only girl</a> in the story appears with a matronly-looking chaperone in a story about the Tribune Spelling Bee.)<P>

<img src=cedric.gif width=210 height=281 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

The story involves two young boys named Steve and Tom who are taken on a tour of the building by Columnist Cedric Adams, an avuncular polymath with nothing better to do than devote his time to visiting boys. At the end of the story both are hoping for careers as "carrier-salesmen." Good old Uncle Cedric doesn't leave 'em there though. Being an experienced campaigner, he knows that boys, like armies, travel on their stomachs and so he ends the tour with "And this is the cafeteria, boys. <a href="http://www.startribune.com/stonline/html/userguide/newspaperland/npl.68.html">Let's eat!"</a><P>

It's a grand tour and, in between offices and departments, the promotion department has sprinkled in those wonderful old-fashioned fun facts to know and tell. <P>

<B>E.G.:</B>

<UL>
<li>more than 650,000 words a day come over the teletypes -- enough to make 5,840 novels a year!<BR>
<li>42 linotype machines are in operation -- in one 8-hour period they can set all 270,000 words in the English language!<BR>
<li>35,000 lbs of ink are used each week and "if a week's supply of ink were turned into milk there would be enough to supply you with a quart a day for 55 years!"<P>
</UL>
Is that great or what?<P>

Of course it's great. It was even greater then when the story was told in a medium appropriate for its message. A 12-page comic book with 74 panels could be read and absorbed in less than five minutes by the slowest of readers. It cost less than a penny and could thus be widely distributed. It created immense goodwill for the newspaper and was doubtless worth the investment.<P>

The new version? You have to give credit to the Star Tribune for resurrecting "Trip" and special kudos to summer intern Kevyn Jacobs who worked with two surviving yellowed-copies to scan the individual panels into digital form and put them up on the Web. But from a technology standpoint you have to say that "Trip" exemplifies the worst hurdles that we face at this stage of Web technology.<P>

The individual panels range in size from about 50k to 150k; they take anywhere from 30 seconds to several minutes to download using a 28.8 bps modem. My visit consumed more than 5.2 MB of memory to store the images on disk and took more than two hours -- probably more time than Steve and Tom devoted to it.<P>

This is the sublime example of computers and the Web going head to head with existing technology and failing the test. "Trip" would be a whole lot better if it were printed on newsprint, distributed to "carrier-salesmen" and delivered to our doorsteps in the Sunday paper. (For an example of appropriate Web technology see the <a href="http://www.startribune.com/">Star Tribune Online</a> with a full menu of news, sports, opinion and a superb collection of other Special Projects.)<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Web Sites Celebate Frugality</font></center></b>

<font size =3>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>

Have you ever rinsed out a plastic bread bag and reused it? Or taken grocery bags back to the store to be recycled? Do you use tuna fish tins as muffin molds or soft drink bottles as flower vases? Do you have a little pile of rubber bands from bunches of broccoli in your silverware drawer? Do you buy expensive perfume, but cheap bubble bath? <P>

<img src=sislogo.gif width=280 height=139 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

Do you consider yourself frugal? Perhaps even a tightwad?<P>

Whether you're trying to make a dollar go as far as it can or are just mindful of natural resources, you're not alone. Most of us think hard before we pull out our wallets. <P>

Some of us enjoy buying good stuff cheap; some of us have no choice. But there is sacrifice and then there is sacrifice -- a careful shopper can live quite well on a fraction of the money needed by a spendthrift. <P>

For example, does your dog or cat really need that special beef or fish flavored bottled drinking water? Won't tap water do? <P>

How about shaving gel? Does a woman really need to spend 15% more for pink gel with a flowery smell or would the cheaper lime-scented green stuff the same folks make for men be just as good?<P>



These are questions taken up at the <a href="http://www.sis.org">SHOP! Information Services</a> site ("...the web's only ad-free, hype-free consumer news service for women!"). In addition to the monthly online SIS magazine, the site has an archive of earlier issues and an online consumer helpline. SIS's August/September issue takes on GM and anti-lock brakes and <a href="http://www.sis.org/docs/sweatshop.html">interviews</a> labor activist Charles Kernaghan, "the man who made Kathie Lee Gifford cry." Anyone who wants to shop responsibly ought to read the interview, which details steps taken and not taken by major clothing manufacturers and retailers. <P>

<img src=thirsty.gif width=150 height=203 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

In the SIS "Product Spotlight" for August is Thirsty Dog and Thirsty Cat gourmet bottled water. (You thought I was joking, didn't you?) The lightly carbonated "tangy fish" or "crispy beef" (crispy?!) flavored water was turned down by the reporter's pets, and gets double billing on the site as "Miss August," the Disturbing Product of the Month.<P>

In an article on "marketing markups based on gender," the author writes that she shaved one leg using Skintimate Shaving Gel (pink, floral) and the other with Edge Shaving Gel (green, lime) both from S.C. Johnson & Son, Inc., and found no difference, though the latter cost 51 cents less for the same amount. <P>

The company spokesperson's explanation seemed a little flimsy.<P>

<a href="http://www.sis.org/docs/econuseless.html">Econ-O-Rama</a> is an entertaining section where folks nominate products they consider useless. I personally disagree with some of the suggestions, which include toast tongs, "Chip Clips," and nail polish (may be useless, but so are a lot of other fun things), but go see what you think.<P>

Frugal folks will probably share my admiration for Amy Dacyczyn's Tightwad Gazette. <a href="http://users.aol.com/maryfou/tightwad.html">The Unofficial Tightwad Gazette Fan Club Home Page</a> has tips, links to web sites dedicated to frugal living and a series of frugal success stories from readers. Unfortunately it also contains the news that the Tightwad Gazette will cease publication by the end of the year. On the bright side, there are two TG books in print, and a third in the works.<P>

Another site to visit is the <a href="http://www.best.com/~piner/frugal.html">Frugal Corner</a>. It has links to web resources for people who want to live more simply. There are sites devoted to sustainable gardening, living lightly, using less stuff, canning, solar cooking, and more. There are also a mailing lists and news groups you can join if you're interested.<P>

If you think all this is a little naive and unsophisticated, take a spin around the <a href="http://www.adbusters.org/adbusters/main.html">AdBuster's</a> site to see some of the troublesome images used to keep us all in a thoughtless frenzy of consumption. <P>

Buy that expensive perfume, if you really love it. Shell out for the sporty new car, if that's what you really want. Just be sure it IS what you really want.<P>

<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Weekend Warriors<BR>Can Rely on Web </font></center></b><P>

<font size =3>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>

You're hard at work. Suddenly a little voice says: 'Mommy, I'm bored.' Or: 'Daddy, when can we go pool?'<P>

You cringe. The proposal is due Monday. The client has been breathing down your neck, and he wants action on his project. All you need is one more hour. But if you can't keep the kids quiet right now, you're sunk.<P>

They've been playing nicely all morning at your office, but it is Saturday. The office supplies cabinet gets old soon -- there are only so many things to do with yellow, pink, green and blue highlighters, and those PostIt tape flags are really expensive. Besides, you're beginning to hear that slight edge to your descendants' voices, prophesying war.<P>

Help.<P>

Jump onto the World Wide Web. You'll find lots of entertaining games that you can quickly print out for your child.<P>

 Fifty-year old Highlights for Children has teamed up with America Online to produce Highlights Online. You'll find it on AOL under For Kids Only. You'll recognize it if you've ever seen the paper version. Download some word games or Hidden Pictures to entertain them or choose rebuses, stories, the Timbertoes, or the quaint adventures of  the brothers Goofus and Gallant. <P>

A section called "Boredom Busters" has projects that come right out of my own childhood. If you have the materials, let them make a pretend camera out of an empty juice box, the top of a toothpaste tube, a piece of toilet paper roll, some tape and some aluminum foil. Or how about a barometer out of a pickle jar, an orange juice carton, a piece of a balloon, a drinking straw an index card a pencil and some glue.<P>

<a href="http://www.energy.ca.gov/energy/education/eduhome.html">Energy Quest</a> from the California Energy Commission is a surprisingly entertaining secret weapon if your resources are limited to a computer with an Internet connection and a printer in an otherwise child-unfriendly office. The opening page looks like a board game, and you can click on various icons for games, information and education. Under puzzles, you'll find word scrambles, word searches, self-tests, and coloring books you can print out, a page at time and toss to the kids.<P>

If you can share the computer, so much the better. Energy Quest has a page of truly fascinating <a href="http://www.energy.ca.gov/energy/education/links/links-html/links.html">links to other educational sites</a> on the Web, beginning with the <a href="http://www.bhm.tis.net/zoo/">Birmingham Zoo</a> which has, among other things, the <a href="http://www.bhm.tis.net/zoo/ao/">Animal Omnibus</a>, a terrific source of images and information gathered from all over the Internet.<P>

Even very young children can have fun on the World Wide Web. (You have to keep an eye on them, though, to keep Cheerios out of the keyboard and peanut butter off the screen.)<P>

Warner Brother's Kids Page is charming. <a href="http://www.kids.warnerbros.com/Karaoke">The Karaoke link</a> took me right back to preschool with Miss Somebody at the piano picking out She'll Be Coming 'Round the Mountain or The Mexican Hat Dance while we all sang (or was that yelled?) at the tops of our lungs. Here you'll find a RealAudio version of "The Mexican Cat Dance" featuring (Andele! Andele! Ay, caramba!) Speedy Gonzalez and Senor Kitty. There's also "Zooming 'Round the Mountain" with Wiley and Beep Beep and Foghorn Leghorn with the "Henhouse Ladies." The words are printed on pages illustrated with Looney Tunes characters, so you can sing along.<P>

<a href="http://www.maui.com/~twright/animals2/grandad.html">Grandad's Animal Book</a>, created by Thomas Wright of Maui, at first seems to be only for little children, but it has hidden depths. It's a series of illustrated poems about animals whose names begin with the letters of the alphabet. The illustrations are cute. The poetry isn't quite up to Edward Lear or Ogden Nash. But the charm is in the hyperlinks on each page. Grandad Wright has found unusual and delightful animal links. Click on the word "fish" to go to Ed Robinson's <a href="http://www.maui.net/~robinson/">Maui scuba diving page</a> with pictures of rays, trumpetfish, sharks and even a harpist playing underwater. There are two <a href="http://www.vni.net/~kwelch/penguins/">penguin sites</a> you can reach from the P page. I could have stayed for hours.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>PhotoBubbles Gives<BR>Web New Dimension</font></center></b><P>

<font size =3>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>

Has your computer screen seemed flat recently? Are you looking for added dimensions to your Web surfing? There's a vast array of software plug-ins and other fascinating programs to soup up your adventure, but many seem to require an advanced degree in computer engineering to install and run.<P>

Every now and then, though, something comes along that is worth the trouble, either because it is so wonderful, or because it isn't that much trouble. PhotoBubbles from <a href="http://www.omniview.com/">OmniView</a> is an example. Recently I started noticing it at Web sites I visited. First I noticed it at the New York Times, then on the Discovery Channel site. It looked interesting, so I downloaded it. It is fairly wonderful and not much trouble at all.<P>

PhotoBubbles uses technology like that used in the OmniMax theaters at science museums around the country.  (Although I searched with several of my favorite online search engines, I couldn't find any science museums using PhotoBubbles on their Web sites. I'm sure they do, though, or will soon. It's a natural.)<P>

The photographer takes two fish-eye photographs of a scene, facing in opposite directions. Then the two images are spliced together so the viewer gets the feeling of being inside the scene. Using your mouse you move around, looking up, down, or behind you. (It can make you dizzy if you go too fast -- maybe virtual roller coasters will be next.)<P>

The software is easy to download and install, at least compared to several other packages I've attempted recently. It's available for either Windows or Macintosh, which is also a plus -- many applications work (or don't work) on only one or the other. It took about 20 minutes to download on a "slow pipe" day (when the Internet's arteries seemed clogged). The images generally only take two or three minutes.<P>

The instructions are noteworthy -- perhaps PhotoBubbles is easy to use because its documentation is so clear. And it isn't a memory hog, though you really ought to have 16 megs of RAM to run it smoothly.<P>

The New York Times is using the technology for their <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/specials/gallery/index.html">Gallery in the Round</a> where recent shows focused on life in New York City and the 1996 Summer Games. The New York photos include scenes in a subway and a coffee shop, the view from the stands at Yankee Stadium, and paramedics in an EMS vehicle responding to a call. Pictures from Atlanta include the Stone Mountain Velodrome, the pool, a scene shot at Opening Night, and others. <P>

Gallery visitors are invited to <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/comment/thread.cgi/message/43/3">comment</a> on the pictures and most of the responses posted in the Forum are positive, even enthusiastic.<P>

<a href="http://www.toyota.com/bubbles/index.html">Toyota</a> is using PhotoBubbles on their Web page to show off their new cars.  You can look 'em over inside and out without even talking to a salesman. <P>

The technology isn't limited to photography, either. There's the <a href="http://www.discovery.com/DCO/doc/1012/world/specials/titanic/titanic1.7.html">Virtual Titanic</a>: an electronic model you can visit at the Discovery Channel home page, where it is part of the <a href="http://www.cyberflix.com/titanic.html">Titanic Live Online</a> special exhibit. Using the BubbleViewer, you can tour a first-class cabin, the Turkish Bath, the Grand Staircase and the Smoking Room. There are also movies to download and various "flat" images you can look at.<P>

If you visit the OmniView Website, there are several <a href="http://www.omniview.com/destinations/destinations.html">images</a> to download, including a dramatic 360-degree image of Westminster Abbey. You can look up at the soaring, Gothic ceiling, or down at the kneeler cushion embroidered with red and white roses and the stone in the floor laid in memory of Edward VI.<P>

Although Westminster Abbey image puts the software through its paces, it also spotlights its flaws. You can zoom in and out, but unfortunately there is only one level of zoom at which the pictures are clear. If you try to look more closely at a detail, it quickly deteriorates into colored fragments, or pixels. Perhaps there's nothing to be done, but I don't think they should encourage you to think you can do something you really can't.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Web Reveals <BR>Tenement's Secrets</font></center></b><P>

<font size =3>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>
Several years ago, when I worked in a downtown office high-rise, I made friends with a very interesting fellow. <P>

The company I worked for had medicine cabinets on each floor. For headaches, indigestion, cramps, paper cuts, dizziness you'd find aspirin and its colleagues, bandages, pink tablets, aromatic ammonia, and so on. My new friend was in charge of checking and refilling the cabinets.<P>

He had the gift of telling tales and once he told me a story. <P>

His family had lived in a tenement building in the Lower East Side of Manhattan, he said. One day his mother and his aunt were given a job by the lady next door. They were young teenagers at the time, and eager to make a little money. The neighbor offered to pay them to kill and clean a chicken she'd just bought. They'd never done anything like that before but they didn't want to admit it. The lady left for work, and they were alone with the bird. It didn't cooperate. The girls did their best, and when she returned, her apartment was in a mess, blood everywhere, but the bird was ready for the oven.<P>

The intrepid sisters seemed too merry and adventurous to have lived in the gloomy, Dickensian place I had imagined tenements to be.<P>

Soon afterward I was saddened to learn that my friend had died. He was a good storyteller, and he'd experienced a part of American history that I knew very little about. I know more about New York City tenements now because of him. <P>

<img src=tm1915.gif width=121 height=304 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

A few years ago, I heard about the Tenement Museum at 97 Orchard St. in Manhattan. The five story building, built in the 1864, had been abandoned and boarded up in 1935. It sat undisturbed until 1987, like a time capsule of a nearly forgotten way of life. <P>

Since it was unsealed, it has been studied and in 1994 opened as a museum with two fully restored apartments. It is a National Historic Site. <P>

Life was hard for the more than 10,000 people who lived in this building between 1870 and 1915, but it wasn't a story out of Dickens. A few of the original occupants and their descendants still live nearby, and others have returned to tell their stories and add their memories to the growing treasury at the museum.<P>

I'm not likely to go to New York any time soon, so I was delighted the other day to discover that the <a href="http://www.wnet.org/tenement/">Tenement Museum</a> has a web page.<P>

Because the building was closed and boarded up so efficiently, urban archaeologists found wonderful artifacts under floorboards and stuffed in mailboxes. It helped them reconstruct the histories and gain insight into the lives of families like the Gottbergs, the Langolors, John and Caroline Schneider who ran the saloon in the basement, the Rubinskys, the Bergs, and the Chereskas and their four boarders, and the Barnonovitches. <P>

At the Website, you can visit the <a href="http://www.wnet.org/tenement/logcabin.html">Urban Log Cabin</a> and see doll-house dioramas showing scenes of everyday life in 1870 and 1915, with short descriptions based on memories of surviving relatives: a visit from the doctor to the Glockners' baby; the Confinos and the Rogarshevskys each celebrating a Passover Seder according to their different traditions (the former Sephardic and the latter Ashkenazic); Norman Gottberg, a lace dealer; and the Shafer family starting the day's chores.<P>

Under the heading <a href="http://www.wnet.org:80/tenement/floorboards.html">Excavation</a>, you can click on wallpaper, revealing, one after another, 13 different layers.<P>

An area of wooden floorboards actually conceals pictures of 10 items found in the building. Click on a floorboard for a Ouija Board, a silver fork, an uncashed check for $10, or a baby's kid leather bootie. There's even a tin of AKEND for Headaches "compounded from a prescription in general use by the medical profession here and abroad." I wonder if it was dropped by one of my friend's ancestors.<P>

Under <a href="http://www.wnet.org:80/tenement/eagle.html">History</a> are Arnold Eagle's photographs of New York tenement life in the 1930s and '40s, and a fascinating essay, The Tenement As History And Housing, by Ruth Limmer and Andrew S. Dolkart<P>

It's a wonderful Website, and I hope that it will continue to develop as the museum grows and prospers.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>PointCast's Not Ready<BR>Not Yet</font></center></b><P>

<font size =4>






<center>by Kitty Williams</center>

I thought I'd finally found the perfect online news service when I stumbled across <a href="http://www.pointcast.com">PointCast</a> Network, the other day. <P>

<img src=pcnatnews2.gif width=307 height=185 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

I was star struck. My previous faves, <a href="http://crayon.net">CRAYON</a> and <a href="http://www.my.yahoo.com">My Yahoo</a>, looked piddly in comparison to PointCast Network News. I couldn't wait to download the software. I needed 10 megs of free hard drive space and a Pentium PC. No problem. Got that. <P>

It didn't take long to download over my 28.8 modem. <P>

It looks so good, too. PCN lets you select specific sports and summer Olympic Games events. You can review <a href="http://pathfinder.com/@@uKcmXwcAuwFbrt3Z/time/daily/">TIME</a> and People Daily magazines, the lottery, weather maps and forecasts, your horoscope, current national, international, business and industry news.<P>

It's all presented in this neat-o "SmartScreen:" animated advertisements, a list of headlines, with tabs to change subcategories, from National, to World, to Politics, to Business, and buttons up the side to change sections from News to Weather to whatever.<P>

In some sections, the bottom half of the screen contains the story or news summary. The Weather section has forecasts, and a series of US maps showing current weather conditions, satellite photographs, Doppler Radar, today's highs, tonight's lows, and the Ray-Ban UV Index.<P>

 You can get pretty color charts of stock activity, while a stock ticker transits the bottom of your screen, looking just like the one on <a href="http://www.cnn.com">CNN</a>.<P>

When your PC has been idle for a while, PCN generates a screen saver with scrolling headlines. You can click on a passing illustration for more news or other information.<P>

It probably won't be long before you can download live TV.<P>

Now, with all this fancy stuff, why don't I just LOVE PointCast? I don't, you know. <P>

After my initial sense of wonder at all the graphics and icons and ads and scrolling thises and thatses, I soon lost interest. As soon as I've finished this article, I'm going to delete the software from my hard drive. <P>

My problems with PointCast are lack of speed and lack of substance.<P>

Although I have a 28.8 modem, it takes more than 20 minutes for PointCast to load the news each time I update. Even though I can work on something else in the meantime, this is painful. <P>

PointCast's stock market information is already at least 20 minutes old when the download begins. Twenty-some minutes later, it's 45 minute old. You can get 15-minute old information from My Yahoo or <a href="http://www.aol.com">AOL</a> in seconds. In fact, an entire update of My Yahoo takes under a minute. Crayon is already on your hard drive. <P>

PCN lets you access each section as the update is completed, but the order in which the categories download seems rather random, and you can't control it.<P>

I don't understand why PointCast is so slow. It has the same <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/headlines/./news/summary.html">Reuters</a> reports you get from My Yahoo or America Online, which don't take long there. The Summer Olympics reports are from NBC/IBM, which, as we know, has had its problems, but I've never had to wait long for their information, even when it's old.<P>

The fancy, animated advertisements may be the bottleneck. They are cool, attention getting. If you click on one, it takes you to the company's Website. But once you've paid your respects to the sponsor in question, I wish you could make the ad go away for good -- the constant motion in the corner as you scroll through headlines or scan scores is irritating.<P>

And the screensaver is set up for a direct connection. Every time it switches on, it tries to access the Internet and bring PCN's contents up to date, but it gives my PC a fit.<P>

Same problems on the Macintosh? Sorry Mac, there isn't a PointCast for you yet. But you can register now for an email announcement to be sent to you when their beta version is released.<P>

Maybe one day I'll have a direct Internet connection. Maybe one day PointCast will match its style with some substance that is unique. Then maybe I'll take another look. <P>

For now, though, handsome is as handsome does, and PCN doesn't do a whole lot for me.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Science History is Unraveled<BR>On the Web</font></center></b><P>

<font size =4>




<img src=leonardo1.gif width=237 height=259 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


Unless we meet them in the hereafter, we'll never know whether the visionary geniuses Galileo Galilei or Leonardo Da Vinci or Copernicus imagined the Global Internet and the World Wide Web in their concept of science in the future.<P>

No matter. What we can find on the Web are remarkable resources detailing the history of science.<P>

You can make virtual visits to history of science museums all around the world.<P>

Start with an Altavista query "history of science" for a number of interesting links, or go to <a href="http://www.asap.unimelb.edu.au/hstm/hstm_mus.htm#Exhibition">World Wide Virtual Library History of Science, Technology and Medicine</a> section for links to museums, virtual exhibitions, and images.<P>

Let's start with Galileo: "<a href="http://bang.lanl.gov/video/stv/arshtml/lanlarstitle.html">The Art of Renaissance Science: Galileo and Perspective</a>" explores the scientific revolution of the 16th and 17th centuries, and its effect on art, architecture, music, warfare, and religion. It's an article from a "hypermedia journal," but it could also be called a virtual exhibition. Author Joseph W. Dauben, a professor at Lehman College of the City University of New York and Program Designer Gary Welz, a lecturer in Mathematics at CUNY, have pooled their talents to create a nicely illustrated scholarly piece. It is well organized and thought-provoking, and takes good advantage of the Web's hyperlinking capabilities.<P>

Continuing in pursuit of  Galileo, you should visit the <a href="http://galileo.imss.firenze.it/museo/4/index.html">Galileo room</a> at the <a href="http://galileo.imss.firenze.it/">The History of Science Museum in Florence</a>. I found it a year or more ago, and it's still one of the odder experiences on the net. I don't mean that it's not serious -- it is. You travel around the virtual exhibit that mirrors a real one in Florence, and you investigate the various objects: drawings, prototype inventions, telescopes, an objective lens, a lodestone, a thermoscope and other important things. <P>

<img src=finger.gif width=188 height=248 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

Among them is the <a href="http://galileo.imss.firenze.it/museo/4/eiv10.html">Middle finger of Galileo's right hand</a>, preserved as a holy relic, in a glass casket on a marble stand. The inscription begins: "This is the finger with which the illustrious hand covered the heavens and indicated their immense space." Peculiar.<P>

Although Galileo didn't invent telescopes, he used them to change the way human beings relate to the universe. <P>

"As an astronomical instrument, the telescope is one of the most familiar icons of science. Yet when invented it was considered more a military device than a scientific instrument," write the curators of <a href="http://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/geometry/title.htm">Geometry of War 1500-1750</a>, a virtual exhibit at <a href="http://info.ox.ac.uk/departments/hooke">The Oxford University Museum of the History of Science</a>. The exhibit is made up of essays on Gunnery, Rangefinding and Surveying,  Fortification, and <a href="http://www.mhs.ox.ac.uk/geometry/summary.htm#troops">Troop Formations and the Telescope</a> with links to books and images in the museum's collection. Its thesis is how the mathematicians of the Renaissance "aimed to demonstrate the usefulness of geometry as well as its ingenuity." <P>

Another scientist who focused on  improving machines of war was the quintessential Renaissance Man, Leonardo Da Vinci. Visit the <a href="http://cellini.leonardo.net/museum/west.html#start">Leonardo Museum</a> and go directly to his engineering drawings in the museum's virtual West Wing. Among the flying machines and pumps are his weapons: a multi-barrel gun, siege defenses, a crossbow machine, a giant crossbow and a terrifying-looking <a href="http://cellini.leonardo.net/museum/p14.jpg">war scythe</a>.<P>

If all this science seems too long ago and far away, there are more recent inventions to contemplate. For those who prefer to know they have lived through history as it was made, there are two virtual museums worth a visit. I expect their collections are growing even as I write. The first is the <a href="http://www.ncsc.dni.us/fun/user/tcc/cmuseum/cmuseum.htm">Obsolete Computer Museum</a>, maintained by Tom Carlson at the National Center for State Courts in Williamsburg, Virginia. It has illustrations of old Amstrad, Apple, Commodore, IBM, Osborne, Tandy and other computers, (many of which I have used!)<P>

The other is the UC Davis Computer Museum which has a smaller collection, but also has links to Smithsonian exhibits. What caught my eye was the 1892 <a href="http://wwwcsif.cs.ucdavis.edu/~csclub/museum/items/crandall_typewriter.html">Crandall typewriter</a>. How come it's still so good-looking when some of those old Kaypros and Altairs are the homeliest hunks of junk I ever saw?<P>

<I>

I got off the plane at Shannon Airport in County Clare, Ireland, and noticed two clocks at either end of the main lobby. But the clocks disagreed, by about five minutes. I mentioned this discrepancy to a baggage handler, and he wasted no time teaching me an important lesson in creative thinking. <P>

"If they both gave the same time," he said, "we wouldn't need two clocks, now, would we?" </I><P>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>

Creativity isn't just for artists anymore -- it's now recognized as that spark that gets us all moving, whether we're bureaucrats or Michelangelos. <P>

<img src=inspir.gif width=230 height=230 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

If your creativity quotient seems to be measured in negative numbers, if the box of cookies in the pantry or the soaps on TV are calling you away from your chores, if the productivity report that's due this afternoon seems impossibly boring, don't despair.<P>

There are books, seminars, computer software programs and Web sites, all there to help nurture the creative person in all of us.<P>

Are you surprised? The Internet is a Mecca for creative types after all.<P>

The creatives on the net are ready to share their techniques and their wisdom, mostly for free, sometimes for a fee. There's money in it, after all. Creativity is the next big thing.<P>

Businesses large and small are encouraging creativity in their workforces. <P>

Creativity may be trendy, but those CEOs and CFOs aren't talking about writing or poetry. They don't encourage workers to be creative in putting together your new car. We can't have steering wheels on the roof, or accelerator pedals in the trunk, can we? <P>

It's about problem solving -- how to get a job done better, faster, cheaper. You know the mantra.<P>

Creativity has to do with finding new ways to do familiar things, organizing your thoughts -- perhaps even finding out what your thoughts are with a little "right-brain thinking".<P>

If this all sounds strange, not to worry. From brainstorming software (demo versions and shareware), to <a href="http://www.lib.cuhk.hk/uli/bi/writers/writers.htm">elementary instructions</a> for writing a term paper from inspirational quotes to mind exercises for overcoming writers block, it's all out there. <P>

Folks who've been to creativity seminars will recognize the mindmapping software from <a href="http://www.mindman.com/">MindMan</a> and brainstorming software from <a href="http://www.inspiration.com/">Inspiration</a>. <P>

You scatter your thoughts on a page, then you arrange them in relation to each other, then you draw links between them, adding more as they occur to you, and finally you make flow charts and plans. <P>

All of this, in the Inspiration 4.0 software, is done with a choice of colors and shapes and fonts and illustrations. It's more like playing than many less productive activities. <P>

The free downloadable demo is sufficient for my needs. I can't save my work, and when I print I get a bold header and footer proclaiming "Made with Inspiration 4.0 Demo." But if all you're trying to do is get some thoughts down on paper, it's more fun than a pencil and a legal pad.<P>

MindMan is similar, but a lot less entertaining. On the other hand, it's freeware. Although for all intents and purposes you can brainstorm and organize as you can with Inspiration, the graphics are limited to boxes for the main ideas with branching lines for the subtopics. BO-ring.<P>

To jump-start your thinking, turn to <a href="http://www.pol.com/GoCreate/qpad.htm">QuotAmaze</a>--a series of hyperlinked quotations. Start on the Launch Pad, click a word. You go to a page of quotes, where individual words are hyperlinked to other pages of quotes.<P>

Take a "<a href="http://galileo.metatech.com/create/course.htm">A Short Course in Creativity</a>" from the Idea Web.<P>

If you need support, try the <a href="http://www.waterw.com/~lucia/aw.html">Artists Way Online Support Group</a>, based on the book by the same name, and the Alcoholics Anonymous 12-step plan.<P>

You might find the Chinese University of Hong Kong's instructions for writing a term paper a useful checklist if you're preparing a report.<P>

What if your skull seems to be full of mud instead of brains? A Right Brain Workout may do the trick. The quote at the beginning came from that site. I found it in the <a href="http://www.pol.com/GoCreate/rbhshed.htm">Right Brain Head Shed</a>, a series of links to sites about ideas, the way we think, types of intelligence, and creativity.<P>

Types of intelligence? Sure. From Dale Kirby's <a href="http://www.rain.org/~da5e/nlpself.html">The Help Yourself to Self-Help Page</a>, I learned there are seven principal intelligences: linguistic, logical, spatial, musical, bodily, interpersonal and intrapersonal. It's very odd, but some of it makes sense. It may be worth a quick visit.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>My Yahoo's Better<BR>
Than Original</font></center></b><P>

<font size =4>



<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


I like to know what's going on in the world. Unfortunately, the newspaper I read at 6:30 in the morning went to press at 11 o'clock the night before. Things happen during the night. <P>

I listen to the radio but, unless it's on all the time, I miss the brief news segments. I can't bear to watch TV during the day. What am I to do to keep up? How are any of us supposed to keep up?<P>

The big search engine, <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a>, has come up with an innovation that may help. <P>

Called "<a href="http://www.my.yahoo.com">My Yahoo</a>," this newest service builds on the frame of the original but takes the process of gathering information a logical step further: giving you a Web site to turn to on a regular basis for broad categories of information you've specified.<P>

With the help of an interactive form, you tell My Yahoo about yourself. It uses this information to build "your" site. Save it, bookmark it and return whenever you please. <P>

My Yahoo is divided into sections, the best of which is "My News." There, you get up-to-the-minute headlines in categories such as: Top News, National, International, Business, Technology, Sports, Art & Entertainment, Olympics, and Movies. The page also includes weather, stock market news (as well as specific stocks you select), and sports scores.<P>

Click the headline to read the full Reuters news report. Click the category heading for a list of all headlines.<P>

How is My Yahoo different from <a href="http://www.nytimes.com">The New York Times</a>, <a href="http://www.cnn.com">CNN</a> or <a href="http://www.usatoday.com">USA TODAY</a> Websites? <P>

Those sites have pictures, multimedia reports, well-known writers and editors, and generally a classier all-'round product. However, if you want a quick overview of what's going on, the bells and whistles can slow you down. When there's a big story breaking, My Yahoo can clue you in faster. Then you can go wherever you like to find out more.<P>

I found out about the Atlanta bomb from My Yahoo a little after 7 a.m. July 27. I read the Reuters report, only a few minutes old, then jumped to CNN and USA Today. Both sites offered lots of photographs, audio and video clips, but not much more hard news than that first Reuters article.<P>

In spite of the horror of the explosion in Atlanta, other things are happening in the world. You wouldn't know it from the front pages at the mega-news sites. My Yahoo doesn't forget, though: there's the situation in Burundi threatening to blow up into genocidal apocalypse; in Israel: drive-by shootings; in Miami: a hijacked airliner; typhoons in the Philippines; floods in China; civil war in Sri Lanka; a landslide in Korea.<P>

All that news tends to be pushed aside when terror strikes close to home. On My Yahoo's news summary those stories keep coming, even as the "big" news is fully covered.<P>

My Yahoo offers other helpful tools.<P>

My Internet presents a list of Websites that might interest you, based on your interests. You can add or delete. <P>

My Contacts is a series of directories: White Pages, Yellow Pages and email addresses. Not very robust at the moment. Didn't have any of the numbers I tested. Maybe soon.<P>

My Agent is an oddity. I have yet to figure it out. Supposedly, you can get personal advice on music and movies that might interest you, participate in chat rooms, and do some shopping. It sometimes works; it hangs up often, and it's not for me at present. The chat area appears to be unmoderated and that's a mistake. If they want the majority of good folks on the Internet to participate, they'll have to monitor their users' language and choice of screen-names for a start.<P>

My Yahoo's banner proclaims "It's yours. You build it. It's free. (It's beta)" <P>

Well, the beta stage should end soon and the improvements will only continue. From beta to better is my slogan. This is one to watch.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Even Luddites Have Web Sites</font></center></b><P>

<font size =4>



<center>by Kitty Williams</center>

Do you know what a Luddite is? <P>

Until  UVA Professors <a href="http://www.engl.virginia.edu/faculty/hirsch.html">E.D. Hirsch, Jr.</a>, Joseph F. Kett, and GMU Professor <a href="http://www.gmu.edu/robinson/jt.html">James S. Trefil</a> published the "Dictionary of Cultural Literacy" in the late 1980s, I didn't have a clue.<P>

In the publicity for the book, "Luddite" was listed as one of the 100 terms all literate persons ought to know. At once, all my smugness evaporated. After years of education, I couldn't call myself culturally literate. I'd never even heard the word. Well, you can be sure I found out what it meant, quickly!<P>

"Luddites," the dictionary says, "-- Opponents of the introduction of labor-saving machinery. The original Luddites, followers of a legendary Ned Ludd, were British laborers of the early nineteenth century who smashed textile-making machines that threatened their jobs. Modern opponents of technical change are sometimes called Luddites."<P>

What a useful word for today. The workplace is full of Luddites. Politics has its "neo-Luddites." Science has its "pseudo-Luddites." We all know people who profess a bias against technology.<P>

Is it any wonder that the Internet is full of Luddite links and information?<P>

<a href="http://www.luddites.com/">Luddites On-Line</a> is tastefully designed, with illuminated borders, and graphics reminiscent of woodcuts. I particularly like the mouse cords and computer cables depicted in formal Celtic knots.  The page is also, just slightly, tongue in cheek. Proclaiming that "Life was better before sliced bread," they offer refuge for those who feel "like roadkill on the infobahn." Cute. <P>

They have a version of <a href="http://www.luddites.com/luddite-tale.html">The Origin of Luddism</a>, told in "Fractured Fairy Tale" style,  that seems to agree with more sober accounts found elsewhere on the Web. If you think you might be a Luddite, yourself, take the <a href="http://www.imagesmith.com/imagesmith/luddites/purity.html">Luddite Purity Test</a> at the site. (The last time I took the test, I got a Network Error message every time I clicked the "I hate submit buttons" button.) Finally, don't miss Luddites On-Line's links to <a href="http://www.luddites.com/history.html">Great Luddites in History</a>: Ronald Reagan, Senator Exon and Bill Gates. Did I mention that this site was tongue in cheek? <P>

Another site features <a href="http://town.hall.org/places/ludd_land/">The Ballad of Ned Ludd</a>, a techno-folk opera. Rather strange. You click one scene after another, and you can download the songs in a choice of formats. It's a somewhat serious composition by Corinne Becknell and Marty Lucas, who also sing and play various instruments including bottle caps, over-ripe zucchini, keyboards, skillet lid, mop handle, and steel trunk.<P>

Luddites aren't all merry musicians and jokers, though. <P>

Obviously Ned Ludd and his followers have struck a cord with the modern online population.<P>

"<a href="http://www.pomona.edu/pynchon/uncollected/luddite.html">Is it OK to be a Luddite?</a>" an article in the New York Times Book Review, October 28, 1984, made me realize this is not a brand new idea. "...[W]e now live, we are told, in the Computer Age," wrote Thomas Pynchon. "What is the outlook for Luddite sensibility? Will mainframes attract the same hostile attention as knitting frames once did? I really doubt it. Writers of all descriptions are stampeding to buy word processors. Machines have already become so user-friendly that even the most unreconstructed of Luddites can be charmed into laying down the old sledgehammer and stroking a few keys instead."<P>

He wasn't right about the sledgehammer part. Wired Magazine's executive editor Kevin Kelly <a href="http://www.hotwired.com/wired/3.06/features/saleskelly.html">interviewed</a> Luddite Kirkpatrick Sale in March. Sale is the author of "Rebels Against the Future: The Luddites and Their War on the Industrial Revolution: Lessons for the Computer Age." He's serious about resisting technology and, to make his point, did take a sledgehammer to a computer. <P>

"It felt wonderful," said Sale. "The sound it made, the spewing of the undoubtedly poisonous insides into the spotlight, the dust that hung in the air..." What larks!<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Craftspeople Now<BR>
Weaving Web Sites</font></center></b><P>

<font size =4>


<center>by Kitty Williams</center>

Support, supplies, information, inspiration -- the Internet provides this and more to craftspeople. Does the Internet foster community? When it comes to craftspeople, the answer is a resounding Yes!<P>

For the exchange of ideas, information, and products, the 'Net is a marvelous resource. Craftspeople and hobbyists of all description  have established a network, sharing and comparing work and inspiration from all over the world.<P>

If you listen to the pundits, you'll think everyone is too busy to knit or weave, or make pots, baskets or wood furniture. There's so much to do, with jobs, children, commutes, professional development, fitness -- who has time for hobbies? And, we read, television and now the Internet are eating up all the time people once had for handwork and projects.<P>

That may be so for some people, but not everyone. Seems like a lot of folks have time for both the Internet and their crafts.<P>

Weavers and textile artists have established a fascinating outpost on the World Wide Web. This seems fitting, since the beauty of the spider's web, and the spider's artful persistence in spinning and weaving have inspired weavers since the dawn of the craft.<P>

<img src=blacksheep.gif width=170 height=110 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

Rosemary Brock maintains the <a href="http://users.aimnet.com/~lbrock/BlackSheep/Computer.html">Black Sheep Handweavers Guild's Computer Corner</a>, a treasure trove of web links for weavers and practitioners of many related crafts including basketry, beadwork, knitting, crocheting, quilting, sewing, spinning, and software for textile artists. (Geographically, the BSHG is in the San Francisco Bay area).<P>

A craftsperson who is feeling isolated or unmotivated may find just the jump-start that's needed at this site. There are links to museums and galleries around the world with textile collections, from the Cooper Hewitt in New York, the Royal Ontario Museum, <a href="http://www.quiknet.com/gallery.html">Textilia</a> in Sweden, the Sistine Chapel, and even the Smithsonian's textile collection and the White House crafts collection. <P>

When I visited, the <a href="http://www.si.edu/organiza/museums/nmah/homepage/docs/quilts/quilt.html">Smithsonian</a> had an online exhibit of 18th, 19th and 20th century quilts, counterpanes and throws. The 1926 <a href="http://www.si.edu/organiza/museums/nmah/homepage/docs/quilts/66.html">child's quilt</a> made in China for James Cunningham of Williston, ND, is simply adorable.<P>

Weavers will find sources for looms and equipment -- big <a href="http://www.oricom.ca/leclerc/">LeClerc Looms</a> in Quebec has a home page as does tiny <a href="http://www.dundasloom.com/">Dundas Loom Company</a> in Montana -- as well as wool and other fibers. For example, visit <a href="http://www.rmefyarn.com/rmefyarn/">Rocky Mountain Exotic Fibre</a>, a mill in Alberta with a wide range of services. You can tour their mill online and look at all the nifty machines where they manufacture yarns from llama, alpaca, bison, qiviuq, among others. They'll even custom process your own wool or other fiber. <P>

The Black Sheep computer corner is also where you'll find links to handweavers' guilds in places as widespread as Vancouver, B.C.; Wagga Wagga, Australia; the English Cotswolds,  Scotland, Sweden, and Denmark. Also, don't miss the <a href="http://www.io.org/~jackal/Weavers/encyc.html">Weavercraft Encyclopedia</a>, a great source of background material for weavers.<P>

If you use beads in your work, or if you want to find out what other people are doing with beads, <a href="http://www.mcs.net/~simone/beadnet.html">BeadNet</a> is a marvelous resource. I didn't know there was so much to learn, but this site has links to suppliers, designers, and many beaders' individual home pages.<P>

Photographs and information about historical textiles are also available online. You can admire <a href="http://www.artic.edu/aic/collections/subtextiles.html">Inca feathered work</a> at various sites, look at a fascinating scrap of woven palm fiber and some cords found with the <a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/expo/deadsea.scrolls.exhibit/Community/basketry.html">Dead Sea Scrolls</a>, and learn about ways modern craftspeople are reviving ancient techniques.<P>

Speaking of ancient techniques, many of these sites sport links to the <a href="http://www.sca.org">Society for Creative Anachronism</a>. I'm enchanted by the way these folks (who dress in accurate reproductions of Viking clothing, stage Medieval Faires, and feast with their friends on food prepared by centuries-old methods) have seized upon the Web to share their enthusiasms. Is this great technology or what? <P>

Crafters of all sorts should also visit the ambitious <a href="http://www.craftweb.com/">CraftWEB</a> site, which, although it doesn't have the depth of information available on some of these other sites, is well on the way to becoming a useful resource. It calls itself the "Premier Online Community for Professional Crafts Arts." Maybe one day.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>I Like Slate!</font></center></b><P>

<font size =4>


<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


Get out the rotten tomatoes. I'm about to reveal an unpopular opinion ... I like "<a href="http://www.slate.com">Slate</a>."<P>

If it were a paper magazine, I would definitely pick it up in my doctor or dentist's waiting room.<P>
<img src=slate.gif width=116 height=72 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

I know, I know. It seems everyone has been fussing about this new "literary" venture from  Microsoft. Why did Bill Gates hire former New Republic and Harper's editor Michael Kinsley to develop it? Why did Kinsley agree? Is it a cop-out? Is it a fraud? Why is it online? What's so special about it? <P>

<img src=utne.gif width=216 height=154 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>



To tell the truth, it isn't so special. It's not unique on the Web as a serious e-zine with an emphasis on content. (Content is Web jargon for words and pictures.) <a href="http://www.salon1999.com">Salon</a>, <a href="http://www.utne.com/">Utne Online</a>, <a href="http://www.feedmag.com/filter.html">Filter</a>, <a href="http://www.suck.com/">Suck</a>, <a href="http://www.hotwired.com">HotWired</a> and <a href="http://www.tripod.com">Tripod</a> are some of the established 'zines with lively writing and timely subject matter. <P>



So what if Slate isn't new? There will always be a market for this kind of thoughtful, informative periodical about politics and culture.<P>



Having read the hype -- did you catch Ken Auletta's long, adulatory article in the New Yorker in May? -- you get the sense that Kinsley, a relative "newbie," rode in on his great white horse to show everyone how publishing on the Internet should be done. You'd think the others might find that a little arrogant. You're right.<P>


<img src=salon.gif width=177 height=55 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

"There is a major shortage of witty or beautiful writing and a coherent overall editorial vision seems lacking -- but it's far from a disaster," writes <a href="http://www.salon1999.com/media/media960625.html">Gary Kamiya</a> of Salon in one of the more positive reviews. The writing, he says, "take[s] meta-commentary... to new and hideous depths" and in other places is "puckeringly dry." Oof.<P>

<img src=suck.gif width=99 height=41 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>


Suck reveals that they were told by a source close to Kinsley that the name "Slate" was chosen because it was the editor's favorite color for his Land's End slacks.<P>

<img src=filter.gif width=216 height=133 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

<a href="http://www.feedmag.com/96.05_filter.html">Filter worries</a>: "...will those of us on the front lines of Web publishing come out looking like Slate's noble forbears -- or its poor relations?" <P>

However, Slate appeals to me for several reasons.<P>

It's an analog magazine. Pages are numbered, the type font is handsome, the words look good on the "page." It has a traditional-looking set up, a cover, a table of contents, feature articles, book reviews, editorials, some art. You can start at the beginning, skip what doesn't interest you, and wind up at the end. Or you can start at the TOC and click on what you want. <P>

The Web allows Slate to avoid "jumps." Each article, whether a few hundred words or a few thousand, has its own page. That is nice. You don't have to flip back and forth as you finish one piece and start another.<P>

Now, there's one annoying trait of the Web that doesn't figure at all in the paper magazine experience. In an ordinary magazine, all you do to get to another part is turn a few pages. It takes a split second. Not so on the Internet. Depending on how many other people are online, a page "download" can take many minutes.<P>

Incredibly (for a publication that has Microsoft's techno-wizards behind it) Slate is sometimes just not available. Your computer screen presents the message "Document Contains No Data." Hunh?<P>

If you have the right word-processing software on your computer you can download the magazine and print it. Then you can pull it up on your screen, skim it, and print only what you want to read. A word to the wise: don't use up your color cartridge on this -- set your printer option to gray-scale, if necessary. The color on the pages is for little advertisements that, deviously, only show up faintly on your PC screen. You may not even notice them until you print them!<P>

Have a look. It's free at present. No one knows how long that will last.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Hurricane Season<BR>Is Upon Us</font></center></b><P>

<font size =4>


<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


Summer is storm season. Depending on where you live, you can expect tropical cyclones (Atlantic hurricanes and Pacific typhoons), or tornadoes with the accompanying floods and general devastation. Even if you are not affected, you can receive comprehensive coverage on every one from television and from the Internet.<P>

The 1996 hurricane season opened officially on June 1. Although an alphabetical list of names, from <a href="http://www.chron.com/content/chronicle/hurricane/96/06/02/names.html">Arthur to Wilfred</a>, has been prepared, many do not expect this season to match the 19-storm severity of 1995. I've also heard that we are embarking on a new 20-year storm cycle, and things will get worse. We'll just have to wait and see. <P>

So Arthur and Bertha have come and gone. Can Cesar be far behind? <P>

<img src=hurricane.gif width=185 height=128 vspace=6 hspace=6 Align=right>

Real and imaginary tornadoes have whizzed across the American landscape, flipping mobile homes in Virginia and the Carolinas, and earning money for movie moguls as "Twister."<P>

Whether you love storms or fear them, whether you live in storm-threatened areas, or are simply curious, the Internet has storm and weather resources so you can stay on top of developments. <P>

The Houston Chronicle has assembled a wealth of information: <a href="http://www.chron.com/content/chronicle/hurricane/">Hurricane Season 1996</a> has information and advisories, and for the truly hard-core storm aficionado, storm tracking software to download.<P>

If you have the patience for a graphics-heavy site, you can visit the <a href="http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/">Cooperative Institute for Meteorological Satellite Studies</a> site. It's a joint effort of the University of Wisconsin at Madison, the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration and the National
Aeronautics and Space Administration. Their <a href="http://cimss.ssec.wisc.edu/tropic/tropic.html">Tropical Cyclones</a> page has fascinating satellite images and movies to download, but I had a hard time figuring out what they meant by "latest" because I couldn't find times or dates anywhere.<P>

Another repository of satellite graphics is maintained by the <a href="gopher://wx.atmos.uiuc.edu:70/11/Satellite%20Images">University of Illinois, Urbanna-Champlain</a>. The images are in files by region, type and size; within the files the name indicate the date of the image. Thus, 96071917 would be the 17th picture taken on July 19, 1996. Simple, once you figure it out.<P>

In addition to scientific information, the Internet sites provide news, advice and direction for people who are actually threatened by storms. <a href="http://www.fema.gov/fema/trop.html">FEMA</a> has a site with tropical storm and hurricane watch information as soon as it becomes available. <P>

The National Weather Service's <a href="http://iwin.nws.noaa.gov/iwin/main.html">Interactive Weather Information Network</a> carries active warnings of all sorts of weather dangers such as flash floods, floods, hurricane/tropical storms, special marine, non-precipitation, severe thunderstorms, and tornadoes. Under each heading, any states that may be threatened are listed. You click on the state for up-to date information. It's easy to use --you don't have to wait for the graphics to download -- but you have to understand a certain amount of weather reporting code, which I don't.<P>
<img src=chase.gif width=180 height=235 vspace=6 hspace=6 Align=left>

Fans of fictional storms will have some fun at Warner Brothers Studio's <a href="http://www.movies.warnerbros.com/twister/">Twister</a> site . It's clearly an ad for the movie, but it's entertaining in a mild way and somewhat educational. There's a glossary of storm terminology and stuff like that.<P>



You go on a pretend storm chase, beginning with a classified ad for chasers. When you answer the ad, after a five-question "qualifying" test, you're assigned to a team led by Jo and Bill (surprise, surprise: actors Helen Hunt and Bill Paxton from the movie). You hear about the storm. you see the storm, you chase it and try to insert "Dorothy," a data-collecting machine, into the core, you survive some exciting moments, and you duck flying cows and farm machinery.  <P>

In fact, the cows provide a Dada-ist touch to the experience: calm representatives of several breeds appear throughout, apparently unfazed by the wind and the weather. <P>

Have fun, don't get too scared, but remember, the danger is real. If disaster strikes and you want to  help, find out how on the <a href="http://www.redcross.org">American Red Cross</a> Home Page. You can also use the <a href="http://www.redcross.org/where/where.html">ARC Chapter locator</a> to find the one nearest you.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Banking Online<BR>Still Takes Money</font></center></b>

<font size =4>





<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


More than a quarter century ago, the late Chic Young, creator of the much-loved "Dagwood & Blondie" comic strip, captured popular consumer attitudes by having Blondie appear at a local bank to open a new account. "How much would you like to deposit?" asked the eager young banker. "Oh, I wanted to start with a withdrawal," answered Blondie.<P>

That comic strip still captures the thinking of many about banking and, despite the hype, the advent of Internet banking services hasn't changed the rules: if you don't put it in, you can't take it out. But if you have a bank account and a computer, the Internet makes it a whole lot easier to see where your money is between the putting in and taking out.<P>

<img src=citibank.gif width=214 height=37 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

Many banks are beginning to develop an online presence, some with more enthusiasm than others. As of  April 1996, 45 of the country's 100 largest banks had a presence on the Web, according to <a href="http://www.netbanker.com/resources/top100banks.html">NETBanker</a>. From the largest: New York City's Citicorp (with assets of $257.5 billion) to New Orleans's Hibernia (with assets of $7.4 billion.)<P>

<img src=hibernia.gif width=186 height=125 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

Bank of America, Chemical Bank, NationsBank, J.P. Morgan, First Chicago (NBD), Chase Manhattan, Bankers Trust , Banc One, and First Union are all represented.<P>

The San Francisco-based <a href="http://www.bofa.com">Bank of America</a> site is bursting with bells and whistles, including Home Banking with quick balance, bill paying, fund transfer and other services, and Build Your Own Bank which has personalized news and information.<P>

<img src=bankfinder.gif width=160 height=32 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

At the <a href="http://www.bankfinder.com/infocenter.html#online">BankFinder</a> Information Center, you find a list of several information sources and online banking services, including Security First Network Bank, FSB. <P>

<a href="http://www.sfnb.com">SFNB</a>, "The World's First Internet Bank" offers checking, bill paying, money market accounts and account information online, 24-hours a day, seven days a week. <P>

<img src=sfnb.gif width=210 height=118 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

A <a href="http://www.sfnb.com/demos/bankdemos.html">demonstration</a> of the bank's current services begins with reassurance that "your SFNB account is protected by a military grade operating system, the same one that protects sensitive information for defense and intelligence agencies." (Recent news stories about computer hackers breaking into government files makes that claim less than reassuring. But calm down: the Internet accounts are insured by the FDIC just like others.)<P>

SFNB's services appear to be easy to use and understand. The bill paying feature, for example, allows you to view your account, then set up regular electronic payments through an interactive form. The online register is updated as soon as electronic payments and deposits are made or an ATM is used. (You can still use old-fashioned paper checks if you prefer and they'll appear online as soon as they have cleared.)<P>

Rates, more information and online applications can be found at the site. Basic Internet checking requires an initial $100 deposit (sorry, Blondie), and provides you 20 free electronic bill payments per month, a free initial check order and an ATM/debit card. There is no monthly fee. <P>

<a href="http://www.firstunion.com">First Union Bank</a> with offices in several southeastern states and Washington DC  launched a service last September called CyberBanking. Aimed at personal and business customers, much of it is still being developed. The service began by allowing commercial customers to see account information through "WEBInVision" with plans to allow Internet transactions as the service is refined.<P>

Except for the budding CyberBanking services, most of FirstUnion's Website functions as a souped-up brochure,  with descriptions of the banks various services. Notable exceptions are the interactive online applications for loans and credit cards. <P>

Although it's still under development (and subject to regulatory approval) First Union plans by year-end to allow customers to open checking and savings accounts, check balances and review statements, transfer funds and pay bills -- all online. People who want to test the services can preview the system using a "guestaccount" login at First Union's <a href="http://www.firstunion.com/3/help/beta.html">Beta test site</a>.<P>

You may not be ready for online banking, but I think you'll find many of these sites offer insight into ways major banks are responding to the opportunities and uncertainties of the Internet. (Notice how many of them use "granite" patterns as background on their Websites? They want to project solidity even in this electronic medium!)<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Organizing Your Files?<BR>Get Out the Crayon!</font></center></b>

<font size =4>





<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


"A cluttered desk is the sign of a cluttered mind" is the favorite aphorism of those who have a fetish for neatness. <P>

I much prefer the sign above our local arborist's correspondence-heaped desk "Those who keep a tidy desk will never experience the true joy of finding something they thought was irretrievably lost."<P>

Still, I do appreciate the value of being able to find things when I need them. Friends often brag about how they get onto the Internet, check the news, the Lottery, the weather, the stock quotes and then get right off. It sounds so efficient, but for many of us it's not been that easy.<P>

The last thing I want to do, really, is to settle down and organize my Web bookmarks into folders. But I should, and so should you. Really. It's the key to purposeful browsing. All those neat sounding links disappear if they're "filed" in random order. By the time I'm ready to explore a corner of the Net I've had my eye on for a while, I find I often miss at least half my links if I haven't organized them in some way. ("True joy" can be elusive.)<P>

<img src=crayon.gif width=350 height=110 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

One great, multipurpose bookmark to have is CRAYON created by Dave Maher and Jeff Boulter, two students who recently graduated from Bucknell University. It's truly useful and it's free.<P>

If you surf the net for news, <a href="http://crayon.net">CRAYON</a> (CreAte Your Own Newspaper) allows you to build a "newspaper" comprised of links to news and information sources that you'd like to check regularly. If you love the <a href="http://www.nytimes.com/yr/mo/day/editorial">New York Times editorials</a>, need to stay on top of local news in Roanoke and Singapore, love (or hate) sports news, here's your site. When you've set up your own paper, bookmark it and drag the bookmark to the top of your list. <P>

CRAYON's choices are pretty spectacular. There are 34 sources of world news, from CNN and Yahoo to The Irish Times, Canada Newswire, several Japanese services including Asahi Newspapers, The Ghanian Newsrunner, The Jerusalem Post, Icelandic, Indian, Malasian, Russian, German, and Chinese news.<P>

<HR>
<img src=catbirdtimes.gif width=450 height=138 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=center><P>

For U.S. news, you have  more than a dozen sources, including <a href="http://www.realaudio.com/rafiles/abc/thelatest.ram">ABC news in Real Audio</a>, the New York Times, Today at NASA and the NandO Times.<P>

More than 50 regional and local papers are offered as links. You can even submit a link for their consideration. It won't be long before all the states are represented here.<P>

There are editorials and opinion pages as well as links to several syndicated columnists. You can choose sports, information and technology, health and fitness, and news of  cool Websites like <a href="http://adsint.bc.ca/deepsite">The Unusual or Deep Site of the Day</a>. And all those "Snippets" you may be fond of? You'll find Today in History, <a href="http://www.gospelcom.net/rbc/odb/odb.shtml">Our Daily Bread</a> (with links to the Bible), <a href="http://www.nine.org/notw/archive.html">News of the Weird</a>, <a href="http://www.earthsky.com/today.html">Earth and Sky</a> and others.<P>

While CRAYON will help organize some of your bookmarks, it's not an all-purpose solution. I don't know about you, but I have hundreds of bookmarks. When I add them to my bookmark file, they stay in random order until I go in and clean them up. In Netscape  you can make sub-folders and drag or move the bookmarks into them. Click Go to Bookmarks at the top of the bookmark list, or More Bookmarks at the bottom, and use the File, Edit and Item tabs to file, rename and organize your links.<P>

I have folders named Garden, Food, Internet, Weird, College, Fashion, Finance, Family, Shopping, and a scary one called To File. Several times a week, I go through my new bookmarks and try to file them away. It's a bit of a pain, but it beats losing a bookmark you suddenly need ASAP because you can't remember its name or where you put it.<P>

Use your bookmarks well, and I guarantee you'll at least lessen the frustration that accompanies even the best Web Surfing.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Time for the Olympics!</font></center></b><P>

<font size =4>
<img src=atlantagames.gif width=243 height=141 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


Oh-oh-oh-oh oh! It's almost time for the Olympics! Opening Ceremonies are July 19, in case you haven't been paying attention. Closing Ceremonies are August 4. In between we'll have a chance to watch the very best the world has to offer.<P>

The last time I watched the games on television, though, I swore I'd never do it again. The coverage seemed to be all advertisements, occasionally interrupted by short snippets of random competitions. I had to check the newspaper to see who won in events that interested me. <P>

This year NBC has paid millions for the exclusive rights to television broadcast of the Olympics; I expect they have to sell at least as many ads to cover the costs and make a profit. (They just might: more than half the world's population is expected to watch the opening ceremony!)<P>





I'll be interested to find out what percentage of the 171.5 hours of Olympic broadcast will be actual coverage of the games. Because my previous experience of Olympics on the tube was a bit sour, I'm a little jealous of the folks who are going in person -- in spite of the heat.<P>

Although I vowed not to, I plan to peek at the TV every now and then. Perhaps I'm a sucker, but there is nothing more wonderful than watching these young men and women from all over the world competing at the limits of their abilities. I get the same thrill whether I'm watching a swimmer, a discus thrower, a gymnast or a weight-lifter. <P>

This year, the Internet will offer, if not an alternative, some respite at least. Several sites are in full swing that will definitely enhance the experience for fans and spectators. <P>

<img src=nbcolympics.gif width=190 height=97 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

Two multi-level sites that merit frequent visits are the <a href="http://www.atlanta.olympic.org">Official 1996 Olympics Web Site</a> and <a href="http://www.olympic.nbc.com/">Olympics on NBC</a>. Both have game and other event schedules, team rosters, and spectators' guides to unfamiliar sports. Like everything else associated with the Olympics you should be prepared for some waiting though. The Web site developers are expecting  more than 10,000,000 hits a day when the games begin and no one knows what the Internet's capacity is anymore: it's almost a separate Olympic event, seeing how many people can hit the offical site at one time.<P>

<img src=olympic.gif width=260 height=90 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

However, if you're going in person you should check out <a href="http://www.atlanta.olympic.org/acog/travel/d-travel.html">Olympic Travel Information</a>, though I didn't see any offers at this late date to help folks find a place to stay. <P>

Parking won't be too easy, either. If you're driving, visit the <a href="http://davinci.csn.net/itsa/websites/transpor.html">Atlanta transportation information site</a> before you set out. It includes an overview of <a href="http://www.itsmarta.com/OlympicInfo.html">MARTA</a>, Metro Atlanta's rapid transit system, directions to the sites of the various games, traffic circulation plans, and tips and hints for getting around. <a href="http://atlantamag.atlanta.com/atla2.html">Atlanta Magazine</a> has a City Guide on the Web which also has lots of information for visitors.<P>

For us stay-at-homes there are many other choices. America Online has a newsy site with photographs and articles as well as schedules, rosters and all the same stuff you can find elsewhere.  The <a href="http://www.atlantagames.com">Atlanta Constitution</a> is offering a site that promises rich content and constantly updated reporting. (To be fair, the games haven't started as I write this, and the quality of events coverage will determine where I spend most of my time.)<P>

<img src=womensports.gif width=250 height=179 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

Another web site you might visit is <a href="http://www.womensports.com">WomenSports</a> which has information about Olympic teams and schedules as well as other competitions involving female athletes, and background information. <P>

For diehard fans and stat-freaks the <a href="http://sports.eb.com">Encyclopedia Britannica</a> has created a free site that offers the full 100 years of Olympic Records. <a href="http://www.princetonbmw.com/plinks.html">Princeton BMW</a> in New Jersey (yes, a car dealership) has compiled a list of 128 Olympics links including sites with information on Special Olympics and Para rivingr, ir.ery best the world lympics. It even has a link to the <a href="http://www.sydney.olympic.org/">Sydney 2000</a> page. That's Sydney, Australia, where the games will be held in 2000!<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Free Newsletters Make<BR> 'Net Surfing Easier</font></center></b>

<font size =4>


<center>by Kitty Williams</center>



So many Websites, so little time! How can the dedicated surfer be sure she isn't missing something wonderful? <P>

<img src=netsurfer.gif width=209 height=37 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

Nothing is certain, but there is help out there. The free weekly email newsletter (or e-zine), <a href="http://www.netsurf.com/nsd/index.html">NetSurfer Digest</a>, may not point you toward every not-to-be-missed site, but you'll find a few winners in each issue. I pick up a couple of good bookmarks every time I read it.<P>

You can read all the issues of the newsletter and subscribe to the Digest at their home page, which carries the apt motto "More Signal, Less Noise." Actually, if you can remember to check by the site from time to time, you'll find the Web version of the letter easier to navigate than the e-zine.<P>

<img src=4girls.gif width=209 height=116 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

Each issue reviews a wide variety of sites, from silly to serious. A recent issue clued me into to <a href="http://www.itp.tsoa.nyu.edu/~gof/">4 Girls on Film</a>, a site with thoughtful and entertaining film reviews by a group of  young women. (I found myself agreeing with them about some of my recent favorites flicks, and will probably check back before I spend big bucks to see the new releases.)<P>

<img src=man.gif width=144 height=96 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

I laughed out loud (LOL in email jargon) over <a href="http://www.angry.org">Angry.Org</a> (which bills itself as "The crankiest site on the Net"), reviewed in the same issue, with uncensored (beware) rants about people, organizations, company and things. Bill Gates, McDonald's, bosses, employees, air conditioners all take their hits. My favorite was from a 9-year-old who was furious because <a href="http://www.angry.org/things/norabbit.html">she didn't get a rabbit</a> for her birthday.<P>

<img src=wno.gif width=200 height=45 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

I'm also grateful to Netsurfer for letting me know about the <a href="http://www.bluemarble.net/~amyloo/wno.html">World Nap Organization</a> Homepage. As I write, I'm listening to "Music to Nap by from the Midi Jukebox linked to the site (zzz-HUNH! Where was I? Oh, sorry -- I must have snoozed off.) The WNO site has links to other nap-related sites, articles celebrating the art of napping, and art (<a href="http://www.soho-ny.com/galleries/sample/vangogh.siesta.html">Van Gogh's Afternoon Siesta</a>). Lovely. A restful by-way on the sometimes too-wide-awake Web.<P>

Netsurfer Digest is only one of several email newsletters I get. I have a habit of  subscribing to any interesting (free) newsletter offered on home pages. This is partly because that way I'm frequently reminded of sites I mean to revisit. If you're sensitive about an overloaded mailbox, you might forgo this, but I find the delete key very useful in eliminating chaff, so I don't mind so much.<P>

<img src=tripod.gif width=209 height=74 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

Several of the newsletters I receive are restricted to news about specific sites. <a href="http://www.tripod.com">Tripod</a> has one of those. Tripod is aimed at younger adults and brings a light touch to the serious  issues of work, money, politics, community, living and travel. It's far from boring and has a number of neat services for members (membership is free) like help with resumes and "Reminder Minder." <P>

Reminder Minder allows you to make a list of things you need to remember to do over the coming year, and Tripod will send you emails reminding you when the time comes. If you like, they'll send a "heads up" email a few days early as well. You can also enter up to four monthly tasks, paying the rent for example, and receive reminders for those too. This service alone could well be worth a trip to Tripod. <P>

The occasional newsletter, <a href="http://www.tripod.com/planet/insider/index.html">Tripod Insider</a> contains a short summary of the new features at the site.<P>

<img src=pbs.gif width=180 height=164 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

PBS Previews is a weekly online newsletter published by the <a href="http://www.pbs.org">Public Broadcasting System</a>. It contains news of upcoming PBS television shows and the locations of the online companion sites for some of them. A particularly amusing companion site is <a href="http://www.pbs.org/nerds/">The Triumph of the Nerds</a>: The Rise of Accidental Empires about  "how youthful amateurs, hippies and self-proclaimed "nerds" accidentally changed the world. " I liked the section on the <a href="http://www.pbs.org/nerds/timeline/index.htm">History of the Computer</a> which starts with the invention of the Abacus around 3000 BC. and mentions Blaise Pascal's 1642 invention of a mechanical calculator with a capacity for eight digits (that didn't work very well).<P>

Anyway, that's a sample of the many useful e-zines I receive. They're a useful way of keeping up to date on cyber-developments, and you can file them away until you're ready for some fun.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Dowsing Is Another Metaphor <BR>On The Web</font></center></b>

<font size =4>


<center>by Robin Lind</center>

As a young journalist, I occasionally took big chances. Once our county was in the grip of a severe, prolonged drought and I was embarked on a series of articles about underground water supplies. At the end of the first story, I added the following note: "Next week, Part II: Dowsing for Water."<P>

I had no idea of who I might interview or how the series might continue and I didn't know a thing about dowsing. Fortunately, a local dowser read the story, called me up and the series continued.<P>

ITOD (in the old days) before the advent of the Web, that's how reporters sometimes did "research." It wasn't a preferred method; my grey-haired editor would have skinned me alive if he had known what I was doing. It was more of a SOTP (seat of the pants) technique but it often helped underpaid reporters on understaffed newspapers get good stories.<P>

More importantly for me, the local dowser, Dick Richards, gave me my first lessons in dowsing. After watching him find water in several locations, I became a firm believer. In the years since I have relied on a dowser to locate my own well and had my own happy experience of successfully locating an artesian source for a cousin who had already drilled several dry holes. <P>

Looking for information on the Web, to my mind, is much like dowsing except I use a keyboard and a mouse rather than a forked twig and a pendulum. The results, however, are often similar: sometimes I get good results, sometimes not.<P>

<img src=dowsers.gif width=192 height=198 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

Naturally, dowsing has migrated onto the Web. The <a href="http://www.newhampshire.com/dowsers.org/">American Society of Dowsers</a> (ASD) has a Web Page that offers resources for those curious, interested or fascinated by the subject.<P>

Dowsing --sometimes known as "divining" -- is the ancient art of finding water through the use of a forked stick. In more modern times it has also embraced searching for oil, ore, caverns, lost items and even diagnosing illnesses. <P>

According to ASD "Dowsing is a faculty employed with intent to expand the perceptive abilities of its practitioner beyond three-dimensional limitations... Explanation of dowsing's whys and wherefores is still far from satisfactory, but for man to refuse to explore the unexplainable, simply because it cannot presently be explained, is unscientific and grossly irresponsible. Dowsing is a fact."<P>

Unfortunately, the ASD site doesn't (yet) explain what happens during dowsing or why. But then again, the Wall Street Journal doesn't explain exactly what happens when the Dow goes up or down either although there are lots of people constantly trying to do so.<P>

<img src=druid.gif width=203 height=367 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

Because it is an art and not a science, dowsing has become associated with other inexplicable phenomena and some fringe stuff like UFOs and alien abductions and that's unfortunate. (Perhaps after I've been abducted I'll have another opinion :-))<P>

What ASD's site does offer is a Schedule of Events  (the 36th Annual Convention is being held at Lyndon State College in Lyndonville, Vermont August 1-4), information about the Annual Convention, the catalog of the ASD bookstore, a brief listing of related links and chat rooms where you may engage your fellow dowsers in conversation.<P>

If you'd like to experiment with dowsing on the Web you might begin with "<a href="http://www.geomancy.org/sig/dowsing.html">Dowsing Explained</a>" by Sig Lonegren and Patrick MacManaway and follow it with a "<a href="http://www.geocities.com/CapitolHill/2280/psitutor.html">Basic Dowsing Tutorial</a>" prepared by 16-year-old Michael Richards. <P>

Need balance? Read Robert Todd Carroll's definition in "<a href="http://wheel.dcn.davis.ca.us/~btcarrol/skeptic/dowsing.html">Skeptic's Dictionary</a>." If your browser supports RealAudio you might want to hear Debra Byrd and Joel Block's Oct. 2, 1995 "<a href="http://www.tpoint.net/earthandsky/1995/es951002.html">Water-Witching</a>" from the Earth & Sky radio program.<P>

Count me among the believing skeptics. I don't know how it works, or why it works but I have seen it work and I can therefore vouch for its reality. As my mother is fond of saying: "Just because I can't explain electricity doesn't mean I have to stay in the dark."<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Fashion Debuts on the Web</font></center></b>

<font size =4>


<center>by Kitty Williams</center>

Does choosing the right shade of nail polish matter to you -- a lot? Do you wonder if flared wide-wale brown corduroy hip-huggers with a fitted olive-green shirt would look great on you? Does an invitation to a wedding send you into a frenzy over what to wear? Well you are not alone. Far from it.<P>



If you're a 14-year-old trying to convince your parents to let you pierce you ears, a 27 year-old seeking advice on the best wardrobe for your new job as a corporate lawyer, a 44-year-old wondering about the newest trends in hairstyles, a 63-year-old trying to find a favorite Charles of the Ritz lipstick in a discontinued color or an 85-year-old interested in the fashion designers' new fall collections, you'll find advice, counsel, sympathy and news on the Web.<P>

Why not? Fashion and the Internet - it's a match made in pop-culture Heaven. Besides, we all spend hard-earned money on clothes and cosmetics -- CNN says beauty products, alone, are a $66 billion industry -- and we want to know what's in, what's out, what's new, and what everyone else is doing.<P>

One woman may feel terrific in the newest Paris style: another may prefer purple hair, multiple earrings, a gypsy dress and combat boots. A third may feel best in black cigarette-leg pants, a fitted black tee-shirt and black sneakers. It doesn't matter, as long as it feels appropriate for the occasion. <P>

 America Online has a whole "channel" devoted to fashion & style. Get there by clicking on the Style Channel button in AOL 3.0 or using the keyword Style.  There you'll find Style 911 for help on what to wear on Saturday night, if your taste runs to purple polyester suede hipsters or burgundy velvet boots. (To this fuddy-duddy, the pictures just show that a pretty young woman can wear just about anything and look fine.) <P>

Style 911 has segments on cool summer men's suits, mostly white, some double-breasted, probably not for that corporate lawyer. Then there are the message boards with questions and advice on all sorts of pressing questions, like what to wear to a concert of alternative music, what nail polish color is in this summer (pastels!?), and lots of hairstyle issues.<P>

If this seem silly, remember how important it was when you were 16. It's the online version of those endless "what are you going to wear to school tomorrow (or to the dance or to the party)" conversations.<P>

<img src=24x7.gif width=56 height=27 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

On the Internet, predictably, the choices are vast. You might as well start with the <a href="http://www.24x7.com/shop/dir~fash.htm">24x7 FASHION GUIDE</a>, a list of links to many of the best sites. Unfortunately, some of the links are out of date. But there are good ones, like <a href="http:www.fashion.net/">Fashion Net</a> with links to magazine sites, news groups, message boards modeling and photography services, job information, and best of all, <a href="http://www.fashion.net/fashionhouses.html">Fashion Houses</a>, the designers' official sites.<P>

<img src=klein.gif width=64 height=175 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

Don't overlook <a href="http://www.firstview.com/home.html">FirstVIEW</a>. For a healthy fee, you can subscribe and access photographs of the newest haute couture and ready-to-wear collections. Dozens of top designers are represented, including Armani, Chanel, Dior, Anne Klein, DKNY, Lacroix, Ungaro, Miu-Miu, Versace, Claude Montana, Givenchy, Valentino, and Saint Laurent. Photos of earlier collections are free, and they are well worth your time.<P>

<a href="http://www.users.wineasy.se/bjornt/lip.html">The Lipstick Page</a> is a whole page devoted entirely to lipstick. Maintained by Webmaster Madeleine Endre, it has color swatches for many brands of lipstick as well as the inside scoop on lipsticks of the stars. Other pages at the site include A World Tour of Cosmetics with a list of addresses and phone numbers of cosmetic companies around the world. There's Cosmetics Exchange Network, and a bulletin board for questions about quality and colors, and whether the various brands live up to their advertisements. This is where people find help in their searches for discontinued brands and colors. I had no idea there was so much to learn about lipstick. <P>

<img src=cnnstyle.gif width=250 height=30 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

The<a href="http://www.cnn.com/STYLE/">CNN Style Page</a> has up to the minute fashion news and even includes some <a href="http://www.cnn.com/STYLE/9607/01/dior/dior.couture.spring.96.mov">QuickTime Movies</a> which take about 60 seconds to download. A recent story "Wardrobe leads the way from welfare to work," provides food for thought. It's about two groups, one in Chicago and one in New York, that are helping women get off welfare by making sure "out-of-work women...look ready for success when interviewing for a job." You see, fashion isn't just about being pretty.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>World Yellow Pages Online<BR>Brings Back Useful Service</font></center></b>

<font size =4>


<center>by Robin Lind</center>

It is only human nature to yearn for simple tools we used in 'the good old days.' <a href="http://wyp.net">World Yellow Pages</a> Network (wyp.net) is a new "search engine" that restores one of those tools and it adds a whole lot more.<P>

Wyp.net cleverly combines existing technologies to create a new entity whose sum is greater than its parts. It promises to become a resource for finding complete yellow and white pages information from around the globe. <P>

Naturally, wyp.net (pronounced "Whip-Net") hasn't achieved its goal of creating or accessing the entire worldwide database of telephone numbers but it has done a mighty impressive job for North America.  Approaching its first anniversary, Wyp.net is still growing. By mid-March it had amassed more than 105 million white and yellow page listings for North America. <P>

Most of us remember when you could call the operator at Ma Bell and ask for someone's telephone number and then casually ask "Could you give me the street address?" Competition, cost-cutting and the invention of digital technologies that led to the present system of recorded directory assistance eliminated that helpful service.<P>

Fret no more. The information is now available through Wyp.net.<P>

Wyp.net lets you <a href="http://wyp.net/Search.html">search</a> for individuals (white pages) or businesses (yellow pages) by name and retrieve not only the telephone number but also the mailing address and -- if it's available -- the email address and URL (Web page address). <P>

You checked your own name and don't find your email address or URL? You can add them at no charge. Wyp.net offers a <a href="http://wyp.net/create.html">free Web Page</a> to businesses with name, address, telephone, fax, email, Yellow Page headings plus up to 300 words of description. If you want a more sophisticated Web page, Wyp.net offers customized <a href="http://wyp.net/Info/services/">design services</a> on an hourly basis. <P>

Got a telephone number but don't who it belongs to? Wyp.net lets you search by number and discover the name and address. <P>

Those features alone are impressive but there's more: Wyp.net has hooked its database into Vicinity Corporation's geo-mapping engine so you can find the actual physical location of the address you've looked up.<P>

You click on the "<a href="http://www.proximus.com">Get Address Map</a>" button, a map appears and a little red X marks the spot where your search target is located.<P>

<img src=webmap.gif width=268 height=247 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right><P>

If you're looking for a specific business, for instance, you can type in the name (we chose New York Times) and Wyp.net provided the information that the New York Times is located at 229 W. 43rd Street, New York, NY 10036 and the telephone number is 212-556-1234. "Get Address Map" provided a street map of downtown Manhattan with the red X on Times Square. You can zoom in or zoom out and view nearby areas by clicking on the compass. At 2000 feet to the inch scale, the map even has little grey arrows to indicate the directions of the one way streets.<P>

We tried a variety of businesses and individuals across the country, and got highly accurate results. (Actually the results in rural areas were within about a country mile but it's hard for even the post office to give better identifiers).<P>

Wyp.net's directory service is free. Its funding comes from a combination of advertising revenue and indirect subsidies from the founders' web development services.<P>

If you're are looking at investment potential and wondering whether this is an Internet startup that might one day be worth billions, Wyp.net is already a step ahead of you.<P>

They are toying with the possibility of giving away <a href="http://wyp.net/Info/shares/about.html">shares</a> in their company to everyone who creates and maintains a web page in Wyp.net. That's right, you have the opportunity to become a "Beta Shareholder" without having to invest any real dollars. You can become a virtual stockholder with virtual shares in a virtual startup without any financial risk. All you have to do is create a listing and maintain a valid email address: if you choose to become a virtual shareholder, your site gains a "Beta Shareholder" button with a link to your virtual stock certificate.<P>

Of course, Joan Kuentz and Edwin Rutsch, the home-office entrepreneurs who launched Wyp.net "on a shoestring" from a two-bedroom house in the San Francisco Bay area, are also toying with plans to conduct a public offering sometime in the future that involves real money and they'd be happy to be contacted if you want the "thrills and chills" that come with stock ownership in the real world.<P>

In the meantime, if you want an address, a zip code, a telephone number or even just the social cachet of having your own URL to mention on the cocktail circuit, Wyp.net is at your service.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Political Knowledge is Expanding on The Web</font></center></b>

<font size =4>


<center>by Kitty Williams</center>

In the summertime, when political candidates are taking turns releasing favorable opinion poll figures and revealing scandals about one another, we all get the feeling that we've been through this before--too many times to count.<P>

Candidates trade ritual insults and charges of unspeakable failure to understand what "the people" want. Is it any wonder that we, "the people," get bored with it all?<P>

What do I tell my 18-year-old son, who will vote for the first time this fall? Do I say that politics is an exercise in futility, perpetrated by windy egoists with a hunger for public exposure? <P>

To seek to be President of the United States or a Member of Congress can be neither easy nor fun. Every weakness is magnified and every strength discounted. <P>

Instead of putting these men and women down, it is important to pay attention to who they really are, and where they stand on issues. It is also important to disagree when it is appropriate and to strive constantly to separate the truth from the lies and the innuendoes.<P>

You have to keep track. Newspaper and television election coverage must offer a brand new story every day. If you don't pay attention, what happened yesterday may be gone forever, and what will happen tomorrow doesn't signify. <P>

Walk past a newsstand and scan the front page headlines. Are they all talking about the same world? Sometimes it seems they aren't.<P>

How can an 18-year-old make in informed decision? How can his parents?<P>

First of all we have to read the newspapers and magazines, watch the television news and stay current. There is also a growing role for the Web in helping voters figure out what is going on. <P>

<img src=nexus.gif width=175 height=29 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

A good starting place is <a href="http://dodo.crown.net/~mpg/election/96.html">Election Nexus</a> -- a non-partisan Internet resource center for the 1996 Presidential Election maintained by Michael P. Gonzales. This site lets you zero in on the presidential race, congressional races, election issues, and the political parties by providing hyperlinks to specific sites maintained by others. Election Nexus aims to be "a directory of election-related materials on the Web" and additional sites are added as they appear.<P>

<img src=showdown.gif width=175 height=54 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

Gonzales was also involved in the creation of iGuide's "<a href="http://www.iguide.com/pol_govt/showdown/index.htm">Showdown '96</a>"  which focuses "on the substance of the races themselves." Showdown lets you review and compare the <a href="http://dodo.crown.net/~mpg/election/tparties.html">candidates'</a> stands on specific issues. For instance, if you're interested in Firearms and Gun Control you might find it valuable to know that Republican Presidential Candidate Bob Dole got a 100 rating from the National Rifle Association in 1993-94 but a 0 rating from Handgun Control Inc. You can also search for relevant legislation passed or pending in Congress.<P>

Both sites also offer some <a href="http://dodo.crown.net/~mpg/election/humor.htm">humor</a> to leaven the mix: You can find links to bogus campaign pages, musical satire by the popular "Capitol Steps," and even a <a href="http://www.webcorp.com/polibabble.htm">random political speech generator</a> in the styles of President Bill Clinton, former Senator Bob Dole and Speaker of the House Newt Gingrich.<P>

If you want a more simplified approach, <a href="http://www.we.com/lgc/">A Layperson's Guide to Congress</a> has the basics you were taught (but may not have learned) in 10th grade government class. The Guide also has links to government and legislative information, including <a href="http://thomas.loc.gov">THOMAS: Legislative Information on the Internet</a>. If you want to let your representatives know how you feel, they give you ways to <a href="http://www.we.com/lgc/howmail.htm">contact them</a>. One source of email addresses is the <a href="http://www.berkshire.net/~ifas/activist">
Electronic Activist</a>, maintained by the <a href="http://www.berkshire.net/~ifas/index.html">Institute for First Amendment Studies</a>.<P>

Whatever your position on the political spectrum, you'll surely find something to suit you. The one major benefit of the Internet is this: it is becoming increasingly difficult -- if not impossible -- for a candidate to say one thing to one group and another thing to another. If it is said during the campaign, it will very likely show up on the Web.<P>

If you have a hankering for a general surf session on politics try the <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a> search engine. Scroll down on the front page to politics. Click. Go to Elections. Click. Carry on.<P>

If you subscribe to America Online use the keyword: Politics.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Manuals Aren't What<BR>They Used to Be</font></center></b>

<font size =4>


<I>(This is a column for fuddy-duddies. Propeller-heads need not read any further for enlightenment but it may give some younger readers an insight into old-timers who seem to uncomfortable with modern technology.)</I><P>

<center>by Robin Lind</center>




I have on my desk a slim, 6" x 7 1/2" 20-page manual that explains everything I need to know about one of my word processors. In fact, it has more than I thought I needed and I feel like a better person for having read it.<P>

The manual starts with instructions for Correct Posture and concludes with a gentle suggestion in favor of an annual maintenance contract. The intervening pages cover the functions, features, and benefits of the machine's advanced improvements. Every page has large graphics and easy-to-read, color-coded instructions. <P>

The final instruction tells me that "The smooth finish... is highly resistant to dirt and wear. It may easily be cleaned and restored to like-new condition by wiping with a damp cloth."<P>

When I compare this with the manual I have for newest word-processing program I want to weep for the decline of modern culture. It is a 9" x 7 1/2", 829-page behemoth. Forty-nine pages precede Chapter 1 where you get the first serious (?) instructions on how to use the software that's going to change your life.<P>

These days, for every "time-saving" feature added to modern software an office manager needs to factor in the significant cost of time that will have to be invested in teaching, training and retraining. Add to this the additional shelf-space for the manuals that accompany every program and its subsequent "upgrades" and you begin to wonder just what this is leading to. Where are we going?<P>

<img src=440.gif width=220 height=179 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left><P>

Well, I must confess that the first manual I mentioned is the 1966 literary delight that accompanied my Royal 440 typewriter: yes, a manual typewriter. The graphics might be considered a little dated (and sexist) in that the user is depicted as a female secretary whose dress reaches just below her knees and the repairman appears in a suit with sensible brown leather shoes carrying his hat in hand. Neither wears earrings and both have short hair. <P>

But the joy of the manual is its clear, concise language explaining exactly how to use the typewriter in the most efficient manner. For instance, did you know "At the end of each day it is a good practice to pull the Paper Release Lever forward so that the rubber feed rolls do not tend to develop flat surfaces."?<P>

You could read this manual in under half an hour and learn all you need to use the typewriter productively for a quarter century. The Royal 440 cost new the equivalent of a week's salary (the secretary' s salary, not the boss's). It worked without electrical or phone lines and was invulnerable to lightning and power surges. The only software required was a new ribbon and a bottle of Wite-Out once a quarter. It could handle multiple paper sizes including envelopes and index cards. It even had a copy feature that provided increased key-stroke pressure to produce multiple copies sandwiched between carbon paper sets.<P>

Now I ask you, was that great or what? <P>

IMHO it was an achievement in office productivity that we will likely never see again.<P>

<img src=flyingOliver.gif width=190 height=98 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right><P>

Skeptical? For youngsters who have never experienced the joys of working with a manual typewriter I can only suggest that you fire up your computer, log on to the Internet, point your browser to Richard Polt's superb <a href="http://xavier.xu.edu:8000/~polt/typewriters.html">Classic Typewriter Page</a> and have a look at some of the truly marvelous inventions that led us to where we are today.<P>

If you want to have some serious fun (and you have a java-enabled browser) follow the "Typewriter-Related Links" to <a href="http://user03.blue.aol.com/thingtone/workshop/spewtype.htm">SpewText Typewriter</a> where you can enjoy hearing your computer generate the clacking rhythms of the old manuals that used to accompany glorious productivity. <P>

Oh, be still my heart ...<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Birding on Beach and Web</font></center></b>

<font size =4>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


It's overcast, with an occasional spit of rain, here at the beach. From my window, I'm watching birds fishing in New England's Buzzards Bay, between New Bedford and Woods Hole, Mass. <P>

<img src=gull.gif width=130 height=156 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

Today I've seen perhaps 10 cormorants, a dozen terns and many seagulls. The two ospreys who fish this part of the bay haven't showed up, yet.<P>

When I woke at dawn, I watched five or six gulls -- some gray-winged, some black-winged-- evenly spaced at the shoreline, eagerly avoiding the waves while snapping up tasty tidbits. Were they eating periwinkles, or hermit crabs, or baby blue crabs? Maybe those weird little creatures I call diggers,  but I think are actually called sand lice.<P>

Each bird has a different fishing method. The small, elegant terns fly with their heads dipped down and their long, narrow wings extended, scrutinizing the sea. When small fish swim near the surface the terns fold their wings and plummet, splashing into the water like small rocks.<P>

The black, snake-necked cormorants ride low in the water. They submerge to fish, swimming underwater for a minute or so, before surfacing somewhere unexpected. I think I'll be able to spot their dark shadows underwater, but they hug the rocks and the seaweedy places where the little fish hide. Although they have a sinister grace in the water, cormorants aren't great flyers. They take off with maximum effort, paddling away at the water's surface for yards before becoming airborne. <P>

After a hard day's work, cormorants stand motionless on rocks with their wings outstretched to dry in the breeze. Their balance must be excellent, for they only sway slightly when the wind picks up, though I expect them to be knocked right over.<P>

Seagulls are somewhat more dignified and appealing on this quiet bay than they are in the carnival atmosphere of the ferry docks and shopping mall parking lots where they fight over hot-dog ends and Cheetos. I wake in the morning to peaceful gull talk, a kind of low, querulous conversation. <P>

In addition to their shoreline fishing dance, the gulls float about, occasionally paddling with their great feet. Their heads are in constant motion, hunting for food. Suddenly they'll upend, then come up with a beakful. I watched one who was so successful, that after several large wiggling things went down his gullet, he sank his head between his shoulders, the very picture of indigestion.<P>

This is a wonderful place for birders, whether keepers of lifetime lists or mildly well-informed amateurs, but both sorts of watchers can enrich their experience with a field trip on the World Wide Web.<P>

<img src=altavista.gif width=138 height=54 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

I switched from screened window to Windows on the computer screen and began an AltaVista search on "cormorant" which led me to "<a href="http://www.fastfwd.com/bird/species/home.html">List of Bird Species</a>." <P>

The list is not very useful, because although every conceivable bird is mentioned, there is
little or no information about any of them. One day, I guess. (Mark this as a nest under construction.)<P>

<img src=birdna.gif width=212 height=192 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

On that page, I clicked on Birds of North America. From there, I clicked the mysterious words "successive categorical refinements" that took me to <a href="http://www.fastfwd.com/bird/birdland.html">World wide Wingspan</a> where I found the tempting words "<a href="http://www.fastfwd.com/bird/joneslst.html">Other Internet Bird Resources</a>." There's where I struck gold with the bold declaration: "By far the most comprehensive World Wide Web bird site is ~Siler at UPENN." <P>

<img src=birding.gif width=290 height=183 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

"~Siler" was hyperlinked and took me to "<a href="http://compstat.wharton.upenn.edu:8001/~siler/birding.html">Birding on the Web: The Next Generation</a>", a site maintained by Jack Siler. His page has links to news of rare bird sightings, messages from other bird watchers, and to <a href="http://compstat.wharton.upenn.edu:8001/~siler/birdlinks.html">BirdLinks</a> -- with information about specific types of birds.<P>



Scrolling through his links, I got farther and farther from my original
quest, finding treasures like <a href="http://www.envirolink.org/orgs/wqed/bird_songs.html">Bird Songs from Cornell</a>, with pictures and downloadable audio files.<P>

True bird lovers will be interested in the <a href="http://www.acnatsci.org/bna/">Birds of North America</a> site with excerpts from the 18-volume series, to be completed in the year 2000, which will contain more than 700 species profiles when finished. It's a joint effort of  The American Ornithologists' Union (A.O.U.) and the Academy of Natural Sciences of Philadelphia.<P>

I also found <a href="http://www.netcom.com/~djhoff/shorebrd.html">The Shorebird Watcher</a>, through Siler's links. It's a compilation of information and links, specifically relating to birds like sandpipers that dash back and forth at the edges of the waves -- just the sort of unexpected treat that makes "birding" such fun in the wild.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Looking It Up Is Getting Easier</font></center></b>

<font size =4>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


That was often heard in our house when I was growing up. My mother and father loved foraging for information. <P>

My mother will still stop a conversation cold if a familiar word strikes her as suddenly strange. The huge dictionary that lay open on the library table at the house where we grew up, traveled, like a minor household god, to the place she lives now. As children, we'd graze through it and puzzle over word origins and multiple meanings. <P>

<img src=oed.gif width=78 height=86 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

When it became available, my parents bought the two-volume Oxford English Dictionary: we delighted in using the magnifying glass in a little drawer in the slipcover to read the impossibly tiny print. The OED isn't yet available online but <a href="http://www.oup-usa.org/">Oxford University Press</a> has a growing presence and you can order the "old-fashioned" printed versions online.<P>

<img src=eb.gif width=240 height=53 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

A 1958 <a href="http://www.eb.com">Encyclopedia Brittannica</a> didn't get dusty, either. We still consult it to our children's dismay. Though much of the information is out of date, newer editions just seem "dumbed down" to me. The Britannica is now available online (for a fee) but you can sign up for a seven day free trial if you want to try it out.<P>

Today, my mother has a PC and dabbles in the World Wide Web through America Online. She finds her connection slow and somewhat frustrating. Things are changing and improving fast though (a higher-speed access number is promised)  and soon, I think, she'll be able to forage happily on the Internet without so many irritating obstacles.<P>

I often wonder what my father would have made of the Internet if it had come along earlier or if he had come along later. It wouldn't have replaced the many magazines and newspapers he always loved, but I think it would have helped resolve countless family discussions. <P>

Questions were always coming up at our family's dining room table. My father had an amazing memory: he seemed to know the words to every poem he'd ever loved, to all of Shakespeare and Madame Butterfly, and -- at nearly 80 -- could name the states and their capitals in under 90 seconds. Still there were occasions when he didn't know an answer, and even if he did, he liked to have his knowledge confirmed.<P>

He also had an insatiable hunger for news. He read several daily newspapers, watched the 6:30 network news and the MacNeil-Lehrer News Hour on PBS every night, and seldom missed the Sunday "talking heads" programs like Meet the Press and Face the Nation.  His car radio was always set to news stations.<P>

The World Wide Web, as someone said to me the other day, is really a marvelous, comprehensive index to sources of information, and in that role, it would have pleased my father.<P>

<img src=altavista.gif width=138 height=54 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

It is not always easy find what you are looking for, but it is often enough to make it worthwhile. With a search engine like <a href="http://www.altavista.digital.com">AltaVista</a>, you can quickly answer the questions that come up during family gatherings: What are the words to the third verse of the <a href="http://adnet.net/hockey/usanthem.html">Star Spangled Banner</a>? When did <a href="http://lal.cs.byu.edu/people/black/dickinson.html">Emily Dickinson</a> die? How can you contact your congressman by <a href="gopher://una.hh.lib.umich.edu:70/11/socsci/poliscilaw/uslegi/congdir/state">email</a>? What did the Frogs say in <a href="http://the-tech.mit.edu/Classics/Aristophanes/frogs.sum.html">Aristophanes' play</a>? What are the <a href="http://www.spb.su/times/index.html">Russian papers</a> saying about the election? <P>

Our dining room hasn't yet evolved to the point of including a PC as part of the furniture but it wouldn't surprise me to see one someday. It's not that far-fetched to imagine the suggestion "Look it up" eliciting a quick web search: especially when our computers include voice recognition and text-to-speech response.<P>

I think my father would have liked it, if only he had been born a few decades later. I hope others like him who are lucky enough to live in this fascinating age of information aren't put off by all the hyperbole surrounding this "comprehensive index."<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Advertising Sites Are Proliferating<BR>And Getting Better</font></center></b>

<font size =4>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


Brand names. You see them everywhere, on billboards, T-shirts, caps and tote bags -- oh, yes, and on consumer products too.<P>

<img src=birdseye.gif width=199 height=81 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

How many brand names can you write down in 20 seconds?<P> Lets see: <a href="http://www.mcdonalds.com/">McDonald's</a>, <a href="http://www.wendys.com/">Wendy's</a>, <a href="http://www.ragu.com/">Ragu</a>, <a href="http://www.birdseye.com/">Birds Eye</a>, <a href="http://www.cocacola.com/">Coca-Cola</a>, <a href="http://www.pepsi.com/">Pepsi</a>, <a href="http://www.ford.com/">Ford</a>, <a href="http://www.toyota.com/">Toyota</a>, <a href="http://www.pella.com/">Pella</a>, <a href="http://www.levi.com/">Levi's</a>, <a href="http://www.jcpenney.com/">J.C. Penney</a>, <a href="http://www.ge.com/">GE</a>, <a href="http://www.att.com/">AT&T</a>, -- and that's just a random sampling from my own particular memory. <P>

<img src=wendys.gif width=80 height=86 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

Would you be surprised to learn that most of those companies are expanding their marketing effort to include Web sites? And that some of those Websites are bang-up displays of web design virtuosity? Well, they are. As the companies start getting on the Web advertising bandwagon, splashy corporate web sites spring up everywhere. <P>

The Internet is not just for academics and scientists anymore.<P>

Instead of full-page color ads like those in newspapers and magazines, the Web has spawned a new type of advertising. Companies design small , eye-catching logos with a brief, compelling message. They pay real money to popular, well-visited Websites like Yahoo, or the New York Times, to include the logo on their page. <P>

Interested consumers can click on the logo and be transported to the company's entire website. Some of these sites are as entertaining and eye-popping as the best non-commercial sites. Pick a product you like and see what you think. 
You can look for a specific company or product with a search engine, of course, but you can also make a game of it, testing your intuition against the web-wizards. Most product Websites have simple addresses made up according to the following formula: http://www.<companyname>.com. It's pretty simple. Try it.<P>

<img src=pepsi.gif width=242 height=84 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

First I went to <a href="http://www.pepsi.com/">Pepsi</a>. Now, just between us, I really don't like Pepsi -- I prefer "Adam's Ale" (water) -- but I enjoy all the soft drink ads on TV. <P>

Trying my formula for guessing corporate website addresses, I found myself in an elaborate environment, with a video game theme aimed at the younger set. There's a catalog of "free" stuff you can get for "purchase points" from Pepsi cans, and a lot more. It's intricate and extravagant, but slow loading. I decided I was too old for it! Have I graduated from "the Pepsi generation?"<P>

<img src=coke.gif width=242 height=43 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

To give equal time to the other major brown soda pop competing for my money, I visited the <a href="http://www.cocacola.com/">Coke</a> page. First I tried www.coke.com, with no success, but then I got there with www.cocacola.com. If one version of the name doesn't work, you can usually succeed with a common variation of the name. If Pepsi's pages are aimed at the 9 to 16-year-old crowd, the Coca-Cola pages are for the 18-35 crowd, I'd guess. They are fun and funny, with the same mix of company facts, logo-encrusted products for sale and entertaining, witty games and web tricks. Since Coca Cola originates in Atlanta, Georgia, you'll find a lot about the Olympics on this site, too.<P>

Next I went to the <a href="http://www.toyota.com/">Toyota</a> site. This is clean, clear and easy to navigate. With no trouble at all, I ordered a CD-ROM "brochure" of Toyota cars, which I expect in the mail any day now.  You can find tons of car information, here, as well as "lifestyle" sites including a very discouraging "gut calculator" designed to tell you how much weight you've gained today. Bleah.<P>

<img src=ford.gif width=119 height=45 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

<a href="http://www.ford.com/">Ford</a> is another page dedicated to providing first class information on choosing and purchasing a Ford vehicle. It's as glossy as those brochures you pick up at the dealer's. There's also a scavenger hunt in which you can win a two-year lease of a Ford Escort or Mercury Tracer by searching for clues throughout the site. Great idea -- only problem is it's a slow loader, and I lost patience before I got very far.<P>

One of the very first company Websites I visited, months ago, was the <a href="http://www.ragu.com/">Ragu</a> site: Mamma's Cucina. I still think it is one of the best and the most fun. There's an Italian cookbook, contests, information about Italian art and architecture and even Italian language lessons where you can learn how to ask your husband to wash the dishes and other useful phrases.<P>

Visit one of these sites, or try my formula to see where else you can get. And, don't ignore these sites -- even though they are blatant advertisements, some are paragons of Website design, and many are clearly worth the mega-bucks that have been spent on them.

<center><b><font size =6>Technology Can Bring<BR>Music to Your Ears</font></center></b>

<font size =4>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


I use my computer rather the same way I use my car. By that, I mean that although I know the basics of turning it on and telling it what I want from it, I have only a vague idea how it works.<P>

Though you can get quite far in a car or a computer without really knowing how it works, a computer can surprise you. Particularly if that computer has bundled software that you haven't explored or even noticed yet.<P>

The other day I discovered a whole new side to my Packard Bell PC. <P>

<img src=g&s.gif width=250 height=137 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

I was surfing the net when I found the <a href="http://diamond.idbsu.edu/gas/GaS.html">Gilbert and Sullivan Archive</a> page. Many of you will know <a href="http://diamond.idbsu.edu/gas/html/gilbert.html">William S. Gilbert</a> (1836-1911) and <a href="http://diamond.idbsu.edu/gas/html/sullivan.html">Arthur S. Sullivan</a> (1842-1900) wrote and composed a series of fourteen comic <a href="http://diamond.idbsu.edu/gas/html/GaSopera.html">operas</a> including the <a href="http://diamond.idbsu.edu/gas/pirates/html/pirates_home.html">Pirates of Penzance</a>, <a href="http://diamond.idbsu.edu/gas/mikado/html/mikado.html">The Mikado</a>, HMS Pinafore, and Iolanthe.<P>

The archives page has plot summaries, libretti, and the words and music to all the songs in the operas. Many of the operas have home pages with links to all the particulars. There's even a 1911 Baltimore Sun article about HMS Pinafore by famed Baltimore journalist H.L. Menken.<P>

Because this website contains the music to famous, but half-remembered songs like "A Wandering Minstrel I" and "I've got a Little List," I was anxious to download them. They are all in the MIDI format, which is quick to download and doesn't take up much disk space. <P>

MIDI is an acronym for Musical Instrument Digital Interface. When I looked around I found MIDI software was already on my computer. I never knew that. Look around on yours. If you don't have it and would like to find out more, visit the <a href="http://www.eeb.ele.tue.nl/midi/">MIDI Home Page</a>. Try to read <a href="http://www.eeb.ele.tue.nl/midi/intro.html">Introduction Into MIDI</a> there but let me warn you: the article is written in English, but that doesn't appear to be the author's first language. Understanding what he is saying takes a little intuition.<P>

I found the MIDI software on my PC in the Media Control program group. The program application is called mcontrol.exe, or if you open the file in Windows, you'll see the icon. Drag it to your desktop to create a "shortcut."  (People who read manuals probably already know all of this, but if you are like me, even when you read a manual, you don't always remember what you read when you need it.)<P>

When you download MIDI files, select "save to disk" when you are given the choice. If you don't want to waste disk space you can always delete them after you listen. Once they're saved, double-click on them and that should activate the MIDI player.<P>

You don't get CD quality music from MIDI -- it sounds more like an electronic keyboard, but it is satisfactory if all you want is to know how a song goes. You can download the music and read the lyrics as it plays. It's wonderful if you want a little private <a href="http://www.teleport.com/~labrat/karaoke.shtml">Karaoke</a> session, and great if you can imagine a famous singer and a great orchestra instead of the player piano plinkety-plonk of the MIDI files and your own untrained voice.<P>

(Actually, the quality isn't that bad: much depends on the speakers in your computer.)<P>

If Gilbert and Sullivan's work doesn't thrill you, you can download MIDI files from other internet sites. I liked the Computer Karaoke Home Page where you can download the words and the music to all sorts of popular songs, from Bette Midler's "The Rose" to "Silent Night" in German.<P>

If Karaoke sounds a little silly, you can find more than 2000 classical pieces in MIDI form at the <a href="http://www.prs.net/midi.html">Classical MIDI Archives</a>. Go to the index and click on the initial of the composer of your choice. <a href="http://www.prs.net/beethovn.html">Beethoven</a>'s Fur Elise took less than ten seconds to download, <a href="http://www.prs.net/bach.html">J.S. Bach</a>'s 12-minute long Brandenburg Concerto No. 2 took less than a minute.<P>

MIDI may be an older technology, but it's easy to use, fast, and, though the music might not be concert quality, it is clear and doesn't suffer from the hiccups and static of some of the more technically advanced, but still imperfect newer audio software.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Computers Let You Work Anywhere<BR> Even On Vacation</font></center></b>

<font size =4>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>
Like the paperless office, the transportable office is an enchanting, though not fully realized, aspect of the personal computer age. Men and women with laptops can be seen on beaches, on airplanes, in cars, and just about anywhere they can find a place to sit with a reasonably steady surface on which to perch their machines. <P>

As laptops get lighter and more powerful, the ratchet effect that accompanies all new technologies kicks in. A machine that six months ago was blindingly wonderful now seems poky and frustrating. As your expectations ratchet up, it is nearly impossible to accept an earlier status quo.<P>

<img src=model100.gif width=250 height=152 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

More than a decade ago - I don't remember exactly  -- I bought my very first laptop computer.  It was a Tandy Radio Shack Model 100 with 32K of memory - think of it! It had been invented by an international duo of computer wizards who were fascinated by the idea of portable computers: Kazuhiko Nishi of Japan and a college dropout from America named ... Bill Gates. Yes, the same Bill Gates of Microsoft fame.<P>

(In an <a href="http://innovate.si.edu/history/gates/gates35.htm">interview</a> with David Allison of the Smithsonian Institution Bill Gates admitted that the Model 100 is his favorite computer, partly because it was the last machine where he personally wrote "a very high percentage" of the code.)<P>

It could store dozens of telephone numbers or several pages of ASCII text. It had a 300 baud internal modem which would dial telephone numbers for me, and I could back data up on ordinary cassette tapes. <P>

I loved it. It was simple, weighed only a few pounds, and had a full-size keyboard. That the screen only could displayed a few lines of text on a reflective background didn't bother me at all. Graphics? Back then graphics were illustrations in magazines.<P>

Oh, yes, and you could get this little kit to silence the clicking keys if you didn't want to disturb people around you. It consisted of a tool to pry off the key tops and a bag of tiny rubber bands that you wrapped around the little metal  posts. When you snapped the top back on, the rubber band acted as a muffler. If you had a child in braces, you could ask the orthodontist for an extra bag of rubber bands, and use a butter knife to pry off the keys.<P>

Today, as I sit in a bright, breezy room on Cape Cod, with the noise of gentle wavelets caressing the sand and children playing on the beach coming through my window, I'm using much newer technology to allow me a "working vacation." I've borrowed a Packard Bell laptop and bought a 28.8 modem to connect me to the wide world. <P>

Until about a year ago, I worked for an international company with an entire staff to manage the 1000-computer network. When you needed to work away from the main office, you sent an email to the computer department to let them know. At the appointed time, you picked up a laptop with all cables, connectors and necessary software installed, and went into the world, a fully functioning employee of the mother company. I was spoiled.<P>

Now that I'm on my own, I suffer from high expectations, unsupported by those computer specialists. In other words, I had to figure out what I needed all by myself.<P>

At first I planned to rent a laptop from a local PC rental firm, but my sister and her husband offered to lend me their laptop. It's a nice machine -- it was state-of-the-art only a year or so ago. What a difference a year or so makes, though! My high expectations and my fast PC with lots of memory and a Pentium processor at home, combine to make this plain old 486 with four megabytes of RAM and a monochrome LCD monitor seem practically antique. I feel a little sheepish remembering how I loved my Model 100.<P>

Once the laptop was set up, the next question was how best to access the Internet. We bought a 28.8 modem (that's 28,800 baud per second, almost 100 times faster than the one in my first laptop) which came with diskettes from America Online, Compuserve and Spry Mosaic Direct. (I loaded the America Online, since it came with 15 free hours of access time.)<P>

America Online is fine, as far as it goes, but heavy-duty Internet users like me are better off with an Internet Service Provider and a Web browser like Netscape. It's faster,  cheaper, and Web pages look better. <P>

Before I left home, I called my own ISP, but they had no local access numbers I could use up here. That means I can't get to my emails until I go home. <P>

I went to <a href="http://www.thelist.com">"The List"</a> (an ever expanding list of ISPs nationwide that is maintained by Mecklermedia) and found a company in Cambridge, Massachusetts that was just setting up local access numbers in the Cape Cod area. The company, called Computer Internet Access, Inc. or The CIA for short, couldn't have been more helpful and interested. Signing on involves a simple phone call -- credit card in hand, natch. For a $20 sign up fee and $21.95 a month, they offer 100 hours of Internet access and your very own registered copy of Netscape. There are other options for lighter or heavier users.<P>

So now, here I am at the beach. If I start to sound a little Anne Morrow Lindbergh-ish, you'll know why.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>"The Home Spot" is <BR>A Real Estate Sweet Spot</font></center></b>

<font size =4>

<center>by Robin Lind</center>

Anyone who has ever dreamed of buying a home knows what a nightmare the experience can become.<P>

 Where do you start? Who do you ask? What do you look for? How do you find it? How do you choose a real estate agent?<P>

One day all your questions will be answered on the Internet. Today a very good example of what will be available is already online in southeast Florida.<P>

<a href="http://www.homespot.com/r0ss1.htm">The Sun-Sentinel</a>, a <a href="http://www.tribune.com/">Tribune Company</a> newspaper in Fort Lauderdale, has launched <a href="http://www.homespot.com/">The Home Spot</a>, an ambitious Web site that provides an extraordinary collection of resources for real estate buyers in the south Florida market.<P>

You can search for "<a href="http://sentinel.trinet.com/newsearch.html">new</a>" (just constructed) or "<a href="http://sentinel.trinet.com/mlssearch.html">resale</a>" homes. Specify a price range, the number of bedrooms and bathrooms, whether you want to see photos or not, and what community you prefer.<P>

 Don't know how to judge the communities? How about comparing their <a href="http://www.homespot.com/r2main.htm">resources</a>: beaches, business, dining and entertainment, crime rates, medical facilities, parks, schools, churches & synagogues, shopping, transportation, utilities or weather?<P>

How much home can you afford? Try the <a href="http://www.homespot.com/r4calc2.htm">financial calculator</a>. Enter information about your annual salary, and monthly payments for credit cards, car payments, student loans, alimony and the length of the loan period at an anticipated interest rate. Click the button and you get "Affordability Results:" how much you can afford to spend, including payments for property taxes and homeowners insurance.<P>

A helpful explanation of how lenders calculate your ability to pay your mortgage clarifies such arcane terms as PITI (principle, interest, taxes and insurance.)
And speaking of arcane terms, check out the <a href="http://www.homespot.com/r0gloss1.htm">Real Estate Glossary</a> where you can get simple definitions. (For instance, a "mechanic's lien" is not the posture you assume when you check your oil: it's "A payment owed to a contractor for work done on the property." and no, you don't want one on your new home.)<P>

 Found a house you like, in the community you want, but don't know whether the asking price is reasonable? <a href="http://sentinel.trinet.com/prevsearch.html">Compare prices</a> for homes recently sold in that specific community.<P>

 Looking for general advice? The Sun-Sentinel's three real estate columnists Joe Kollin, Mark Bogen and John Maines offer <a href="http://www.homespot.com/r4main.htm#moremore">advice</a> on home owning, legal matters and home repairs in the regular newspaper and their columns are archived here with their email addresses so you can even drop them a line if you want to.
 A real estate professional <a href="http://www.homespot.com/r3main.htm">directory</a> allows you to browse listings of agents, companies and company offices. You can print out a helpful form to compare different agents if you're having difficulty deciding who may be more qualified.<P>

 Got enough information? Wait there's more.<P>

Remember, the Home Spot is a cutting edge Web site.<P>

You can get <a href="http://www.homespot.com/r2zone.htm">profiles</a> of general areas, a <a href="http://www.homespot.com/r2city1.htm">map</a> of communities, <a href="http://www.homespot.com/r2comp1.htm">home price comparisons</a>, overviews and (this is a little much) the opportunity to download a <a href="http://www.homespot.com/r2main.htm#mov">virtual reality video</a> of Fort Lauderdale's beach.<P>

 You'll need QuickTimeVR to view it but the application is there for a free download. Once you've got it installed -- not that easy -- you can have the fun of looking around in a complete circle from beach to city to beach again. You can even zoom in on the sunbathers, right up to their individual pixels, if your computer doesn't crash with the effort.<P>

 Another neat feature is the promise of a real estate agent describing a property in her own voice, using RealAudio. We can only guess that it's neat and popular because in successive attempts we got locked out with the message "All streams for that URL are in use now. Please try again later."<P>

Even if you aren't in Florida, you can have some fun and learn something, too, here. It's very likely The Tribune Company will be offering the Home Spot in other markets soon and, competition being what it is, other real estate Web sites as good as or better will follow.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Six Museums and a Restaurant<BR>Touring on The Internet</font></center></b>

<font size =4>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>

Either you loved school field trips or you hated 'em. If you loved 'em and you miss 'em, here's a site for you. (Science and history teachers will like it too.) <P>

<img src=expo.gif width=259 height=118 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

"<a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/expo/">EXPO, a WWW Exhibit Organization</a>," is a collection of six exhibits -- drawn mostly from the collections of the Library of Congress -- and a restaurant. There is also a <a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/expo/expo/bookstore.html">bookstore</a> where you can find how to order exhibit catalogues.<P>

As with any good museum, a visit to each exhibit is really worth a couple of hours. Don't try to speed through this, because you'll miss something wonderful. Each exhibit is also presented in outline form, if you prefer to devise your own itinerary.<P>

The site is set up as a series of stops along the route of a <a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/expo/expo/busstation.html">shuttle</a> bus. Pick up the shuttle at the station, and choose your first stop: the Vatican Pavilion, the Soviet Pavilion, the 1492 Pavilion, the Dead Sea Scrolls Pavilion, the Paleontology Pavilion, or the Spalato Pavilion.<P>

The <a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/expo/vatican.exhibit/Vatican.exhibit.html">Vatican Pavilion</a> contains material from the Library of Congress and is divided into several "rooms." Choose between Vatican Library, archaeology, humanism, music mathematics, nature, or several others. Each room has a well written introduction to a collection with links to more information and fascinating images. In the Library, you'll see maps showing the revival of Rome from devastation in the 14th century to the Renaissance city it became in the next two centuries. You can look at Greek and Latin manuscripts and other treasures, and read a love letter from Henry VIII to Anne Boleyn. <P>

<img src=soviet.gif width=156 height=158 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

In the <a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/expo/soviet.exhibit/soviet.archive.html">Soviet Pavilion</a>, formerly  top secret papers provided by the Russian Archival Committee to the Library of Congress, include material from archives of the Central Committee, the Presidential archive, and the KGB, dating from the October Revolution of 1917 to August 1991. You can read original documents about everything from Stalin's repression to Perestroika, from early cooperation between the U.S. and the U.S.S.R. to the Cuban Missile Crisis. Displays in the exhibit include images of the actual documents, accompanied by translations.<P>

<img src=1492.gif width=193 height=183 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

"<a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/expo/1492.exhibit/Intro.html">In 1492: An Ongoing Voyage</a>" is an in-depth look into the Western Hemisphere (before travelers from the Mediterranean arrived) comparing it to the Mediterranean world of the late 15th century. It also examines the nature and long term effects of the initial contacts between various peoples whose descendants now inhabit the American continents.<P>

<a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/expo/deadsea.scrolls.exhibit/intro.html">Scrolls from the Dead Sea</a>: The Ancient Library of Qumran and Modern Scholarship tells about the discovery of the scrolls, and their significance. It is illustrated by scroll fragments with translations, and images of  sandals, pottery, limestone measuring cups, textiles, and silver coins. The introduction has links to maps showing the locations of the various sites in the Dead Sea region, as well as to other materials relating to the scrolls in the Library of Congress collections. <P>

 A visit to <a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/expo/paleo.exhibit/paleo.html">The Paleontology Pavilion</a> may take all day. You begin by choosing  to explore either phylogeny, "the family tree of life," Geologic time or Evolutionary thought. The introductory page describes it best: "The exhibit might be visualized as starting at the center of a museum with halls spreading in each direction.... Unlike normal hallways, the hallways you are following are actually the path that evolution is supposed to have taken." You won't get lost, though, because each page has a navigation bar at the bottom that allows you to go anywhere on the site.<P>

<img src=split.jpeg width=286 height=140 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

The final pavilion is an archaeological and historical exploration of the <a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/expo/palace.exhibit/intro.html">Palace of the Roman Emperor Diocletian</a> at Split or Spalato on the Adriatic Coast. It has lots of information and photographs, but may be the least compelling of all the Expo pavilions.<P>

<img src=cordonbleu.gif width=87 height=171vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

Don't leave Expo without a visit to the wonderful <a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/expo/restaurant/restaurant.html">Restaurant Le Cordon Bleu</a> if you are interested in food and food preparation. It has history, menus and recipes from the Paris cooking school, Le Cordon Bleu, as well as pictures, tips and instructions on techniques used. Yum!<P>

<center><b><font size =6>When the Going gets Tough, <BR>The Tough go Shopping!</font></center></b>

<font size =4>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


When I'm faced with random chaos and difficult problems, I'm like most women -- I get an urge to shop.<P>

The other day when the urge hit, I decided to take a virtual shopping trip on the Internet. I was pleasantly surprised by what I found.<P>

The last time I ventured on an Internet shopping trip, I was frustrated. Long downloads, ugly pictures, unclear instructions, and fear of transmitting my credit card information combined to make it a never again experience.<P>

Now I'm back to repeat James Bond's advice: "Never say 'never again.'"<P>

Either I've gotten a whole lot better at navigating the Web, or the Web has improved, but Internet shopping is a lot easier and a lot more fun than I remembered. A variety of browsers, like Netscape have vastly improved security for credit card shoppers.<P>

A great place to start on your shopping trip is <a href="http://www.pointcom.com/">Point.</a><P>

Point. rates and reviews thousands of Websites of every description. Click on "View Top 5% by Category" for a list from Arts & Humanities to The World. Click "<a href="http://www.pointcom.com/gifs/shopping/">Shopping</a>", and you'll go to the following list: Apparel, Autos, Books, Entertainment, Flowers and Gifts, Food and Drink, Grab Bag, Home, Hobbies, Kids Stuff, Office and Technology, Real Estate, Travel, and Virtual Malls.<P>

Choose and click. Sites in each category are described briefly and rated by content, presentation and experience. If one sounds intriguing, click on the title to read the review. If it sounds good, you can then go to the site. This may sound like a lot of steps, but in fact it's a real time saver. You don't have to load a whole site in order to find out what's there. You can quickly eliminate those with misleading names.<P>

I explored several of the categories, and found Point.'s guidance extremely helpful, though not flawless. There are many well organized sites selling a mind-boggling variety of products, but you have to be prepared for sites to have vanished or moved without forwarding addresses.<P>

<img src=landsend.gif width=220 height=101 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

Under Apparel, I found my old friend <a href="http://www.landsend.com">Lands' End</a>. Their website is no substitute for the old-fashioned paper catalogs, but it's a good introduction to Internet shopping. The site is easy to navigate and order from. If you have special questions, you can email them. There is pretty good selection and the pictures download promptly. The site also includes a useful guide to help women choose the most flattering and comfortable swimsuit.<P>

<img src=balduccis.gif width=248 height=75 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

I then visited the Food and Drink list. <a href="http://www.balducci.com/">Balducci's</a> site caught my eye first. The Greenwich Village specialty food store is the place to spend lots of money on wonderful-sounding food. You can buy $300 worth of caviar or a $135 Beef Wellington. Once you get over those prices, everything else seems reasonably priced: four pounds of Eggplant Parmigiana for $38, or a jar of Pomodoro Condito for $6. Warning: you aren't hit with the whopping shipping and handling charges until you are ready to check out. I assembled a $27 order. When I saw the additional charges totaled $13.50, I'm afraid I left my virtual shopping cart at the virtual check out counter and did a virtual bunk.<P>

 Even if your credit card goes limp, food lovers should visit the site just for the mouthwatering descriptions and the wonderful pictures. Whatever the prices, Balducci's knows food.<P>

<a href="http://www.farmdirect.com">@Farm Direct Marketplace</a> has beautiful pictures, a wonderful selections of fresh produce and specialty items. All its bells and whistles gave my machine indigestion, though. (On a Java-enhanced browser this site opens with a lively country-music tune produced by the new "Crescendo" plug-in which can be startling to say the least!) <P>

Under Grab Bag, I found <a href="http://203.13.34.98/index.html">Australian Shopping Gateway Homepage</a>, a fascinating glimpse into shopping down under, from crafts and clothing to the most exotic foodstuffs and <a href="http://www.cmcc.muse.digital.ca/cgi-bin/cmc.cgi">Cyberboutique</a>, access to Canadian museum shops (available in both English and French.)<P>

If you know exactly what you are looking for, you might have the best luck with <a href="http://www.shopfido.com">Fido the Shopping Doggie</a>, a shopping search engine. You enter a description and price range for product you want, click "Submit" and within a few seconds Fido comes back with a list from its fairly large database. It's fun to try.<P>

CyberChambers:<BR></b> <font size =6>Newcomers to the Labyrinth<BR> of Business Information</font></center></b>

<font size =4>

<center>by Kitty Williams and Robin Lind</center>

The World Wide Web is a natural place for regional, national and international business development: its very nature nourishes connections between folks trying to do business in every type of marketplace. <P>

But researching business opportunities with the help of the Internet can still be a little more daunting than many are used to. <P>

Metaphors for the Web and the Internet are spiderwebs and fishing nets; labyrinths and mazes might be more precise, at least for beginners seeking business information. <P>

There are many obstacles and distractions for one thing and much promised that is not (yet) delivered, for another.<P>

Fortunately, guideposts to this economic adventure are going up fast and, as you might have expected, Chambers of Commerce are in the vanguard.<P>

A good place to start is the <a href="http://www1.usa1.com/~ibnet/chamshp.html">Global Network of Chambers of Commerce & Industry</a>, with links to "more than 725 live Chambers and Associations of Chambers" in Oceania, the Americas, Africa, Asia, Europe and the MidEast. You can search by country and by state. More chambers appear on the list every week. If you're looking to expand your business this is a site to bookmark and return to.<P>

Unfortunately this is also a site where much is promised that is not yet delivered. <P>

True, more than 725 chambers are listed but you may not find your local chamber, nor even some of the largest; 15% of Global Network's links are to sites in California: an indication of how far ahead of the rest of the nation the gold rush state continues to be.<P>

In order to be functionally useful one might expect a "global network" to provide a search engine capable of producing results based on economic or demographic indices. Unemployment statistics might help. The local labor force education levels would be a useful comparative tool. Perhaps a "livability index" that rated communities on assets such as symphony, theater or low crime rates would help businesses seeking new locations. A good start might even be to have Chambers agree on a standard format for information. Sorry, it's not here. <P>

Chambers of Commerce are naturally interested in blowing their own horns but this collection of sites has so many horn blowers in different bands the noise drowns out the tunes. Some Chambers have little or no graphics. Some have graphics that take such a long time to load you'd swear your computer has seized up. The quality of the sites runs the gamut from inexcusable to laudable.<P>

Inexcusable? Any site (and there are plenty) that has a link to a page that displays a highway department icon and says "Under Construction." Hunnh?<P>

<img src=nunavut.gif width=102 height=150 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left><P>

Laudable? You'll find it hard to believe but one of the very best (which describes itself modestly as "one of the northernmost chambers of commerce on the planet") is <a href="http://www.nunanet.com/~brcc/">Baffin Region Chamber of Commerce</a> in Canada's Northwest Territories which will soon become the territory of "Nunavut."<P>

Baffin Region's Chamber offers press releases and discussion papers, news, election results, a FAQ sheet about Nunavut and <a href="http://www.nunanet.com/~nic/demogsandsocioecon.html">demographic and socio-economic information</a> on Nunavut communities including population, ethnic composition, population by sex, age, mother tongue and households.<P>

If you're considering locating a business or launching a new product line this is the sort of information that is essential and valuable. It's the sort of data you'd expect to get from a Chamber and could tip the balance in your final decision.<P>

(Want to consider Nunavut? You'll need to have a mighty specialized product because there are only 11,385 people in 2,615 households in this territory that's larger than the state of Texas. The have only 460 residents with University degrees, an average income of $28,598 and an unemployment rate of 20%. At least their chamber has a solid understanding of the value of information and the World Wide Web.)<P>

In addition to all those chambers, the Global Network of Chambers of Commerce & Industry has links to <a href="http://www1.usa1.com/~ibnet/gbxintro.html">GBX -- The Global Business eXchange¨</a>, <a href="http://www1.usa1.com/~ibnet/icchp.html">International Chamber of Commerce</a> -- The World Business Organization ¨, and <a href="http://www1.usa1.com/~ibnet/index.html">International Business Network -- The Electronic Silk Road ¨</a>. <P>

The first, GBX, is a global network with a database of online (or soon to be online) business opportunities and services for small and large businesses. <P>

The second, International Chamber of Commerce, contains an introduction to the organization and an index with links to information about programs and services.<P>

The third, International Business Network -- The Electronic Silk Road ¨, describes itself as "a global trade route dedicated to the exchange of business information and the facilitation of international trade offering you the centuries of experience and services of the worldwide network of Chambers of Commerce and Industry." <P>

The IBNet page contains links to financial & economic service providers, merchants & commercial service providers, trade promotion & related organizations, and newswires & research tools. Although these lists may not be a complete inventory of the tools and sources on the Web, they are a beginning.<P>

Also linked to these pages are alphabetical lists, by acronym, of intergovernmental and international organizations.<P>

Chambers of Commerce show a range of sophistication but many are (unfortunately) still works in progress: It is clear that one day Global Network will offer one-stop shopping for all sorts of data. At present you can enjoy (mostly) just the promise of things to come.<P>

<I>"Timothy Leary's dead. No, no, no, he's outside, looking in."</I> -<a href="http://kbt.com/moodies/mxsearch.html">The Moody Blues</a>, Legend of a Mind<P>
<center><b><font size =6>"Timothy Has Passed"</font><br></b>
</center>
<center>by Kitty Williams</center>




Twenty-eight years after the song came out, Timothy Leary is finally dead. <P>

The guru of psychedelia, and former Harvard professor died May 31 of prostate cancer that was diagnosed in January, 1995. <P>

Although his home page has now posted the message "Timothy has passed" he lives on in cyberspace, and it is we who are on the outside looking in. The <a href="http://www.leary.com/">entry page</a> to his Web site shows him holding a "cigarette" and -- for those with Java-enhanced Web browsers -- a lighter flickers in his left hand, a plume of smoke rising above him.<P>

He was ravaged by disease and finally confined to a wheelchair, but Timothy Leary didn't go off and deal privately with his illness. <P>

Quite the opposite. With the help of a group of young admirers he put together the <a href="http://www.leary.com/home/Enter.html">Timothy Leary Home Page</a> on the Internet. Since his death, the page has been hard to get to because so many have stopped by to visit and leave messages<P>

Until the end, Leary, remained an advocate of "neuro-active drugs," both legal and illegal, as a means of expanding one's consciousness. His 1960s message to "turn on, tune in, and drop out," was guaranteed to give parents cold chills.<P>

During his illness, he immersed himself in the process of his own dying. He was working on a book, "<a href="http://www.leary.com/news/columns/UltimateTrip.html">The Ultimate Trip: A Manual for Designer Dying</a>," to be published by Harper Collins in the spring of 1997.<P>

An online summary provides a clue to the book's content and a sampling of his latest "cyberspeak" thinking: "I am developing methods and technologies to delay the ultimate onset of pain, coma, helplessness, and indignity which await. Hi-Tech Designer Dying is occupying most of my time, " he wrote.<P>

Responding to his own question of where personal consciousness is located, Leary wrote "One's personal consciousness is stored in the nervous system. The brain is the hardware, the biocomputer which fabricates and navigates the realities we inhabit. The software systems which operate the brain are the programs, directories, files and personal operating systems which define the individual soul."<P>

During the past several months Web surfers could tune in to the state of his physical and emotional health, and his regularly changing plans to cope with his inevitable decline. At one point, he announced that he would commit suicide on the Web. His death was reportedly to be videotaped and there was some talk of the film being made available through the site.<P>

The site is set up as a virtual "home:" his own house. The front door opens and Leary steps out to greets you. You are invited to take a guided tour, join the "never-ending cyber party or explore the various "rooms."<P>

As you might expect, a visit to Leary.com is a very strange experience. Images of the gauntly handsome. white-bearded Leary, usually with a lit cigarette (?) in hand are everywhere - including in his "zippy hot rod wheel-chair," on the wall of his Cyber Room, and on the couch in his living room.<P>

In addition to marketing for the Manual and Leary's other published works, the Home Page is a multi-purpose potpourri of personal papers, plugs for friends' art and music, and <a href="http://www.interverse.com/cgi-bin/chatline/chatline.pl?user=leary&to_do=index">chitchat</a> of the "Oh, Wow!" variety. The <a href="http://www.leary.com/HealthChart.html">chart</a> of his daily intake of legal and illegal drugs was kept up to date until May 16. <P>

The way the site is organized makes one think that kindly, but not necessarily analytical, volunteers worked their way through dusty file cabinets and shoe boxes full of photographs, typing letters, scanning pictures, and shoveling the whole lot into the site. <P>

Traveling through the house, you can click on pictures on the wall for more information about his art collection. A lifetime of <a href="http://leary.com/archives/photo/PhotoArchives.html">family photographs</a> is available in the Art Archive. In the library, you can read old letters from his Harvard days.<P>

There are photographs of Baby Tim and his mother, 3-year old Tim and his father, photographs of Tim as he ages, with his various wives, children and celebrity friends including John Lennon and Yoko Ono, Alan Ginsberg and Jack Kerouac. <P>

It's a little like rifling through a box of photographs at an estate sale or an antique store.  I long to know the stories behind the photos, but they remain a mystery. Did Leary ever take time to analyze his own life and write about it? There no sign of introspection here.<P>

This site might be a pioneer effort at using the Web to create autobiography. Who will be the next well-known personality to put their personal papers on the Web instead of donating them to some deserving university?<P>

Think of it: what if Richard Nixon or Lyndon Johnson had lived in the age of the Internet, and after their presidencies had devoted time and energy into interactive Websites like this one instead of glass and metal Presidential Libraries? <P>

As Leary might have said, "It would be mind-blowing!"<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Paranoia: <BR>The Mad Axeman Lives!</font></center></b>

<font size =4>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>



Was the mass suicide at Jonestown an exercise in CIA mind control? <P>

Did Jesus Christ survive the crucifixion, move to France and found the Merovingian dynasty? <P>

Has the three decades-old investigation into the assassination of President John F. Kennedy been nothing more than a "really good cover-up"?  <P>

Why is NASA hiding the fact that the Moon's atmosphere is breathable? <P>

Did <a href="http://www.conspire.com/buchrant.html">Hillary Clinton</a> spy for the Israeli Secret Service?<P>

What about aliens? UFOs? <a href="http://www.fn.net/~kbcenter/kbchom~1.htm">Bigfoot?</a> Workplace monitoring?<P>

<P>

Do these questions quicken your pulse or boil your blood? <P>

Whether you are willing to suspend your disbelief for the thrills and chills of unbridled paranoia, or you merely want to know how people can believe this garbage, you will be edified by a visit to <a href="http://www.conspire.com">The 50 Greatest Conspiracies of All Time</a> Website. (If paranoia consumes you, you'll be mildly annoyed by the undercurrent of gentle skepticism.)<P>

Paranoia is a growing industry. Just ask the deadpan duo Scully and Mulder of <a href="http://www.conspire.com/xlink.html">The X-Files</a> television show. It may be nostalgia for childhood, when all we needed was a good mad-axeman-ghost story to electrify the hairs on the backs of our necks. Or it may all be true. <P>

 As Shakespeare's Hamlet said: <center><I>"There are more things in heaven and earth, Horatio,</center><center>Than are dreamt of in your philosophy."</center></I><a href="http://the-tech.mit.edu/Shakespeare/Tragedy/hamlet/hamlet.1.5.html#191">Hamlet, Act 1, Scene 5</a><P>

Jonathan Vankin and  John Whalen, authors of the 50 Greatest Conspiracies book, published by Citadel Press, and producers of this website hope to cash in on the paranoia boom.<P>

Here you can read chapters from the book, and several that didn't make the final cut. They are well written and researched,  gracefully straddling the line between scorn and gullibility. If you are hungry for more, you can buy the whole book.<P>

The book isn't all. A tour of the site is entertaining -- and a tiny bit touching. You may even sympathize with the Kennedy conspiracy addicts, doggedly pursuing aged details, though the cold war is over and the rags and tags of Camelot dispersed under the auctioneer's gavel.<P>

And aliens. Over the years, I have know several nice people who would jump at the chance to ride in a Martian spaceship with super-intelligent beings from another world. <P>

Touching or ridiculous, real or imagined, conspiracies are here to stay. The cry goes up: "This can't be all there is to it! Surely the truth is out there, if only 'they' would stop trying to hide it from us!"<P>

Some cover-ups detailed on this page are actually true, including the pact among Dead Sea Scroll scholars to conceal their discoveries. Apparently established Christian dogma was thought to be endangered by the early writings. <P>

Another paranoia based in reality is rendered in uncomfortable detail in "<a href="http://www.conspire.com/bigboss.html">Big Boss is Watching You</a>" Employers, frightened that employee theft and goldbricking is eating up their profits, can now covertly monitor productivity. "In an office hardwired with a server-based local area network managed by software such as Microsoft LAN Manager, a technically inclined boss or network administrator can turn any employee workstation into a covert surveillance post," they write. If you work in an office, read the whole thing. You'll never feel alone again.<P>

The site has in depth information about conspiracies and cover-ups in the news, including the Tokyo subway nerve gassing trial and coverage of the <a href="http://www.conspire.com/metic.html">Unabomber</a>. For short blurbs on just about any conspiracy you can think of, go to <a href="http://www.conspire.com/updates.html">Conspiracy Currents</a>.<P>

One note: Make sure you haven't set your Netscape browser to override the background colors, or you'll miss some remarkable fuschias, oranges, and lime greens unknown at more sedate Websites. Also not to be missed is the green, pulsing alien autopsy graphic.<P>

If The 50 Greatest Conspiracies of All Time leaves you hungry for more, check their links to other sites of interest. For example, <a href="http://www.xensei.com/users/john9904/">Aliens, Aliens, Aliens</a> is a must see site,. If you go, don't miss <a href="http://www.xensei.com/users/john9904/pagecost.html">The Human Factor</a> detailing the economic cost of time wasted browsing the site. As they say, even paranoids have real enemies!<P>

Whether you are like me and just love books or are in the book business and are trying to figure out a way to compete with the mega-stores and category-killer discounters you should take a look at the <a href="http://www.bookwire.com/">Bookwire</a> website. <P>

The site is a wonderful repository for links to information that would interest anyone whose business or pleasure is books. Bookwire lists 900+ publishers, 500+ booksellers, 500+ libraries and more than a thousand other resources. They boast more than "3500 categorized links to book sites around the world."<P>

See "Authors on The Highway" for upcoming readings, signings and appearances across the country; check Publishers Weekly for current bestseller; and visit Websites maintained by Quarterly Black Review of Books, The Boston Book Review or Hungry Mind Review where you can send a free literary <a href="http://www.bookwire.com/hmr/send.HRMcards">Postcard</a> by email.<P>

Bookwire has a wide number of sponsors, including many big name publishers such as American Psychiatric Press, Inc., Audiobooks.com, Columbia University , HarperCollins, Houghton Mifflin Interactive, International Thomson Computer Press, Macmillan Online, McGraw Hill, Penguin, Publishers Weekly, Putnam Berkley, Random, RR Donnelley & Sons Company, and John Wiley & Company.<P>

As well as wonderful links to libraries, booksellers, and other book resources, there are links to the web pages of each of the sponsors. It's almost as much fun as spending an hour or two at a great bookstore. All of their home pages are worth a visit for news of new releases, interviews with authors, entertainment and shopping information.<P>

<img src=stonediaries.gif width=130 height=194 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left><P>

Anyone who read and loved Carol Shields' Pulitzer Prize and Canada's Governor General Award winning novel, "<a href="http://www.penguin.com/usa/catalogs/stone_diaries/">The Stone Diaries</a>" should go to <a href="http://www.penguin.com/usa">Penguin's</a> site. They've made a big splash about her with an online Readers Guide to the book. <P>

If fiction isn't your bag, you can preview self-help sites such as <a href="http://www.penguin.com/usa/electronic/sat/index.html">Penguin's "Acing the New SAT CD-ROM"</a>.<P>

The information available through Bookwire is not just limited to books published over the last few years. You can access antiquarian booksellers like the fabled <a href="http://www.blackwell.co.uk/bookshops/rarebooks/">Blackwells</a> in Oxford England where you can search by title, author and subject. Still yearning for your own copy of Samuel Johnson's 1779-81 "Lives of the Poets"? They've got a 10-volume first edition for only £3,500. And you can order online!<P>

A great resource is the small but growing list of US libraries who have put their entire card catalogues online. Does your local, nearby college or state library have that book you're looking for? Search in the <a href="http://www.bookwire.com/index/US-libraries.html">US Libraries Index</a> by title, author or publisher. Call up and reserve it or have it sent to your local library by Inter-Library loan.<P>

If you like to read books on-screen, or if you want to print them out on your own printer (each to his own), you can go to the <a href="http://www.bookwire.com/links/readingroom/readingroom.html">Bookwire Reading Room</a> where you'll find links to copyright-free electronic fiction, non-fiction, reference and children's books.<P>

<img src=pob.jpeg width=136 height=200 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right><P>

Is there an author whose works you'd like to discuss? Look on the Bookwire Author-Specific Mailing List Index which provides Web addresses (and simple instructions on how to subscribe) for active discussion lists on authors from Theodor Adorno to Mark Twain. (One of the 20th century's greatest writers --<a href="http://www.wwnorton.com/pob/poblist.htm">Patrick O'Brian</a>-- whose works are the topic of an active listserv discussion, is not on this list, so keep looking if you don't find what you want here.) <P>

There's a <a href="http://www.bookwire.com/links/lit/lit.listserv.html">Literary Mailing List Index</a>, with a topics ranging from philosophical fiction to medieval performing arts to Renaissance and Baroque Hispanic poetry to curriculum development.<P>

From Bookwire, I followed links to the American Booksellers Association home page,  <a href="http://www.ambook.org">BookWeb</a>, "a complete resource for news and information about books, bookstores, authors, the First Amendment, and much, much more!" They have a great <a href="http://www.ambook.org/bookweb/sellerlist/">bookstore directory</a> which allows you to search within the United States or abroad. Each member bookstore's address, hours, and phone numbers are listed, and a link to their web page is provided where one exists.<P>

So, what do you do if you're a dedicated bookseller with a devoted following in a small market but have only 15,000 titles in stock? How are you going to compete against someone like <a href="http://www.amazon.com">Amazon</a> that is offering 1.1 million titles online?<P>

Take heart. Put a computer out front in your reading room and show your patrons how to use it to access Bookwire. The big boys like Amazon may indeed have the titles but they don't necessarily have them in  stock: they're asking customers to wait 4-6 weeks while they go through the ordering process. You can order it just as quickly as they can and, while you're helping your customer decide what to order, you still have the opportunity to suggest another great book from your stock to fill in the time while she's waiting. ;-)<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Cicada Spring:<BR>Sound the Alarm!</font><br></b>
</center>
<font size=4>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


About a week ago the 17-year cicadas emerged from the ground around our house in rural Virginia's James River Valley.<P>

<img src=cicadaart.gif width=148 height=166 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left>

At first only a few of the brownish, thumb-sized bugs were clinging to shrub branches and the underside of the porch. They shed their husks and hung quietly while their transparent Art Nouveau wings straightened and dried.<P>



Several days later I saw 50 or more cicadas hanging from the branches of an autumn olive bush, some still in their shells, others resting from the exertion of shedding. Scattered half-inch holes showed where they had emerged from the ground.<P>

As I marveled at the never-ending lessons of country living I heard a distant burglar alarm sounding off through the woods. Approaching subdivisions bring the possibility of neighbors ever closer and we cherish our time with nature's wonders.<P>

The next morning, when we awoke pre-dawn, the burglar alarm was still going: a high-pitched mechanical buzz in a steady rhythm  of insistent irritation. We grumbled about city people who wire up their houses as if they still lived in the crime-ridden suburbs and then go off for the weekend. Until the security company sends someone out to shut their alarms off, our country peace is demolished. We were annoyed. <P>

The alarm kept sounding.<P>

Worried that someone might actually be in trouble, we walked out to search for it. Strangely, the sound seemed to move around. As we got closer to one house and then another, the sound seemed to come from somewhere slightly different. Ridges and hollows in the deep woods must have been combining with the early morning fog to reflect the sound: we just couldn't pinpoint it.<P>

After an hour of fruitless search -- but good exercise -- we gave up and went home. We drove out in our car to see if the alarm was at one of the new houses recently completed, but still no luck.<P>

Returning home, we saw a neighbor walking down the road. An avid walker who normally logs ten or more miles a day, he certainly must have passed the screaming house, we thought, so we stopped to ask him. <P>

"I think it's the cicadas," he said, with a broad grin. He was right.<P>

Somehow we weren't embarrassed. The cicadas really do sound like a distant house alarm, even now that we know what we're hearing. <P>

I'd never experienced a 17-year cicada visit. I wanted to know more, so I went to the Internet for answers. <P>

Using the <a href="http://www.altavista.digital.com/">Alta Vista</a> search engine, I typed in "cicada." I got more than a thousand hits, but soon realized I'd have to refine my search. There's a software development company called Cicada, and it has lots of Websites. The menu and several news articles about a restaurant called Cicada are online. And there is much other irrelevant stuff.<P>

I went back and typed "cicada+insect." In an Alta Vista simple search, you use symbols to limit your search. The plus sign tells it to look for sites with the word cicada AND the word insect. (Click  "Help" on the Alta Vista main page for more ways to refine a search.)<P>

My second search was better. I found The <a href="http://www.ag.ohio-state.edu/~ohioline/hyg-fact/2000/2137.html">Ohio State University Extension Fact Sheet</a> on Periodical and "Dog Day" Cicadas where I learned that periodical cicadas "emerge somewhere in the eastern United States almost every spring." Only the males make noise. They live for two to four weeks after they emerge -- after 13 to 17 years underground. How sad.<P>

I also found the <a href="http://entmuseum9.ucr.edu/ENT10/LEC_13.TXT">prospectus</a> for a lecture by University of California, Riverside Entomology professor Dr. Rick Redak on Homoptera. From him I learned that the cicada's "loud, obnoxious sound.... is produced using a pair of tymbals that function as a balloon loosing air to make noise." <P>

<img src=cicada.gif width=245 height=210 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

Painter Katherine Klein, has a watercolor of a cicada and its exoskeleton under a snowball bush in her <a href="http://www.art.net/Studios/Visual/Kklein/img11.htm">online studio</a>. Under the image, she explains that the creatures' scientific name is "Magicicada Septendicem: 'Magic every seventeen years.'"<P>

Two noteworthy articles are in the <a href="http://www.insects.org/ced3/">Cultural Entomology Digest</a>. In "<a href="http://www.insects.org/ced3/cicada_chfolk.html">The Cicada in Chinese Folklore</a>" by Garland Reigel, I read that "the ancient Chinese regarded cicadas as symbols of rebirth and immortality." Reigel also quotes an article by Lafcadio Hearn, who wrote that cicada skins were used to cure earache (!) in China and Japan. <P>

"<a href="http://www.insects.org/ced3/cicada_ancgrcult.html">Cicadas in Ancient Greece: Ventures in Classical Tettigology</a>" by Rory B. Egan at the University of Manitoba, tells about a cicada that once helped an ancient Greek musician by substituting for the fifth string of his cithara when it snapped in the middle of a competition. <P>

<P>

A footnote: Some longtime-resident neighbors were highly amused by our expedition and presented my husband with a small film canister labeled "Burglar Alarm." <P>

When he prized the lid off what should he find but, of course, a large red-eyed cicada, agitating to be let out, no doubt wondering what particular sin had led it out of a 17-year earthen imprisonment into a black plastic solitary confinement. Needless to say, the hapless cicada is now back among its brethren, exercising its tymbals, sounding the alarm, and no doubt summoning the ladies.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Magazines Evolve Online</font><br></b>
</center>
<font size=4>




<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


Quick Quiz: You're inline -- no, not online: inline -- at the grocery checkout counter and the person ahead of you is having the hardest time getting his debit card to work. All you can do it wait. What do you do?<P>

<img src=HAmast.gif width=206 height=315 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=left><P>


You start to scan the magazines. Eventually you either get engrossed enough to add it to your own shopping cart or it is so thumb-worn by the time you finally advance that you feel too embarrassed to put it back.<P>

Ching-ching. Ring up another sale for the magazine vendors.<P>

So, what does this have to do with your computer, the Internet and World Wide Web? Good question. The answer is "Web-zines:" magazines online.<P>





Some of the heavy-hitters in the magazine world are moving their publications --or at least parts of them-- onto the Web and they're worth checking out. An excellent example is <a href="http://homearts.com/depts/fresh/newhome.htm">Hearst Corporation's HomeArts website</a> which takes full advantage the Web's ability to handle lots of information and present it in neat little interconnected nuggets. <P>

<img src=homearts.gif width=251 height=85 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

HomeArts is a Web-zine that presents articles from Hearst's Redbook, Good Housekeeping, Country Living and Popular Mechanics. It is smooth, the information well-organized, and the waits for articles to download were well within the acceptable range. In fact, it loads fairly promptly by Web standards. There are plenty of graphics, don't be mistaken, but the text loads without waiting for them, and the graphics follow quickly.<P>

I found tips on designing a Victorian Kitchen, a diet to take off those last 10 pounds, a recipe for 267-calorie-apiece cookies, step-by-step instructions for building a supply closet for your home office, horoscopes, discussions of sex and marriage, parenting -- you get the picture.<P>

My only problem arose when I clicked on the intriguing icon labeled "Planet Lunch." My browser crashed and I was informed that I had tried to "perform an illegal operation." A law abiding citizen like myself is intimidated by such a scolding!<P>

(When my husband accessed it on his Mac with a Java-enabled browser he found a roast turkey flapping its way across the sea between the islands of "Automat Cafe" and "Microwavy" with a neat little applet for Microsoft Network rotating in the foreground.)<P>

Back at HomeArts I had no problem pulling up and reading articles in the categories of Health, Relationships, Food, Pastimes, Home, and Garden. There are plenty of interactive quizzes, too, some of them from other Hearst publications, such as Cosmopolitan. <P>

<img src=loveorlust.gif width=253 height=82 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right>

I've always been a sucker for magazine quizzes, and these do not disappoint. Current examples include: <a href="http://homearts.com/depts/relat/02sexqf2.htm">"Are You in Love or in Lust?"</a> and <a href="http://homearts.com/cosmo/quizzes/05quizf1.htm">"How Large is Your Sleep Debt?"</a> This site scores them for you. You don't have to flip back and forth to the answers in the back of the magazine. This is an improvement: score one for Web-zines!<P>

In an article I read somewhere else recently, the writer pondered the fact that she's seen the same stories in these magazines over and over again. It's true.<P>

Today, an article on how to attract a member of the opposite sex might mention body parts a nice girl "didn't know about" 30 years ago, but though the language changes the yearning remains the same. <P>

No matter how common a condition pregnancy is, there's a hunger among those currently pregnant to read everything they can get their hands on about it. The trends change, the doctors have different ideas about how much weight you should gain and whether home birth is a good idea, but there are always readers for the magazines that publish these articles.<P>

No matter how many experts have given the final word on child-rearing, new and experienced mothers are always eager for fresh advice. How to instill morals and values in a young person without stifling his or her personality development? How to raise an independent thinker who at the same time is polite and respects authority to a reasonable extent? How to be sure your child won't end up in therapy because you inadvertently did something devastating? <P>

These questions are eternal. No normal parent is completely confident that he or she knows best. <P>

There will always be a market for the articles published by these magazines and their ilk.<P>

HomeArts takes the genre a step further by using the Web's ability to link pages with related sites of interest. For instance, a <a href="http://homearts.com/gh/health/05healf1.htm">piece</a> about the problem of teens abusing Ritalin -- the drug that has been so helpful to many who struggle with Attention Deficit Disorder and related difficulties -- has a link to the <a href="http://www.usdoj.gov/dea/deahome.htm">Drug Enforcement Administration</a> site.<P>

An article titled "<a href="http://homearts.com/depts/health/01healf1.htm">Research Your Own Ailment</a>" has links to online medical resources, information about traditional, off-line resources, and a list of medical research firms that can help, for a fee.<P>

Now, to get back to that problem of waiting inline, er... online. How many times have you been trying to access a site and had to wait and wait and wait? Here's a checkout line computer tip: sophisticated Web browsers like Netscape allow you to open more than one browser at a time. <P>

Go to File; click on New Browser; type in the address for HomeArts and access the page. Now you've got your magazine open. Drag the page slightly off center. Click on the earlier page you already had open. Execute the search or begin downloading the program you need from the Web site; but don't just sit there waiting. Click back on the other page and Voila! you are reading your magazine online while the computer goes on its merry way retrieving the material from the other page.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Foraging the Web for College <BR>And Financial Aid Information</font><br></b>
</center>
<font size=4>

<center>by Kitty Williams and Robin Lind</center>




It is college graduation season. Graduates and parents alike are breathing collective sighs of relief as degrees are awarded and the great hurdle of higher education begins to recede on the horizon.<P>

But what of younger students? For rising high school seniors and even juniors (not to mention their parents) the stress associated with selecting -- and being accepted by -- an institution of high learning has only just begun.<P>

Although some parents begin researching colleges early, for most families the process doesn't come into focus until the high school student's junior year. <P>

For most students, the question is where should I go? For most parents, the question is can we afford it?<P>

First the brochures start to trickle in. Eventually the student's bedroom floor disappears under stacks of glossy college mailings. Then the high school's college counseling program kicks in with timetables and deadlines.<P>

To anxious parents, it all seems terribly telescoped. Since the day their baby entered pre-school, college has loomed distantly on the horizon. Except for the random anxious moment over a bad grade or news of sky-high tuitions, many parents don't give it much thought until they have to. All of a sudden it is time to do something.<P>

But college counselors aren't terribly interested in the juniors until mid-May when all the seniors have safely found a niche. So juniors often spend an entire school year in a state of anxious uncertainty as to what they should be doing. <P>

One thing students and parents can do is research, and there's no better place to start than the Web. <P>

It's a great place to forage for college information. Over the past year hundreds and hundreds of colleges and universities have established Websites. Those sites are  terrific windows into the culture of the place, because they are maintained for the institution's students, professors, and alumni, as well as for those interested in applying.<P>

Many let you download the course catalog, see what's on the cafeteria menu, inquire about financial aid, scroll through the library card catalog, browse email discussions about academic topics, and even apply online.<P>

By the time you actually show up on campus for your visit, you'll know a lot and you'll be able to ask intelligent, informed questions. That will impress your interviewer. <P>

The best place to start looking for college web pages is <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a>'s hierarchical directory list. Click on "Regional, Countries, United States, Education, Colleges and Universities, Complete Listing" for a huge alphabetical list of web pages, from Abilene Christian University to Youngstown State University.  The newest additions are bunched at the top. Scroll all the way down to the bottom of the list for special interest pages, including several additional lists of universities. <P>

<img src=Colleges.gif width=320 height=201 vspace=2 hspace=2 align=center><P>


For example, <a href="http://famine.emich.edu/~mtsai/us/Amer_college.html">American Colleges</a> has a clickable US map that returns lists of college Website links for each state.<P>

Financial aid is of deep and abiding interest to most college students and their parents -- especially their parents. With annual costs approaching $30,000 at many private institutions, only the wealthiest or the most disciplined financial planners can pay full freight.<P>

There's plenty of good financial aid information on the Web, however, and there are many useful tools, including calculators and online search engines. <P>

One of the best kept secrets about sky-high tuition rates is the "Robin Hood" nature of tuition: a system designed to take from the rich and give to the poor. If you're wealthy you can expect to pay the full tuition; if you have only moderate means you can apply for grants, loans, work study and loans. <P>

The best colleges want the best students and they're willing to pay to get them. If you have good grades, don't worry unnecessarily about the cost. You can almost always find a way to make ends meet. Many colleges have over half their students on some form of financial aid: some students qualifiying for as much as 100%!<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Email's Ease of Use <BR>Can be a Hazard</font><br></b>
</center>
<font size=4>

<center>by Robin Lind</center>


Of all the uses for the Internet, the undisputed leader is "email" -- the electronic transmission of mail. <P>

<img src=eudora.gif width=240 height=188 vspace=2 hspace=2 align=right>

Email is extremely easy to use and has wonderful features that quickly seem familiar. Typically, the most challenging task is acquiring the accurate email address of the person to whom you want to send a message.<P>

You can send, receive, and forward messages. You can attach files and graphics. In some email programs you can type in a web site address and it will become automatically hyperlinked to that site when the message is received.<P>

You can copy parts of a message into a new one, send "carbon-copies" or your email to someone else and even "blind-carbon-copy" large groups of people. <P>

Let's say you want to send a message to a very large list of people but don't want them to see who else is receiving the message. Send the message to yourself and send a copy to all the others by "bcc" instead of "cc." This preserves the privacy of your email list which can be very important, because another of the features of email is the ability to copy "header" information.<P>

If you receive an email that has huge list of recipients in its "cc" box you can simply copy those email addresses into your own files for future use. It may not be helpful if you don't recognize any of those people but it could be a competitor's worst nightmare if he let you capture his customer list by mistake.<P>

Are there mistakes like that?<P>

Sure. Remember all those email transmissions that Marine Col. Ollie North deleted from his hard disk during the Iran-Contra scandal? He forgot about the automatic backup... :-(<P>

Sending and receiving email is no different in complexity than drinking a cup of coffee and consider how often something gets spilled at the table. For a real life example, consider this recent email exchange:<P>


1. An email from "Joe Blow" sent to an industry list of several thousand recipients at 10:39 am: <P>
<Font size =3><TT>
"Moving: Colleagues in the xxx world may be interested to hear that I'll be leaving the XYZ company at the end of March...I've accepted a position at ABC company..."<P>
</TT></Font>
2. An email reply sent from "Jane Doe" at 11:13 am: <P>
<Font size =3><TT>
"As one of the directors of Fuzzy Logic Inc, I'd like to remind you of your non-competition clause in your contract that expressly forbids you from working for the Evil Empire. And Wendy says "No f------ way!"  Me, I'm gonna be working for the other evil empire, DEF company... outta here on Wednesday... Things around here have been s---. They cut the department to about 25 in December right? Since then they lost an artist, two content people, the project manager... I know of two people that are actively looking, two or three more that are sort of looking...<P>
</TT></Font>
3. Another email message from "Jane Doe" to the industry list at 11:54 am:<P>
<Font size =3><TT>
"As you might have guessed, I didn't really intend to send that message to "Joe" to the mailing list. I would have thought that by this point I would have learned to read who I was sending replies to, but I guess that I need to pay more attention to what I'm doing."<P>
</TT></Font>
4. An email message from "Bob Roe" to "Jane Doe" with a "cc:" to the industry list at 5:57 pm:<P>
<Font size =3><TT>
"Thanks for the note. I wanted to ask those who know what happens when you reply to a note that has a blind cc: in the original to many other people. If there's a regular cc: with a name in it, will the machine prompt you to reply to all... I'm a bit cloudy on it."<P>
</TT></Font>
5. An email message from "Jane Doe" to "Bob Roe" with a "cc:" to the industry list at 12 midnight:<P>
<Font size =3><TT>
"Damn, never thought that the worst mistake of my life would turn into a tutorial on email. In my experience, what happens when you hit reply depends on two things -- the way the message was sent, and the program that you're using..."<P>
</TT></Font>
6. An email message from "Bill Bloggs" to "Bob Roe" with a "cc:" to the industry list at 3:01 am:<P>
<Font size =3><TT>
"If the cc: was truly "blind" it wouldn't be kept anywhere in the header of the copy you receive, even in a field that normally isn't displayed by your mail-agent software..."<P>
</TT></Font>
7. An email reply from "Bob Roe" to "Jane Doe" with a "cc:" to the industry list at 12:30 am:<P>
<Font size =3><TT>
"Thanks "Bill" and "Joe." ... Now I know a lot more than I did before, and my fears are relieved. I owe "Bill" two compliments and "Jane" a beer!<P>

</TT>
</Font>
There are several lessons to be learned from this exchange:<P>
<UL>

<li>
<li>even the most experienced computer users can -- and do -- make mistakes with their most commonly-used programs<P>

<li>it never hurts to ask for help or advice: someone always knows more than you do and will very likely share the knowledge<P>

<li>never write anything down you'd be embarrassed for your Mother to see in print ;-)<P>

</UL>
Finally, is this for real? Absolutely: only the names have been changed to protect the shame-faced. Three of the four people in this exchange work for Fortune 500 companies in senior positions of responsibility and authority.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Finding Fitness on the Web</font><br></b>
</center>
<font size=4>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>



Whether your idea of being fit is being able to climb a flight of stairs and talk at the same time or being able to run a marathon, you'll find information and encouragement on the World Wide Web.<P>

A rich variety of interesting sports and fitness links, including many pages made up entirely of  links to mailing lists, newsgroups and Websites lead people to their specific interests.<P>

<img src=fitness.gif width=216 height=48 vspace=2 hspace=2 align=right>

<a href="http://www.fitnesslink.com">FitnessLink</a> is one of the most comprehensive sites I have found, and it will keep a fitness freak happily clicking away for a long time. There are articles, weekly fitness tips, and places to get your questions answered or find an exercise buddy. The large listing of fitness, health, nutrition and sports newsgroups and internet mailing lists is genuinely useful. There's also a list, with telephone numbers, of more than two dozen magazines and a short bibliography. To save you time, Webpage owner Shannon Entin has also compiled a list of "FitnessLink Links" and rated them on quality of information and navigability.<P>

Another great site with links to general health pages is <a href="http://www.cdc.net/~primus/fpc/fpchome.html">Fitness Partner Connection Jumpsite</a>. You should also look at <a href="http://www.primenet.com/~karenwe/diet.htm">Internet Resources for Healthy Living</a>, compiled and maintained by Karen Weber.<P>

These two pages are strictly "jump sites" but they are well organized and easy to use.  They'll save you a LOT of time. <P>

<a href="http://www.fitnessworld.com/enth/enthmap.html">Fitness World</a> lets you ask questions, search archives, and start book discussion groups or discuss fitness fashions. A number of Websites are dedicated to a single sport or aspect of fitness. <P>

Aerobics instructors will find ideas and step by step diagrams at the <a href="http://grove.ufl.edu/~evilgreg/Aerobics/">Aerobics</a> page.<P>

<img src=linda.gif width=102 height=151 vspace=2 hspace=2 align=left>
<img src=donnie.gif width=85 height=159 vspace=2 hspace=2 align=right>

<a href="http://www.imgsys.com/bodymech/index.html">Body Mechanics</a> concentrates on bodybuilding information and techniques. A variety of approaches are discussed and you can admire photographs of some remarkable practitioners of this art.<P>


Endurance trainers will be interested in the <a href="http://s2.com:80/etj/">Endurance Training Journal</a>, a searchable database of articles about cycling, running and general fitness.<P>

If swimming is your thing, splash over to <a href="http://alf2.tcd.ie/~smftzger/swim/header.html">Web Swim</a>, which has links to sites listing pools you can train in, world records, nutritional advice, tips on techniques, meet results, and more. <a href="http://www.swim2000.com">Swim 2000</a> features "Workouts of the Week," a week-at-a- time schedule of workouts for beginner, intermediate and advanced swimmers. It made me gasp for air just to read them.<P>

<a href="http://www.runnersworld.com">Runners World Magazine online</a> is crammed with articles and news for runners. <P>

<img src=sweatnet.gif width=153 height=265 vspace=2 hspace=2 align=right>


My favorite fitness site is <a href="http://www.sweatnet.com//sweatnet.htm">SweatNet</a>. It's for anyone who is interested in fitness at any level. I like it primarily for the exercise log.<P>

Here's the drill -- you register by giving them certain information about yourself such as age, height and weight and level of fitness. You choose an alias and a password, and each time you exercise, you enter the type of exercise and the time you spent. The log tells you how many calories you burned, and gives you some basic facts about what it all means and how to motivate yourself to keep going.<P>

Another reason I like SweatNet is CyberCise: "At last! An answer to that eternally pesky question: What can I do while I'm downloading?" <P>

If you've ever sat in front of the computer chewing on your mouse cord and waiting in frustration, you'll like this page. It has instructions for the Basic Crunch (lie down on the floor and do crunches while you wait), Cyber-Curl/Biceps (watch those weights around your new 19" monitor!) and Yoga for Posture and Strength. <P>

So what are you waiting for? Start with any of the jumpsites, or if you are on America Online, use the keyword: "Fitness" to arrive at their comprehensive site. If you'd rather read about sports than sweat, America Online also has message boards for many popular sports. My only disappointment was to find Field Hockey buried among "other sports" in the Grandstand area (keyword: GS other).<P>

</center>
<font size=4>



<P>

<img src=Motley.gif width=376 height=220 align=center hspace=2 vspace =2> <BR>

<I>"The Motley Fool is a mess. It's sort of like a big desk with a ton of great stuff piled on top of it."</I><BR>
--Editors, The Motley Fool<P>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


Of all the users of the Internet, investors and those who follow the stock market are among the most enthusiastic. Buyers and sellers are hungry for the kind of up to the minute news they can find on the "Information Superhighway."<P>

Several companies have sprung up to feed that hunger.<P>

One of the most popular is America Online's Motley Fool. It was started in 1993 as a print newsletter by David Gardner, a former writer for "Louis Rukeyser's Wall Street," and his brother, Tom, who taught business and investing at the University of Montana. In 1994, it entered cyberspace as The Motley Fool Online. Essentially, it is a clearing house for investment information and advice, with hefty dose of education and entertainment thrown in.<P>

"It is the very essence of Folly," writes brother David, "to invest for oneself, to make one's OWN mistakes, to learn one's OWN lessons, to enjoy the fruits of one's OWN investment successes. To damn the manifold torpedoes shot from every direction and go out and BEAT the Market."<P>

Message boards allow individuals to share company information, investment advice and opinions. Dozens of other Motley Fools whose screen aliases begin with the letters MF, monitor the message boards and help answer questions. The Motley Fool is irreverent and contrarian, but a broad current of common sense runs through all of their material.<P>

According to an article at the site, "The Motley Fool name comes directly from Shakespeare's "As You Like It,".... Motley is of course the parti-colored garment worn by Elizabethan court jesters.... In fact, Fools were really the only members of their societies who could tell the truth to the King or Queen without having their heads lopped off. They had a freedom of speech that makes even our own Constitutional one look weak by comparison."<P>

Because freedom of speech is encouraged at the site, anyone, especially a recently hatched investor, who looks to Motley Fool for direction should be careful. <P>

The editors put it bluntly: "We Fools recognize that while we have tons of great stuff in this forum, sometimes people post messages in our folders that are misleading or downright wrong. They may do this unintentionally, and sad to say on occasion, intentionally.<P>

"The fundamental concept is not that you should rely on the information you read, but rather, that you use it as a starting point for doing independent research on various companies and investing techniques....<P>

"The most important tool of your investment decisions must be your own research, and your decisions must based on your own life's circumstances."<P>

They also write: "Our first recommendation is to educate yourself. Don't put your money anywhere until you know exactly why you're putting it there. Our allocation model for new investors is simple: 95% cash, 5% investment in education."<P>

<img src=13fools.gif width=300 height=290 hspace=2 vspace=2 align=right>

Education is what you'll find here. The thirteen-step "Fools School" is clearly written and presented. Each step leads the new investor into more complicated territory, from "don't invest your lunch money" to the whys and wherefores of selling short: "[W]hen your ... friends find out you're shorting stocks, they may start to regard you as Darth Vader. So wear dark clothes, a low visor, breathe loud, and milk it." <P>

There are also chapters covering how to value stocks and a range of investment strategies for people who want to spend minutes a year managing their portfolios to those who can afford risk - and enjoy it every day.<P>

The Motley Fool has telephone numbers for and individual message folders about many companies listed on the United States exchanges, as well as the phone numbers to call to get the numbers for the rest.<P>

A sample script for the phone call requesting company information is useful for those whose brains stop functioning when they hear the dreaded words "please leave a message after the beep."	<P>

For folks who want to watch others manage their investments before trying on their own, there's "Foolish Portfolio," which you can check every day to see "the inner workings" of the Gardners' own portfolio.<P>

There are also research tools and up to the minute financial news to keep investors abreast of the market. For those who don't like to stay serious, there are two games, Today's Pitch where you can try for free AOL hours, and Port Folly, "a portfolio game ... centered around a 13th century medieval port town." <P>

Another area of America Online that complements the Motley Fool is the stock portfolio function, accessed by clicking the toolbar button with the icon of a stock chart. You can enter the stocks you own or are interested in, and the prices you paid for them, and check their performance regularly. <P>

Full service stockbrokers probably won't be terribly enthusiastic about the Motley Fool or Gardners' attitude toward them. They would do well, though,  to click through the site, if only to better understand the forces  influencing investors, online and off. <P>

The Gardners's book, "The Motley Fool Investment Guide," was published this year by Simon & Schuster, 1996.<P>

America Online is only one source for online investment information and advice. There are many others on the Internet and the World Wide Web.<P>

<a href="http://www.networth.galt.com">Networth</a>, like AOL's stock portfolio area, allows you to build a custom portfolio and track its performance. A "24-hour mutual fund marketplace," it is attractive, easy to use, and almost severe compared to the Foolish site. It also offers information on more than 5,000 funds from the Morningstar database, a Mutual Fund Market Manager, a Fund Atlas that lets you define and organize the mutual funds of interest to you, as well as the Personal Portfolio, current prospectus performance figures, a weekly market outlook, and interactive question and answer forums. <P>

In both Networth and AOL, the stock quotes are delayed 15 minutes, so your everyday fire-breathing, two-telephone, broker might be dissatisfied.<P>

Networth has links to the non-profit <a href="http://networth.galt.com/www/home/planning/aaii/home.html">American Association of Individual Investors(AAII)</a> to investment advisors who would like your business, and also to the Quicken website where you can download upgrades and learn about all the newest products.<P>

Finally, the online investor has access to Securities and Exchange Commission reports. The <a href="http://www.sec.gov">SEC</a> has a website, and, according to their <a href="http://www.sec.gov/oursite/faq.htm">Frequently Asked Questions</a> page: "Over three quarters of domestic public companies are currently filing electronically on the <a href="http://www.sec.gov/edgarhp.htm">EDGAR</a> system. The last group of mandated filers is scheduled to come on-line in May, 1996. After that, new companies will be phased in as they become public and are required to file documents with the SEC. " <P>

The  FAQ page also contains instructions for downloading public documents from the Edgar System including the annual 10-K reports and the quarterly 10-Q reports. <P>

<center><b><font size =6>Upgrades Don't Always <BR>Improve For the Better</font><br></b>
</center>
<font size=4>

<center>by Robin Lind</center><P>

To the certainty of death and taxes we should add the computer software term: "upgrade."<P>

Software companies generally produce at least one major upgrade every year, sometimes several minor upgrades during the year.<P>

Consumers who want to stay on the leading edge of technology usually feel compelled to shell out more cash every time. Sometimes it's worth it, sometimes not. For some it's just a matter of pride to tell colleagues you're using version "two point oh beta six."<P>

<img src=msword.gif width=157 height=189 align=left>

Several months ago we "upgraded" to the <a href="http://www.microsoft.com/msword/ProductInfo/Maintosh/Word601.htm">newest version (6.01)</a> of the popular Microsoft Word program. One goal was to acquire the latest bells and whistles but a more important goal was to establish a common platform for both Macintosh and PC platforms. Another consideration was price: by upgrading to 6.01 on the Mac we could qualify for the little-publicized "side-grade" to the PC.<P>

In legal jargon, you don't actually buy the software program; you license its use for your machine. Therefore, once you've paid the licensing fee you can pay a small additional "media" fee ($19.95) to get the program for a different operating system if, for instance, you use one type of computer at work and another at home.<P>

On the PC, Word 6.01 was a welcome improvement to its predecessor, the stripped down word processor in Microsoft Works.<P>

On the Mac, version 6.01 was a disaster. The program required 38 megabytes of hard disk space to house its full complement of bells and whistles and the program itself took more than eight megabytes of RAM to operate -- up from only one megabyte in version 5.0.<P>

Ten years ago, a machine with one megabyte of RAM was on the cutting edge. Five years ago, four megabytes of RAM was pretty sophisticated. Presently eight megabytes of RAM is fairly common. This means you can forget Microsoft vers. 6.01 if you don't have at least 16 megabytes of RAM. (One imagines the young programmers deliberately and gleefully deciding to kick sand in the faces of the 90-lb weaklings on the cyber-beach.)<P>

And why have the memory requirements jumped eight-fold? A Microsoft technical support person told me that Version 6.01 has added so many more improvements and so much more "functionality."<P>

Say what?<P>

In most "upgrades," the programmers keep the best, eliminate any bugs, and introduce new features that are truly useful. They hope consumers will believe the new version "insanely cool." Our verdict? Cool, no; insane, yes.<P>

Version 6.01 eliminated popular keystroke combinations, hid others, changed some and blithely suggested that users could easily write their own "macros" to restore features they were familiar with. Hunh?<P>

After laboring diligently with the new version for six weeks I decided to call it quits. No more. I wanted out. This was not an upgrade. This was a downgrade: a degradation of function and efficiency.<P>

I ran the de-install program and removed it. Well, not entirely. I still had to call technical support to find out how to manually remove the additional plug-ins, extensions and add-ons that don't actually get de-installed when you run the de-install program. <P>

That process left me feeling weak in the knees and wondering what the programmers knew when they included a de-install program. I've never had a de-install program come with any other software. Should this have been a tip-off?<P>

Apparently I am not alone in my decision to de-install. When I had trouble re-installing version 5.0  (another call to Technical Support) I discovered they no longer support version 5.0 but they could send me the last minor upgrade (version 5.01). And they did. It arrived two days after my call. Credit where credit is due.<P>

But isn't it curious that Microsoft has 5.01 ready and available for consumers who de-install 6.01? Sometimes in this ever-changing computer revolution you have to be wary that the leading edge doesn't become the "bleeding edge" and you become ... yes, another bit of road kill on the information superhighway.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Archie McPhee Provides <BR>Stuff You Can Do Without</font><br></b>
</center>
<font size=4>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center><P>

<img src=mcphee.gif width=211 height=171 align=left>

Tired of finding only useful, helpful or educational stuff on the Web? Looking for something a little outrageous? Want to stretch your mind and see things you never thought could exist?  <a href="http://www.halcyon.com/mcphee/welcome.html">Archie McPhee, Outfitters of Popular Culture since 1986</a>, is the place to go.<P>

Whether you're looking for something as ordinary as a <a href="http://www.halcyon.com/mcphee/products/RubberChicken.html">rubber chicken</a> or as unusual as Glow in the Dark Alien Pops, you'll find it at the home page of this Seattle shop. If you want to actually buy any of this stuff, you still have to write, phone or fax your order, though. They aren't set up for cyber-shopping yet. <P>

<img src=chicken.gif width=231 height=54 align=right>

They say the home page only shows a fraction of the odd things they sell in the store, but it is enough for a start. If you can't get there in person, you can order their catalog over the Internet.	<P>

Although I am not naturally acquisitive, as my husband will tell you, I was actually glad for my credit card's sake that I couldn't order online. There's so much good stuff !<P>

I'll pass on the life-size, squishable model of a human heart and the bubble gum brain. Someone else can buy the Elvis signs... But a set of squid finger puppets? Or banana slugs or duck-billed platypus finger puppets? Sigh.<P>

One of my fondest memories of childhood was getting a cousin to eat chocolate covered bugs. Thirty years later, he still remembers -- and mentions it every time we meet. It's lucky for him that Archie McPhee wasn't in business back then. I would have tried him on fried BBQ, Cheddar Cheese or Mexican Spiced <a href="http://www.halcyon.com/mcphee/products/larvets.html">mealworm larvae</a> -- or a tequila pop complete with worm. Ooooh, giggle-giggle-giggle.<P>

Archie McPhee also has Christopher Columbus Trick Candy. It looks like a wrapped toffee candy, but when you unwrap it, out comes a large rubber bug. Too cool.<P>

If you are the serious type, interested in international relations and perhaps learning a new language, what better place to start than Bazooka Joe Bubble gum in Hebrew? Bored with plain old fruit or mint flavored gum? Try Pickle Puss chewing gum from Archie's place. I wonder if it tastes better than the last dill pickle flavored lollipop I tasted back around the time I was feeding people chocolate covered bumblebees. Probably not. High quality flavors aren't often a concern for those who manufacture weird candy.<P>

Speaking of weird candy, remember the Alien Glow Pops I mentioned? They're enough to make me wish our children were ten years younger (watch out nieces and nephews!). These are nifty suckers with a 9" handle that you can use as a glow in the dark bracelet once you've eaten (or lost) the candy part. <P>

But perhaps you are on a diet and you'd rather stay away from sweets or fried snacks. Archie McPhee also has statuary and animal figurines. There's a Monkey God statue -- if you think you need a monkey that sticks his out tongue at you. There's a stuffed armadillo and a stuffed giant banana slug. You can get pink lawn flamingos, <a href="http://www.halcyon.com/mcphee/products/13-squirtfish.html">squirting goldfish</a> and miniature plastic gargoyles to keep in your car. I tell you, I don't know how I lived without this stuff until now.<P>

The Archie McPhee spokesmodel is a miniature dachshund called Red Dog. She has her very own page, and several McPhee items are modeled on her. You can buy a T-shirt featuring her in a fetching pair of "nerd glasses," which I'm sure you can also buy from the company or the <a href="http://www.halcyon.com/mcphee/red/bendy.html">Red Dog Bend-O-Weiner</a>, a bendable model weiner dog.<P>

Sparkzilla, a 3" windup monster is also fine. I wonder if he's HO scale or what. Doesn't your model train layout need one? I should think so.<P>

By far the most marvelous item is <a href="http://www.halcyon.com/mcphee/products/sqkbibo1.html">Squeak Bibo</a>, a 6" plastic doll that squeaks when you squeeze him. You won't know why he is so wonderful unless you read his remarkable story, available at the site.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Answer Your Questions<BR>At Financenter</font><br></b>
</center>
<font size=4>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


In William Shakespeare's play, Hamlet, Lord Polonius gives this oft-quoted advice to his son, Laertes:<P>

<I>"Neither a borrower nor a lender be;<BR>
     For loan oft loses both itself and friend,<BR>
     And borrowing dulls the edge of husbandry."</I><BR>
		<a href="http://the-tech.mit.edu/Shakespeare/Tragedy/hamlet/hamlet.1.3.html">Hamlet, Act 1, Scene 3</a>
<P>


Though the old man's speech sounds mighty convincing, the world has changed, for better or for worse, since the days of the Bard of Avon.<P>

Most people carry, and use, at least one credit card. Few people carry much cash. Tax law encourages home mortgages. To the modern listener, Polonius' words sound overly cautious or perhaps just plain silly.<P>

Whether our extensive use of debt to finance our businesses and our private lives is "progress for the better" is a question that won't be settled easily. <P>

It's definitely complicated. Ads for cars tout rebates and "low, low down payments." Furniture stores offer "no money down, 0% interest" for up to a year. Almost every day the mail brings an offer for a new credit card with some intriguing gimmick to lure new customers. <P>

Is it better to rent or own a house? Lease or own a car? How about refinancing? How can you tell if an offer will save money or just bury you in more debt?<P>

And, finally, what do all these <a href="http://www.financenter.com/homeloan/AFI/homerept.htm">words</a> mean that your banker throws around so freely?<P>

There are no easy answers, but the Web is a great place to start asking the questions. <P>


<img src=financenter.gif width=334 height=58 align=center><P>

"<a href="http://www.financenter.com">Financenter</a>" has more than 35 different calculators to figure the relative costs of various credit options. In addition, they have good glossaries and reports that explain clearly the jargon of home mortgages and auto lending and leasing.<P>

Naturally, they aren't in this for charity. They hope Netsurfers who reach this website will become customers of the national financial companies that provide information to the site. To make that easy, the site offers online loan applications and daily rate quotes. You can also print out and mail applications for several credit cards.<P>

<img src=txthom2.gif width=126 height=99 align=left><BR>

Then there are the calculators. There are calculators for home buying, refinancing and home equity lines of credit. <P>

<a href="http://www.financenter.com/autoloan/newcalcs/finvcash.htm">Car financing calculators</a> include ones to help you determine the costs of depreciation, whether to finance or pay cash, the merits of a rebate versus special dealer financing, the size of your payments, and whether to lease or purchase the car.<P>

<img src=txtcar2.gif width=126 height=99 align=left><BR>

For instance, if you're thinking of buying a new car, should you finance or pay cash? Financenter states unequivocally that's it's "almost always recommended" that you pay cash to avoid interest costs but the decision should be based on the interest you could have been earning if your cash was employed in another investment.<P>

Let's say you have your cash in a savings account that earns 4%. If you finance $15,000 of the purchase price at an 8% interest rate you end up paying $1,056 more over the four-year purchase period. However, if your cash is invested in the stock market and currently yields 20%, then you save $2,571 over the four-year purchase period.<P>

The calculator lets you enter your current rate of return on savings or investments, the purchase price, downpayment, loan term, and interest rate. Go ahead and try it.<P>

There are links to Chase Manhattan Bank's <a href="http://www.financenter.com/autoloan/chasrate.htm">Auto Loan rates</a>, and to <a href="http://www.intellichoice.com/sponsors/financenter/vehicles.html">IntelliChoice "Just the Facts"</a> reports on cars and trucks. The free reports contain enough information to help narrow your choices. For $4.95, you can order a report including complete invoice prices, features, and operating costs. IntelliChoice also gives price comparisons by type of vehicle. and<P>

<img src=txtcre2.gif width=126 height=99 align=left><BR>

Credit card calculators include ones that compare competing cards, compute the advantages of rebates or rewards, calculate the time or payment to pay off credit card debt, and help you figure the advantages of consolidating your debts.<P>

The calculators are the best part of this website. I came away feeling that everyone would benefit by running a credit question through the applicable program, even if  they decide to stick with their own bank or finance their car through the dealership.

<center><b><font size =6>Planning The Graduate's <BR>Summer Travel</font><br></b>
</center>
<font size=4>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>

5/6/96 -- Our son graduates from high school next month. Like many before him, he hopes to travel in  Europe before putting his nose to the university grindstone. This won't be a Grand Tour, to say the least. It is going to be on the cheap. <P>

He plans to spend a couple of weeks traveling with three friends. These young men don't have a lot of money  and they don't have a lot of time, but they don't need to stay at the Ritz, either. <P>

My mission, as "cybermom", was to see what I could find by way of travel tips and cheap airfares on the Internet. So far I haven't had much luck with cheap airfares, but I'm going to keep plugging away. <P>

<img src=travelocity.gif width=254 height=43 align=left>

The first place I tried was the <a href="http://www. travelocity.com">Travelocity</a> Website. When I told my husband that I'd found a round-trip fare to Munich, and what it was, he turned pale.  "But it only costs $157 return on Icelandic! Or else it used to..." he said, shaking off the time warp that had snagged him briefly. <P>

<img src=bosmap.gif width=284 height=220 align=right>

Back in the dim past, we also used to consult Arthur Frommer's "Europe on $5 a Day"  currently: "Europe from $50 '96", available for $21.95 from the famed <a  href="http://www.gcb.com/catalog">Globe Corner Bookstore</a> in Boston, where over 5,000 travel books are online and you can order by email.<P>

Times change. We're nowhere near the Corner Bookstore but today, there's the Internet.<P>

When I started at "Travelocity" I was impressed: it is a large site, swollen with information and ambition. They profess to be a full service travel website. Indeed, they offer schedules and fares, reservation and ticketing services, travel merchandise, and bulletin boards where travelers can share information. <P>

The two times I used it, though, it was slower than any website I'd ever accessed, and that is saying a lot. I hope they can speed it up, but unless your Internet service provider allows unlimited web access, I'd skip it for now. Its sluggish response time will eat up your expensive AOL, CompuServe or Prodigy hours.<P>

<a href="http://www.eurail.com">Eurail</a> also offers a good website to help you plan travel within Europe. Although still under development, it has train schedules and prices of  the various Eurail (and BritRail) passes as well as single tickets between cities. You can post questions in the Cafe Elysees message area to be answered by other travelers or by travel writers. Downloadable maps are coming. There's an 800 number to order passes.<P>

The site also has a link to EuroData, a free software program for planning itineraries. It sounds wonderful, but I tried to download it three times -- unsuccessfully. Each time the download began at a reasonable speed, then slowed to a snail's pace and suddenly quit. Finally, I gave up and called (800) 383-8308, to order the free diskette. <P>

Cruising through travel Websites, I finally came upon the website of a San Francisco travel agency, <a href="http://www.european.com/~eurofile/home.html">European Travel Inc.</a> There I found instructions to email my travel plans to them for a price quote. I sent the vague outlines of the travelers' plans, and I'm keeping my fingers crossed. <P>

Going back to a general search I used Alta Vista to generate a long list of web sites about travel in Europe. Two that seemed especially promising were "How to travel Europe by Train" and "GNN Select Travel: Western Europe Guides. <P>

<img src=munich.gif width=300 height=216 align=center><P>

For Germany itself, and specifically Munich, I found "<a 
href="http://www.munich-tourist.de/english/m1.html">Munich on TOP</a>" (Touristic Online Program) which includes a large city map with clickable dots that are hyperlinked to information about historic buildings, city squares, churches, theaters and museums. <P>

After all the time wasted earlier waiting for information that wouldn't (or couldn't) download I was happy to find a solicitous instruction on the TOP page "If you have a moment to spare, you can also see an illustrated version of this page. Simply click on the mouse."<P>

I clicked. It worked. Danke!<P>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>

5/6/96 --"Every day should be Mother's Day," the voice in your mind says. "You can't just send a dumb bunch of flowers or a cheap card once a year and think you've paid enough attention to your mother!" <P>



Still, it's hard to be too negative about Mother's Day (May 12 in case you need reminding). No matter how commercial it gets, no matter how many inattentive children ease their guilt with an annual card or phone call, I am not ready to give up on it.<P>



If you are a new mother, your co-parent really should bring you breakfast in bed. May I suggest coffee and a croissant--and a single rose in a vase on the tray?<P>

If the children are a little older, wouldn't you be touched if they brought up a tray with burnt toast, a half-spilled glass of orange juice and a fistful of daisies and dandelions or a homemade card?<P>

If you plan to send flowers, you can call the neighborhood florist who knows exactly what sort of flowers Mother always orders. Or, you can log onto the Internet and order flowers online. <P>

On <a href="http://www.yahoo.com">Yahoo</a> I found enough choices to make me dizzy. I clicked, one after another, on <a href="http://www.yahoo.com/Society_and_Culture/Holidays/Mothers_Day/">Society and Culture, Holidays, Mother's Day.</a>. Then I clicked on "<a href="http://www.yahoo.com/Business_and_Economy/Companies/Flowers">Flowers@</a>" which took me to a huge list of online florists and floral supplies companies. You'll find bunches of Teleflora and FTD florists on the list. <a href="http://flowernet.com">Flowernet</a> advertises a bouquet of asters, chrysanthemums and carnations ($24.95 plus $8.95 S&H), that's quite pretty.(And you can order it right there online.) It's also a change from the all the (dare I say dull?) variations on the theme of flowers-in-a-mug offered by Teleflora and FTD.<P>

Flowers might make your mother sneeze, but there are other options on the Internet. <P>




The quotes at the beginning of this column come from the Mother's Day Greeting Card Page at <a href="http://www.dearmom.com">Dearmom.com</a>. Dearmom.com is the Mother's Day branch of <a href="http://www.outpost.net">OutPost Network</a>, an Internet mail service. <P>

<img src=yearrd.gif width=450 height=209 align=center><P>

You select a card and add a personal message or choose from quotes they suggest. For $3.75,  prints your message on the card, addresses it, stamps it and mails it. If you want to startle your mother, order temporary tattoos with the word "Mom" in a heart and wear one when you visit. <P>

While you're at Dearmom, listen to audio clips of motherly admonitions and cast your vote to Rate-A-Mom, including your own mother, Madonna (the original), June Cleaver, Hillary Clinton, Barbara Bush, The Mothers of Invention, Roseanne Barr and Mother Teresa. <P>

If you're a procrastinator -- or a cheapskate ;-) -- and it's too late to mail a card or send flowers, all is not lost, so long as your mother is online. You can send an email card -- free! Go to one of several sites, for example <a href="http://family.starwave.com/seasonal/mothers/index.html">Family Planet's</a> special Mother's Day site. There, you pick an image, add a message and send. Your mother gets an email message telling her where to find her "card". There are several places you can go for this service.<P>

StarNet, the electronic version of The Arizona Daily Star in Tucson, offers the free "<a href="http://www.azstarnet.com/flowers/">StarNet Flower Server</a>" which allows you to choose a mixed bouquet, small or large, white or red roses, or pansies. You can send one, six or a dozen. You can add your message and with a simple click of the mouse your email is put into the pipe with flowers coming out the other end.<P>

Keywords "Mothers Day" on America Online will get you to more stuff. There are electronic cards, pictures and descriptions of contraptions invented by children to "help" their mothers, ideas for homemade presents, and links to various relevant forums and Websites. <P>

Happy Mother's Day. And remember, if every day is Mother's Day, it's never too late to send a card!<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Get Enough Comics in Your Paper?</font><br></b>
</center>
<font size=4>

<center>by Robin Lind</center>


4/29/96 -- "You know," one of our readers told me, "I sat down and read the newspaper this morning right through and when I got to the end I read this little comic strip that gave me a real chuckle. It was the only thing in the paper that made me laugh. Almost everything else was war, murder, accidents. business failure. It was just depressing. <P>

"It occurred to me," he continued, "that there might be a real market for a newspaper that was just comics. I mean, think of how it would affect people if they could go to work after reading a whole newspaper that was amusing, that gave them a chuckle to start the day."<P>

I happen to know that this reader lives in a part of the country where comics are not a big part of his local daily newspapers' content. I also know that he's in an industry and a part of the country where there hasn't been much good news lately ... nothing you'd want to chuckle over anyway.<P>

But I must say I got chuckle just thinking about a whole subway car full of people reading newspapers comprised of only comics and chuckling their way to work. It might even be an interesting social experiment. But could you get the business people who are addicted to the Wall Street Journal or the New York Times to switch over? 'Nuff said.<P>

There is a possibility on the Web however. <P>

<left><img src=greg.gif width=350 </left><P>

In addition to being able to search out breaking news topics by subject, or create a tailor-made newspaper that is loaded with just what you specify (like the Wall Street Journal's subscription-based Personal Edition) you can, in fact, create your own comics newspaper.<P>

The Philadelphia Inquirer has a collection of 29 comic strips at <a href="http://www2.phillynews.com/comics/index.html">Philadelphia Online</a> for you to access and arrange in your own order of preference. You have one, two, three ... as many as your want. And you can arrange them in your own order.<P>

Once you've made your choices, you can bookmark the page and return every day to get your personal comic strips. <P>

Twenty-nine strips may sound like a lot but, according to newspaper industry publication <a href="http://www.mediainfo.com:4900/ephome/news/newshtm/recent/contest.htm">Editor & Publisher</a>, there are actually close to 200 comic strips and panels for newspapers to choose from when they assemble their comics pages. <P>

According to an article by E&P's David Astor, the two most popular comic strips in the country (ranked by number of newspapers carrying the strip) were "Garfield", that irritating cat drawn by Jim Davis and Dean Young's "Blondie" which recently went through a social relevance revamping that sent Blondie out into the working world.<P>

 Unfortunately, they are not included in the Phillynews stable. :-(  But they do have the next seven in ranking, including number three (89 newspapers) Lynn Johnston's "For Better or For Worse;" Peanuts" by Charles Schultz, "Doonesbury" by Garry Trudeau, "Hagar the Horrible," by Chris Browne, "Cathy" by Cathy Guisewite, "The Family Circus" by Bil Keane and "Beetle Bailey" by Mort Walker.<P>

Many comic strips, such as Greg Howard's "Sally Forth," are also beginning to include <a href="mailto:HelloSally@aol.com">email</a> addresses so that you can communicate with the creators. <P>

Sorry to say they don't (yet) have Scott Adams's "<a href="http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics/dilbert/">Dilbert</a>" which was last year's fastest growing comic strip: jumping from 51 to 80 newspapers but Dilbert has his own Web site as do Garry Trudeau's "<a href="http:www.donesbury.com/">Doonesbury</a>" and Jeff MacNelly's "<a href="http://www.pluggers.com">Pluggers</a>."<P>

At present the strips at Philadelphia Online are only the dailies in black and white but they promise that the Sunday (read Color!) and Philadelphia Daily News comics (read Many More!) are on the way.<P>

Cool? You betcha. <P>

Is there a catch? You betcha. <P>

The good folks at Philadelphia Online say that this is free now but may soon be subscription based. Go take a look quick before they raise the barrier. Then again, maybe you'll find that starting your day off with a chuckle is so beneficial to your mental attitude you may be willing to pay the price. You might even want to have an office subscription and send it 'round the Local Area Network to re-engineer all your colleagues' outlooks.<P>

There are also lots of other comics resources on the Web including collections put together by Thao Tran (<a href="http://www.cen.uiuc.edu/~t-tran/comics.html">Today's Comics on the Web</a>) and David deVitry WebComics. The United Media Syndicate hosts "<a href="http://www.unitedmedia.com/comics">The Comic Strip</a>" and an Australian has even put together a collection of re-runs for fans of Gary Larson's <a href="http://www.ausweb.com.au/FarSide/">The Far Side</a>. Go to your favorite search engine and enter "comics." <P>

Happy surfing!<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Virtual Science on the Web</font><br></b>
</center>
<font size=4>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


4/29/96 -- Remember high school biology class? Dissecting fetal pigs? I remember those rubbery items, about the size of a rat, that smelled strongly of the formaldehyde bath they came in. Red latex had been pumped into their veins and blue latex into their arteries. Otherwise they were uniformly pale gray. They were not cute. At first my lab partner refused to look at ours when I fished him out of the pig jar and put him on a metal tray to begin the day's deconstruction. Eventually she peeked at him. Before long, she was so fascinated, she wouldn't let me take my turn. That was fine with me.<P>



I have always been grateful that Mrs. Cross, our biology teacher, didn't make us cut up frogs instead of pigs, though. Friends have told me of having to go out, catch the creature, and send its little froggy soul back to its maker with a quick stab to the back of the head before beginning the dissection. Eeeuw, yuk! At least our pigs scarcely resembled anything that had once been alive. <P>

<img src=frog.gif width=208 height=208 align=left>

These days, thanks to the wonders of the Internet, you can avoid touching your frog at all! Now you can perform virtual dissection of Fluffy the Frog with the handy dandy <a href="http://www-itg.lbl.gov/ITG.hm.pg.docs/dissect/info.html">Virtual Frog Dissection kit</a>. Fluffy is remarkable. He's a drawing, not  terribly realistic, and he takes a little getting used to. But you can turn him over and sideways and back by clicking on directional arrows, remove his skin, bones and various organs, and enlarge or reduce the image. As I said: remarkable. If you are a science teacher or student, you owe yourself a visit.<P>

Impatient or fastidious scientists will also enjoy <a href="http://vflylab.calstatela.edu/edesktop/VirtApps/VflyLab/IntroVflyLab.html">Virtual FlyLab</a>. Remember trying to learn about genetics in science class? Remember the guinea pigs? Remember the fruit flies - drosophila melanogaster? Recessive and dominant genes? Now you can construct your own experiments with Virtual FlyLab. The program allows you to select characteristics for each parent, then mate them (this happens off-screen) and see how their offspring turn out. Though I am not a scientist, I found this pretty interesting. Maybe there's a computer game in here somewhere: who can come up with the weirdest looking fruit flies?<P>

Fluffy and the fruit flies are only the tip of the iceberg when it comes to science teaching tools on the 'Net. Some are more scholarly than others (and some are nothing but advertisements), but a great guide to links is found on the <a href="http://www.nsta.org/misg/index.htm">National Science Teachers' Association</a> home page. <P>

From archeology to physics, from volcanoes to whales, you'll find dozens of intriguing links here, classified by discipline. <P>

<img src=map.gif width=212 height=184 align=right>

As a girl I dreamed of being an archeologist, so I was particularly taken by the <a href="http://seamonkey.ed.asu.edu/swa/">Southwestern Archeology</a> web site. It has information and pictures of ongoing archeological work throughout the region. I was also fascinated by the intelligent and extensive information about health issues archeologists face when working in the region, from skin cancer and dehydration to valley fever and Hanta virus. <P>

Volcano enthusiasts will like <a href="http://www.dartmouth.edu/pages/rox/volcanoes/elecvolc.html">The Electronic Volcano</a>, edited by Barbara DeFelice, and Richard E. Stoiber at Dartmouth College in Hanover, New Hampshire. It has interesting links for casual browsers as well as serious volcano researchers. Don't miss the photograph by Katia Krafft called "Pele Dancing." <P>

Physicists will have fun with <a href="http://www.qmw.ac.uk/~zgap4027/physics.html">Dominic's Physics Lovers Paradise</a>, whales ethusiasts can learn about how whales are tracked in the oceans from <a href="http://whale.simmons.edu/">WhaleNet</a> at Wheelock College in Boston.<P>

Science teachers should definitely stop by <a href="http://www.cuug.ab.ca:8001/~johnstos/geosci.html">GeoScience: K-12 Resources</a> based in Calgary, Alberta. Although the links are organized by topics prescribed by the Alberta K-12 GeoScience curriculum, Earth Sciences teachers everywhere will find a common ground, so to speak. <P>

(Following a link from the GeoScience home page, I ended up at <a href="http://mineral.galleries.com/bible.htm">Minerals of the Bible</a>. On it, several biblical passages that mention minerals -- gemstones and precious metals -- are hyperlinked to photographs and scientific descriptions of those substances. Neat.)<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Click & Clack Bring CarTalk<BR> Onto The Web</font><br></b>
</center>
<font size=4>

<center>by Kitty Williams</center>


4/29/96 -- "Are these guys on drugs?" my son asked when he heard the NPR program "Car Talk</a>" for the first time several years ago. If you've ever tuned in, you know what he meant. <P>

Their National Public Radio show is raucous and often terminally goofy. I love it. On Saturday mornings, it's the only thing that helps me get through the ironing or whatever housework has built up over the week. <P>


Tom and Ray Magliozzi, a.k.a. Click and Clack, the Tappett brothers, are as punchy as a couple of college kids at the beginning of spring vacation -- after a grueling week of all-nighters.<P>

Although I've been listening to them for years, I knew very little about them until I found their Internet Web Site, <a href="http://cartalk.com">CarTalk.com</a>. As you might imagine from hearing their program, their website is a hoot. Like the show, it is a nice place to waste an hour or so, and is also pretty helpful.<P>

I found the Car Talk history and autobiographies of the perpetrators, an interview with their parents, and <a href="http://cartalk.com/About">short blurbs</a> about their staff. If you ever wondered what Jennifer "Jiffy" Loeb looks like, you can see her at about age 5.  You can also read about Dougie Berman, Ken "Baby Face" Rogers, and J.Bugsy S.M.H.S.C.F.L.T.T.D.B.H.H.G.M.T.T.T.C. Lawlor, Technical Advisor for Dewey, Cheatham and Howe.<P>

Born and brought up in East Cambridge, Mass., Tom and Ray are graduates of the "Toot" as they call M.I.T. Tom has a degree in Chemical Engineering and a Ph.D. in something; Ray has a degree in General Science. You wouldn't know it from their show. <P>

They began broadcasting Car Talk on Boston's WBUR in 1977. Eventually they got paid for it. In 1987, they hit the big time when NPR's Susan Stamberg invited them to be regulars on Sunday Weekend Edition. A few months later NPR gave them their own show.<P>

Now, before anyone imagines that I am a car enthusiast, let me set you straight. It's true that my mother's family used to make cars up in Rochester, N.Y., during the early part of the century, but I didn't inherit those genes. I drive a nine-year-old Ford with more than 200,000 miles on it and a wee bit of rust as decoration. I can't really tell you what color it is -- it's in between gray and medium brown. In the brochure it was called "pewter," but it doesn't look like any pewter I've ever seen. <P>

Until my son grew old enough to take an interest, I have to admit that I didn't check the oil every time I filled up my car. When I was rear-ended (twice within a couple of months) at the toll plaza, I spent the insurance money on groceries instead of fixing the bumper. (It'll only happen again if I fix it, I reasoned.  So far, my theory has worked.)<P>

The Ford's the new car in our family. We also have an '85 Mercury, a '66 Buick and a '41 Pontiac, all more or less roadworthy. We also maintain a '51 Pontiac and a '27-ish Model T for rural decoration (they don't run).<P>

In spite of my relative indifference to cars, I find one does have to know a little bit about them. So I listen to Click and Clack.<P>

Unlike me, they seem to know a fair amount about cars.<P>

You can listen to RealAudio clips from the show, search their columns to find out what they've said about your car (or a car you're interested in), or check their <a href="http://cartalk.com/Tools/car-report.pl">database</a> for National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) recall notices and complaint reports.<P>

Before you leave the site, you ought to look at the classified ads. Apparently they hope to sell ads soon. They don't have a lot of takers, yet, but the sample ads are funny.<P>

If you've never heard Car Talk, click Radio on the navigation bar, and go to the <a  href="http://cartalk.com/Tools/find-cartalk.pl?kind=radio">directory</a> to find out when and where it's broadcast in your state.<P>

4/21/96 -- We had a communication from the IRS recently. Thank goodness it came in the form of a tax refund check! <P>

Stuck in the envelope with it was a card advertising the Internet site for the government's Consumer Information Center. I logged on and took a look. <P>

<img src="consumer.gif" width=131 height=180 align=right>

I clicked on the <a href="http://www.pueblo.gsa.gov">Consumer Information Catalog</a> cover on the opening screen, and was given several options for downloading the 23-page catalog. It took less than a minute with my 14.4 modem to download it in "zipped" format (zipped is computer talk for compressed.) If you don't have a program to un-zip it, go ahead and choose the uncompressed format which won't take much longer to download. <P>

The catalog lists more than 200 free or low cost government publications you can <a href="http://www.pueblo.gsa.gov/instruct.htm">order</a>. Categories include cars, children, employment, environment, federal programs, benefits, food and nutrition, buying and financing, home improvements, money, financial planning, small business, travel and hobbies. There are also special sections about online scams, "Your Family Disaster Supplies Kit," and paying for college.<P>

Once you're at the CIC website, you'll find you don't really need the catalog, although it's useful for reference. The text version of every booklet is available online! <P>

On the lower portion of the download page is a "road sign" listing the various categories of booklets available. "Text format only" means there are no graphics, though. You'll still have to pony up $1.25 or so for the guides with maps or charts, such as the full color "National Park System Map and Guide", or "National Wildlife Refuges: A Visitor's Guide."  You can order printed booklets by fax or by mail, but not online -- yet. <P>

See the instruction page for more information.<P>

<center>* * *</center><P>

One booklet we all ought to read carefully if we're going to spend much time online is "<a href="gopher://gopher.gsa.gov:70/00/staff/pa/cic/misc/scams01.txt">Online Scams: Road Hazards on the Information Superhighway.</a>" As the booklet says, "The scams aren't new, just the medium. Some con artists who always used telemarketing, infomercials, newspapers and magazines, and the mail to attract consumers to their products, services, or investment schemes, now have turned to the Internet and the online services of Cyberspace as the new medium to promote their scams."<P>

Another booklet that looks interesting is "<a href="gopher://gopher.gsa.gov:70/00/staff/pa/cic/misc/fmdiskt.txt">Your Family Disaster Supplies Kit.</a>" It contains a list of things (from a three-days' supply of drinking water and food to medical supplies and games) you might need in case you're stuck at home or suddenly evacuated. It's pretty complicated. Nonetheless, there have been a lot of disasters in the news recently. Massive floods all over the country, chemical spills, severe snow storms ... all have cut people off or forced them to leave their homes. It could happen to you, so why not just  glance over the list?<P>

<center>* * *</center><P>

If you are planning to travel this summer, you might find "<a href="gopher://gopher.gsa.gov:70/00/staff/pa/cic/trav&hob/travel.txt">A Listing of State and Territorial Travel Offices of the United States</a>" helpful. It is a list of addresses and 800 numbers for all state travel offices. It doesn't have the website address, though. Phooey. Maybe next year.<P>

When you have finished exploring the Consumer Information Center's offerings, don't leave before clicking on the button labeled "<a href="http://www.pueblo.gsa.gov/links.htm">Links</a>" at the bottom of the page.<P>

This takes you to a directory of dozens of sites including Federal Indexes, Federal Agencies, Consumer Help, Interesting Information Sites, Commercial Online Services and Community Nets and Freenets.<P>

<img src="am-mem.gif" width=258 height=175 align=left>

I bookmarked it for future reference, but not before following a series of links to reach a delightful treasure. I clicked on <a href="http://www.loc.gov">Library of Congress</a>, about halfway down the list of Federal Agencies. From there, I clicked on <a href="http://lcweb.loc.gov/homepage/rschcoll.html">Research and Collections Services</a>, and thence to the <a href="http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/ammemhome.html">American Memory</a> page. On the <a href="http://lcweb2.loc.gov/ammem/amtitle.new.html">List of all American Memory Collections and Topics</a>, I found "<a href="http://lcweb2.loc.gov/wpaintro/wpahome.html">Life History Manuscripts from the Folklore Project</a>, WPA FEDERAL WRITERS' PROJECT, 1936-1940." It's a huge selection of interviews from 24 states that you can search either by region or by topic. Although I have heard that famous writers like Eudora Welty participated (as a photographer!) in this WPA project, I didn't find anyone I recognized. But every interview is astonishing. Take a look.<P>

<center><b><font size =6>Time Warner's "Pathfinder" <BR>Is Worth Following</font><br></b>
</center>
<font size=4>

<center><b>by Kitty Williams</B></center>




4/21/96 -- Time Warner's website, <a href="http://pathfinder.com/">Pathfinder</a>, is vast and impressive: from a complete online gardening encyclopedia to Time Daily to a live online trivia contest. Every time I go back I find something else to attract and inform. In fact, I subscribe to their weekly email newsletter, Compass, for information about new developments, and check the site frequently. (To subscribe, click on the NEWSLETTER button on Pathfinder's home page.)<P>

<img src="twcompass.gif" width=91 height=78 align=right>

Pathfinder's table of contents consists of Pathfinder's compass rose logo surrounded by links to various categories representing segments of Time Warner's empire. Click on any one and go directly to a vast subset of choices. <P>

Don't try to do it all the first time, though. You'll end up feeling seasick.  And a word of warning: most of these pages are graphics-intense and take a lo-o-o-o-ng time to load. If you don't really need the pictures, click on the "text-only" version when available.<P>

(If you're using Netscape you can turn autoload images off in the Options menu to allow rapid downloading of all pages; if you arrive at a page that might have glorious graphics just click on the Load Images button on the menu bar: Netscape will download the images for just that page.)<P>

My favorite site (surprise!) is <a href="http://pathfinder.com/vg/">The Virtual Garden</a> found under Home & Hobbies. In this  garden you'll find articles from Southern Living and Sunset magazines, the Time Life Gardening Library, the Time Life Complete Gardener Encyclopedia Search Page, a house plant directory, garden projects, excerpts from garden books and a list of public gardens and plant societies. The Gardener Encyclopedia is wonderful for those of us who don't have complete horticultural libraries. Enter a plant's common or botanical name and it will come back with a color picture, growing instructions and a list of related information. <P>

In the News and Politics category, you'll find Time Magazine, Time Daily, AllPolitics, Congressional Quarterly Vote Watch, People, Life, Money Daily, National Review, and Asia Week. "Black History through the Ages," set up to mark Black History Month, has art, photography,  history and more.<P>

Click on Money and Business for links to Fortune Magazine, Hoover's Business Profiles, Progressive Farmer and Quick Quote.<P>

Under Sports: Sports Illustrated's <a href="http://pathfinder.com/si/welcome.html">SI Online</a> and Sports Illustrated for Kids. You can get to Swimsuits '96 from SI Online if it's your kind of thing. I don't think they offer a text only version of that site ... ;-)<P>

<img src="isatafac.gif" width=281 height=152 align=right>

<a href="http://pathfinder.com/pathfinder/fact/">Is That a Fact?</a> is an online live quiz show, listed under entertainment. The show airs (?) on Tuesdays and Thursdays at 7:30 p.m. You can test yourself  with previous quizzes, archived at the site, and submit them to find out how well you score. When your confidence is high enough, you can try out for a slot as a live contestant and play for prizes.<P>

<a href="http://pathfinder.com/Netly">The Netly News</a> is entertaining. The opening page has a dancing cow in tennis shoes and a party hat, and the disclaimer that although no cows were harmed in the production of the site; the Netly News is not for kids. The day I looked it had some pages that sounded unsuitable. The rest consisted of reviews of sites about business, golf, the unabomber, the telecommunications act, and cooking.<P>

Online game fans -- or classicists -- should drop in at <a href="http://pathfinder.com/twep/rome">S.P.Q.R.</a>, an interactive mystery game set in ancient Rome. My PC's modem is too slow for its large graphics, so I've never had the patience to get very far. Diehards and enthusiasts can save their place from one online session to the next, so if you have a really fast modem, you may have fun with this.<P>

I have to mention Pathfinder's search engine <a href="http://pathfinder.com/cgi-bin/siteseeker">SiteSeeker</a>. There may be enough search engines on the Web already, but SiteSeeker is a little different. It's organized by categories, like all the others, and you can search by keyword or concept. Each site is rated with up to five stars, and before clicking the link to the site, you can read a brief review. Sites that are "kid-safe" have a green light. Click on "more options" to limit your search to sites rated a minimum number of stars or only kid-safe sites. I don't always agree with the ratings, but it's better than surfing blind.<P>

Money, Fame and True Love are All Due ...</font><br></b>
</center>
<font size=4>

<center><b>by Kitty Williams</B></center>


4/21/96 -- I have a secret vice. I hate to admit it, because I know everyone will laugh at me, but I always read my horoscope in the paper. With the Internet, I've gotten a lot worse.<P>

There's a whole new world of horoscoping out there. <P>

It used to be that my only choice was on the back of the comics section of our hometown paper. Now, if that one doesn't suit me, I have lots more to choose from. I can just keep going until I find a forecast I like!<P>

<img src="jonpic.gif" width=142 height=182 align=right>

When I log onto the Internet, I first check the UK Daily Mail for <a href="http://marilyn.metawire.com/stars/index.html">Jonathan Cainer's Daily Zodiac Forecasts</a>. My bookmark is set to my own sign, so I don't have to look at the color photograph of Jonathan every day. Each to his own, I guess, but I've never gotten used to his seven-day-beard look (though it's in style). I do like the neato stars-and-moons pattern on his jacket, though!<P>

Looks aren't everything, and Cainer's daily readings are well-written and thoughtful. And they are always encouraging and upbeat, even when the stars all seem ranged against you. If you prefer your readings a week at a time, click the RealAudio button to listen to his forecasts for the week ahead. I won't vouch for his personal horoscopes, which cost about thirty bucks. I am way too cheap to find out if they're any good.<P>

If you are a skinflint like me, but you want a personal chart, you can use <a href="http://www.idirect.com/astrology">Oracle's Astrolog Chart Calculation</a> to create one. You enter your birthdate, time, and the longitude and latitude of your birthplace (there's a link to help you figure that out -- <a href="http://wings.buffalo.edu/geogw">Geographic Name Server/Xerox Map Gateway</a>) and click a button. I haven't a clue what it all means, but it's free! <P>

<a href="http://www.math.grin.edu/~motika/horoscope.html">Astrological Horoscope Casting</a> is another free, interactive chart program. In addition to telling you where the planets were when you were born, it draws a pretty color chart.<P>

<img src="astroleft.gif" width=183 height=139 align=left>

Another favorite astrology site is <a href="http://pathfinder.com/twep/astrology/">The Astrology Zone</a> from Time Warner Electronic Publishing. The astrologer, who has been doing this for 20 years, is Susan Miller, a member of the American Federation of Astrologers. She writes for a couple of national magazines.<P>

Since my horoscope for April promises "Money, fame, and true love are all due to you in this benchmark month," I hope she knows what she's talking about! In addition to month-at-a-time and year-at-a-time horoscopes, Ms. Miller writes monthly features. The current one is the slightly naughty "Seducing your Lover by Sign." The next one will be "Stress Busters by Sign."<P>

If you still are looking a horoscope to suit you, there's the <a href="http://www.cam.org/~fishon1/horo.html">Weekly HomePagers Horoscope</a>, <a href="http://www.bdd.com/horo1/bddhoro1.cgi/horo1">Dell's daily horoscope</a> and stock market outlook, or <a href="http://www2.romance.net/horoscope/">Romance.net's daily horoscope</a> which has nice, antique-looking drawings but lightweight horoscopes. <P>

(Romance.net is the Harlequin Books' website, by the way, where you'll find all you need to know about their various romance novel series. You can also learn to say "Will you marry me?" (phonetically) in one of "Harlequin's 23 languages." It was in Hungarian, the day I checked.)<P>

America Online subscribers can use keyword "Astronet" to reach the AOL astrology site. At the opening screen, if your computer has speakers, a voice intones "invade our space." Click the spinning white ball marked "A net" for the index, or click Chinese Astrology, ASTROMates, Newsstand, Horoscopes, Shopping, Chat, Astronet Central or Messages.<P>

The Horoscopes button leads to some unusual horoscopes, from Dr. Brown's monthly Healthcasts to the Cosmic Muffin and Carole 2000. There's also an interactive horoscope selection. <P>

If you seeing stars after this whirlwind tour and need to talk to someone, AOL's Astronet chat area posts a packed schedule each week and Jonathan Cainer has a raft of message boards in his "Astro Chat" area. Have fun but remember to keep your feet on the ground!<P>

<header><title>Women</title> </header> <p><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFE8"><html><center><img src=banners.gif><BR><b><font size =5>Women are Finding Their Place on the Web</font><br></b>
by Kitty Williams</center>


The time has passed when almost everybody on the Internet was young and male. According to an article in the Sacramento Bee's series <a href="http://www.nando.net/sacbee/women/">Women and Computers: A special report</a>, about 35 percent of the Internet's 10 million users are women. <P>

<img src="hed.gif" width=331 height=164 align=right hspace=4 vspace=4>

Websites for women range across the political spectrum, from Phyllis Schlafly's <a href="http://www.basenet.net/~eagle/eagle.html">Eagle Forum home page</a> to the <a href="http://www.feminist.org/">Feminist Majority Foundation</a>. The League of Women Voters of the United States has a <a href="http://www.electriciti.com/~lwvus/">home page</a>, as does the <a href="http://www.now.org/now">National Organization of Women</a>.<P>

Whether a woman is looking for support during a difficult time or for ways to become involved in global or  local issues, there is help on the Internet.<P>

America Online users can use the keyword Women to access message boards and websites on a variety of women's issues. It has links to everything from the New York Women's Bar Association, women in business, and women journalists to links for single parents, PowerSurge for women undergoing menopause, and more.<P>

If you intend to participate in "Take Our Daughters to Work" on April 25, use the keyword "Daughters" on America Online to learn more about the event.<P>

Women have worried, with reason, about being harassed online and in chat groups. Fortunately, there are ways to avoid the unpleasant side of the net. If you are in an America Online chat group, and someone becomes obnoxious, just click the name in the upper right hand corner of your screen, then click "ignore" in the box that appears. Their messages no longer appear on your screen. If the chat is hosted, the host can exclude the offender completely. Internet discussion groups usually have a forum manager who can do the same. <P>

With more and more women on the Internet, it is easy to find a group -- or start up a group -- for people with common interests. America Online also allows you to set up a private chat room where you can meet with only the people you invite to join you there. (This makes for a lively family reunion as well.)<P>

Many discussions take place in news groups and listservs, both terms for a continuing series of email messages. If you subscribe to a listserv, the e-mails will come directly into your e-mail folder. It can be overwhelming -- make sure you save the instructions for un-subscribing, which they will send you when you subscribe.<P>

<a href="http://www.femina.com">FeMiNa</a> is a good example of websites geared toward women. It contains links to sites featuring women artists, women-owned businesses, women in computing, women of color, women's studies, educational resources, entertainment & leisure, family resources, feminism, girl-friendly resources, health & well-being , sexuality, organizations, politics, publications, religion & spirituality (a rather weird set of links, if you ask me), shopping, women's sports, women's personal websites and writing resources. <P>

With women's sports gaining more and more popular support among both men and women, the links on the <a href="http://www.femina.com/femina/sports">Women's Sports Pages</a> will be interesting to sports fans. There you will find an international sports tournament list, CAAWS -Canadian Association for the Advancement of Women and Sport and Physical Activity, a variety of college sports home pages including Duke Blue Devil Sports, Virginia Tech Intercollegiate Athletics, and Wichita State University Sports; and information about basketball, bodybuilding, hockey, lacrosse, rugby, soccer, softball, tennis, Frisbee, volleyball, watersports, skydiving, flyfishing and T'ai Chi. An instructive variety...<P>

There is an effort afoot to get more girls up onto the Internet, and several interesting sites have been devised to attract them. <a href="http://www.girlgamesinc.com/interwire.html">Interwire</a>, an interactive newsletter for teenaged girls, contains short articles about issues concerning girls, with a gently feminist slant. The April edition deals with modeling as a career, the influence of dreams, the Olympic games, and women in politics. At the end of each article are a few "what do you think?" questions, and the reader can respond. Each issue also has a slightly longer article about women with interesting occupations.

<header><title>Reference</title> </header> <p><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFE8"><html><center><b><font size =5>My Virtual Reference Desk Puts it All at Your Fingertips</font><br></b>
by Kitty Williams</center>


The hardest thing about the Internet, for most people, is learning how to use it efficiently. In fact, I'm not sure it can be used all that efficiently.<P>

Some people can go into a shopping mall or a department store, buy exactly what they want, and come right back out. Others can go to the grocery and buy exactly what is on their list and not one thing more -- not a candy bar, not a jar of fancy olives, not a bag of chips. They're amazing. <P>

Just between us, I'm not like that at all. Although I seldom go shopping, when I do set foot inside a mall I usually cruise the length and breadth of it, just to be sure I don't miss anything.<P>

So, learning to use the net without unnecessarily wasting time is both a goal and a challenge for me. I have undying admiration for organized, disciplined foragers for goods or information. Part of me wants to be just like them, but I'm not sure the organized, disciplined approach is best for the net.<P>

The problem is, if you are too narrow in your researches on the net, you'll probably miss the one thing that would make your surfing safari truly worthwhile.<P>



Don't throw your hands up in the air yet. Don't nod sagely and say "I told you so -- the Information Superhighway is nothing but a warren of dead-end side-roads!" Fortunately for those who are too busy or impatient to let the net take them where it will and those who don't love the road less traveled, there's an alternative. Elaborate web sites exist, with well organized links to all the reference material a serious person would want. In other words, there are people who are obviously enjoy exploring every link and creating useful tools so you can get where you want to be without going nuts.<P>

<img src="mvrd.gif" width=292 height=86 align=left hspace=4 vspace=4>

<a href="http://www.refdesk.com">My Virtual Reference Desk</a>, compiled and organized by Bob Drudge, is virtual one-stop information shopping. By searching out links to myriad sources, Mr. Drudge has done a real service to anyone who needs specific kinds of information quickly and in a usable form.<P>

If you need to know the time according to the US Naval Observatory Atomic Clock, Mr. Drudge has provided a link. If you can't find your dictionary anywhere in the piles of books on your desk, there's a link to the Hypertext Webster's Dictionary. <P>

There's a <a href="http://www.earth.com/calendar">searchable calendar</a> that allows you to look at any month in any year. They suggest you look up August 1752 to see what happened in the Gregorian Reformation (hint: why did the peasants riot and demand they be given back their eleven days?). The National Debt, the US and World Population Clocks, an on-line calculator, news, weather and sports -- all there. Visit the section titled "My Virtual Newspaper" for links to news summaries and world newspapers, business news, technology reports. You can also find horoscopes, comics, crossword puzzles, and stock quotes.<P>

My Virtual Encyclopedia has 33 subcategories, ranging from Arts and Culture to Women's Issues. Virtual Encyclopedia links you to encyclopedias, dictionaries, thesauri, electronic texts, genealogy resources, atlases, phone books, legal resources and more. Not all the sites MVRD takes you to are free. Some, like the Encyclopedia Britannica On-line, only have a taste of the full product. You must subscribe to use the whole thing. Based on the sample tidbits I think it looks a whole lot better than the disappointing hardback edition which I consulted a few months ago in the Public Library. It had been simplified to death. Our 1958 edition is better!<P>

Finally, don't miss <a href="http://www.refdesk.com/animate.html">My Animated GIF89 collection</a> of lots of funny little moving pictures. Mr. Drudge has scattered them throughout his site, so you'll recognize some if you've toured it. I like them all, especially the book with turning pages, Sisyphus and his rock, a beating heart, and a little round button that changes color across the spectrum. <P>

<header><title>Roots</title> </header> <p><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFE8"><html><center><img src=banners.gif><BR><b><font size =5>Using the Web to Find Your Roots</font><br></b>
by Kitty Williams</center>

In Virginia, where we live, fascination with one's ancestors is more than just a hobby -- it's very nearly a religion for some. Some would say it's a vice. "Shintoism," my uncle calls it (though most of us are Episcopalians).<P>

<img src="gen.gif" width=240 height=180 align=left hspace=4 vspace=4>

We tend to listen quietly when the aunts and uncles tell the stories and scandals of their parents' generation.  <P>

They discuss who married whom and how so and so is connected to such and such. My father could reel off our connection to George Washington without a hitch, and I'm sure the rest of them can, too. As they age, they get mixed up about generations, and ask us about things that happened decades before we were born.<P>

And there's the great aunt who misbehaved. Her husband divorced her. Her children were told she was dead. Worst of all, she was removed from the family pictures. There's a shrublike thing where her image used to be. (In the days before Photoshop and computer-retouching, it took a photographer with a stylus hours to scratch out her image on the negative.) All that remains is a disembodied hand on her former husband's shoulder. Everyone loves that story.<P>

It's fun, but you have to be careful. Some resentments survive long after the original players turned to dust.<P>

In Virginia, when someone asks "Who is she?" they don't mean "What's her name?" they mean a whole series of things including "What was her grandmother's maiden name?" It can be frightening, or even annoying, if you aren't used to it.<P>

It shouldn't be. Everyone has ancestors, though not everyone needs or wants to climb the family tree. That's fine, but genealogy and the study of ancestors are not only interesting to Virginians. Judging by the quantity of information on the Internet for genealogists and family historians, it is of interest to lots of others.<P>

One of our friends posted a message last year looking for people who shared his surname and got a reply from Australia. That led to the discovery of mutual ancestors in Alsace-Lorraine and resulted in the sharing of a turn of the century family photograph from Belgium that looked remarkably similar to family photos taken in America.<P>

For those tending their family trees, the Internet's ability to link and share information makes it a fertile ground. Information in linked databases can be both manageable and comprehensive. Certainly it is easier to follow than those handwritten, fan-shaped family trees that degenerate into minuscule, unreadable ant-writing within a few generations.<P>

Whether your own ancestors came here by land, by sea or by air; across a pre-historic land bridge, on the Mayflower, on a slave ship or through Ellis Island; voluntarily or in chains; as adventurers or as refugees; you will find fellow searchers on the Internet who can help you in your quest.<P>

If you subscribe to America Online, the place to start is the Genealogy Forum (keyword: Genealogy or Roots). If you are interested, and you aren't an AOL subscriber, you might even consider a trial subscription. The Genealogy Forum is divided into several areas: the conference rooms, the software area, the message area, the research area, and genealogy search. There is also a history area. <P>

According to Forum Leader George Ferguson: "One cannot understand other generations unless [one] understand[s] what was happening to them and around them."  The conference rooms have a schedule of chats about general genealogy, special interest or ethnic groups and late night chats for night owls and people on the west coast.<P>

In the software area, you can upload or download your own records or software. You can post questions and answers in several categories in the message area. The research area, currently under construction, has articles of genealogical interest. There are big gaps, but the traffic is heavy. The more people add, the more useful this area will become.<P>

America Online is not the only good resource. One of the Internet genealogy websites may further your search as well or better. Start with the <a href="http://www.refdesk.com/facts1.html#gen">Genealogy Resources</a> compiled by My Virtual Reference Desk. <a href="http://ftp.cac.psu.edu/~saw/genealogy-full.html">The Genealogy Home Page</a> is a good one, as is <a href="http://sillyg.doit.com/genweb/">GenWeb</a>, and the <a href="http://genealogy.org/NGS/">National Genealogical Society</a>. The last site includes a list of questions to review before undertaking an oral history. They would be equally worth perusal by someone writing a personal history for his or her descendants. <P>

Good luck! May your ancestors smile on you.<P>

<header><title>Money</title> </header> <p><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFE8"><html><center><img src=banners.gif><BR><b><font size =5>Finding Money on the Web</font><br></b>


by Kitty Williams</center>
"Money, money, money makes the world go 'round," sang Joel Grey in the movie, Cabaret.  Although people have argued equally forcefully that love, or some principle of physics, actually keeps the globe spinning, money is pretty darn important. 

<P>We worry about debt and taxes, investments and retirement, and how to increase our earning power. We tend to take St. Paul's statement that "the love of money is the root of all evil" with a grain of salt.

<P>Those interested in money would do well to visit the website of the <a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/treasury/Welcome.html">U.S. Department of the Treasury</a>.

<img src="franklin.gif" width=260 height=109 align=right hspace=4 vspace=4>

<P>There are many interesting and useful links on this site for everyone from bankers  to international traders to small business owners to interested citizens. (Unless you really want to read them, you can skip Secretary Rubin's old speeches, and archived Treasury press releases in the Treasury Electronic Library.)

<P><a href="http://www.dgsys.com/~intra2/INTRAPO.HTML">INTRADEX</a>, the International Trade Data Exchange Project Office </a>, has progress reports on the International Trade Data System, which, when completed, will be an "internet application to advise and guide you on International Trade; procedures, laws, licenses, permits, regulations, directives, resources, and statistics."

<P>Tax time is upon us. If you still have questions, and you've about bitten your fingernails off, you might find some answers at the new <a href="http://www.irs.ustreas.gov/prod/">IRS Server</a>. Unlikely as it sounds, the site is amusing and well designed. Among the things you'll find there are information about personal and business taxes, on-line filing help, and forms and publications you can download and use. 

<P>Small business owners or those interested in starting a small business should explore the <a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/treasury/services/services.html"> Small Business Program site</a>. There you will find information on small and disadvantaged business utilization and partnership conferences. You can also find out how to connect to SBA ON-LINE, an electronic bulletin board service with information on starting or running a small business. 

<P>The Treasury Home page also has links to information about foreign assets control, electronic certification, the Freedom of Information Act and savings bonds. 

<P>The <a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/treasury/bureaus/pubdebt/save.html">savings bond site</a> links you to an on-line calculator at the <a href="http://www.ny.frb.org/pihome/svg_bnds/sb_val.html">Federal Reserve Bank of New York</a> that can tell you what your bonds are currently worth. You enter the denomination, the series and the issue date, and click a button. Within seconds, the calculator comes up with the figure.

<P>While you're at the Treasury, don't forget to find out about the new $100 bill. Everything you want to know is there, under <a href="http://www.ustreas.gov/treasury/whatsnew/newcur/">New Currency</a>. You can admire Ben Franklin's new look, inspect the watermark portrait, see what they mean by "color changing ink" and scrutinize the concentric lines that make up the engravings and the impossibly small microprinted words in the fold of Ben's lapel.. 

<P>After all that touring, its time for a little shopping. How about a visit to <a href="http://www.usmint.gov/">The 1995 United States Mint Gift Collection</a>? Click on the really strange looking graphic that seems to be half a keyring with a Kennedy half dollar and half a fancy blue and clear crystal wine goblet to enter the catalog. There you'll find annual coins and sets; jewelry, including a pair of uncirculated gold American Eagle cufflinks; and $100 and $2000 bags of uncirculated Susan B. Anthony silver dollars.  

<P>You can also look at some of the property the IRS and Customs has seized and plans to auction. There's a lakefront estate in Lake Tahoe, California, that sure is pretty, minimum bid: $1 million plus. Or perhaps you'd rather have a 1987 Jeep Comanche pickup with 120K miles for a minimum bid of $900. You'd have to go to Scotia, NY to bid on it, though.

<P>The Treasury website is updated frequently and contains many other interesting links. There's plenty of grist for the mills of election year debates. For example you can find out the exact size of the National Debt, read the Treasury's report to Congress on Mexico, or browse the ATF Alcohol and Firearms regulations. Check it out.

<P>COOL/HOT LINK: <a href="http://www.cs.rdg.ac.uk/archive/palindrome//emordnilap/evihcra/ku.ca.gdr.sc.www//:ptth/">Palindromes: World's first palindromic URL?</a> ()

<header><title>Mapping</title> </header> <p><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFE8"><html><center><img src=banners.gif><BR><b><font size =5>Mapping Your Travels on the Web</font><br></b>


by Kitty Williams</center>


Will you be traveling anytime soon?  If you are like many of us, the answer is yes. Whether for pleasure, business, or to take your teenager to look at colleges, you will probably be venturing into unknown territory before long.<P>

<P>There is a surprisingly helpful resource on the Internet for planning your next journey. <a href="http://www.mapquest.com/">MapQuest</a> is an easy to use way to get maps and directions. I like the way it looks, too, with its amusing, 1940s-style graphics. From the opening screen -- an illustration of a family on a motoring vacation getting directions from a friendly-looking cop -- it makes you want to pack up the car and go.

<img src="Postcard.gif" width=280 height=170 align=right hspace=4 vspace=4>


<P>MapQuest can locate a business or a street address, and will provide a map to get you there. If you prefer, you can ask for detailed directions and mileage from anywhere to anywhere else within the continental United States. 

<P>Use the Interactive Atlas to find where your friends live or where your client's offices are. Simply enter a street address in the blanks provided and it returns a map showing the exact location. An adjustable scale along the side of the screen allows you to request street, city, state or national level detail on any map.

<P>The maps are not as attractive as those on Rand McNally's StreetFinder CDRom, (which, by the way, is a very useful trip-planning tool) but there appears to be more information. Some of it is out of date, but MapQuest also includes the very newest roads. It's strange. When I checked our area, for example, I spotted a road that was torn up and its asphalt bulldozed into a pile, more than fifteen years ago. At the same I also saw nearby roads that are only a few years old. These people apparently add new information without deleting the obsolete stuff. It's a fairly minor gripe, though. The road in question is not a major thoroughfare and would have been easy to overlook.

<P>Icons marking the locations of hotels, cyber cafes, airports, hospitals, museums, parks, and other places of interest, can be added to the maps, if you want. I wouldn't recommend asking for too much information on a city-level map, though: you end up with a crazy quilt of icons that completely obliterates the map itself. 

<P>For best results, start from a detailed map and only request the locations of businesses, services and facilities that you really want. When you click on an icon (having marked the button below the map next to "identify icon" beforehand) MapQuest will tell you the name and exact address of the place, as well as its web address if it has one.<P>

TripQuest, which gives you directions from one place to another, is also very good. If you enter your starting point and your destination, MapQuest will give you the mileage and what look like very good directions. We're going to test them this summer.

<P>Other areas of the website are not as well developed.	

<P>CyberHomes is not much use yet. It's a real estate listing service that opens with a clickable map of the United States. You are told to click on one of the highlighted states, but only Illinois and Texas are highlighted. I clicked on Illinois. Only listings in Chicago are available. Movie Guide gives you information about movies in San Francisco and Los Angeles. No use to me. Still, MapQuest is already a site you should visit before traveling in the "lower 48.".

<P>What if you are not sure of the exact address of the friend or business you want to visit? The best tool for finding addresses and telephone numbers that I have found so far is <a href="http://www.switchboard.com/">Switchboard</a>, a nationwide business and residential directory. It looks as though information from all U.S. telephone books is in their database. You can also register with Switchboard to add, tailor or delete your listing. If you want, you can add your email address or the URL of your own web page.

by Kitty Williams</center>


The grocery store line slows down while checker and customer compare due dates. Party girls drink wine spritzers, please hold the wine. Corporate executives balloon out under their expensive, tailored maternity suits. Aerobic instructors can't do sit-ups along with their classes. 

<P>One of surest signs that it's spring is that pregnant women seem to be everywhere.

<img src="baby.gif" width=230 height=230 align=right hspace=4 vspace=4>

<P>Maybe  there really are more than at other times of the year, or maybe they've recently shed their winter coats and their interesting condition is more apparent. Whatever the reason, this time of year it seems natural and proper to contemplate fertility in all its forms, human included. 

<P>From the <a href="http://www.childbirth.org">Pregnancy, Reproduction, and Health Education Page</a> to <a hef="http://www.parentsoup.com/cgi-bin/genobject/pmp000">Parent Soup</a> to the <a href="http://www.parentsplace.com/readroom/frc/index.html">Fathers' Resource Center</a> the Internet is rich in resources for parents..

<P>There are pages devoted to and motherhood and fatherhood, calculators for gestation times, answers to all kinds of questions, and <a href="http://q.continuum.net/~sidsnet/pil.htm">support</a> for those who have miscarried or lost their babies.

<P><a href="http://www.childbirth.org">The Pregnancy, Reproduction, and Health Education Page</a> is comprehensive and very well organized.  Maintained by Robin Elise Weiss (robin@childbirth.org), a reproductive health educator in Louisville, Ky., it is worthy of a visit by anyone who is pregnant or contemplating pregnancy.  Her philosophy, "birth is a natural process, not a medical procedure," doesn't prevent her from offering good information and answers to the medical questions that parents have.

<P><a hef="http://www.parentsoup.com/cgi-bin/genobject/pmp000">Parent Soup</a> (AOL Keyword Parent Soup) is a delight. I wish I had had a resource like that when I had young children. It is light-hearted and friendly, but full of solid advice and support. New parents can read excerpts from the 22 books by the pediatrician and nurse combo, Dr. Bill & Martha Sears (who also are parents of eight!). There's also a pregnancy planner and a photo gallery of baby pictures. 

<P>Parents of older children will also find much of interest here. For example, there's advice about the special issues of  raising daughters (should you give a two year old a Barbie doll?) and sons ("Boys are known for their absent-mindedness between eight and twelve"), or coping with teens and alcohol ("drinking and driving is so dangerous that it MUST be handled EXPLICITLY").

<P>My favorite area of Parent Soup, though is <a href="http://www.parentsoup.com/cgi-bin/bboard/message/6">Primal Scream</a>, found among the Bulletin Boards, if you've accessed Parent Soup via the Internet, or under Messages if you got there by AOL. It is priceless. 

<P>At one time or another most mothers and fathers have been pushed to the edge of sanity by their adorable little children. No matter how helplessly out of control they feel, all they can do is grit their teeth and hold on. Or they can log on to Parent Soup and let out a Primal Scream. America Online even offers the option of using a pseudonym when posting a message! Some of the messages are tremendously funny, others are heart-breaking. But the best part is the way parents support each other with understanding, advice, and the assurance that others have been there and survived.

<P>Finally, there are many websites devoted to fathers on the Web. One, the <a href="http://www.parentsplace.com/readroom/frc/index.html">Fathers' Resource Center</a> page is run by a nonprofit family service agency in Minneapolis. The center's "philosophy is that by helping fathers become more capable and involved parents that fathers, mothers, children and subsequently, all society will benefit."

<P>I particularly enjoyed the Father Times Newsletter Online which includes a very useful article, <a href="http://www.parentsplace.com/readroom/frc/spr96net.html">"Fathers on the 'Net,</a>" by Chris Stafford which will lead you to many more resources for fathers.

<P>One of its links led me to <a href="http://www.fsci.umn.edu/cyfc/FatherNet.htp">FatherNet </a>, run by the University of Minnesota. It is "the electronic continuation of Family Re-Union III: The Role of Men in Children's Lives, a national conference on family policy moderated by Vice President Al Gore and co-sponsored by the Children, Youth and Family Consortium and the Tennessee Department of Human Services," in July 1994. According to Stafford's article, it "is the original fathers resource on the 'net." It's amazing how far things have come in less than two years!

<center><img src=banners.gif><P>
<b><font size =5>Worried About Mad Cow Disease?</font><br></b>
by Robin Lind</center>

Have you ever read a brief article and wanted to know more? A lot more?<P>

My interest in one particular story that has been unfolding over the past month led me to the World Wide Web this week with the hope of finding more on "Mad Cow Disease."<P>

<img src="madcow.gif" width=312 height=268 align=right hspace=4 vspace=4>

First, for those of you who may have missed the story entirely, a disease prevalent in sheep for hundreds of years (Scrapie) crossed the species barrier and appeared in British cattle about 15 years ago where it is known as "Bovine Spongiform Encephalopathy" (BSE). If you try to say that aloud you understand why most people call it "Mad Cow Disease." <P>

The British government has just recently acknowledged that this disease in cattle has now apparently crossed another species barrier and appeared in humans. Known in humans as Creutzfeld-Jakob Disease (CJD), it is a fatal, degenerative brain disease which takes from two to 30 years to incubate. It is incurable.<P>

During the past year 10 Britons were diagnosed with a variant of CJD apparently related to BSE. Eight have already died.<P>

The result of the British government's acknowledgment has been an understandable panic among British consumers, the removal of British beef from major fast-food outlets and British supermarkets, and a ban by most European countries on the importation of British beef.<P>

My interest was part general curiosity and part genuine concern. Should our family continue to eat beef? Should I be concerned about this happening in America? How could I learn more?<P>

This is a quest for which the World Wide Web is uniquely qualified.<P>

I began my research using <a href="http://guide.infoseek.com">"Infoseek"</a>, one of the many free search engines that enable you to seek out information on specific topics. I typed in "Mad Cow Disease" (using quotation marks ensures the search brings back references with all three words together) and got 14 "hits."<P>

The first listing was for the Independent <a href="http://inet.uni-c.dk/~iaotb/bse.htm">Agrochemical Observer</a> which provided links to other sites about the disease in Britain. There I found a <a href="http://www.mcspotlight.org/beyond/bse_links.htm">site</a> which provides other links including lists of current articles about BSE from <a href="http://www.the-times.co.uk/news/pages/Times/timopnedt01003.html">The Times of London</a>.<P>

I also found a <a href="http://www.who.ch/programmes/emc/bsefacts.htm">BSE Fact Sheet</a> produced on March 26, 1996 by the World Health Organization (WHO) and a <a href="http//www.easynet.co.uk/ifst/hotop5.htm">Position Statement</a> issued by  the British Institute of Food Science & Technology on March 27.<P>

WHO's fact sheet is a brief summary of what's known, helpful for understanding the scope of the problem. Their chief conclusion is that "if the measures taken in the United Kingdom ... were being strictly implemented, the risk of ... possible BSE transmission to bhumans, would be minimized." The source is credible and I felt reassured. They'll be meeting again this week in Geneva and I'll be back to their home page to check to latest news on April 4.<P>

The British report I read with a little more skepticism; after all, they have a material interest in a satisfactory conclusion. Their conclusion went further than saying the risk would be "minimized": they said "muscle meat of British beef would appear to be without risk of causing CJD." I didn't feel quite so reassured.<P>

The Infoseek search also turned up an <a href="http://www.envirolink.org/arrs/AnimaLife/spring94/madcow.html">article</a> about Mad Cow Disease which it described as "Much More Serious Than AIDS."<P>

This certainly piqued my interest and I printed out the full five-page story. The tone was inflammatory and sensational but the text was very heavily footnoted. It concluded with a challenge to the reader: "Do not take my word for any of this. Go to the library; check out Agricola, Medline, Biosis, CAB Extracts, the online catalog, anything. Time is of the essence."<P>

 As I read it, I was increasingly shocked. Frankly, I could not believe what I was reading. It was too incredible.<P>

I wanted to know more about the article and its author. There was nothing to identify it: no date, no publication, no author's credentials. Was this fiction? Was it a prank? Was it animal rights protest? Was this information or misinformation?<P>

To identify the publication I shortened the title of the web page to <a href="http://www.envirolink.org/arrs/AnimaLife"> http://www.envirolink.org/arrs/AnimaLife</a> and tried it by itself. It turned out to be an independent student-run magazine published at Cornell University in Ithaca, NY. The Mad Cow Disease article had actually been published in the spring of 1994 --well before the current crisis in Britain.<P>

Still there was no information about the author so I sent an email to the AnimaLife webmaster whose address was hyperlinked at the bottom of the main page, asking for background on author Michael Greger.<P>

Next I went back to Infoseek and searched for Michael Greger by name: I got three results, all of which identified him as the author of an introductory essay for medical school applicants. His essay indicated that he is a candidate for an MD/Ph.D. and his email address indicated Tufts University is his present location. I sent him an email asking for background on the Cornell article. If this was the same Michael Greger who wrote the article about Mad Cow Disease, his medical/science qualifications had certainly been given a boost.<P>

But what of some of the scientific claims he made? Could Mad Cow Disease really be as frightening as he said it is? <P>

My searches on the Web for some of his footnoted articles weren't very successful. However, a look at another one of Infoseek's references yielded <a href="http://www.nmia.com/~mdibble/prion.html">an 8-page article</a> from Scientific American on Prion Diseases written by Stanley B. Prusiner, a professor of neurology and biochemistry at the University of California. <P>

Since Dr. Prusiner was the first scientist to propose the existence of infectious particles comprised only of protein and invented the term "Prion" I felt somewhat reassured about the credibility of his information. The information, however, only increased my sense of alarm about what is going on with Mad Cow Disease.<P>

Can you believe what you find on the Web?<P>

The information on the Web is no more or less credible than you find anywhere else. You may have a little easier time locating and retrieving it; you still need to assess and weigh it to determine its value.<P>

A few hours after emailing the webmaster at AnimaLife I got a reply confirming that Michael Greger had been a junior at Cornell when he wrote the article and was well-known to the webmaster. The following day I got a reply from Michael Greger himself, confirming that he is a medical student at Tufts University School of Medicine and was a biology major at Cornell when he wrote the article.<P>

Was there any feedback to his article I had asked. <P>

"Presumably because of all the controversy I stirred up at Cornell (by publishing and giving talks on the subject)" Greger replied, "the Food Science Department brought C.J. Gibbs (NIH bigwig; prion expert (and come to think of it, Prusiner came too)) to allay fears. But he was more radical than I was!"<P>

"Mad Cow Disease" is a subject that is going to become much more widely discussed in the year ahead. You may wait for the mainstream press to focus on it later this year or you may focus on it yourself by searching the Web now. This story is one that is not going away.<P>

<header><title>Academic Bounty</title> </header> <p><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFE8"><html><center><img src=banners.gif><BR><b><font size =5>Academics Still Provide Internet Bounty</font><br></b>
by Kitty Williams</center>

The Internet is so snappy, so wild, so jazzy, so spiffy, so downright exciting, that it is hard to remember that it was once the exclusive domain of academics and scientists. Everyone gets so anxious about its potential to replace television as the primo brainsucker and corrupter of innocents that they forget that a large number of surfers are into Shakespeare, Jane Austen, Chaucer, the Bible, and other such staid pursuits. <P>

<img src="bard.gif" width=222 height=282 align=right hspace=4 vspace=4>

The old profs are still out there, half glasses perched on their noses, pencils stuck into their hastily pinned up hair or tweed jackets coming out at the elbows, pipe dottle sprinkled over their keyboards, rings from countless coffee cups decorating the tops of their desks.  From <a href=http://the-tech.mit.edu/Shakespeare>The Complete Works of William Shakespeare</a>, to the <a href="http://uts.cc.utexas.edu/~churchh/janeinfo.html">Jane Austen Information Page</a>, the scholars' love for the written word and endless assessment and reassessment of its meanings shines through website after website.<P>

If you never gotten your own set of Yale Shakespeare (the little, blue cloth-bound volumes), do not despair. The Complete Works has all you need and more, including the newly discovered Funeral Elegy. And it's all searchable. In addition, you can find a Shakespeare discussion area, links to Shakespeare resources on the Internet, chronological and alphabetical listings of plays, a glossary, and a link to Bartlett's familiar Shakespearean quotations. <P>

These days it is trendy to know a little bit about Jane Austen (English author, 1775-1817). Movies based on her books are proliferating like violets in springtime, and her oeuvre is increasingly popular. I say Hooray! Although the world she wrote about was geographically and socially limited, the issues she wrote about with such wit and humor are universal. <P>

The fairly successful transmutation of her novel Emma into Clueless, a movie about oh-so-modern high school girls in Southern California is proof enough of that. And don't forget, Emma Thompson's lovely interpretation of Sense and Sensibility was nominated for several Oscars.<P>

<img src="janepict.gif" width=310 height=400 align=left hspace=4 vspace=4>

Anyone who has long admired Jane Austen, or who has developed a taste for her based on the current crop of movies, will love the rich and rewarding Jane Austen Info Page. It is such a treat. All her books are there. Not to be missed is the annotated and illustrated hypertext of Pride and Prejudice. Her early and minor works are there, too, and they are annotated which adds to the enjoyment. <P>

You can also find poems and light verse by Miss Austen, her letters, a portrait of her by her sister, her biography, some jokes, including the "Jane Austen top ten song list" the Encyclopedia Britannica article on Jane Austen, on-line academic articles, a bibliography of Jane Austen sequels, Sir Walter Scott's review of Emma, and a great deal more.<P>

Are the Middle Ages your bag? Are you interested in Sir Gawain and the Green Knight or the entire works of Sir Geoffrey Chaucer on-line? Then you'll want to go to the <a href="http://www.georgetown.edu/labyrinth/labyrinth-home.html">Labyrinth</a>, a World Wide Web server for Medieval Studies, sponsored by Georgetown University. <P>

There's a lot of Latin on this page, so be warned.  The Labyrinth library contains medieval works in French, Italian, Latin, Middle English and Old English, as well as modern day articles and reviews, and information on  medieval cultures, arts and architecture, history, manuscripts, philosophy and theology, sciences, music, and a variety of special topics. Term paper heaven.<P>

Now, the Bible. My great grandfather was said to have claimed that all one needed to know about human nature could be found in the Bible or in Shakespeare. That is definitely over-simplifying things, but you could do worse than dip into one or both. The Bible is all over the net. You can have it in any translation, in any number of languages. Start with <a href="http://humanities.uchicago.edu/homes/BIBLES.html">ARTFL Project: Bibles</a> or <a href="http://www.gospelcom.net/bible?">The WWW Bible Gateway</a>. If you are interested in things ecclesiastical, take a look at the <a href="http://www.iclnet.org/pub/resources/christian-history.html">Guide to Early Church Documents</a>. This is a scholarly site if I've ever seen one!<P>

<header><title>Great Art</title> </header> <p><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFE8"><html><center><img src=banners.gif><BR><b><font size =5>Great Art's Not to be Missed</font><br></b>
by Kitty Williams</center>

To my deep disappointment, the show of paintings by the great 17th Century Dutch artist Jan Vermeer came to Washington and left before we had a chance to see it. <P>

<img src="vermeer.gif" width=321 height=381 align=right hspace=4 vspace=4>

Friends and relatives braved storms and government shutdowns, but somehow the right day and time never arrived for us. Over and over I ran into folks who'd driven up I-95 and waited in line for hours to see the few dozen surviving pictures by the master of light, color and mood. To a person they were thrilled by the experience. "You must go!" they'd exclaim. "It was won-der-ful!"<P>

I grew steadily gloomier, until I found that there's some comfort to be found on the Web. Of course it's not the same as seeing the paintings in person, but an hour or so with Roy Williams' <a href="http://www.ccsf.caltech.edu/~roy/vermeer/">Paintings of Vermeer</a> page is better than most substitutes. <P>

The best part of the Roy Williams Vermeer site is "Thumbnails of the Paintings" -- a page made up entirely of small images of all Vermeer's works. When you point your mouse and click on one, you are taken to a slightly larger image with the name and description of the painting, and links to related pictures. If you click on this thumbnail, you are taken to a somewhat larger image, if you click on the word "Large," you are taken to a fairly high quality image that more than fills my 13 1/2" inch screen. It is not nearly as good as seeing the picture in person, but it is not bad.<P>

The page also has "Find Your Closest Vermeer" and a chronological index of all the paintings with links to the same pages that are linked to the Thumbnails page. <P>

The Vermeer Page may be one of the best art sites on the net, but it is not the only one worth a visit. <a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/wm/">The WebMuseum</a>, Paris is excellent. Its current lead exhibit is "Japanese Art at the WebMuseum," the works of Katsushika Hokusai and Ando Hiroshige, artists of the Edo Period.<P>

A variety of smaller WebMuseum exhibits also includes one on medieval art with pictures from Les tres riches heures du Duc de Berry and another on the work of Paul Cezanne. <P>

Most of the artworks are reached through the Famous Paintings section. For the art lover or the student of the history of art, this is a rich resource. In addition to an artist index and a glossary, there is a themes index. The main headings are Gothic Painting (1280-1515), The Italian Renaissance (1420-1600), The Northern Renaissance (1500-1615), Revolution and Restoration (1740-1860), Impressionism (1860-1900), The 20th century, and Japanese Art and Architecture. Follow any link to a description of the period, and links to representative artists and their works. The sections also contain links to related topics, including art from other periods that influenced the painter or the movement.<P>

Marvelous "virtual tours" leave from the <a href="http://www.christusrex.org/www1/icons/index.html tour">Christus Rex et Redemptor Mundi</a> web site including one of the Sistine Chapel with  325 images. In addition to the Sistine chapel tour, there's a tour of Vatican City (255 images), the Raphael Stanze and Loggia (226 images), the Vatican museums (596 images) and a worldwide tour of churches.<P>

<P>

If you have a special area of interest, or if you just want to find out more about art on the Internet, go to <a href="http://206.21.84.20/default.html">World Wide Art Resources</a>. Areas of information include everything from Art Market, to Museums, to Schedules and Festivals, Odd Arts Resources, Arts Education, and Antiques. The <a href="http://wwar.world-arts-resources.com/museums.html">Museums link</a> connects to 2,000 museum pages maintained by art museums around the world, all searchable.<P>

<P>

Silliness is often a reaction to great art, and yes, there's some on the net. <P>

For example, have a look at the <a href=http://zocalo.net/~danwood/mentos/vermeer.gif">Mentos ad</a> a mild and not very good parody of Vermeer's Woman with a Water Jug (the real one is at the Metropolitan Museum). It's good for a faint chuckle.<P>

Have you ever wondered about that seemingly random punctuation in the electronic mail you receive? Next time you see a strange collection of parentheses, colons, asterisks, etc., turn you head sideways to look at it. You may be face to face with a "smiley!"<P>

Although people have been composing prose on keyboards since the typewriter was invented 125 years ago, most people don't have the time or the inclination* to polish their prose and refine the nuance of meaning in their electronic messages. Humor doesn't translate reliably across the ether. It is a good idea to use smileys safe in casual emails to be sure your joke isn't read as an insult. <P>

Smileys are also known as "emoticons" from emotion and icon, and are sometimes spelled "Smilie". Writers who are trying to communicate humor, irony, or some other emotional subtlety, use emoticons to make sure their messages aren't taken the wrong way.  It's all part of the new discipline of Internet etiquette.<P>

<img src="netiquette.banner.gif" width=336 height=90 align=left hspace=4 vspace=4>

For help with all your Internet etiquette problems and questions, you need go no further than "Netiquette" at <a href=http://www.screen.com/understand/Netiquette.html">http://www.screen.com/understand/Netiquette.html</a>.<P>

Netiquette has links to two good Smiley dictionaries, Pierre Violet's The Smiley Dictionary at <a href="http://olympe.polytechnique.fr/~violet/Smileys/">http://olympe.polytechnique.fr/~violet/Smileys/</a>, with Classic Smileys, Funny Smileys, People Smileys, and a place to add your own. It has hypertext links and it's the product of some sophisticated designing.<P>

The unofficial Smilie Dictionary at <a href="gopher://vega.lib.ncsu.edu:70/00/library/reference/dictionaries/smilies">gopher://vega.lib.ncsu.edu:70/00/library/reference/dictionaries/smilies</a>, is very like the previous one. It's straight text, though. Not so fun to look at, but fun to read and lots more examples. The author has gone into some depth about the subtle shades of meaning of each silly face. <P>

Another website dealing with Internet etiquette is <a href="http://www.organic.com/1800collect/Netiquette/">PolitenessMan's guide to Netiquette </a>. It is part of 1-800-COLLECT's PoliteNet Place. This commercial website will be useful to new Internet users (newbies) who take seriously the credo that "a gentle(wo)man is never unconsciously rude." <P>


One of PolitenessMan's tip bears repeating: "Don't SHOUT -- Don't type in all caps when you send a message. This is known as SHOUTING. Whether talking on the phone or sending an e-mail message, shouting is rude." <P>

I don't know why some folks persist in typing their messages in all capital letters. It is so off-putting to us mild-mannered email users. <P>

PolitnessMan's Gallery of Emoticons doesn't break any new ground, but it is nicely done. If you want to check it out, it's at <a href="http://www.organic.com/1800collect/Emoticons/index.html">http://www.organic.com/1800collect/Emoticons/index.html</a>. <P>


For those of you who still aren't sure about smilies, here's a sampling to whet your appetite from The Unofficial Smilie Dictionary:

<UL>
<LI><B>:-)</B>   Your basic smilie. This smilie is used to inflect a sarcastic or joking statement since we can't hear voice inflection over Unix.
<LI><B>;-)</B>    Winky smilie. User just made a flirtatious and/or sarcastic remark. More of a "don't hit me for what I just said" smilie.
<LI><B>:-( </B>   Frowning smilie. User did not like that last statement or is upset or depressed about something.
<LI><B>%-)</B>    User has been staring at a computer screen for 15 hours straight

Sometimes even the most serious  Internet explorer leans back in her chair and moans "give me a break!"<P>

<img src="tubcearib.gif" width=235 height=81 align=left hspace=4 vspace=4>


That's when it's time for the <a href="http://www.amused.com/">Centre for the Easily Amused</a>  (Motto: Life's too short to take seriously.) With hundreds of links to pages ranging from the silly to the ridiculous, there's something there for everyone. And probably at least one thing that will annoy or offend each person who stops by. There are some I won't even admit to having noticed (my children might be reading this!)<P>




Among the nearly 300 links under "Random Silliness" are
* <a href="http://www.warwick.ac.uk/~msucy/timewasters/index.html">The Timewaster Page</a><BR>

C*E*A's "hard-working experts have been exploring the Internet since long before it was trendy in their search for the Ultimate Guide to Wasting Time." Who was it who said no one ever went broke underestimating the taste of the American people?  They're a "Top 5%" Site!, selected by Point Communications Corp., one of the arbiters of  web quality (I didn't say what kind of quality).<P>

One of their offerings is <a href="http://www.amused.com/guide.html">Miss Walker's Guide to Employee Internet Etiquette</a>, well worth a visit if you illicitly surf the net on your boss's time. It has topics like Bringing The Internet To Your Workplace, Introductory Goofing Off: ( "If you are using Netscape, it is a good idea to keep "auto load images" turned off under the Preferences menu. Not only will this allow Netscape to load faster, enabling you to view them when you wish, but it will look more like a document and less blatant."), Advanced Cruising:; Intermediate Addictiveness: ("For hard-core work avoiders, we recommend changing Netscape's background to white.")<P>

If you still have time to waste after visiting the Center for the Easily Amused , you might be interested in <a href="(http://pharmdec.wustl.edu/cgi-bin/jardin_scripts/SCG)">The Surrealist Compliment Generator</a>. A recent visit provoked the following: "Seven donkeys and a concubine cannot compare with the tarnished sheen left in your path of combustion."<P>

If it is an excuse you want, try the <a href="http://www.dtd.com/excuse/">Evil Little Brother excuse generator</a>. The Charles Addams-esque creature uses a fill in the blanks approach to generate excuses for many occasions:  Sorry I Burnt Down Your House,  Forgive Me For Totaling Your Car,  Didn't Mean to Kill your Pet,  Lost Homework,  Had to Reformat your Hard Drive, and more. If you laugh out loud at Mad Libs, you'll smile at this. <P>

I tried Lost Homework. After less than a minute, here's what I got: <P>
Dear Mrs. Smith, <P>

I am sorry to report that I will not be handing in my homework. As usual, my pet giraffe named Percy Bysshe Shelley grabbed my homework from my desk and proceeded to devour it.<P>

I fought back and used a wrench to wedge his toothy mouth open. I then reached my leg in and tried to force it from his belly, but it did not work.<P>

I then grabbed a strainer and tried to open up the animal's stomach to find it. But then, a group from Greenpeace broke down my door and demanded that I stop.<P>

So, I spared the beast, since I am, of course, politically correct, but at the expense of my now digested homework. Your Scholar, Kitty<P>

<P>


Perhaps you don't need an excuse or a compliment, but would rather <a href="http://www.emap.mtu.edu/mdh/Insult.html">Send a Shakespearean Insult!</a>. You select phrases from three columns, enter the recipient's email address, and send it. Sample insults are: "Thou cockered, beef-witted puttock!" and "Thou bawdy, onion-eyed clodpole." Take that, varlet!<P>

If your creativity is not enhanced by any of these , you can always go to <a href="http://www.cs.virginia.edu/~robins/quotes.html">Professor Gabriel Robins' Good Quotes by Famous People</a>, where you'll find:.
"He can compress the most words into the smallest idea of any man I know. " (Abraham Lincoln (1809-1865). Honest Abe and his colleagues seem better than brilliant in comparison to the goofiness out on the Web.<P>

<font size =6>Cyber-Appetites are Sated & Satisfied</font><br>
by Kitty Williams</center>




When I was young I saw Breughel's painting 'Land of Cockaigne' and it made a lasting impression. <P>

It shows sated people lounging about in a mythical place where pies fall from the roof, a cooked pig runs by, a roast chicken lies on a plate waiting to be eaten, wine pours into the open mouth of a young man, a little egg with legs hurries up to be eaten -- bountiful food and drink are everywhere.  <P>

The image recurred when I began looking into the Internet. I felt exactly like one of those chaps in the picture.  Behind every link, around every corner, there is a connection to something fascinating, whimsical, entertaining, informative, and often bizarre.<P>

Because I like cooking, eating, and reading about food, I love Internet food websites. I have a kitchen cabinet overflowing with cookbooks, subscribe to several food magazines and look forward to Wednesday's food sections in the newspaper, but I can always look to the net for a culinary kickstart.<P>

<img src="eggmain.gif" width=240 height=81 align=left hspace=4 vspace=4>

There's the <a href="http://www.2way.com/food/egg/index.html">Electronic Gourmet Guide </a>, a monthly Internet "e-zine". It  has two different versions, eGG on the Web and a more complete version on AOL, (keyword eGG) where you can access everything from Bed and Breakfast reviews to the American Potato Board's interactive meal planner to a discussion group among and for women in the restaurant profession. And an ever-changing contest I haven been able to win yet<P>

<img src="eppicurious.gif" width=250 height=115 align=right hspace=4 vspace=4>

And there's <a href="http://www.epicurious.com">Epicurious: For People Who Eat</a> where you can search the archives of both Gourmet Magazine and Bon Appetit,  go on the road with Jane and Michael Stern who send "Postcards from the edge of culinary respectability," or check out a city by city restaurant guide.<P>

And then there's <a href="http://www.honors.indiana.edu/~veggie/recipes.cgi">Veggies Unite! </a>  Although I'm not a vegetarian, I happily go for days without meat. This is a fun site for vegetarians and omnivores alike.  <P>

It has a well organized list of recipes, and at the end of each is a place to read comments by others who have used the recipe.<P>

Veggies Unite!'s weekly menu planner is something like the Potato Board's. At the bottom of each recipe is a link that lets you to add it to a weekly menu. The first time you use the weekly planner, you make up a name and password. Then each time you go back to it, using your name and password, you can plunk the recipe into a particular day and meal slot. <P>

When you are ready to go shopping, you click the bar at the bottom of the menu to create a grocery list. The list is clumsy, but I don't know what else they could have done. First you get a list of all the ingredients in all the recipes on your week's menu. You mark the ingredients you need and click a button. A bulleted list is returned. The annoying part is that if you have several recipes that use the same ingredient, say you mark six potatoes here and four there, you don't get back a list with 10 potatoes. It's simple enough to copy and paste the list into your word processing software and clean it up, but...<P>

The page also contains a glossary. A lot of vegetarian terms are not widely known, so I found it helpful. Another reason for the glossary is that this site is used by cooks from around the world. Many of them use different word for the same thing, like capsicum for bell pepper. Many of the comments about each recipe include cross complaints about unfamiliar names for familiar ingredients. <P>

Don't be so serious that you skip some of the great commercial websites. Not to be missed is <a href="http://www.eat.com/">Mama's Cucina</a>, Ragu's site. It has recipes, coupons, Italian lessons using a variety of sound applications, contests, tours of Italian art and architecture, and more, all spiced up with Mama's sassy sense of humor.<P>

If that's not enough, you can always perform a search with Yahoo or Webcrawler. <P>

<b><font size =5>Internet Sympathy Flows to Dunblane</font><br></b>
by Kitty Williams</center>

<img src="dunblane.gif" width=91 height=89 align=left hspace=4 vspace=4>
It was news that shocked the world: sixteen preschool children and their teacher shot dead in a school gymnasium by a middle-aged man with a grievance against society. Twelve others shot, some critically wounded. Only one child in the class escaped unhurt.
<p>The frightful tragedy in Dunblane, Scotland, on Wednesday, March 13, reminds us that no matter how peaceful the place, no matter how innocent the victims, no matter how carefully crafted and enforced the laws, a single unbalanced person can operate alone, outside commonly held values and standards, and commit outrage beyond imagining. <P>
<img src="dunblanemap.gif" width=184 height=244 align=right hspace=4 vspace=4>

One day, perhaps, people will understand why Thomas Hamilton took vengeance on society by shooting and killing little children. But, even if that understanding comes, it won't heal the sorrow and loss the parents, the town, and the whole world felt upon hearing the news.
<p>The Internet is one place people turn for news and an outlet for their outrage and sympathy. 
<p>In the aftermath of the shooting, the weekly  Highlander Web Magazine is publishing a special edition: <a href="http://www.catalyst-highlands.co.uk/flash.htm">NEWS FLASH - Dunblane Massacre Update</a>, with complete news coverage and regular updates, details on how to make a donation to the Dunblane Primary School Appeal Fund and a link for people who want to send condolence messages to the families of the murdered and injured children.
<p><a href="http://www.record-mail.co.uk/rm/drsm/appeal.html">The Daily Record and Sunday Mail in Glasgow, Scotland</a>, has also established a web page at  with details of that newspaper's appeal on behalf of community of Dunblane in honor of the children. Messages of condolence are found <a href=" http://www.record-mail.co.uk/rm/drsm/messages.html"> here</a>.
<p>America Online's "Today's News" section has a special feature on the Dunblane Massacre with links to the AOL United Kingdom newsroom.
<p>The condolence messages to Dunblane on the Highlander Web Page, the Daily Record Page, and the America Online UK Newsroom message board are heartfelt and honest. There is no unseemly fascination here, but rather message after message to the parents and other survivors from other parents around the world. They are so exquisitely touching, it is hard to read them without tears. 
<p>The messages come from around the world but so many come from America:
<p>HERNDON, VA: Words fail at such a time as this; please accept the tears and shared grief of so many around the world who mourn with you, barely able to comprehend the pain you are feeling, but able certainly to offer our prayers on your behalf and in memory of the little ones. We remembered you all in prayer at St. Dunstan's in McLean, Virginia in the US yesterday, and will continue to pray for you. May God bless you and help you at this sad, sad time.
<p>RALEIGH, NC: We are Scots in a foreign land but never felt closer to home than in this dark hour. We cry with you and feel your pain--we hope the dawn will eventually break through. Have courage and retain hope. Feel our love.
<p>MINNEAPOLIS, MN: The classroom photograph was in the paper yesterday, and I showed it to my 20 month old son. The smiles on those young faces made Trevor smile in return. There have been so many tears shed (mine included) over this heart breaking tragedy, that at first I didn't know if it was right that he should be smiling at the young victims. I realized quickly that their lives were more about love and laughter than hate or sadness. We should not let the violence overshadow their goodness. Millions of parents all around the world are remembering this week how precious their children really are.
<p>TALLAHASSEE, FL: What happened was a terrible thing. We are thinking about you and praying for you. Ms. Ehrlich's 4th Grade Class Springwood Elementary School 


<p>BOSTON, MA: I keep looking at the class picture of your children and can not believe the little angels are gone. I can't escape the thought that this could have been MY little boy's class ...I pray your hearts will heal with the help of God and the memory of your wee little ones. Know that there are families out here covering the globe who weep with you and pray for your broken hearts. I will hold my little boy closer for this.. ...
<p>BURNABY, BC CANADA: An old man (98 years of age) of my acquaintance asked me to write you on his behalf. He does not speak much English, only Gaelic, even though he has been gone from the Isle of Lewis since 1914, so I was explaining to him about your dreadful tragedy. He was silent for a while and then said, "Tell them these words exactly as I say them." "Agus ge b'e 'bheir aobhar oilbheim do aon neach de 'n fheadhain bheaga seo, a tha 'creidsinn annam-sa, b'fhearr dha gu'm bitheadh clach-mhuilinn air a crochadh m'a mhuineal, agus gu'm bitheadh e air a thilgeadh 's an fhairge. This is from Mark X, Verse 42. In English it is: "And whosoever shall offend one of these little ones that believe in me, it is better for him that a millstone were hanged about his neck, and he were cast into the sea." Myself, I think this may not be of great comfort, but he is an old man and he was determined that you should know his thinking, so I pass his words on to you in the knowledge that he was deeply moved by your tragedy.<P>
 
You may send your own message by <a href="mailto:admin@catalyst.highlands.co.uk"> email</a> and it will be added to those that are forwarded to the families.<P>

<b><font size =5>Does Your Computer Speak to Your?</font><br></b>
by Kitty Williams</center>
<p>My friend Debbie called me several weeks ago. "I have a URL for you," she said, with a grin I could practically hear over the phone line. 
<p>Debbie is a busy "at-home Mom" as the current jargon goes, who takes time off from her two energetic youngsters to keep up with the latest information on the Internet. (A "URL" is the acronym for "Uniform Resource Locator" and that's techno-jargon for a Web site.) That day, she'd just stumbled upon the <a href="http://pfm.het.brown.edu/people/mende/steps/">Capitol Steps Home page</a> , and she thought I'd be entertained by it. She was right.

<img src="logo.gif" width=400 height=100 align=right hspace=4 vspace=4>

<p>If you haven't heard of the Capitol Steps, you may have a treat in store. This singing group specializes in songs that poke fun at all sorts of public figures and institutions, from the Pope to Newt Gingrich and Bill Clinton, from Prince Charles to the Internal Revenue Service. 
<p>Their satire is aimed equally at all deserving targets, regardless of position on the left-right spectrum. On the Capitol Steps home page, you can listen to their songs (if your computer has a speaker) and you can order their records.
<p>If your computer does have a speaker, you will still need some special software. It's free for the asking. You can get there from a link on the Capitol Steps home page or you can go straight to <a href="http://www.realaudio.com">RealAudio</a>.

<center><img src="multiburst.gif" width=473 height=87  hspace=4 vspace=4></center>

<p>This software allows your computer to play sounds as they are being downloaded from the Web. Those who have waited minutes (which seem like hours in Web time) to download a file before they can play it -- only to discover that what they have found is both short and boring -- will see the benefits of this bit of software.
<p>In its current form, RealAudio tends to freeze up or sound as awful as the transistor radio my father and I built from a kit when I was eight or nine. When it works, though, it is fun -- and it works often enough to keep me coming back.
<p>The RealAudio page takes you step by step through the process of putting their software on your own computer. You register yourself, choose a "user name" and a password to listen to the files. If you forget where you've written it down, they'll be happy to give you another -- no big deal.
<p>When Real Audio is up and working, you'll be able to hear, among other things, today's ABC News report, Peter Jennings' Journal, yesterday's National Public Radio's All Things Considered, or an interview with the female star of the new James Bond movie.  Now, you say you can turn on the radio and hear the news, and Famke Jenssen is kind of boring, even though she is pretty. I hear you, but this stuff is cool enough to tempt you to overlook some of the inanities, for now.
<p>There's also a little sample of weird new music, some other public radio offerings, and some radio shows from decades ago. 
<p><a href="http://www.audiobooks.com/">Audiobooks</a> has shown some commercial acumen by including "samples" in RealAudio Format.
<p>A nice touch: if you set a Real Audio file playing, it will keep on going until it ends (some are an hour or more long) or until you disconnect from the Internet.
<p>That gives you something to listen to while you're looking for other information or waiting for another file to appear on your screen. Around Christmastime, I did some research while listening to Patrick Stewart, the star of the television series Star Trek: The Next Generation, reading aloud from Charles Dickens' A Christmas Carol. It's a great frustration diffuser.
<p>Once RealAudio is good and fast and works every time, it will have all kinds of possibilities for commercial and personal communications on the Net. In the meantime, it's another cute WWW toy.<P>

<img src="fulllogo.gif" width=184 height=166 align=left hspace=4 vspace=4>
<p>Hannah, who is five and a half, her parents, and her little brother Nicholas, who just turned one, are visiting from Canada
<p>We have plenty of toys and books left over from when our children were little. But, as a nod to the new technology, I went out and bought a CD ROM game based on the movie "Babe" and looked for children's resources on the Internet.
<p>I'm a little shy about it, though, having just read Plain magazine on "Children without Computers." 
<p>In case you haven't heard of it, Plain is published by the Center for Plain Living.  Its editors, who currently typeset it on computers, hope one day that it will be completely hand typeset and hand-printed on antique presses. (They're trying to buy antique press equipment -- if you can help out, write them at the Luddite Press Project, PO Box 100, Chesterhill, Ohio 43728. They don't have a phone.)
<p>Alongside Plain's copyright notice is the warning that "no portion of this magazine may be displayed or sent via any interactive data network."  I'll just paraphrase their articles, so I don't make them mad.
<p>Plain's writers and editors worry about children growing up unable to appreciate the outdoors or handmade school projects or the slow subtlety of  drawing with crayons instead of computer graphics programs. They worry that children with unlimited access to information won't value and respect the wisdom or knowledge of their elders. They don't like Sesame Street any more than they like the Internet. They imagine a world where children learn colors and fractions and letters by helping out with household tasks or being read to by their grandfathers.
<p>It is a good vision, but I contend that allowing children to use computers and the Internet, or even watch little television, doesn't have to put it at risk. Home-schooled children should benefit more than most from Internet access to academic resources. Parents can exercise the level of control they feel is appropriate while allowing their children access to advanced instruction in science, mathematics, languages, or other academic disciplines.
<p>The scary stories in the news can make the new technology appear a dangerous robber of childhood and community values. But I'm not convinced. The writer James Thurber's mother worried that electricity leaked out into the room from wall outlets; when telephones were first introduced, people locked them up in a separate room of their houses because they were afraid of them; railroad trains and automobiles were thought to be useless, dangerous, novelties. 
<p>Anyway,  Hannah's been having fun -- on and off the computer. She had a long walk with her uncle this morning and she came back with a turtle shell. She says she likes the Babe CD. She's drawn us some pictures and read some books to her brother. They've gone to Maymont Park to visit the bears. She's lobbying for a video.
<p>If we have time, I'll take her for a spin on the Internet. Here are some of the places we'll go:



<p><a href="http://www.cochran.com/TT.html">Theodore Tugboat's homepage</a> has pictures to color, resources for educators, stories, and a super list of links to other children's resources on the Web. 

<img src="nicolai.gif" width=256 height=130 align=right hspace=4 vspace=4>

<p><a href="http://www.h-plus-a.com/nikolai/">Nikolai's Web Site</a> concerns the adventures of  Nikolai, and his cat, Neow Neow. It has finger puppets and a village to print out, color, cut and paste together, recipes, and stories where you can decide what happens next. Produced by I Hoffman + Associates Inc., it is related to the Nikolai Adventure Series on CD ROM.
<p><a href="http://www.clark.net/pub/journalism/kid.html">Kids Internet Delights</a> has 100 Internet connections "kids and their parents might enjoy" kept by  <a href="mailto:john@trainer.com">John Makulowich</a> . 
<p><a href="http://wchat.on.ca/merlene/kid.htm">Maddy Mayhem's Kids Stuff</a> was chosen a "Cool Canadian Site of the Day." Maddy, 6, is looking for email penpals, and putting together a map showing where they live. She lives in Hamilton, Ontario, just west of Toronto where Hannah lives. Maybe they'll meet one day.<P>

You're in trouble ...

<P><P>	You're a small business owner. You've been doing everything you thought you ought to about returning the water you use in the widget-making process to Mother Earth in a pristine form. But the EPA folks seem to have a problem with your reports ...

<P><P>	You have a terrific idea for a new rock song. You record it and send the tape to a big record studio. They say thanks, but no thanks. A few years later, a smash hit on the radio sounds more than familiar ...

<P><P>	You run a farm that has been in the family for 150 years. Suddenly, a sexual harassment claim against your farm manager threatens to bankrupt the farm -- and your family. The manager may end up in jail ...

<P><P>	You probably need a lawyer. How do you find one? 

<P><P>	You can ask a friend or colleague who has had a similar problem (and resolved it satisfactorily) for the name of her lawyer. 

<P><P>	You can look through the yellow pages, call the individuals or firms that sound promising, and ask for more information . 

<P><P>	You can ask your friend from church who happens to be a lawyer if she knows anybody. You can get a list from a bar association.

<P><P>	Or you can search the web. <P>

<img src="venable.gif" align=left border=2 width=312 height=95"><P><P>	

A lot of law firms now have computer and information specialists on staff who hope you will search the web. 

<P><P>	Just as in radio, television, and print advertising by lawyers, you'll see a wide range of ideas about what is decent and proper. Most are fairly handsome and fairly staid. 	The home page of Baltimore-based <a href="http://venable.com/vbh.htm">Venable, Baetjer, Howard & Civiletti (http://venable.com/vbh.htm)</a>, is a good example. They were one of the first law firms to have an Internet presence and proudly announce they have won a "Silicon Webbernaut Award" for the best legal website.

<P><P>	The 600+ lawyer firm of <a href="http://www.sidley.com/">Sidley & Austin (http://www.sidley.com/)</a>, with offices practically everywhere you can think of also has a very creditable presence on the web, as do the small to medium-sized firms <a href="http://www.dsmllp.com/">Dickstein, Shapiro (http://www.dsmllp.com/)</a>; <a href="http://www.hollandhart.com/law/">Holland & Hart (http://www.hollandhart.com/law/)</a>; <a href="http://www.arentfox.com/">Arent, Fox, Kintner, Plotkin & Kahn (http://www.arentfox.com/)</a>; <a href="http://www.us.net/~steptoe/welcome.htm">Steptoe & Johnson (http://www.us.net/~steptoe/welcome.htm)</a>; and <a href="http://www.haledorr.com/">Hale & Dorr (http://www.haledorr.com/)</a>. 

<P><P>It should be noted that Hale & Dorr has won a "Platinum Webbernaut Award" and their site is rated as "still the best on the Internet."

<P><P>	Clifford Chance <a href="http://www.cliffordchance.com/">(http://www.cliffordchance.com/)</a> a 1,400-lawyer international law firm with a total staff of approximately 2,800 in 23 business and financial centers around the world has an informative, though not snazzy, web site.  

<P><P>	Others among the biggest of the big have apparently decided they aren't ready for a web site, though.

<P><P>	If the mega firms aren't on the net today, you can be sure they will be soon.

<P><P>	Smaller firms have a little more leeway and can afford a touch of humor. The San Antonio firm of  <a href="http://www.tddc.net/lamrouex/">Lamrouex & Cravens (http://www.tddc.net/lamrouex/)</a> claims to be the first law firm on the web in San Antonio. Its home page sports an illustration of a old fashioned lawyer in a sheepskin wig in front of a computer. The caption is "Cyberlaw, where tradition meets technology." 

<P><P>	Long lists of law firms on the net can be found through lists at <a href="http://www.infi.net/~aland/userlist.html">(http://www.infi.net/~aland/userlist.html)</a> and  the Washburn University School of Law at <a href="http://lawlib.wuacc.edu/washlaw/lawfirms.html">(http://lawlib.wuacc.edu/washlaw/lawfirms.html)</a>. In fact, the WashLaw WEB at <a href="http://law.wuacc.edu/washlaw/washlaw.html">(http://law.wuacc.edu/washlaw/washlaw.html)</a> is the most comprehensive source of legal information that I have seen on the Internet.

<P><P>	A well designed law firm web site is rather like a souped-up firm brochure. Ideally it will tell you whether the firm has experience in the area that concerns you, and if so, how you can get in touch with them to find out more. 

<P><P>	Naturally, you ought not to think we prefer these firms just because we've mentioned them here. (If we had a favorite lawyer we'd mention it, and he'd probably insist we say something just like this.)

by Kitty Williams and Robin Lind</center>


The letter came from overseas. The envelope was the blue tissue-paper kind,  emblazoned with the checkered border that was the old international convention to indicate Air Mail. Two large colorful stamps carried commemorative portraits: one of a 15th century explorer, the other a 19th century literary hero. 

<P><P>It was a treat. We hadn't received a communication like it in years.

<P><P>The letter it enclosed was even more of a treat:

<P><P>"The surprise of reading a Portuguese newspaper of the day on your computer still hasn't worn off! ..."

<img src="jn.gif" align=right border=2 width=189 height=295>

<P><P>One of our earliest adventures on the World Wide Web was still being savored months later by a fellow "internaut" halfway 'round the globe. 

<P><P>The retired Portuguese diplomat came to dinner with us in the early fall while on an American tour to visit former colleagues and friends. Intrigued by our descriptions of the rapidly-developing World Wide Web he asked for a demonstration and we were only to glad to oblige.

<P><P>Was there anything in Portugal he would like to know about?

<P><P>He hadn't seen any coverage in the American newspapers of the Portuguese election, he said. Could we tell him what had happened? 

<P><P>We launched our web browser and entered the query "Portugal and newspaper" in the search engine.



<P><P>Bingo! An immediate hit. At (http://www.jnoticias.pt/) we found the <a href="http://www.jnoticias.pt/">"Jornal Noticias"</a> in Oporto, home of the world-famous port wine industry. 

<P><P>First there was a tiny "thumbnail" picture of the actual front page -- Primeira pgina -- and then an index of interest sections; within those sections was the actual text of stories. Clicking on the thumbnail would expand the page to the full width of the screen.

<P><P>On this particular day the headlines were big enough to read even in miniature format. We thought we must have found the election results themselves, but no. Our visitor, translating for us, gave us the results of the league soccer matches of the day before.

<P><P>The election had been over for some weeks and the local readers were obviously much more interested in the important news of the day. Inside were the stories about government actions, pending legislation, recent speeches and new ministerial appointments. 

<P><P>In Oporto, Portugal, seven hours ahead of us by the solar clock, newspaper editors and pressman were already busy printing the next day's edition of JN. Somewhere in their office, an electronic version was being readied for "uploading" onto their Web site.  

<P><P>Half a world away, in the rural isolation of Virginia's James River Valley, we sat in mutual amazement and pleasure as our visitor viewed screen after screen of news from home and read aloud for us, translating the news from Portuguese into English. It was as much a treat for us as for him.

<P><P>Although he had never been exposed to the Internet before and never seen a Portuguese newspaper on the World Wide Web, this 80-year-old former diplomat was taking to the new medium like a duck to water. 

<P><P>The gauge of his understanding and  fundamental grasp of the real benefits came in his letter. "I hope you will make good use of that marvelous technology. I suppose it really enables you to work -- or at least to do a great deal of one's work -- while living in a pleasant place."

<P><P>On the sun-drenched banks of the Douro River -- unarguably a pleasant place to live --  the important news of the day is published on newsprint and delivered to homes and news kiosks throughout the region. The electronic version is also published day after day, and published for the world. Improvements to design and content continue to appear. 

<P><P>JN's home page later included a click option for an introduction in English which proudly proclaimed "We intend to satisfy your curiosity on a daily basis, with the expectant and communicative joy of a "surprise" present. Welcome to the JN HOUSE, where the door of information is always open to problems generated by healthy democratic societies."

<header><title>Going Gaelic</title> </header> <p><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFE8"><html><center><img src=banners.gif><BR><b><font size =5>Going Gaelic on the Web</font><br></b>
by Robin Lind</center>





<P><P>A member of the choir approached me outside the nave, just before the service was to begin.<P>

<img src="knot1.gif" align=left border=2 width=288 height=218>

<P>"I'm sorry to bother you," she began, "but the organist said you once read the lesson in Gaelic and I wondered if you could tell me where I might learn it?"

<P><P>(Actually, I had once read the lesson from William Lorimer's translation of the New Testament into "Scots" but that's how stories get started.)

<P><P>She explained that she wanted to learn Gaelic in order to better understand the Gaelic songs and music she was studying. I knew nothing of Gaelic, I told her, except how to spell it and search for it on the Internet.

<P><P>With the approach of St. Patrick's Day however, and the green in her eyes,  and the joy of the hunt... I had sufficient inspiration.

<P><P>As soon as I got home from church I fired up the computer  and called up the "Yahoo" search engine. I typed in the word "Gaelic" and, almost immediately, got 19 matches with a selection of entries ranging from the "Story of Mac Dathos Pig"  to the "Abbey Pub and Restaurant" in Chicago.

<P><P>I also found <a href="http:futon.sfsu.edu/%7Ejtm/Gaelic/">"Gaelic Languages Info -- Collection of items of interest to speakers and learners" (http:futon.sfsu.edu/%7Ejtm/Gaelic/)</a> maintained by John T. McCranie.

<P><P>The menu was vast: classes in Gaelic, Irish language and culture resources, computer programs dealing with Irish grammar, organizations of interest to learners and speakers of Irish, bookstores that carry Irish language books, Irish language newspapers ... 

<P><P>It also offered the newsletter of the North American Association for Celtic Language Teachers, edited by Thomas Ihde of Bergen Community College in Paramus, New Jersey. 

<P><P>A minute or so later my printer produced a broad selection of Gaelic language articles to forward to my new friend from church. 

<P><P>Looking a little further, I found a web site entitled <a href="http://celtic.stanford.edu/Narada/Voices.html">"Reviews and Sound Samples" (http://celtic.stanford.edu/Narada/Voices.html)</a> which offered brief descriptions of currently available Celtic music disks and recordings. 

<P><P>Little speaker icons enabled me to download small audio files and actually hear music on my computer!  In moments I was listening to Connie Dover of Scartaglen in Kansas City singing the traditional Irish romance song "Chuaigh Me 'Na Rosann."

<P><P>Just out of curiosity I selected the "Lycos" search engine developed by Carnegie-Mellon University and asked it for "Gaelic." It returned 2126 documents: a hundredfold increase!

<P><P>As I studied the screen listings, a pale yellow graphic image began to materialize at the top of the page. Suddenly I was looking at the frothy top of a glass, the shoulder and neck of a brown bottle and an advertisement from Popular Mechanics magazine saying "Click here if you love beer."

<P><P>What a grand marketing strategy -- anyone interested in Gaelic is bound to love beer, eh? And what a dilemma: click there and go off the path? Press on and miss the opportunity to find out about beer? 

<P><P>Fortunately, a web solution for serendipitous exposures to other interesting sites was developed even before commercial advertising came aboard. You click on the site: wait until you are spun over to it, add it to your "Bookmarks" or "Hotlist" or "Favorite Places" directory and then tell your web browser to go back to the previous page. 

<P><P>The location of the new site is now stored in your computer's memory and you can resume your search responsibly, knowing that the intriguing information about beer can be retrieved later when you're no longer on task.

<P><P>The vast catalog of Gaelic information is maintained at University College, Dublin in Ireland and "mirrored" at California State University in Fresno, California. If you are a ÔGaelic-aholic', you can visit their archives and find out what messages they were typing to each other, month by month, right back to May, 1989.

<P><P>But, where was I?  Ah, yes: "if you love beer ... " Back to that tempting site.<P> "Slainte mhath!" as they say on St. Patrick's Day: "Good Health!"<P>

<font size=2><center><I>The traditional Celtic knot at the top of the page was created by Drew Ivan <center>who maintains a <a href="http://www.en.com/users/ivan/knotwork.html">web page</a> dedicated to teaching simple ways to draw these intricate patterns. </center>

<center><b><font size =5>Travel Safely on the Lonely Planet</font><br></b>By Kitty Williams<BR></center>Whether you are an armchair adventurer or a frequent traveler, you'll have fun with the Lonely Planet's website at <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com.au/lp.htm">(http://www.lonelyplanet.com.au/lp.htm).</a> 

<img src="lonelyplanet.gif" VSPACE=6 HSPACE=6 align=right width=312 height=163>

<p>As I wandered through it, I was transported back to the time I could carry everything I needed in a shoulder bag: passport, money, comb, shampoo, toothbrush, toothpaste, underwear, a clean shirt, a squashable knit dress (for touring churches and being taken out to lunch by my parents' friends), and my father's American Express card hidden away in case I got into a jam. 

<p>A pair of jeans, a shirt, and a good pair of walking sandals, which I wore, completed my travel kit. Thus equipped, I traveled all over Greece, England, and France. Of course, that was years ago. But the Lonely Planet made me deeply nostalgic for those days and half-tempted to believe I could do it again. 

<p>Lonely Planet co-founder Tony Wheeler's, statement, `Don't worry about whether your trip will work out. Just go!', sets the tone for the extensive, amusing, informative site. Tony and his wife Maureen (http://www.lonelyplanet.com.au/prop/graphics/t&m.htm) produced their first guidebook 'Across Asia on the Cheap' in 1973. There are 140 titles now in print, and you can order them through the Website. 

<p>Unlike other travel book websites -- such as the Globe Corner Bookstore <a href="http://www.gcb.com/catalog/">(http://www.gcb.com/catalog/)</a> which has a wonderful collection of travel resources for sale -- the Lonely Planet has many other reasons to visit, even if you aren't planning a trip anytime soon. Well-written articles include historical and cultural information about countries as widely different as Great Britain and El Salvador. Seven "Detours" are also featured <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/detours/detours.htm">(http://www.lonelyplanet.com/detours/detours.htm)</a> illustrated with color photographs. 

<p>The Detours "for travelers who don't expect too many creature comforts along the way, and who are enchanted by the idea of getting to some of the lost and forgotten places on the planet" include: Ulaan Baatar "capital of Mongolia, the city at the end of the earth;" the Spice Island of Ambon in the Moluccas; New Ireland, "a skinny sickle-shaped island off Papua New Guinea crunched between the Pacific and Indian Ocean;" Easter Island " mere speck in the Pacific Ocean...often lost in the gutter of the atlas or hidden beneath the copyright notice on the map;" Kashgar "in the western corner of China's westernmost province, on the edge of the Desert of No Return;" The Faroes, "when the earth was created, God cleaned his fingernails and what he discarded scattered into the North Atlantic to become the Faroe Islands;" and Timbuktu "so wrapped up in legend that you could be forgiven for thinking the place was a figment of the imagination."

<p>If you want a more conventional destination, Lonely Planet has a clickable map and a search form <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/dest/dest.htm">(http://www.lonelyplanet.com/dest/dest.htm).</a> Using either, you might arrive somewhere like Destination France <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com.au/dest/eur/fra.htm">(http://www.lonelyplanet.com.au/dest/eur/fra.htm)</a> or Destination Russia <a href="http://www.lonelyplanet.com/dest/eur/rus.htm">(http://www.lonelyplanet.com/dest/eur/rus.htm).</a>

<p>Each "Destination" page includes Facts at a Glance, Environment,  History, Economy, Culture, Events, Facts for the Traveler, Attractions, Off the Beaten Track, Activities, Getting There & Away, Getting Around, Recommended Reading, Lonely Planet Guides, Travelers' Reports, and On-line Info. Whenever you see a picture of the planet Saturn next to the blue words, "Off the record" click on it for an irreverent historical anecdote. 

<p>Lonely Planet's recommended reading list for a trip to Russia is impressive and characteristic: 'A History of Russia" by Nicholas Riasanovsky, 'The Master and Margarita', by Mikhail Bulgakov, 'One Day in the Life of Ivan Denisovich' by Alexander Solzhenitsyn, 'Ten Days that Shook the World' by John Reed. 'Trekking in Russia & Central Asia' by Frith Maier.

<p> If that all sounds too much like school, they also recommend Martin Cruz Smith's 'Gorky Park', John Le Carre's 'Russia House', and every other spy novel published between 1963 and 1979.

<p>I spent two happy hours exploring the Lonely Planet, and there's plenty I haven't seen yet. If I ever get airborne again, it will be with one of their guidebooks tucked into my knapsack!

<center><img src=banners.gif></center><P><center><b><font size =5>So You Support The Flat Tax?</font><br>

</b>by Robin Lind<BR></center>

Much of America's political reporting in the past months has been devoted to presidential candidates' declarations and posturing, none of it more compelling (as we approach April 15th) than their stand on the "Flat Tax" originally proposed by Representative Dick Armey of Texas and Senator Richard Shelby of Alabama.

<p>Anyone who has ever filled out his or her own tax return or tried valiantly to assemble the paperwork required by a professional tax preparer knows what a nightmare this annual exercise can be. 

<p>The idea of a "flat tax" is understandably seductive.

<p>The Armey proposal would eliminate the current sliding scale of tax rates. Deductions would be done away with. Loopholes for special interest groups would be history. Everyone would pay the same rate of tax: 17% of earned income above the standard deduction. 

<p>Under Rep. Armey's plan, deductions would be $11,300 for singles, $14,850 for head of household, and $22,700 for married, filing jointly; there would be an additional $5,300 deduction for each dependent.

<p>Rep. Armey maintains his own web pages <a href="http://www.house.gov/armey.flattax/">(http://www.house.gov/armey.flattax/)</a> to explain and support the flat tax.

<p>Since his original proposal was introduced, other Republican presidential candidates have introduced their own variations. Texas Sen. Phil Gramm (who recently withdrew from the presidential race) proposed a 16% flat rate plan maintaining deductions for mortgage interest and charitable contributions. Millionaire publisher Steve Forbes went along with the 17% rate but offered lower deductions.

<p>Critics of the flat tax proposals say that the rich would actually be the main beneficiaries because they are the ones who currently pay the highest rates, and all proposals would eliminate personal income taxes on interest, dividends and capital gains.

<p>The middle class, those who are the primary beneficiaries of the home mortgage deduction (Uncle Sam's biggest tax loophole) would actually see their taxes increase, say the critics. 

<p>Who do you believe?

<p>If the idea of the flat tax appeals to you, you might want to check your own particular tax situation. Using the Web it's a breeze.

<img src="flattax.gif" VSPACE=6 HSPACE=6 align=right width=443 height=210>

<p>One of America's brilliant young techno-wizards, Hugh Chou, a systems manager at the Institute for Biomedical Computing at the University of Washington in St. Louis, Missouri has created a simply amazing collection of mathematical calculators at <a href="http://ibc.wustl.edu:80/mort_links.html">(http://ibc.wustl.edu:80/mort_links.html)</a> that includes a simple form <a href="http://ibc.wustl.edu/~hugh/armey.cgi">(http://ibc.wustl.edu/~hugh/armey.cgi)</a> to compare taxes due under the current and proposed systems. He has now added the Forbes and Gramm proposals to his original calculator for the Armey bill.

<p>You enter your wage income, your filing status, number of dependents, non-wage income, capital gains and distributions, and itemized deductions. Click on the "Calculate Tax" button and Hugh's formula does the rest.

<p>We tried two examples with hypothetical married couples we gave fictitious names. They file jointly, claim two dependents,  and have deductions of $10,000; we gave them varying wage incomes. The results were educational.

<p>Adam & Eve: wage income: $35,000; non-wage income: 0. Current income tax due: $2,250. Armey Flat Tax due: $289; Forbes plan: 0; Gramm plan: 0.

<p>Peter & Julia: wage income: $70,000; non-wage income: $5,000. Current tax due: $10,330. Armey Flat Tax due: $6,239; Forbes plan: $5,644; Gramm plan: $6,880.

<p>We tried other hypothetical situations. Consider the single taxpayer who has no deductions and only his wages as income.

<p>Taylor earns $5 an hour for an annual income of $10,400. Current tax due: $600. Armey Flat Tax due: $0; Forbes plan: $0; Gramm plan: $0.

<p>Marge earns $10 an hour for an annual income of $20,800. Current tax due: $2,160. Armey Flat Tax due: $1,606.50. Forbes plan: $1,309; Gramm plan: $1,568.

<p>Everyone seems to benefit. What we haven't shown is the benefits that come into play with all the complicated special exceptions in the tax code. Will the Armey Flat Tax benefit you?

<p>Try the calculator at <a href="http://ibc.wustl.edu/~hugh/armey.cgi">(http://ibc.wustl.edu/~hugh/armey.cgi).</a> It's obvious that the flat tax won't suit everyone but, before you jump on the bandwagon, you owe it to yourself to find out what it does for you personally.

<center><img src=banners.gif></center><P><center><b><font size =5>Do You Have a WebScholar at Home?</font><br>

</b>by Kitty Williams<BR></center>
<p>One recent Sunday evening, our tenth-grade daughter came to me for help. She needed illustrations for an oral report, due the next day. 

<p>"Mom," she asked, "do you have any books about Taoism?"  

<p>Well, I actually have one or two -- somewhere. I'd  taken a course on Eastern religions when I was in college, 25 years ago. I had no idea where in the attic or basement, in which unmarked, dusty cardboard box, I'd find anything she could use. 

<p>It was too late to go to the library. The Internet was our only hope. Normally the girl limits her use of my PC to typing papers and checking her electronic mail. She has little interest in the Web -- except when she's in a pickle and needs her mom to extract her.

<p>This wasn't the right time for a lesson in search engines or planning ahead, and besides, I was a little flattered that she had such confidence in me. 

<img src="daoteching.gif" VSPACE=6 HSPACE=6 align=left width=282 height=463>

<p>I logged onto the Internet, opened up the Lycos Web search engine <a href="http://www.lycos.com">(http://www.lycos.com)</a>, and asked for information on the famous book of Chinese philosophy called the Tao Te Ching. I got a long list of documents and homepages. Among the quirky personal homepages and ads for New Age products, I found the Chinese World Wide Web <a href="http://www.ncb.gov.sg/chinese-web/tao/prod/ddj-u.html">(http://www.ncb.gov.sg/chinese-web/tao/prod/ddj-u.html)</a>, which contains several chapters of  the Tao Te Ching (or Dao De Jing). Eureka. 

<p>Each chapter is presented as a page of Chinese calligraphy with the English translation below it. Words for important philosophical concepts showed up in blue, which meant that there was a link to more information. When I clicked on a blue word, a larger image of the character appeared with an explanation of each of its elements and a brief interpretation of the philosophical concept it represents. 

<p>I put a color cartridge into my little inkjet printer and printed a nice selection. Our daughter got an A. 

<p> I don't always wait for our children to ask for research help. I have so much fun foraging around for information, that I have been known to volunteer. When our 17-year-old son had to write something about Chechnya, it was another chance to see what's out there. 

<p>For those like our son who really want to understand the background and implications of the complex, emotionally-motivated conflicts taking place all over the world, the Internet and the World Wide Web can provide some answers. It is a rich source of information and opinion, as well as rabid ravings, and there is wild, up-to-the minute reporting that is seldom found in conventional print and broadcast media. The closest I can remember is television reports from the front during the wars in Vietnam and the Persian Gulf.

<p>If you have access to America On-line, you can click the Today's News icon, click "Search News," type the name of the country you're interested in, and click "List Articles. A recent request for information on Bosnia turned up 185 articles from Reuters, Business Wire, Agence France Presse, and PRN Newswire, none more than three days old. Sixty two articles turned up in a search for information about Chechnya. 

<p>Another angle on the situation in Chechnya can be found on the Chechen HomeLand page <a href="http://www.smns.montclair.edu/%7Echechen/">(http://www.smns.montclair.edu/%7Echechen/)</a>. News and background about Bosnia and Croatia can be found at BERSERKISTAN IN BOSNIA: An Interactive Newsmagazine <a href="http://www.linder.com/berserk/berserk.html"> (http://www.linder.com/berserk/berserk.html). </a>

<p>You can look at Bosnia and Croatia Related Home Pages <a href="http://www.helsinki.fi/~tervio/muut/HomePages.html">(http://www.helsinki.fi/~tervio/muut/HomePages.html)</a>, and soul-wrenching reminders of the area (before war tore it all to pieces) in two photographic websites,  The Thousand Islands of the Croatian Adriatic <a href="http://vukovar.unm.edu/islands/">(http://vukovar.unm.edu/islands/)</a> and A Roman Palace in Dalmatia <a href="http://rubens.anu.edu.au/split.xmosaic/split1.html"> (http://rubens.anu.edu.au/split.xmosaic/split1.html). </a>

<p>Finally, whatever your opinion about our presence in the former Yugoslavia, if you agree that the young men and women over there need our moral support, you can send them a message through the following web site: Send Your Greetings and Encouragement to the Troops in Bosnia <a href="http://www.dtic.mil/bosnia/message_form.html"> (http://www.dtic.mil/bosnia/message_form.html).</a>

<header><title>Cruising Wall Street</title> </header> <p><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFE8"><html><center><img src=banners.gif><BR><b><font size =5>Cruising Wall Street in Your PJs</font><br></b>
By Kitty Williams</center><p>
Even though I'm not a cigar-chomping tycoon, I like to read The Wall Street Journal. Its mixture of cutting-edge business news, financial analysis and marvelous feature articles is leavened with humor and insight. <P>

I've been fond of the Journal since I was a teenager. In high school we had to report on the day's news in our current events class. I discovered that I could save time and effort by just reading the Journal's World News Summary instead of struggling with the New York Times or Washington Post. (At the time I thought I was pulling a fast one on Miss Hollman. In retrospect, I think she probably knew.) <P>


<img src="cruising.gif" width=312 height=240 align=right>

Last month the Wall Street Journal introduced an electronic "Personal Journal" that is delivered to your own computer via the Internet. You download the software, call an 800 number to register and get a local SprintNet telephone number. You get two weeks free. After that you can continue if you pay for a subscription. The cost ranges from $12.95 in the contiguous states to $16.50 in Hawaii, $17.95 in Canada (only four major cities) and $19.95 in Alaska. <P>

I connected to the Personal Journal <a href="http://bis.dowjones.com/pjuse.html">(http://bis.dowjones.com/pjuse.html)</a> and followed directions I found there. The software takes about an hour to download on  a 14.4 kbs modem. <P>

Once I'd got the software and registered, I was prompted to customize my own "PJ." You can choose up to 25 "personal news stories" from the Journal's regular columns and articles (including news about companies you are following) and up to 25 stocks and mutual funds for your "personal portfolio". <P>

All regular columns are available, including the front page middle column (a feature article that focuses on the unexpected), Legal Beat, Abreast of the Market, Personal Technology, Work & Family, Washington Wire and all the rest. Your PJ also gives you world and business news summaries, a market report, weather, and sports. <P>

You schedule delivery of a full first edition and up to two daily updates by dragging icons of newspapers from an old fashioned papercarrier's bag to the appropriate times each weekday on the delivery schedule page. <P>

Be warned, though. The automatic download happens like an attack of the green apple hurryups. You can't stop it. It only takes a couple of minutes, but what if you set this up on your laptop? ... and you are in the middle of a presentation to clients? ... and you'd forgotten you had a Journal coming in? Uncool.<P>

A better way is to click on the telephone receiver icon in the screen's corner. That downloads the PJ then and there.<P>

After my two-week trial, I concluded that it is for people who need business and financial news as it breaks. For those of us who can get the actual paper at the newsstand, or have it delivered in the mail, it's probably simpler to stick with the old fashioned version.<P>

If I were a tycoon wannabe, though, I'd subscribe, if only because you can cut and paste excerpts from the PJ into emails to your boss. If you time it right, you can get the news to her before her own Wall Street Journal is delivered and impress the heck out of her. Don't overdo the cut and paste, though, or you'll get on the wrong side of copyright laws. The Customer Agreement is specific: "...you may, from time to time, disseminate via electronic mail insubstantial portions of information received through Personal Journal...to a limited number of employees in the same company or organization." <P>

Downsides? Well, at present it's only available for PC users; sorry Mac. Unlike the newsprint edition, you can indeed read today's news today but, unless you want to print it out on your home printer, the PJ still can't compete on the 4Bs portability test: going from Bedroom to Bathroom to Bus to Beach.<P>

"Is there a directory of the World Wide Web?" has become one of the most frequent questions of new adventurers on the Internet.<p>

No, there isn't. Not yet.  <p>

A comprehensive directory is probably on the horizon -- but there are partial directories of the more than 30 million users and more then 10 million web sites, and they're getting better every day. <p>

Disappointed? Don't be. This is part of the fun and excitement of this new medium. <p>

If you are using Netscape Navigator, look for  "Internet White Pages" on the home page. The link takes you to a page listing Internet Directories. <p>

Netscape explains that they are still "exploring a number of methodologies and technologies" to improve the tools available. This means that, like most developments on the Web, this is still in infancy.<p>

Among those white pages, you'll find one candidate for "grown-up", though. <p>


<img src="operator.gif" width=312 height=241 align=right>

"Four11 Directory Service" <a href="http://www.Four11.com/">(http://www.Four11.com/)</a> claims to be the Internet's largest, with over 5 million listings and over a million registered users. <p>

It's free but you must register before they'll give you a password allowing you to search the database after your first visit. (Your password will arrive by email within about three hours of your registration).<p>

Using the information you provide when you register (high school and college background, industry, organization, interests, etc.) the database expands to include you. It is also searchable by those criteria. <p>

You'll be allowed to search the "white pages" on your first visit one you've completed registration. You have to be somewhat specific in your searches or you may get a response saying "Too Many Matches;" a subtle hint that a "paid" subscription to this "free" service appears if your search is too broad. (Free users are limited to a maximum of 30 hits; subscribers to Four11-Plus get up to 80 hits; "other" users get up to 150 hits.)<p>

 You are warned against using the information for email business solicitations. No penalty is spelled out, but they could revoke your password and privileges. <p>

The search criteria tools in Four11 are extensive: you can search by name (first and last), city, state, country, organization, hobby, schooling, organizations, interests, research topics, even military service. If you want to locate veterans in your state who graduated from the same college or live in the same city, or share an interest is some research topic, this might give you some really good connections. <p>

Naturally those vets would have to be on the internet and have email addresses, and be registered with Four11 ... but you knew that already, didn't you?<p>

One of the potentially great tools offered is a "Sleeper Search." If you're trying to make contact with people interested in a particular topic that could generate more interest in the future, you can instruct the system to conduct a search of all new directory entries and changes as they occur, for up to a year. You'll get an email whenever a match occurs.<p>

Another very handy feature is a search for "old" email addresses. If you have a friend who has changed employers, moved or switched internet providers, you many not be able to make contact with the old email address. This search will give you the new address, if your friend has updated it on Four11. <p>

On the non-profit side, Personal Pages Worldwide, created by the University of Texas Austin TeamWeb, offers a directory of home pages organized by university, k-12, non-profits, commercial, and others.  <p>

PPW is not a proper directory, as such. It is more a collection of links to other sites, but it is fascinating to surf from college to college and compare the student home pages at Harvard, for instance, with those at Louisiana Tech or the Thomas Jefferson High School for Science and Technology.<p>

The comprehensive directory of the future will probably rise up when one of these directories asserts dominance or they all fuse into a integral whole.<p>

<header><title>Hello, What's the Weather?</title> </header> <p><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFE8"><html><center><img src=banners.gif><BR><b><font size =5>What's the Weather like Up Ahead?</font><br></b>By Kitty Williams</center><p><p>

During the First Blizzard of '96 and subsequent storms, I was grateful for access to the World Wide Web. We had enough food. Our firewood was seasoned and split. Our power didn't go out. <p>

We didn't go out either and, best of all, the various providers of Internet access kept up (more or less) with demands. America Online chugged along, although occasionally it was hard to get onto the Web. <p>

Seated at my computer, I looked out at a landscape draped in two feet of  snow, crossed by very  few sets of human and animal tracks. We remained snow-bound for days, and loved it<p>

<img src=aolweather.gif width=312 height=178 align=right> One day, the snow was coming down in steady, big clumps. From my window, I watched our nearly-grown children sledding down the empty distant road. At the same time I skimmed the AOL Weather Chat. (For AOL users, who might not have braved a "chat room" yet, the weather chat is reached from the Today's News page. First you click on the in-depth button on the Weather section header, then, on the right-hand side of the Weather Page, you click on the icon for Weather Chat.) <p>

A couple of dozen people were exchanging weather news. One man announced he was feeling chest pains after shoveling snow. A flurry of concerned chatters urged him to take it seriously and do something. He insisted it was really his wife's cooking.  <p>

Another fellow asked about the condition of Interstate 64 south toward Norfolk, Virginia. Nobody answered. <p>

Suddenly a little box appeared on my screen with an "Instant Message." <p>

(America Online allows users to send instant messages to one another if both are online. In a "chat room" you double-click with your mouse on the name of the other chatter you want to contact. Participants' screen names are listed in the upper right-hand corner. After selecting a name, you can choose "get info" or "send message." Get info summons the optional AOL Member Profile.) <p>

It was the man who was trying to get information about I-64. He had clicked "get info" and seen that I lived in Virginia. He wanted to know if I lived near Virginia Beach or Norfolk. <p>

I was rather startled, because I had just been eavesdropping and hadn't "said" anything. I replied that I lived near Richmond. Another query: Did I know what the Interstate was like? Since I hadn't been out of the house except to walk the 150 feet to my office in four days, I told him that I thought the Interstates were passable (I'd been listening to the radio), and that he should drive slowly. He thanked me and soon after I saw that he had left the chat room.<p>

If a stranger on the street had asked me a similar question, I would have answered without thinking. This simple exchange felt different. Partly, I suspect, because most human contacts usually involve a face, or a voice. A letter or an email message may have been written hours or days ago. I can answer when I am ready. <p>

In this case, however, the little black letters appearing on my screen were being typed seconds before I read them. All the conventions of an ordinary conversation applied. I could be rude, polite, friendly, cool, or anything I chose, but everything depended on the typed word. It felt unsettling. <p>

I was glad to help, though. <p>
<img src="weather.gif" width=312 height=212 align=left>
If you prefer a more authoritative source than an unknown person in a chat room, lots of weather information, from forecasts to current satellite pictures, is available on the Internet. <p>



For example, NBC News' Intellicast <a href="http://www.intellicast.com/index.html">(http://www.intellicast.com/index.html)</a> has regional forecasts and satellite pictures. Or you could look at the Weather Information Superhighway <a href="http://thunder.met.fsu.edu:80/nws/public_html/wxhwy.html">(http://thunder.met.fsu.edu:80/nws/public_html/wxhwy.html)</a>, which has a motherlode of weblinks to other weather sites around the globe -- enough to satisfy even the most insatiable weather aficionado.<p>

<center><img src=banners.gif></center><P><center><b><font size =5>How Does Your Garden Grow?</font></center>
</b><BR>
<center>By Kitty Williams</center>
It's cold out there. The gardener's brain is seething with plans, but in most parts of the country it is foolish to do much more than plan and dream.<p>


As I write, the radio reports ferocious winter weather over much of the country. What's a gardener to do?<p>


Fingernails clean (for a little while), chapped hands healing, you can fix a cup of herb tea, light a cozy fire and log onto the World Wide Web. There you may contemplate the electronic spiders' webs instead of those than gleam between the bean rows, backlit by a summer dawn.<p>


<img align=left VSpace=6 HSpace=6 src=spidweb.gif width=100 height=100><p><a href="http://www.gardenweb.com/spdrsweb/">The Garden Spider's Web Page</a> begins with close-up photograph of a real web, spangled with dew in the upper left-hand corner. The Garden Spider (aka Karen Fletcher)  wonders "if we can find a high-quality out-of-garden experience out here on the wild, wild web." With herself as a guide, we can. <p>

She offers links to a glorious treasury of garden pages, from "slow-loading images" to "good solid horticultural information in good old-fashioned text form."<p>

Among the field trips that can start from the Garden Spider's Web are virtual tours of Pukeiti Rhododendron Gardens in New Zealand, the Medicinal Herb Garden at the University of Washington in Seattle, the National Wildflower Research Center in Austin (with a photo of Lady Bird Johnson in a field of Texas bluebonnets) and the Georgeson Botanical Garden in Alaska. <p>

Then there are links to cooperative extension services, the US Department of Agriculture, and searchable collections of agricultural and horticultural publications at Pennsylvania State University, AGINFO at the University of Delaware, Missouri Extension, and North Carolina State University. The <a href="http://www.ext.vt.edu/hort/consumer/"> Virginia Cooperative Extension Service</a> is described as "a well-organized treasure-trove of searchable information."<p>

After an hour following the Garden Spider's links, the serious gardener might be tempted to put a second computer in the potting shed. <p>

It would take many hours of serious research to exhaust the resources of this single, nicely-written and well-presented web page. Not to mention links to books, magazines, catalogs, newsgroups and mailing lists. <p>

<a href="http://www.gardenweb.com">The Garden Web HomePage</a> of which the Garden Spider's Web is a subpage, and <a href="http://www.olympus.net/gardens/welcome.html">GardenNet</a> also contain myriad useful links.<p>

These carefully-researched pages are among the finest I've found on the Web: both entertaining and informative. (It's "content-rich" as they'd say in WWW jargon.)<p>

For an entirely different approach to gardening, check out the <a href="http://www.mgardens.org">Mary's Gardens Page</a>, based in Philadelphia. This page and its links are all about the garden as a form of worship of Mary, the mother of Jesus. <p>

It's not for the faint of heart, but it is lovely nonetheless and full of wonderful gardening folklore and information about flower symbolism.<p>

<img align=left VSpace=6 HSpace=6 src=mg.gif width=370 height=238>I was enchanted to find a link to a photograph and description of the <a href="http://www.mgardens.org/MG-WH.html">Wood's Hole Mary Garden</a> on Cape Cod, Massachusetts. The garden is planted with herbs and flowers that are either named for the Virgin Mary or somehow connected to her through medieval plant symbolism. <p>

Mary's Gold (marigolds), rosemary, Our Lady's Slipper (lady slippers), Spotless Lily, Our Lady's Bedstraw, Mary's Milkdrops, Our Lady's Mantle are all found in the pretty garden on the banks of the Eel Pond in Wood's Hole. <p>

Maintained by St. Joseph's Catholic Church, the garden is one of our family's favorite places to sit on a summer afternoon during our annual vacation. It's nice to find a Internet link to it so we can return electronically during the bleak midwinter.<p>

But that's just a beginning. The gardener -- whether dreamer or practical plant person (or some combination) will find food for  the soul and solid information as well as entertaining side trips on the Web.<p>                   [Feedback is welcome: email: <a href="mailto:catbird@webpointers.com">catbird@webpointers.com<a/><P><HR>

<header><title>Looking</title> </header> <p><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFE8"><html>

<center><img src=banners.gif></center><P><center><b><font size =5>Looking For Work</font><br></b>By Kitty Williams<BR></center>A friend was 'downsized' a little while ago. That doesn't mean she lost weight and could suddenly wear a Size 8. It means her former employer decided it was uneconomical to pay someone to do the work she had been doing, so her position was dissolved. <p>
The world is full of the recently riffed (from R.I.F.: reduction in force).  She's not the only one -- not by a long shot.<p>
Still, all is not lost. There are lots of resources for the job searcher on the World Wide Web, ranging from the theoretical to the practical. 'Downsizing' can be an exhilarating exercise in reinventing the future. It is certainly an opportunity to demonstrate the value of this amazing new technology.<p>
If you aren't online yourself you very likely know someone who is. Ask for a helping hand.<p>
For our friend I did a search for the word "Jobs" using  <a href="http://www.webcrawler.com/">WebCrawler</a>, a "search engine onwed by the popular America Online service. I got 10,823 hits.  (When I checked again six weeks later, Webcrawler retrieved 20,586 hits!)<p>
Almost all of  the first 25 search results (WebCrawler only returns 25 at a time) looked interesting. <p>
<img src="earthcap.gif" align=left> Nerd World: JOBS, left me cold, but I clicked on it anyway. I thought it would contain only information on computer and high-tech jobs. Boy, was I wrong. <p>
The link took me to Jobs by <a href="http://www.tiac.net/users/dstein/nw102.html">Nerd World Media</a>. It is definitely worth your time.  The main page offers links to literally thousands of career related resources. Among them are: 100 careers in Wall Street; Career Resource Homepage; How to Write A High Impact Resume; Insurance Career Connection; Southeast Recruitment online and Job Center.  <p>
Launching out from NerdWorld, I wound my way through highways and byways to a real treasure: <a href="http://www.rpi.edu/dept/cdc/homepage.html">Rensselaer Career Resource Homepage</a>. <p>
RPI offers a link to <a href="http://www.rpi.edu/dept/cdc/carserv/">Career Centers at Various Universities</a>. I found 176 listed alphabetically. <p>
There are plenty across America and more than half a dozen institutions in the United Kingdom including Cambridge University, as well as universities in Australia, Ireland and the Netherlands. It's a good place to start.<p> 
Meanwhile, back to the WebCrawler search results. <p>
My query also revealed Job Search Resources, Posting a Job Ad, The Job Bank Series, Employment Opportunities and Resume Postings, About America's Job Bank, The Virtual Press Presents the Job Information Center, Yahoo -- Business and Economy: Employment: Jobs, BBS Job Listings, Global Job Net, Job Center, Jobs Database. <p>
And, remember, I was still in the first 25 hits of a possible ten thousand plus. (Some of those may have had to do with former Apple Executive Steve Jobs or the Book of Job in the Bible, of course).<p>

<img src="gjnlogo.gif" align=right><a href="http://www.globaljobnet.com">Global Job Net</a> sounded interesting, so I accessed it. "Welcome to Global Job Net, the Internet's Best Business and Employment Resource." Cool. <p>
I was the 10,493rd person to access the page since November 15th. <p>
It has a resume database service where you can register your own resume and the categories of job listings cover the entire spectrum. <p
>It turns out they only have 20 job openings posted right now, though. Not too cool.<p>
Cornell University needs a librarian, University of Miami in Florida needs a lecturer in Transportation and Geotechnical Engineering, Virginia Institute of Marine Science needs a Scientist/Hydrodynamics, University of Vermont needs an Assistant Professor in Fisheries Ecology, Columbia University needs a Producer Editor (HTML) and so on. <p>
Nothing for our friend. Still, lots of potential. She can go back later and see if it is fleshed out.<p>
There's a lesson in this Global Job Net experience. There is no way to tell whether a resource on the net is valuable or ever will be valuable. <p>
The essential anarchy of the World Wide Web allows just about anyone to offer wonderful things without having to back them up. The duds will eventually disappear but  temper your explorations with common sense and caution. <p>

<header><title>Understanding</title> </header> <p><BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFE8"><html>

<center><img src=banners.gif></center><P><center><b><font size =5>Understanding the Web</font><br></b>By Kitty Williams and Robin Lind<br></center>You've seen the references to "the Web." You've heard experts mention "the Net." You may even have grown weary of jokes about being "roadkill on the Information Superhighway." <p>But still you wonder: What is it? Why is it such a "Gee-Whiz" phenomenon to some people?<p>Put simply: the world has changed and this is what's changing it. We have entered the Information Age and information has become the most valuable resource we have.<p>Enter the Internet. Behold the Web. It is open and available to everyone. Learn how to use it and the information of the world is yours for the asking. <p>Don't be frightened. Aware of it or not, you are already a part of this new technological and cultural phenomenon: without a doubt, information about you, your buying habits, your voting record, even your credit rating are already part of the information being shared around the globe. <p>Although the number of people presently using the Internet is relatively small, it is growing enormously every day.<p>If you use a computer at business you are probably familiar with "email" -- electronic messages that you transmit (often instantaneously) from your computer to someone else's computer. Email is transmitted on the Internet.<p>If your children are using a computer at school or college, you are likely aware of them going "online" to get research material for a term paper. They're using the Internet to access that information from a "Web" site. <p>If you or members of your family are subscribers to an "online" service you are probably familiar with the computer's ability to deliver email, academic research, stock quotations, photographs, sound and even short animated films. If you've "cruised" the Net you may even have been exposed  to some of the fun and excitement in the "cool" sites of the day.<p>
<b><font size=5>What is The World Wide Web?</font><br></b>The "Web" is a metaphor for information distribution sites linked together by computer. It began only seven years ago, caught on immediately in academic centers and quickly  spread worldwide.  When the federal government was sponsoring the development, commercial use was banned. When government  support was withdrawn that prohibition was lifted and the Web exploded with commercial sites.<p>In April 1994 there were 1,000 individual sites on the World Wide Web; in April 1995: 40,000; in October 1995: 110,000; by April 1996 there may well be in excess of 1,000,000.<p><B><font size=5>What is The Internet?</font><br></b>The Internet is a term used to loosely describe a "network of networks" -- small and large host computers linked together to permit the free exchange of information. It is an extraordinary, and unanticipated, dividend of the billions of defense dollars spent during the Cold War to provide a communications system capable of surviving nuclear war. <p>The original concept was to design an inter-connected network of computers that would all operate independently and share transmission chores equally. Networks would be hooked to networks in a "deliberately anarchic structure" that defied enemy targeting.  All would be subservient to the supreme goal of simply exchanging information.<p>The system was established in 1969 with four "nodes." By 1971 there were 15 , a year later: 37. Other organizations and other countries joined and in July 1995, more than 6.6 million hosts in more than 50,000 autonomous networks were recorded on the Internet. <p>The growth rate for the first six months of 1995 was 37%. <p>More than 1,000,000 new hosts were added in the United States alone. More than 100 counties worldwide now have host computers helping transmit information on the Internet.<p>At least 28 million computer users are currently accessing the World Wide Web. Accelerating use by the American public is not unique; the entire world is coming aboard. <P>
If you have a computer and a modem you can access the Internet. If you would like to know if there's an Internet Access Provider who serves your telephone exchange look at this <a href="http://www.thelist.com">list</a> of ISPs arranged by country, state, area code and exchange.  <p>Have a look around while it's still young. Come explore with us. Let us point the way. We think you'll be entertained, amused and amazed.<p><center>[Feedback is welcome:  <a href="mailto:catbird@webpointers.com">email</a> the authors at Catbird@webpointers.com]<p></center>

<b><font size =5>Feedback is Welcome</font><br></b>By Kitty Williams and Robin Lind</center><p>Two reader questions this week illustrate both the curiosity of new "internauts" and the vastness of the resources on the Web. <p>Our first query asked "How about finding out for me a good source of herbs ... stuff like Valerian and St. John's Wort. I'd like to know all about these wonderful medicinal herbs and it would be useful to find a source for locating plants."<p>We begin by calling up the search engine "Infoseek" at (http://www.infoseek.com) and typing in the simple phrase "medicinal herbs."<p>Infoseek almost immediately returned a list of resources, the second of which was "Medicinal Herb FAQ" at (<a href="http://sunsite.unc.edu/herbmed/mediherb.html">http://sunsite.unc.edu/herbmed/mediherb.html</a>) which was described as "A Medicinal Herb FAQ and Resource list for the alt.folklore.herbs newsgroup." <p>Don't let the jargon put you off. FAQ is an acronym for "frequently asked questions." FAQs appear throughout the Web and are usually invaluable aids for the novice. <p>A newsgroup is an expanding and contracting group of people who associate voluntarily via the Web to exchange information about a specific topic. <p>There are an estimated 18,000 newsgroups at present on almost every conceivable subject and their exchange of information is one of the most exciting continuing developments on the Internet.<p>The Medicinal Herb FAQ is a goldmine of information, all culled from exchanges across the Internet by "FAQ Keeper" Henriette Kress. It begins with an alphabetical list of more than 40 members of the newsgroup (with their email addresses if you wish to contact them directly) and follows with specific topics.<p>Valeriana was happily the first herb discussed and discussion ranged from effects (it's a central nervous system depressant like alcohol)  to possible adverse effects: "about 20% of the population respond to Valerian as a stimulant..." (You're advised to try "hops, chamomile, passionflower, skullcap or avena" if you develop insomnia or feel "buzzed out" after taking Valerian.)<p>The discussions can get fairly technical which might be helpful if you're a chemist or medical researcher but the general reader may be reassured to know (from a Harvard University respondent) that Valeriana is not derived from Valium.<p>A few entries down was a discussion of St. John's Wort (hypericum) and a warning about photosensitivity and the adverse reactions in certain pale-skinned people. "Black Irish" beware.<p>At the end of the FAQ file was a directory of nine mailing lists that provide information on an ongoing basis. If you want to join in, send an email to HERB@trearnpc.ege.edu.tr with the message "SUBSCRIBE HERB [your full name]."<p>Our second reader query was "How do I find a mate for Mary my dog, a two year old Pembroke Welsh Corgi..."<p>We used Infoseek again for "Pembroke Welsh Corgi" and immediately came up with... Yes, this little dog, which is a favorite of Britain's Queen Elizabeth, has its own home page, maintained by Perrine Crampton at (<a href="http://www.zmall.com/pet_talk/dog-faqs/breeds/pembrokes.html">http://www.zmall.com/pet_talk/dogs-faqs/breeds/pembrokes.html</a>.)<p>Not only does the page offer more information than you ever thought possible to collect about a small dog, it also lists local Corgi clubs across the country and 17 members of the Corgi-L newsgroup with their email addresses. If you want to subscribe to their newsgroup you should send an email to "Listserv@tamvm1.tamu.edu" with the message "Subscribe CORGI-L [your full name].<p>Along with plenty of stern warnings about not supporting "puppy mills" that debase the genetic stock, Perrine Crampton advises "The best way to get a purebred puppy whose origins and health you are sure of, is to contact the national or local Pembroke Welsh Corgi Club (or local all-breed kennel club) for a breeder's directory."<p>WebPointers wishes it could provide Mary with a suitable mate but, after all, our purpose is merely to point the way. The rest is up to you.<p><center>[Feedback is welcome:  <a href="mailto:catbird@webpointers.com">email</a> the authors at Catbird@webpointers.com]<p></center><P><HR>

<center><b><font size =6>Warming the Hearth<BR>On the 'Net</font></center></b>


<font size =3>

<P>


<center>by Robin Lind</center>

The Web may have an abundance of exciting, mind-boggling, "way-cool" sites that have been "shocked," audio-streamed and java-enhanced to enhance our "surfing" but honestly, how can anyone hope to compete with the simple joys of a log fire? <P>

<img src="woodheat.gif" width=180 height=221 vspace=6 hspace=6 align=right><P>

--the promising crackle of kindling igniting? <P>

--the bright yellow tongues of flame that flicker and flutter until they strengthen, redden and bite into the larger logs with jaws of elemental power? <P>

-- the stored sunlight of 20,000 days, released from now split logs, radiating out into a cold dark night giving off both light and heat?<P>

It's not a fair competition but the Internet is always producing surprising things so I had a look shortly after the Winter Solstice to see what might have appeared while we weren't looking. Using the easiest of shortcuts I simply typed in "www.firewood.com" to my browser and immediately got a hit!<P>

Unfortunately, it wasn't about firewood. It's an address that brings you to UltraNet Communications which describes itself as "the premier Internet Service Provider in New England." That's pretty clever, I thought. The marketing people must know that no matter how technologically advanced New Englanders get they'll always be interested in firewood. And when they go looking for it: presto, they'll be at an ISP offering Web services.<P>

(Frankly, I categorize that as "poke-in-the-eye" marketing. It gets your attention immediately but you never want to experience it again. You were, after all, looking for firewood.)<P>

Switching over to conventional research I launched <a href="http://altavista.com">AltaVista</a> and found 8,000 sites that dealt with firewood. Yes, 8,000! (That gives you something to look at while you're waiting for the room to warm up.)<P>

The very first item offered a Free Use Permit to cut firewood in the Penticton Forest District but since it is in the Canadian Province of British Columbia about 3,000 miles away I decided to give it old go-by. <P>

A site labeled only "<a href="http://www.northpolecity.com/dept56/sva/54863.htm">Chopping Firewood</a>" turned out to be a miniature wood carving offered at $16.50 with an 800-number for ordering. Sorry. Nope. Moving right along.<P>

A poem entitled "<a href="http://wktk.bidmc.harvard.edu/poetry/winston/the-cutting-of-firewood.html">The Cutting of Firewood</a>" by a Harvard student left me where it found me and I resolved to brush up on my poetry interpretation skills in the new year.<P>

Better luck at the Minnesota <a href="http://www.state.mn.us/ebranch/dpsv/wm/wood.htm">Division of Weights and Measures</a> Q&A. <P>

Did you know that Minnesota has a statute that gives a specific legal definition for a cord of wood? "One cord is 128 cubic feet in four foot lengths; If the wood is sawed, a cord is 110 cubic feet when ranked, or 160 cubic feet when thrown loosely into a truck; If the wood is sawed and split, a cord is 120 cubic feet when ranked, and 175 cubic feet when thrown loosely into a truck."<P>

Silly me, I thought firewood was "sawn" and a cord was always 128 cubic feet, let the chips fall where they may ...<P>

I found a motley collection of classified ads for firewood in various parts of the country: 
<blockquote>
<li> $35 a pickup load for mixed hardwoods "U-haul, U-split" in Lawrence, Kansas<BR>
<li> $65 a "face cord of mixed hardwoods, $75 for pure oak, hickory, maple, ash, cherry 2-year seasoned" in the Chicago suburbs.<BR>
<li> A Lake Tahoe vacation delivery service offers "The $20 stack will last an average weekend with two to four fires depending on how much of a pyro you are."<BR>
<li> In Pasadena you can order specialty firewoods like Olive, Almond and Eucalyptus  classified by ... their aromas. Hey, it's California.</blockquote>
<P>

I finally hit pay dirt at <a href="http://www.woodheat.com">Wood Heat</a> which has everything you ever wanted to know about heating with firewood, including positive environmental factors, chimney sweeping, wood-burning stoves, revolutionary ways to start fires, even odes and songs.<P>

The folks at Wood Heat also demonstrate the moral superiority of woodburners by including a link to the <a href="http://BurningIssues.org/bi/">Burning Issues</a> Homepage where activists oppose all wood-burning. "If you think we at wood-heat.com are misguided Neanderthals on a mission to threaten the health of little children, you'll find support at Burning Issues. All other hold your nose and check it out anyway."<P>

<h1>

 Notice: wyp.net to  close down. </b> </center> </h2>


<BR>
Hello, my name is Edwin Rutsch and I am the founder and President of wyp.net
(World Yellow Pages Network).  I run wyp.net out of my 
<A HREF="http://wyp.net/info/about/home.html">home office</A> and I am the
sole proprietor and  sole full time employee.   wyp.net makes available a
database of over 105 million names and addresses of businesses and individuals
over the Internet.  Due to a legal issue, wyp.net will be closing down.  Let me
explain; <BR>
<BR>
Over a year ago I did research and found out that in the 1992 US Supreme Court
Feist decision,  the  Court ruled that fact compilations,  such as those of
yellow and white phone books, are not creative works and are therefore not
eligible for copyright protection. In other words, fact compilations are public
domain information and may be freely used by anyone. <BR>
<BR>
Based on this information, I installed a high speed Internet connection into my
home office.  I used raw data (name, address and phone #) from yellow and white
pages  CD ROMs and  placed them into a relational database.  With the help of
over 15 people, who have donated time and energy, we built up the wyp.net
directory. <BR>
<BR>
wyp.net has creatively competed against directories from such corporate giants as
NYNEX and GTE.   wyp.net is the only directory to offer a free web page to any
individual or business and to give a unique URL to everyone of the 105 million
listings.  It was also, the first to come up with extended searches that link
every listing to maps, driving instructions, news group postings,  e-mail
addresses, etc.  We are also, the first to explore the idea of making our users
shareholders in the company. 
Shortly after going online, I received a "Cease and Desist letter" from lawyers
representing Pro CD, a company that publishes the CD ROM yellow and white page
directories that I used data from.  In essence the letter said "Stop using data
from our CD-ROM or we will sue you."   This is rather ironic, since they
themselves copy the data from phone books. <BR>
<BR>
Around this same time (October 1995) another company (Silken Mountain) in Madison
Wisconsin had also used data from Pro CD and  Pro CD sued them.  The case went to
the Federal District Court in Madison WI and Pro CD lost.  The judge ruled that
data could be freely used.  Pro CD then appealed to the Seventh Circuit Court of
Appeals and the judges (on June 20th)  reversed the ruling and said, in essence
that in this particular case, the data could not be used .    Silken Mountain is
now planning to appeal to the Supreme Court.  (If you are interested in finding
out more about the legal case and issues involved you can check
 <A HREF="  http://wyp.net/trial-by-internet/">  http://wyp.net/trial-by-internet/</A> ). <BR>
<BR>
Emboldened by this decision, Pro CD, has now again threatened to sue me.  If I
fought this in the courts, I feel positive I would prevail in the end.  The
Supreme Courts ruling is very clear to me, that fact compilations may be freely
used by anyone.   However, to fight this out in  court could take 1 to 2 years of
legal battles. During this time it would be impossible to get investors for
wyp.net and a business like this needs investors to survive and grow. <BR>
<BR>
For practical reasons, I have decided to close down wyp.net instead of fighting
it out in the courts.  Being a home office based business, I don't have the
financial resources to maintain wyp.net and to fight a protracted legal battle
against a big corporation. <BR>
<BR>
Therefore, unfortunately, by July 16,  searches in the wyp.net database will no
longer be available.  Also, listings and web pages that people have created will
not be available after July 16.  Check
<a href=" http://www.yahoo.com/Business_and_Economy/Companies/Internet_Services/Web_Presence_Providers/Free_Web_Pages/">http://www.yahoo.com/Business_and_Economy/Companies/
Internet_Services/Web_Presence_Providers/Free_Web_Pages/ </a> for a list of other
sites that will host your web page for free. <BR>
<BR>

I've enjoyed reading the many thousands of positive e-mails from wyp.net users. 
I would be interested in hearing from you.  I tend to learn by doing, and I have
learned an amazing amount about starting and running an Internet business on a
shoestring.  I immensely appreciate  the time and energy of all the friends who
helped create wyp.net, it has been a pleasure working with you.   I will now be
looking for involvement in a new project or job. <BR>
<BR>
Best Wishes, <BR>
<BR>
Edwin Rutsch <BR>
President World Yellow Pages Network <BR>

<P><font size=+2><b>W</b></font>elcome to the Southern California Gas Company Worlds Fair.  If you thought our driveway and front steps were impressive, youre in for a treat because our world is even bigger and brighter on the inside.  Theres so much inside that youll have a tough time taking it all in with just one visit, so feel free to return often and well have regular updates waiting for you.  Heres a sampling of what you can find among our exhibits:
 </P>


<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Energy Resources Center</H3></FONT>

<P>This cutting-edge facility is a must-see if you want to see the latest in energy-saving technologies, but if youre too distant to visit it in Downey, Calif., you can <a href="/erc/tour">tour it here</a>, online. Pick up some <a href="/erc/ercsource/ercsource.shtml">energy tips</a> during your visit and view our schedule of upcoming <a href="/erc/seminars.html">seminars</a>, check out some selected South Coast Air Quality Management District information and find out how cost-effective it can be to <a href="/erc/ercsource/ercsource.shtml">"recycle"</a> an old building instead of constructing a totally new one.
 </P>

<pre>

</pre>


<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Residential Services</H3></FONT>

<P>Sign up for our <a href="/res/existres/reslpp.html">Level Pay Plan</a> to make your natural gas bills more predictable and budgetable. Then move on to an exhibit that will explain factors that influence your gas consumption and steps you can take to <a href="/res/existres/afford.html">save money</a>. Find out what puts the "advantage" in <a href="/res/newres/enadvhom.html">Energy Advantage Homes</a>, pick up heating and laundry tips and learn how to read your natural gas <a href="/res/existres/gasbill.html">bill</a> and gas meter. Youll also find a list of <a href="/res/existres/afford.html#serv">services</a> that we offer and a collection of <a href="/res/existres/safety.html">safety tips</a>.
 </P>


<pre>

</pre>


<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Commercial/Industrial Services</H3></FONT>

<P>We mean business in this wing. Find out how <a href="/corecom/serv.html">Energy Management Services</a> can help you analyze your operation and pinpoint potential improvements. Need energy help with your business? Our <a href="/corecom/serv.html#TEEM">TEEM (Total Energy Efficiency Management)</a> can show you how to build the most effective energy solution to meet your specific needs. We have a wide selection of <a href="/corecom/serv.html#REPLACE">equipment replacement</a> incentive programs, and well help you <a href="/corecom/serv.html#AIR">breathe easier</a> while meeting South Coast Air Quality Management District requirements.

 </P>


<pre>

</pre>


<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Transmission & Storage</H3></FONT>

<P>Make a quick stop at our <a href="/largecom/matters.html">newsstand</a> and read an online copy of our Energy Matters newsletter. Looking for a backissue? No problem, we have every edition since January 1966. Youll find a complete listing of our <a href="/largecom/noncorepr.html">program and service options</a>, along with guidelines on how to qualify for them.

 </P>


<pre>

</pre>


<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Tariffs</H3></FONT>

<P>Need to go through our <a href="/bin/tariff">tariff and rate records</a>? Theyre accessible either through the <b>Residential Services</b>, <b>Commercial/Industrial Services</b> or <b>Transmission & Storage</b> wings. Detailed and easy to tap into, theyre a bean counters paradise.
 </P>


<pre>

</pre>


<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Environmental Services</H3></FONT>

<P>If air quality regulations are leaving you a little foggy, this wing can help you clear the air. Youll find lots of information about air quality compliance and the latest environmental legislation. A listing of our air quality <a href="/airqual/aircaldr.html">seminars</a> and descriptions of our air quality <a href="/airqual/handbook/handbook.html">compliance handbooks</a>, along with information on how to order copies, will help you make sense of your options.

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Natural Gas Vehicles</H3></FONT>

<P>Well show you <a href="/ngv/ngvinfo.html">tomorrows transportation fuel</a>, here today for fleet vehicles. Imagine an alternative fuel with 130 octane (premium gasoline is only 92 octane), that burns cleaner than any other fossil fuel, is abundant in the U.S. and costs about 30% less than gasoline. Thats compressed natural gas. Here, you can find out about product <a href="/ngv/product/product.html">services</a>, <a href="/ngv/product/avail.html">product availability</a> and the locations of natural gas <a href="/ngv/location/location.html">fueling stations</a>. 
 </P>


<pre>

</pre>


<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Who is SoCalGas?</H3></FONT>

<P><a href="/about/history.html">History</a> buffs will find plenty of facts about our roots and our parent corporation, Pacific Enterprises, as well as a smattering of information about the natural gas industry in general. If youre the pragmatic sort, youll also find a list of our <a href="/about/region.html">regional offices</a> and <a href="/about/payment.html">payment centers</a>. Looking for a job? Our <a href="http://www.pacent.com/class/emplops.html">employment opportunities</a> are also described here.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<A NAME="Save"><FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Natural Gas Appliances Lower 
Operating Costs</H3></FONT> </A>

<P>New gas appliances are more energy efficient than ever. And when you save
energy, you save money - your appliances can actually help pay for themselves
as you use them.</P>

<P>This emphasis on efficiency helps you get more value from your energy
dollar. It also helps explain why the majority of homes in southern and
central California
use gas heaters, gas water heaters, gas ranges and gas clothes dryers.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Save By Being Energy Efficient
</H3></FONT>
<P>Here are some energy-saving tips from <A
HREF="../../about/history.html">Southern
California Gas Company</A> to
help you reduce
the amount of gas you use for home heating, laundry, hot water and
cooking.</P>

<B>Home Heating Tips</B>
<UL>
<LI> Save on heating costs by adding insulation to your uninsulated or
inadequately insulated attic.
<LI> Install an automatic setback thermostat.
<LI> Caulk cracks around your windows and doors. 
<LI> Weatherstrip your windows and doorways.
<LI> Check your furnace filter every month during the heating season and
replace or clean it when it is dirty.
<LI> Repair cracks or broken seams in forced-air heating ducts.
<LI> Set your thermostat at 68 during the day and 55 or lower at bedtime.
<LI> Turn the thermostat off if you're going to be away for more than one
day.
<LI> Close your drapes at night to keep the heat in.
<LI> During cold weather, close all openings to cooling units (evaporative
coolers, wall and window air conditioners) to keep the heat in.
<LI> Don't block heating outlets or return registers with furniture or other
objects.
<LI> Choose a high-efficiency model when you're in the market for a new gas
furnace.
</UL>

<B>Laundry Tips</B>
<UL>
<LI> Wash full loads or adjust the water level to fit the size of your load.
<LI> Wash with warm or cold water rather than hot water whenever possible.
<LI> Dry full loads of clothes rather than half loads. Don't overdry.
<LI> Clean the lint filter before drying each load.
<LI> Every so often, check to see that the outside moisture exhaust of the
dryer is open and remove any lint that has collected.
<LI> When you replace your clothes dryer, buy an efficient gas dryer with
energy-saving features.
</UL>
<B>Hot Water Tips</B>
<UL>
<LI>Set thermostat dial at mid-range (120F). Extremely hot water not only
uses more
energy, but can also cause instant, severe burns or death from scalds.
<LI>Turn your water heater control valve to "pilot" when you're away from
home for a week or more.
<LI> Install a water heater insulation blanket if
your hot water heater is located outside or in the garage and doesn't have an
"Energy Guide" label indicating it is energy efficient.
<LI> Install water-saving showerheads.
<LI> Take shorter showers.
<LI> When you're washing dishes by hand, rinse with cold water. Wash full
loads in your dishwasher. 
<LI> Fix leaky faucets.
<LI> Insulate exterior hot water pipes which aren't covered.
<LI> When buying a new water heater, choose an energy-efficient gas model.
</UL>
<B>Cooking Tips</B>
<UL>
<LI> Don't preheat your gas oven unless the recipe specifically requires it.
<LI> Don't open the oven door while food is cooking.
<LI> Cover pots when cooking.
<LI> Adjust the top burner flame to fit your pansize, then simmer after
cooking starts.
<LI> Cook by time-and-temperature guides.
<LI> Be sure all burners are off when not in use.
<LI> Never use the gas range for room heating - it's unsafe. 
<LI> Prepare an entire meal using just the broiler, or the oven, or just one
top burner.
</UL>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT COLOR="#006600"><H2>Introducing the Energy Advantage Home.</H2></FONT>

<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HEIGHT="106" WIDTH="108"
SRC="./images/gif/logo.gif" border=0 alt="EAH logo"> At the <AHREF="../../about/history.html">Southern
California Gas Company</A> we know finding a new home is no easy task. We want to help reduce the
guessing and stressing and make the process easier for you. That's why we
introduced the Energy Advantage Home. It's a home with special features built
right in.

<FONT COLOR="#006600"><H2>A sign of higher standards.</H2></FONT>

<P>You see, the Energy Advantage Home is a newly constructed house, condo, or
apartment that's built to higher energy efficiency standards than the State of
California currently requires. Builders participating in the Energy Advantage
Home program have agreed to construct homes with gas space and gas water heating 
that exceeds minimum efficiency requirements. This, of course, can mean
greater value to you in the short and long run. All you have to do is look for
the Energy Advantage Home sign. It tells you at a glance that your builder is
going beyond the minimum requirements to bring you an energy efficient home.
You'll not only spend less time and energy looking for a house that meets your
high standards, but you can also save energy and money living in it.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#006600"><H2>A sign of value.</H2></FONT>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT HEIGHT="256" WIDTH="211"
SRC="./images/jpeg/eah.jpg" border=0 alt="EAH illustration">
<P>When checking our new houses make sure you look for the Energy Advantage
Home sign Because energy efficiency can really impact a home's value. After
all, the higher a home's energy efficiency, the lower its monthly utility
bills. Your builder can participate in a variety of Energy Advantage Home
program elements to increase you home's energy efficiency. One measure your
builder must include is Duct Testing. As heating and cooling are major energy
consumption areas, improperly sealed duct systems can substantially increase a
home's energy usage and cost. This is significant in that a small duct leak can
mean paying to heat or cool your attic or crawl spaces instead of the living
areas. So this test helps you avoid a big waste of energy and money.</P>

<P>In addition, you may also enjoy the many advantages of cooking and heating
with state of the art high efficiency natural gas appliances if your builder
participates in these program elements. On average, it's currently about half
as expensive to run natural gas appliances over those which are electric. Plus
there are all the practical benefits of natural gas water heaters, furnaces and
cooktops such as ease of use and better temperature control. Ask you builder
for details on the Energy Advantage Home features built into your home.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#006600"><H2>Your future is part of the plan.</H2></FONT>

<P>Californians are spending more time at home and keeping homes longer than in
the past. The majority of  new home buyers plan to stay in there next home over
ten years rather than reselling after three to five.  So when buying a home,
it's important to think ahead. That's why the Energy Advantage Home is built to
incorporate many of the modern amenities and efficiency you'd want in a home.
The surprise is this not only makes a house more comfortable to live in, but
also easier to get into in the first place.</P>

<P>You see, since an Energy Advantage Home is built to higher energy efficiency
standards it may allow you to qualify for an Energy Efficient Mortgage. This
allows you to stretch your qualifying ratios and obtain a larger loan since the
debt to equity ratio on an Energy Efficient Mortgage is higher than typical.
Which we think is a nice part of any plan. Ask your lender for details.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#006600"><H2>There's even something in it for the
environment.</H2></FONT>

<P>We've entered a time when environmental responsibility is something everyone
should consider. That's why it's nice to know that natural gas is the cleanest
burning fossil fuels. So it's not only an economical source of energy, but also
one of today's most environmentally friendly.</P>


<FONT COLOR="#006600"><H2>Put our energy to use. </H2></FONT>

<P>To find our more about an Energy Advantage Home, just ask your builder or
call the <A HREF="../../about/history.html">Southern
California Gas Company</A> at 1-800-427-2200. You'll see that with
our help a little energy can go a long way towards finding you a home with
advantages built right in.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<font color="880000"><h3>Did You Know?</h3></font>
<P><A HREF="../../about/history.html">Southern
California Gas Company</A> owns and maintains the meter, regulator and
related piping
that are on your property. Public Utilities Commission Rule 25 requires you
to guarantee that we will be able to reach our meter and other equipment at
all reasonable hours.</P>

<P>Your meter is read once a month. If your meter cannot be accessed due to
vegetation, an unfriendly dog, or a locked gate, we must estimate your bill.
If you choose to keep your gate locked, please contact <A
HREF="../../about/history.html">Southern
California Gas
Company</A> to
make arrangements to have your meter accessed on the "scheduled read date."
You'll find this date printed on your last bill.</P>

<P>We may also contact you because of a locked gate when we need to work on
the meter or survey the underground piping. And in an emergency, the fire
department or <A
HREF="../../about/history.html">Southern
California Gas Company</A> may need to shut off your meter.
So make sure
the meter is easy to reach.</P>

<B>Gas Theft</B>

<P>Tampering with a gas meter and/or gas piping could cause a fire or an
explosion. The California Penal Code makes it a felony to willfully remove,
obstruct, or interfere with any valve, meter, pipe, or other device installed
on any gas main or pipeline.</P>

<P>All paying customers have to bear the cost of gas thefts. If you are aware
of gas thefts or anyone tampering with gas meters or piping, you should
report it to <A
HREF="../../about/history.html">Southern
California Gas Company</A> - your call will be kept
confidential.</P>

<font color="880000"><h3>How To Read Your Gas Meter</h3></font>
<CENTER>
	<IMG HEIGHT="143" WIDTH="287"
SRC="/res/existres/images/jpeg/meter.jpg" border=0 alt="gas
meter">
</CENTER>
<P>Read only the dials marked 1,000 and higher. (The small dials are for test
purposes only.) In each of these dials, there's a hand that points between
two numbers. Write down the smaller of the two numbers. Read the dials from
left to right. The sample reading shows 6084. </P>
<P>To check the amount of gas you use, look at the reading at the start of
the billing period and again at the end. The difference between the two
numbers is the amount of gas used in hundreds of cubic feet.</P>



<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Gas Rates</H3></FONT>

<P>The California Public Utilities Commission sets the rates we charge for
natural gas. Its goal
is to encourage the efficient use of natural gas by setting "baseline therm
allowances" for all our residential customers.</P>

<B>Baseline Therm Allowances</B>

<P>Under the direction of the State Legislature, the California Public
Utilities Commission has established the amount of natural gas needed to meet
the minimum basic needs of the average home, referred to as the baseline
therm allowance. </P>

<P><A HREF="../../about/history.html">Southern
California Gas Company</A> bills these "baseline" amounts at its lowest
residential
rate.</P>

<B>Medical Baseline Allowance</B>

<P>An additional "baseline" allowance is available for customers with certain
medical conditions, such as paraplegics, hemiplegics, quadriplegics, persons
afflicted with multiple sclerosis and scleroderma, and persons dependent on
life support equipment. For an application, call Southern California Gas
Company.</P>

<B>Why Your Gas Bills Vary</B>

<P>Seasonal weather conditions, more than anything else, affect the amount of
natural gas you use.</P>

<P>When it's cold outside, your furnace goes on more frequently and runs
longer to warm your home to a comfortable temperature. Additionally, incoming
water is colder, so your water heater stays on longer to heat your water.</P>

<P>You will use less gas if you keep the furnace thermostat turned down, take
shorter showers
and wash full loads in your dishwasher and washing machine.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Why Your Gas Bill Is Different
From Your Neighbor's</H3></FONT>

<P>Neighbors who live in homes like yours and have the same number of family
members don't necessarily use the same amount of natural gas as you do.</P>

<P>The gas bills may differ because some people like room temperatures
higher, others lower. The amount of gas used for washing clothes, bathing and
cooking can be different, too. Guests or a new addition to the family may
also increase gas usage.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>What To Check If Your Gas Bill 
Seems Higher Than Usual</H3></FONT>
<UL>
<LI> Does your furnace thermostat have an on/off switch? If not, the furnace
will go on automatically when the temperature drops below the lowest setting.

<LI> Have you left evaporative cooler ducts open during the heating season?

<LI> Are any of your hot water pipes or fixtures leaking?

<LI> Have you turned your pool or spa heater burner valve to the "off" or
"pilot" position for the winter? If you've simply turned the thermostat to
the lowest setting, the heater may come on if temperatures drop low enough.

<LI> Have you recently received notification of an increase in gas rates?
</UL>
<P>There are a number of low-cost or no-cost steps you can take to reduce the
amount of energy you use and still maintain year-round comfort at substantial
savings. See <A HREF="./afford.html">Making Gas Affordable</A>
 for some gas-saving tips.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>At <A
HREF="../about/history.html">Southern
California Gas Company</A>, we know that savings are
strong incentives
for all companies. Which is why we offer the Equipment Replacement Program. 
Designed to help your business improve its overall productivity by replacing
existing gas equipment with prescribed new high-efficiency gas equipment, it
can mean significant long-term savings.</P>
<P>  And that's not all.  This program also
offers significant financial incentives to our core commercial and industrial
customers, saving you money in the short run, as well.  And because the aim of
our 1996 Equipment Replacement Program is to encourage the use of the most
energy-efficient solutions, it of course contributes to a cleaner environment. 
Which is a good incentive for us all.</P>

<P><I>This program is available to the core commercial and industrial customers
of Southern California Gas Company</A>.  Incentives are determined by rated MBtuh input, efficiency
ratings, therms saved and/or installed invoice costs.</I></P> </BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT COLOR="#000088"><H4>Apply Before You Buy</H4></FONT>
<BLOCKQUOTE><P>To receive financial incentives, projects must be approved
before work is started.  An Application for Participation must be received and

<FONT COLOR="#000088"><H4>Improving Efficiencies</H4></FONT>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The Equipment Replacement Program offers our core commercial and
industrial customers a prescribed selection of new equipment designed for
greater energy efficiencies for your operations.  It also offers financial
incentives for selecting these higher-efficiency options.  Gas Company
incentives are designed to cover the incremental cost of installing a wide
range of high energy-efficient equipment such as space heaters, water heaters,
boilers and cooking units.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT COLOR="#000088"><H4>Sharing the Cost</H4></FONT>

<BLOCKQUOTE>Once our representatives have helped you determine that overall
energy efficiency and savings can be realized by installing new equipment, we
may help share the cost.  But please remember, to be eligible for any
incentives under this program, you must contact Southern
California Gas Company</A>
before ordering
equipment.</BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT COLOR="#000088"><H4>Gas Air Conditioning Systems</H4></FONT>

<BLOCKQUOTE>The gas air conditioning systems incentive is based on efficiency

<FONT COLOR="#006600"><A NAME="TEEM"><H2>Total Energy Efficiency Management
(TEEM)</H2></A></FONT>

<FONT COLOR="#000088"><H4>Southern
California Gas Company Provides Total Energy
Efficiency Management
(TEEM)</H4></FONT>        


<P><B>TEEM</B> began in March 1995 and already several contracts have been
signed with more customers clamoring at the door.  Because of the overwhelming
response, the program's focus is now on large commercial and industrial
customers who
have cumulative annual energy bills of $400,000 or more.</P>

<P>The popularity of the program, we believe, is due to the wide range of
benefits it provides:</P>

<P><B>TEEM</B> is comprehensive.  The program is fuel neutral; that is, it
evaluates and determines energy efficiency opportunities not just for natural
gas, but for all energy systems -- gas and electricity.   <B>TEEM</B> even
includes water conservation measures in the program.</P>

<P><B>TEEM</B> offers affordable energy solutions.  Because the program is fuel
neutral, it provides the customer the best and most cost effective energy
solution -- natural gas, electricity or a combination of the two.</P>

<P><B>TEEM</B> includes project financing.  <B>TEEM</B>  has put together a
select group of qualified financing companies and works with the customer to
develop a customized financing plan that addresses the customers unique goals. 
Project financing arranged by <B>TEEM</B> requires little or no money from the
customers up-front.  In addition, the energy savings from the project pay for
the project itself over the contract term.  </P>

<P><B>TEEM</B> handles project management with single-point accountability. 
<B>TEEM</B> manages the project from start to finish so the customer can stay
focused on managing the business itself.  The customer benefits from
<B>TEEM</B> is expertise in all areas of energy management.</P>

<P>As wild and woolly as the energy business can be, there is no shortage of
energy management companies offering the promise of cutting energy costs. 
What's missing is one energy management expert who can provide it all, and who
the customer knows will still be around at the end of the contract period. 
<B>TEEM</B>
provides that longevity and broad expertise.</P>

<P><B>TEEM</B> works closely with the customer and provides substantial
information before a contract is even signed through a pre-qualification
process and a preliminary energy audit.</P>

<P>Once a customer signs on with <B>TEEM</B>, the first step is a detailed
evaluation of the customers facility using state-of-the-art computer simulation
technology.  <B>TEEM</B> creates a computer model of the facility and tests 
possible variables - a variety of building materials, alternative equipment,
alternative energy sources and different projected business growth rates.</P>

<P>The customer's "what ifs" can be investigated thoroughly in advance of the
customer spending any money or installing any new energy systems.  </P>

<P>Customers get the energy options that work best for them because they are
designed specifically for them, taking only their own individual business needs
into consideration.</P>

<P><B>TEEM</B> is funded by shareholders of Pacific Enterprises, the parent
company of <A
HREF="../about/history.html">Southern
California Gas Company</A>, and is budgeted through the end of
1996, although it could be extended longer.</P>

<P>Two of the program's most popular features are flexible financing options
and single-point accountability.  Some companies which have a gut feeling they
should be able to reduce operating costs through better energy management or
installation of more advanced energy systems never get beyond the initial
stages of thinking about improvements because of difficulty, confusion or lack
of expertise in arranging 
financing.</P>

<P>Customers also like the single-point accountability feature of the program. 
The energy business can be very confusing and volatile.  If the customer has to
shop around for a provider on every aspect of energy management, the project
will likely take longer and be less efficient than when there is a single
provider who is responsible for all aspects of the project.</P>

<P><B>TEEM</B> isn't biased toward natural gas.  If the energy evaluation shows
that new electric systems provide the best energy solution to the customer,
that's what <B>TEEM</B> will install.</P>

<P>Southern California Gas Company</A>'s vision statement is to be Southern
California's energy provider of choice and we put the customer first.  A
program like <B>TEEM</B> demonstrates in very real terms what we mean by that
and how serious we are.  Our success depends on the success of our customers. 
We're committed to both!</P>

<FONT COLOR="#000088"><center><H1>The California Energy
Hub</H1></FONT></center>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>A hub is a focal point for moving gas in many different directions. The Hub
brings more buyers and sellers of natural gas together by providing new
alternatives for matching supply with demand.  The California Energy Hub is
connected to 5 major interstate pipelines: El Paso, Kern, Mojave, PGT (via
PG&E) and Transwestern. These interconnecting pipelines reach into major supply
basins in the southwest United States, Rocky Mountains, and Canada. It is owned and operated by
<A HREF="../about/history.html">Southern
California Gas Company</A> and administered by Enerchange, L.L.C.   The
hub links major gas producing sites with metropolitan areas such as Los
Angeles, Long Beach and San Diego. The Hub acts as a one-stop market center for
marketers or customers to buy, sell, store, and/or trade gas.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#006600"><H2>Transportation Options</H2></FONT>

<P> To effectively meet your customers' demands, you need the ability to move
gas exactly where and when you need it.  The California Energy Hub provides new
options for buying, selling and wheeling gas by helping you create your own
interconnections throughout the system. Using a process called "wheeling," the
Hub gives you new flexibility in transporting gas. Gas may be "wheeled" in and
out of the California Energy Hub and dispatched through different "spokes," or
pipelines. Through displacement, this process allows the Hub to direct gas to
alternate markets, city gates, pipeline interconnects and points originating in
the supply area. If you're a gas supplier, wheeling means you can deliver to
more markets. If you're a market, you have more suppliers to choose from.</P>
 
<FONT COLOR="#006600"><H2>Cost Savings</H2></FONT>

<P> Pipeline imbalance penalties and wildly fluctuating market demands can
seriously hurt your bottom line. The California Energy Hub can help avoid these 
costly pitfalls.  Through parking and loaning you always have
the right amount of gas whenever you need it.</P>
 
<P> No longer will you need a separate, full reserve to satisfy peak needs. With
access to nearly 120 billion cubic feet of storage, the California Energy Hub
can satisfy even the highest customer demands for gas supply. If a change in
market demand leaves you temporarily short or long, you can take an
interruptible short-term gas loan, or park volumes at a competitive rate. 
Loaning also helps you take advantage of price arbitrage.  For example, when
current prices are high, you can make a sale with gas "loaned" from 
the hub, and repay it at a later date with lower-priced gas.</P>
  
<FONT COLOR="#006600"><H2>Time Efficiency</H2></FONT>

<P>In a business environment where "soon" means "now," you can't afford to
waste time. </P>
<P>The California Energy Hub will save you time by offering services that allow
you to more effectively manage your resources. For example, with the Hub's
parking service, you can avoid the time-consuming search for temporary places
to store gas. If there is no immediate need for your gas, you can easily delay
the transaction by "parking" gas on the Hub, then withdrawing it at a later
date. The flexible injection and withdrawal schedules, along with inter-month
agreements allow you to take advantage of different market and transportation
opportunities.  In addition, the Hub will soon offer an electronic service that
will let you complete transactions in seconds rather than minutes.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#006600"><H2>Technology</H2></FONT>

<P> For greater control over your business, you need the latest technology to
access and manage your transactions efficiently.  In the future, the California
Energy Hub will allow you to place nominations directly through GasSelect<sup>&reg;</sup>,
<A HREF="../about/history.html">Southern
California Gas Company</A>'s state-of-the-art nomination and communication
service.  This new system will confirm the particulars of each transaction.
With this critical information at your fingertips, you can efficiently track
your nominations and confirmed volumes.  In addition, future services of the
Hub will also include title transfer, allowing gas to be purchased and sold
through the California Energy Hub. Such a service will truly provide a complete
market center, providing an efficient and liquid point for buying and selling
volumes in the west.</P>


<FONT COLOR="#006600"><H2>New Solutions for a New Era</H2></FONT>

<P>Deregulation has brought many new opportunities to all segments of the gas
industry, along with many new challenges. Today, whether you're a local

<BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A HREF="../about/history.html">Southern California Gas Company</A> offers large volume natural gas users an array of <a href="#sales">basic sales, transportation</a>, and <a href="#store">storage</a> services.  We also have some <a href="#other">ancillary programs</a> that may help you operate a little more efficiently.</P>



<P>To be eligible, customers must consume an average of at least 20,800 therms monthly. All services are available to customers throughout our service territory. Transmission and storage services are available to customers throughout the western United States and Canada.</P>



<a name="sales"><font color="#006600"><h2>Gas Sales and Tranportation Services</h2></font>



<P>Gas sales contracts provide users a one-stop, full service source for natural gas supplies and delivery.  Gas contract prices track those of the general natural gas market.</P>



<P>Gas transportation services enable customers to transport their own gas from the California border through our 45,000-mile network of gas <a href="./transmap.html">transmission</a> and distribution pipelines. Pricesare competitive with those offered by other similar service providers.  In addition, customers can enter into transportation contracts that provide longer-term price stability.</P>



<font color="#000088"><h4>Core Subscription (G-CS)</h4></font>



<p>This is a full service option that includes natural gas procurement and transportation to your facility.  This service requires a two year commitment.<p>



<font color="#000088"><h4>Firm Transportation Service (GT-F)</h4></font>



<p>This service provides intrastate transportation of your natural gas from the California border to your facility.  You must procure natural gas and transport it to the California border through a third party.  This service requires a two year commitment.</p>



<font color="#000088"><h4>Interruptible Transportation Service (GT-I)</h4></font>



<p>This service provides intrastate transportation of your natural gas similar to GT-F service, however, GT-I service reliability is a less than firm service.  Should it be necessary to curtail natural gas service, GT-I service will be curtailed before GT-F and G-CS.  This service only requires a one month commitment.</p>



<a name="store"><font color="#006600"><h2>Storage Services</h2></font>



<P>Gas storage services offer two important benefits.  First, storage provides added security against supply shortages or capacity constraints.  Second, storage can facilitate  customers' management of  their supply portfolio to take advantage of market price fluctuations.</P>



<P>We have short term (one year basic storage) and long term (3-15 years) storage programs that offer firm injection and "as-available" injection and withdrawal service.  Short term and long term programs require contractual agreements.  You may also choose to participate in our auction storage program where storage costs are determined through an annual bid process.  Storage volumes available under the auction program may be limited.  Most recently, we've developed a new storage program that allows you to purchase storage one transaction at a time and negotiate storage fees based on market conditions.</P>



<P>For more information on the storage services, contact Peter Yu (<a href="mailto:peteryu@pacent.com">peteryu@pacent.com</a>).</P>



<a name="other"><font color="#006600"><h2>Ancillary Services</h2></font>



<font color="#000088"><h4>GasSelect<sup>®</sup></h4></font>



<P><a href="./gselect/gslect.htm"><img border=0 align=left width=50 src="./images/gif/gaselct.gif"></a> This subscription service gives you access to our electronic information and gas transaction system specifically designed to maximize your ability to manage gas supplies.  By utilizing the appropriate software and a computer modem, you can: submit gas nominations and obtain allocated quantities; post imbalance advertisements and submit imbalance trades; obtain energy usage information for your facility; and view your storage balances (if applicable).  There are monthly base and access fees (<a href="http://www.socalgas.com/bin/tariff?T91+1">Rule 33</a>) associated with using GasSelect<sup>®</sup>.  Accessing GasSelect<sup>®</sup> requires a software licensing agreement.  <!--<a href="./gselect/gslect.htm">more info</a><P>-->


<P>For more information, contact Ed Vera (<a href="mailto:evera@pacent.com">evera@pacent.com</a>) or (213) 244-3715.



<font color="#000088"><h4>The California Energy Hub</h4></font>



<p><img align=left width=50 src="/corecom/images/gif/hublogo.gif"> The <a href="/corecom/calhub.html">California Energy Hub</a> is a focal point for moving gas in many different directions. The Hub brings more buyers and sellers of natural gas together by providing new alternatives for matching supply with demand.</P>



<font color="#000088"><h4><a name="TEEM">Total Energy Efficiency Management</a></h4></font>



<P>Through <a href="/corecom/serv.html">Total Energy Efficiency Management</a> (TEEM), our experts help you implement comprehensive energy-efficient changes to your facility.  Energy solutions involve all energy technologies available including both natural gas and electricity.  We also can provide various financing options that reduce initial capital costs and allow your payments to be included in your monthly gas bill (payments may be offset by energy savings).</P>



<font color="#000088"><h4>Building Technical Services</h4></font>



<P>Building Technical Services (BTS), is designed to help you lower your facility operations and maintenance costs.  BTS offers a full complement of services including:  facilities operations, maintenance, energy procurement, technical support, and on-site management.</P>



<font color="#000088"><h4>Residual Load Services</h4></font>



<P>The CPUC has approved our Residual Load Services (RLS) for customers who partially bypass our service on or after July 1, 1995 and continue to stay connected to our system for peak, swing and standby service.  This new rate will take effect February 1, 1996.  The rate for this service is negotiable with the maximum rate being based on a formula that measures the degradation of the customer's load factor on our system after the partial bypass takes place.</P>


<a name="AIR"></a>
<font color="#000088"><h4><a href="/airqual/airprgrm.html">Air Quality Compliance Support</a></h4></font>



<P>This support was created to help our commercial and industrial customers understand and comply with air quality regulations affecting their natural gas use.</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE> 



<FONT COLOR="#000088"><H2> January 1997</H2></FONT>



<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H2 align=center>PermitWorks<font size=-1><sup>SM</sup></font></H2></FONT>



	<P>Carlos Flores, environmental manager of Hayes Wheels International, Inc., in La Mirada, regularly prepares permit applications for his company. So he was one of the first gas company customers to try out the new software, <b>PermitWorks<font size=-1><sup>SM</sup></font></b>, and the self-service permitting station at the ERC.

	   </P>

	<P>"<b>PermitWorks<font size=-1><sup>SM</sup></font></b> is easy to use and really cut down the time it normally takes to complete a permit application," Flores says. "Most recently, I successfully used it to install an internal combustion engine at our facility. Consequently, I was able to reduce the time required to prepare the ICEís application form and its respective emission calculations by a factor of 10!"

	   </P>

	<P>The Gas Company rolled its air-quality permitting assistance service last June. Ann Fritzsche, a permitting and air quality expert for the company, says sheís happy to report that customers are finding it a quick, easy and inexpensive way to apply for air quality permits.

	   </P>

	<P>"After hearing our customersí frustrations with permit applications, The Gas Company developed <b>PermitWorks<font size=-1><sup>SM</sup></font></b>, which automates the permit application process. Using <b>PermitWorks<font size=-1><sup>SM</sup></font></b> we can prepare permit applications quickly and accurately, based on the customerís facility and equipment data. If the customer would like our help collecting this data, we can do that, too," Fritzsche says.

   	   </P>

	<P>Customers who prefer to prepare their own permit application and would like to speed up the process can use <b>PermitWorks<font size=-1><sup>SM</sup></font></b> for a low fee at the ERC, Fritzsche pointed out. Or, if they prepare a lot of permit applications, customers can license the software to use at their own facility.

	   </P>

	<P>The Gas Company is also working with equipment manufacturers to make air quality permitting a simple part of purchasing new gas-fired equipment, Fritzsche says. Kirby Brown, who represents Cummins Engines, works with the utility to permit the new gas engines he sells.

	   </P>

	<P>"We have found The Gas Companyís permitting service an invaluable asset in marketing our products in Southern California," Brown says.

	   </P>

	<P>Another manufacturerís representative who says he finds <b>PermitWorks<font size=-1><sup>SM</sup></font></b> a time-saver is the R.F. MacDonald Company, who represents Cleaver Brooks boilers. The company regularly refers its customers to The Gas Companyís permitting service at the ERC to save them time and trouble. "R.F. MacDonald works closely with us to ensure we have all the information we need to make permitting easy," Fritzsche says. 

	   </P>

	<P>R.F. MacDonaldís Robert Riccio agrees. "The Gas Companyís permitting service has saved us time and saved our customers money," he says.

	   </P>

	<P>To find out how <b>PermitWorks<font size=-1><sup>SM</sup></font></b> can make permitting easier for you, talk to your account executive or call (310) 803-7500 to make an appointment for self-service permitting at the ERC. Or call 1-800-GAS-2000 for more information.

<BLOCKQUOTE>
As tough air quality regulations get even tougher, fleet owners face a difficult challenge. They not only must switch to cleaner-burning fuels but also must decide which fuel is best.  In making the choice, there are several important questions:

<UL>
<LI>Which fuel is the cleanest-capable of meeting the most stringent regulations?
<LI>Which fuel is the most economical?  
<LI>Which fuel offers the safest track record?  
<LI>Which fuel provides the best financial incentives for switching?
</UL> 
<P>
More and more fleet owners are discovering the answer to all of these questions: natural gas. Though it has been widely known for over a century as a safe and dependable fuel for homes and businesses, natural gas is now recognized as a viable vehicle fuel
 for almost any operating need.
<P>

<font color="#000088"><H2>Why does natural gas make sense as an alternative vehicle fuel today?</H2></font>

<UL>
<LI>It's the cleanest of all fuels.
<LI>It costs less than gasoline.
<LI>It's safe.
<LI>It's the best fuel for longer engine life.</UL>
<P>
Most importantly, a wide variety of natural gas vehicles (NGVs) are available today.
<P>
Fleet owners have two ways to switch to NGVs: purchasing them directly from original equipment manufacturers (OEMs); or converting existing vehicles to run on natural gas. Either way, NGVs are the most economical, high-performance alternative fuel vehicles 
currently available. 
<P>

<font color="#000088"><H2>Natural Gas: A Smart Choice
</H2></font>

Using natural gas as an alternative transportation fuel makes sense for a variety of reasons.

<blockquote>
<font color="#880000"><H3>Cost-effective</H3></font>
Compressed natural gas currently costs about 25 to 30 percent less than gasoline and as much as 50 percent less than other alternative fuels, such as methanol and ethanol.  Natural gas prices have also proven to be stable and not as vulnerable to market 
fluctuations or to world crises.

<font color="#880000"><H3>High performance</H3></font>

Natural gas has an octane rating of 130, compared to only 92 with premium unleaded gasoline.  Because of the clean burning attributes of natural gas, NGVs generally have lower maintenance costs and longer engine life compared to most gasoline-powered vehicles.  NGVs can go 10,000 to 
15,000 miles between oil changes, 40,000 miles between tune-ups, and spark plugs can last up to 75,000 miles.  Plus, "cold start" problems are non-existent with NGVs.

<font color="#880000"><H3>Clean</H3></font>
  
Overall, natural gas is the cleanest burning alternative fuel available today. NGVs can reduce NOx emissions and reactive hydrocarbons, which form ground-level ozone, by as much as 95 percent.  NGVs can also reduce emissions of carbon dioxide by as much as 30
 percent, carbon monoxide (CO) by 85 percent and carcinogenic particulate emissions by 99 percent.


<font color="#880000"><H3>Safe</H3></font>
 

Thirty years of experience and millions of problem-free miles driven by NGVs show that natural gas is an extremely safe fuel for vehicles.  According to a survey conducted by the American Gas Association, over 7,000 NGVs in the U.S. have traveled 434 million 
miles with no reported fatalities.  


<font color="#880000"><H3>Abundant</H3></font>
Experts agree that there is enough 
natural gas to last well beyond the 21st century.  In fact, estimates show that if there were eight to 10 million NGVs on the road, natural gas consumption would increase by only six percent.

<font color="#880000"><H3>Domestic</H3></font>

Because natural gas is produced in the U. S., its increased use could help reduce the national trade deficit and significantly cut the our dependency on foreign oil.

<font color="#880000"><H3>Available</H3></font>

The Los Angeles basin already has more than 40,000 miles of natural gas pipe in place.  Natural gas for vehicles can be provided at virtually any point along this pipeline network, including residential homes.

<p>Southern California Gas Company (SoCalGas) provides millions of people in Southern California with a safe, efficient and reliable source of energy for their everyday lives. For more than a century,
Southern California Gas Company has been an integral part of the business community while being committed to a tradition of excellence in the energy field.</P><FONT COLOR="#006600"><H2>History</H2></FONT>In 1867, Los Angeles was a frontier community of adobe and frame houses and small buildings huddled around the old Plaza. The town's total population was less than 5,000 people.  Five of those citizens formed what they called the "Gas Works" under the official name of the Los
Angeles Gas Company on June 28, 1867, with a capital investment of $36,000.<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT SRC="./images/gif/oldcar.gif" ALT="old gas delivery car" border=0></p>

<p>This was the great grand daddy of
today's Southern California Gas Company.</p>

<p>At about the same time, <a href="http://www.pacent.com">Pacific Enterprises</a>, our parent company, was experiencing a success story of its own. Established in San Francisco in 1886 as Pacific Lighting, it recognized Southern California as ripe for growth by the turn of the century and began to purchase many small gas manufacturing and distribution companies in the area that eventually became the Southern California Gas Company.</p>

<p><A NAME="pipeline"> The</A> growth of Southern California Gas Company since that time has been outstanding. The first few hundred feet of pipeline laid in the old Los Angeles Plaza has expanded to about 45,000 miles of <A HREF="./pipeline.html">transmission
and distribution</A> pipelines providing natural gas service to approximately 17 million people through 4.7 million meters.</p>

<p>
The original population of 5,000 who benefited from the service of the "Gas Works" has grown to more than 15 million Southlanders, most of whom rely today on natural gas for heating, cooking, water heating and many other <A HREF="../res/resprdct.html">household uses</A>. And SoCalGas has grown from the five original founders to over 7,000 employees.</p>

<FONT COLOR="#006600"><H2>About the Industry</H2></FONT>
The natural gas industry is a complex business fueling some 25% of North America's energy needs. Natural gas is the cleanest burning fossil fuel available. Fifty-five million American households and more than one-third of America's industrial energy needs are met by gas.</p>

</p>The million-mile network of underground pipe that delivers this energy to customers is operated by more than 214,000 men and women working in scores of professional and technical disciplines. SoCalGas is one of the nation's largest natural gas distributors within this dynamic industry. With today's emphasis on the environment, we are confident that the Company's products and services are well positioned for strong growth in the future.</p>

<FONT COLOR="#006600"><H2>A leader in the Industry</H2></FONT>

<p><A NAME="service">SoCalGas</A> has become the largest natural gas distribution utility in the country. Its year-end weighted average rate base stood at $2.9 billion. SoCalGas serves a territory of
23,000-square-miles that ranges from central California to the Mexican
border. All but 1,200 of the 4.7 million meters in our <A HREF="./service.html">service territory</A> serve core customers -- residential and small commercial users. The remainder serve noncore customers -- large volume commercial, industrial and electric
generating users.</p>

<p>The core market consumes about 33% of annual gas deliveries, but accounts for 89% of the utility's margin recovery. SoCalGas enjoys a high residential market penetration, providing the fuel for 97 percent of water heaters, 94 percent of space heaters, 78 percent of cooking appliances and 72 percent of clothes dryers. When core and noncore customers are combined, SoCalGas fuels about half of all non-transportation energy use in its service area. Including gas transported for customers and direct sale to customers, SoCalGas delivers about 1 trillion cubic feet of gas a year, or about 5 percent of all gas delivered in the United States.</p>

<FONT COLOR="#006600"><H2>Company Organization</H2></FONT>
<p>The company is made up of two business units: Energy Distribution Services and Energy Transportation Services.</p>

<p>The Energy Distribution Services unit provides technical, planning, marketing and support services for residential, commercial, and industrial utility customers. Departments in this business unit also provide for procurement of natural gas as well as purchase material for day-to-day operations. The Energy Transportation Services, provides all technical, marketing and support services required to provide transportation of natural gas to large customers or groups of customers.</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>Few things can enhance the personality of a home like natural gas.  It's
reliable, clean and economical.</P>
<P>Whether it's the charm of an inviting natural gas log fireplace or the
efficiency of a gas clothes dryer, gas is the natural choice of homeowners who
are looking for reliability as well as savings.</P>
<P>Indoors a natural gas range gives you prompt and precise heat for all
your cooking needs.  Outdoors, a natural gas barbecue is the perfect partner
for gatherings of friends and family year-round.</P>
<P>Add a gas spa heater, and your backyard becomes the perfect entertainment
area.</P>
<P>And even though they're out of sight, nothing works harder for less money
than a natural gas water heater and a natural gas furnace.  Both give you energy
for your home quickly, quietly and efficiently.</P>
<P>So give yourself the lifestyle you deserve.  With gas, the natural
choice.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3> What services does Southern California Gas
Company
provide for residential
customers?</H3></FONT>

Please feel free to review our many <A
HREF="/res/existres/afford.html#serv">services</A> available to the
residential natural gas user.

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3> How do I read my gas bill?</H3></FONT>

We have provided a handy <A HREF="/res/existres/gasbill.html">guide</A> to
better understand your gas bill.

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3> How do I contact Southern California Gas
Company?</H3></FONT>
<P>You can arrange for many services by phone-- 1-800-427-2200.</P>

Or you can visit or call your nearest <A HREF="/about/region.html">regional

HREF="/about/payment.html"> payment office</A>.

<A NAME="lpp"><FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>What about the Level Pay Plan?</H3></FONT></A>
<P>How does the <A HREF="/res/existres/reslpp.html">Level Pay Plan</A> work?</P>

<P>The Level Pay Plan enables residential customers to pay their annual bill
for gas service in relatively equal amounts by spreading the cost of higher
winter bills and lower summer bills over the entire year.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>How is the Level Pay Plan amount
determined?</H3></FONT>

<P>The <A
HREF="/res/existres/reslpp.html">Level Pay Plan</A> amount is an average of
the previous twelve months
billing for your address.</P>

<A NAME="lpp2"><FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Who is eligible to join the Level Pay
Plan?</H3></FONT></A>

<P>Qualified residential customers can join the Level Pay Plan any time during the year.</P>
<P>If you have not received more than one 41.6 Collection Notice or been closed for non-payment in the past twelve months, you may elect to have your arrears balance amortized over the plan year.</P>
<P>If you do not qualify for amortization or prefer not to amortize, then you are required to pay your current bill plus any arrears balance 	in full prior to joining the plan.</P>
<P><I>Note:  Deposits and Service Establishment Charges (SEC) cannot be amortized.</I></P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Can I still join the plan if I have a previous
balance on my
account?</H3></FONT>

<P>Yes you can join the <A
HREF="/res/existres/reslpp.html">Level Pay Plan</A> by either paying any
previous balance
owing on your account or, if you qualify, by requesting to have the previous
balance amortized.  By requesting to have your previous balance amortized, we
will adjust your plan amount and spread the previous balance over the
next twelve months.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>What if I decide I don't want to be on the
plan?</H3></FONT>

<P>You can request to be removed from the plan at any time.</P>

<BODY BGCOLOR="#FFFFFF">

<a href="/maps/larhead.map">
<img border=0 src="./images/gif/larhead5.gif" alt="navigational header" ismap></a>
<FONT COLOR="#000088"><H1>Frequently Asked Questions</H1></FONT>
</center>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Can SoCalGas sell gas to noncore customers competitively with other suppliers?</H3></FONT>

<P>Yes. We purchase natural gas in significant volumes at very competitive rates from several U.S. and Canadian supply basins; therefore, we have one of the lowest weighted average costs of natural gas (or WACOG) in the industry. There is, however, a  burner tip price differential between us and other suppliers. This differential exists primarily because of the difference between the  interstate pipeline charges we pay and those costs to other suppliers.  We move all gas under "firm" interstate pipeline rights and pay the corresponding "full" interstate demand charges - these are contract obligations we currently are required to include in the price of gas available for sale to noncore consumers.  Our rate which includes both procurement of natural gas and transportation to your facility is called the Core Subscription rate.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>How reliable are Natural Gas supplies and
transportation?</H3></FONT>

<P>While the interruption of natural gas deliveries is still a remote 
possibility, we have firm interstate contracts for 2,200 million cubic 
feet/day of pipeline capacity, double our average daily system requirements. 
We also have 115 billion cubic feet of storage capacity in five underground storage fields, a portion of which can be purchased and accessed by customers as insurance against the unlikely event of  an interruption of interstate supply or transmission.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>What is Pacific Enterprises' and SoCalGas' future direction, especially as it pertains to electricity?</H3></FONT>

<P>We will continue to be very involved in the electric industry restructuring.  Look for regular informational updates in this site and our monthly newsletter, "ENERGY MATTERS" (a hard copy version <a href="matters.html">ENERGY MATTERS On-line</a>).  We will also continue to hold customer forums, and of course, your Account Executive always has the latest updates on electric restructuring.  Pacific Enterprises (our parent corporation), or one of its affiliates, may also be strategically involved as an electricity provider under the deregulated electric market.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>What services (besides providing natural gas) does SoCalGas offer to help me run my operations?</H3></FONT>

<P>Our Account Executives are your "one-stop" energy providers.  In addition to providing you information on natural gas and utility-related items, they can assist you in maximizing your operating and process efficiency.  The Account Executive assigned to your facility can work with you to ensure that you consider the latest and most energy efficient technologies to incorporate into your operations.  We have also developed several <a href="noncorepr.html">programs</a> that can help you to finance facility changes and centralize plant operations.</P>

<P>We can assist you with air quality permitting, assist you with <A
HREF="../airqual/envsoft/envsoft.html">RECLAIM reporting</A>, and help
you complete your <A HREF="../airqual/handbook/handbook.html">Title V facility permits</A>. We have natural gas storage available for purchase, to take advantage of price hedging opportunities or firm up your service.  We have an <A HREF="../erc/tour/index.html">Energy Resource Center</A> that can be 
reserved for your conference and meeting needs, houses commercial and 
industrial equipment for testing and observation, and contains an on-line 
resource of energy-related products, simulation programs for building air 
conditioning modeling, and a representative from the Air Quality Management 
District available to process your permits or answer questions.  We also 
have Service Technicians who are available to tune and adjust your equipment and provide emissions testing.</P>

<P> Contact your Account Executive for more information, or call 1-800-GAS-2000.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>	How can I tell if my facility needs to apply
for a
federal Title V
permit?</H3></FONT><P>

<P>Title V of the Federal Clean Air Act Amendments (CAAA) requires certain
facilities to 
obtain facility operating permits. Some facilities are included based on the
type of facility, 
but in most cases, the permitting requirements is based on the amount of
emissions from 
the plant.  The threshold values vary by air pollution control district.  The
following 
information describes which facilities need Title V permits in more detail.</P>

The types of facilities which need to obtain Title V permits based on the type
of category 
include:<BR>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
  	<LI>Electric power generating plants emitting NOx and SOx.  These are
defined as acid rain 
	<LI>sources in Title IV of the CAAA.
  	<LI>Municipal solid waste incinerators.
  	<LI>Facilities which have been issued a Prevention of Significant
Deterioration (PSD) permit.
  	<LI>Major sources subject to New Source Performance Standards.
  	<LI>Major and area sources regulated by Maximum Available Control
Technology (MACT) standards or NESHAPs (National Emission Standards for
Hazardous Air Pollutants).  
MACT standards will be developed for air toxics from specific industries.	
</UL>



<P>In most air districts, Title V applicability is determined by facility
potential to emit.  The potential to emit is the facility's maximum emission
level, considering federally approved emission control equipment, when the
plant is operated at maximum rate or time period allowed on the operating
permits.  In the <A HREF="http://www.aqmd.gov">South Coast Air Quality Management District</A>, applicability for the first three years 
of the program will be based on actual reported emissions during 1992 - 1995. 
After the first three years, SCAQMD will also look at potential to emit.</P>

The threshold values by air district are as follows:<BR>

SINCE EACH READER'S SITUATION MAY DIFFER, THE READER IS ADVISED TO SEEK ADDITIONAL GUIDANCE SPECIFIC TO IT PRIOR TO EMBARKING ON ANY PARTICULAR PERMITTING STRATEGY.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3> What is the SCAQMD Permit Amnesty program?</H3></FONT>

<P>The <A HREF="http://www.aqmd.gov">South Coast Air Quality Management District</A> adopted a new rule which
provides a      
six-month amnesty to businesses to obtain required air quality operating
permits.  Rule 
310 - Amnesty for Unpermitted Equipment allows businesses to apply for permits
for 
existing unpermitted equipment without being subject to any late fees or civil
or criminal 
penalties.  The six-month amnesty period extends from October 3, 1995, to April
2, 1996.  
The amnesty will apply to any equipment at a business, including RECLAIM
facilities.  </P>

<P>To take advantage of the amnesty, check to see if any of your equipment
needs permits.  
In general, combustion equipment with a rated heat input of greater than 2
MMBtu/hr 
needs an air quality operating permit; engines rated at greater than 50 brake
horsepower 
also need permits.  For non-combustion equipment, check SCAQMD Rule 219 - 
Equipment Not Requiring a Written Permit Pursuant to Regulation II.</P>



<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3> What does the SCAQMD's new policy on Best Available Control Technology guidelines mean to my facility?</H3></FONT>

<P>Recent changes in Best Available Control Technology (BACT) policy mean more 
certainty, more public participation, and potentially lower costs to reduce
emissions.  
These changes came about based on the work of a new Scientific Review Committee 
(SRC), which is made up of representatives of regulatory agencies, academia,
business and 
SCAQMD staff.  Here are some highlights of the new policy.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P><B>Create a more certain environment:</B>  District staff will
now analyze
control technology 
cost effectiveness and technological feasibility as part of BACT guideline
development, 
rather than on a case-by-case basis for each permit application.  Also, control
equipment 
must meet specific requirements before it can be designated as BACT, such as
commercial 
availability and 12 months of proven field performance.</P>

<P><B>More Opportunities to be Heard:</B>  Industry, the scientific community
and the public 
have much more opportunity to participate in BACT guideline development under
the new 
policy.  Once the District staff has developed new guidelines, the SRC will
review them.  
The new guidelines will then go through public review before being presented to
the 
Governing Board.  Also, the policy includes a new appeal mechanism:  a BACT
Review 
Committee, made up of senior District management, will hear specific concerns
from 
permit applicants who do not agree with their designated BACT
determination.</P>

<P><B>Maximum Cost Reduced:  </B>Previous District policy allowed equipment to
be considered 
BACT as long as the associated emission reductions cost less than $31,900/ton
for NOx; 
other pollutants also had cost effectiveness limits.  The new policy limits the
maximum 
cost for NOx reductions to $17,000/ton, with significant reductions for other
pollutants as 
well.  For small businesses, the maximum cost is 75% of these values.  </P>

<P><B>Definition of small business expanded:</B> "Small Business" now means
facilities which 
have 100 or less employees, total gross annual receipts of $2,000,000 or less,
and are not 
subject to RECLAIM.</P>

<P><B>Incentives for New Technology Development:</B> Pending EPA approval, the
new policy 
proposes a BACT Designation for new technology.  Once designated, the
technology will 
be considered BACT for two years, even if more efficient technology is
developed during 
that time.  As a further incentive, facility operators who exceed BACT emission
reduction 
requirements can qualify for Emission Reduction Credits for their excess
reductions.</P>

<P><B>Simplified Guidelines:</B>  The previous five categories of guidelines
have been collapsed 
into two:  BACT, and Small Business BACT.  The Alternate Basic Equipment
category 
has been eliminated.</P>
 
<P>The specific BACT guidelines developed under this new policy will be
available in 6 to 8 
months.  Permit applications submitted now go by existing
guidelines.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P>
NGV Ecotrans Group was established in May of 1993 with the
sole purpose of providing the finest quality Natural Gas Vehicle
conversions in the western United States.
<p>
NGV Ecotrans Group is a limited liability company whose
members include NGV Systems, Inc., a Long Beach based corporation
dedicated to the development of the natural gas vehicle industry,
Ecotrans OEM Corporation, a subsidiary of Southern California Gas
Company, and Cardinal Automotive, an OEM vehicle upfitter in Sterling

<P>
NGV Ecotrans Group is currently offering the following conversion systems in both dedicated and "Bi-Fueled" configurations:
<ul>
  <li><b>GFI Control Systems Inc. (GFI) & (GEM)</b> - Full electronic integrated system which combines pressure regulation and fuel delivery and controls them utilizing a state of the art closed -loop computer microprocessor.  These systems are actually an aftermarket form of high pressure fuel injection and are the leading edge of technology in the industry.
  <p>
  <li><b>IMPCO Technologies (ADP)</b> - Commonly referred to as "Core-Type" technology which utilize two pressure regulators, a natural gas carburetor, and a state of the art closed-loop  fuel control processor.
  <p>
  <li><b>Baytech Corporation</b> - This system utilizes a preprogrammed chip that plugs into the OEM computer.  This feature eliminates additional wiring and speeds installation.  A set of high pressure natural gas injectors meter the fuel as it is introduced to the intake system at the throttle body.
  <p>
  <li><b>Vinyard Engine Systems, Inc. (VESi)</b> - This "lean burn" fuel system uses new internal engine components to convert a diesel engine to a dedicated natural gas engine.  A state of the art electronics system manages fuel control and spark timing.  The original diesel engine horsepower and torque curves can be matched, and in some cases exceeded, while burning   natural gas with the VESi system.
  <p>
  <li><b>Clean Air Partners (CAP)</b> - Offers both a "lean burn" conversion system, and  "dual fuel" diesel and natural gas systems.  Dual fuel systems burn natural gas and diesel fuel simultaneously, using the diesel fuel only for pilot ignition.  As the RPM increases, so does the % of natural gas being burned, and the amount of diesel decreases (Approx. 80%NG/20%D).
</ul>
<P>
The manufacturer warranties for the kits listed above range from 1 year/12,000 miles to 3 years/50,000 miles.  In some cases, the labor is covered by the manufacturer. NGV Ecotrans Group  offers a 3 year/50,000 mile warranty in accordance with C.A.R.B. on its workmanship.
<p>
In addition to an extensive inventory of underhood equipment, NGV Ecotrans Group is also carrying a substantial inventory of fuel storage cylinders.  The likes of which include steel composite, aluminum composite, and full composite cylinders.  NGV Ecotrans Group will only install DOT/NGV-2 certified cylinders.

<P>
Some of the other services that NGV Ecotrans Group makes available to its customers are:
<ul>
  <li><b>Emissions Testing</b> - NGV Ecotrans Group recognizes that many of the NGV projects that are currently being funded will require testing to confirm emissions reductions.  NGV Ecotrans Group has a CARB certified emissions laboratory that can perform a full range of CARB and EPA required emissions test including full FTP-75 emissions certification tests for the certification of conversion equipment.
  <p>
  <li><b>DOT cylinder re-certification testing</b> - NGV Ecotrans Group, in association with CNG Cylinder Company of Long Beach, have the equipment and personnel necessary to retest and re-certify natural gas vehicle fuel storage cylinders which must comply with DOT regulations.  These DOT cylinders must be re-tested and re-certified on a three year interval from the production date of the cylinder.
  <p>
  <li><b>Conversion Modifications</b> - NGV Ecotrans Group can make any needed modifications to underhood equipment, cylinder mounting, high pressure components and wiring.  In order to better serve the natural gas vehicle population, NGV Ecotrans Group is capable of making these modifications and also upgrading the systems regardless of who the original converter was (please check your conversion warranty for details related to having modifications performed by other conversion facilities).
  <p>
  <li><b>Extended Range Upgrades</b> - NGV Ecotrans Group can also extend the range (not possible for all applications) of your existing OEM or converted natural gas vehicle.  Our extensive cylinder inventory of cylinders in stock make extended range upgrades quick and easy.  If you have vehicles in service which require extended range, please contact our Sales Dept.
  <p>
  <li><b>Repower  Capabilities</b> - Capable of repowering light duty, medium and heavy duty vehicles from gasoline and diesel to natural gas operations. Either by supplying new natural gas engines or rebuilding old engines and offering bi-fuel or duel fuel capbility. Recently repowered a Methanol Transit bus with a new natural gas engine and fuel system for a dedicated CNG bus. Also completed Van Pool vehicles and UPS step vans to operate with new natural gas engines. Last year we converted 65 Paratransit buses from gasoline to dedicated natural gas.

</center>


<BLOCKQUOTE>
<font color="#880000"><H3> What is a natural gas vehicle?</H3></font></font>
<P>
A natural gas vehicle (NGV) is a car, truck, van or bus which uses compressed 
natural gas to fuel its engine. Because it's not a liquid fuel, natural gas 
is compressed at 3,000 pounds per square inch so that it can be stored in 
steel, aluminum, or carbon-fiber cylinders.  
<P>
<font color="#880000"><H3>How do NGVs work?</H3></font></font>
<P> 
NGVs work like conventional liquid gasoline or diesel-powered vehicles in that they burn a gaseous mixture of fuel and air in an engine; however, natural gas has the distinct advantage of already being a gas, which helps the engine run cleaner.
<P>
<font color="#880000"><H3>How are NGVs refueled?</H3></font></font>
<P>
At fueling locations, natural gas is compressed 
and dispensed into vehicles in much the same way gasoline is.  Fleet fueling stations can be conveniently located on-site, using either the "quick-fill" or "timed-fill" method of fueling. Quick-fill refueling takes about three to seven minutes; timed-fill 
refueling is usually done overnight, in about five to eight hours.  
A refueling station may be installed wherever natural gas is available. NGVs are convenient for fleets since the vehicles usually return to the same location each night for refueling. 
<P>
Home refueling appliances are available that provide consumers and small 
fleets with an over night refueling option.  These appliances require 220 
volt electric service along with the standard natural gas service available 
at most homes.
<P>

<font color="#880000"><H3>Is compressed natural gas safe?</H3>
</font></font>
<P>
 
Yes. The cylinders that hold the 
compressed natural gas are significantly stronger than gasoline tanks and 
have withstood bullet  and bonfire testing and meet or exceed U. S. Department  
of Transportation safety standards.   Even in the unlikely event of a rupture, 
CNG will not form combustible pools  on the ground, as other fuels do. Because 
it is lighter than air, it will rise and dissipate if released.  Furthermore, 
natural gas is not toxic to touch, and it is much more difficult to ignite 
than gasoline or methanol.  
<P>
<font color="#880000"><H3>How do NGVs comply with clean air regulations?</H3></font></font>
<P>
NGVs are simply the cleanest of any vehicles in 
production today.<sup>*</sup> &nbsp;In fact, NGVs produce only 
5% to 10% of allowable emissions of today's most stringent standards. Some models are available 
today that meet emissions standards not slated 
to take effect until 1999. Clearly, NGVs present 
the cleanest choice for today and tomorrow.

</center>

<blockquote>
<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>What is the ERC?</H3></FONT>
Southern California Gas Company's <A HREF="./tour/index.html">Energy Resource Center (ERC)</A> is a model of advanced , 
energy-efficient and environmentally sensitive building technology. 
Designated by the <A HREF="http://www.epa.gov/">U.S. Environmental Protection Agency</A>
as an "Energy Star Building", the ERC showcases innovations in
resource-efficient designs, materials and equipment to help businesses make informed choices about 
energy consumption and conservation.

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3> What is the mission of the ERC?</H3></FONT>
 The <A HREF="./tour/index.html">ERC</A>'s mission is to serve as a one-stop "idea shop"
where customers can 
find the most efficient and environmentally sensitive solutions to their 
energy needs.

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3> How do you get more information on the building and or
seminars?</H3></FONT>
   If neither the <A HREF="./tour/tour.html">tour</A> nor the <A
HREF="./ercevent/seminars.html">seminar schedule</A> address your particular question, then please
all us at 1-800-427-6584. For additional information contact <a 
href="mailto:ERC@pacent.com">ERC@pacent.com</a>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3> Where is the ERC?</H3></FONT>
The address for the <A HREF="./tour/index.html">ERC</A> is 9240 E. Firestone Blvd., <A
HREF="http://www.cityguide.com/us/ca/downey/">Downey, CA</A>. We are 
approximately 20 miles east of Los Angeles at the center of the Los 
Angeles/Orange County Metropolitan area. Refer to the <A
HREF="/clients/socal/erc/tour/ercmap.html">area map</A> for more information.

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3> Is the ERC a new building?</H3></FONT>
The <A HREF="./ercsource/ercsource.shtml">ERC</A> made use of an existing <A
HREF="../about/history.html">Southern California Gas Company</A> building. Approximately
60% of the 
old building materials were either left in place, removed for future 
reinstallation or recycled. About 80% of all <A HREF="./ercsource/ercsource.shtml">ERC</A>
construction materials, 
internal furnishings and displays are either recycled, contain recycled 
materials, or are made of renewable resources.
<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3> Where can I get more environmental conservation
information?</H3></FONT>
You can find more information through the <A HREF="http://www.envirosense.org">Envirosense
Consortium</A>, a non-profit organization that addresses indoor air quality issues.
<P>More information can be found at <A
HREF="gopher://gopher.igc.apc.org/11/environment/pubs">GreenClips</A>,

<A HREF="/bin/tariff/">The Tariff Book</A> is available via any Header Bar which contains the label "Rates & Terms."
  Residential Services, Commercial/Industrial Services, and Transmission & Storage all have 
  this option available.


<font color="000088"><H4>How to Print a Tariff (Using Netscape<sup>&reg</sup>)</H4></font>
Since the tariffs are huge .gifs (pictures), it isn't just a matter of clicking
on the print button or selecting "File|Print."  We have tested this under
Netscape<sup>&reg</sup> 2.0 using a HP LaserJet IIIsi:  
<blockquote>
<ol type=a>
<li>Right click your mouse button and hold it down on the tariff .gif you want to 
    print.
<li>Select <b>View this image (<i>xxx</i>.gif)</b> and release your mouse 
    button.
<li>Select <b>Page Setup</b> from the <b>File</b> menu.
<li>Change your margins (left, right, top <i>and</i> bottom) to .20". Click
    OK.

<font color="880000"><H2> <IMG SRC="./images/gif/ball_yellow.gif" border=0><A NAME=NETSCAPE>How to configure Netscape Navigator&reg</A></H2></font>

The following configuration setup will result in Netscape Navigator<sup>&reg</sup> properly displaying the pages in
this site.

<font color="000088"><H4> Cache Size</H4></font>
If you plan to explore this site, sampling different pages and later returning
to them we recommend that you configure Navigator to use a cache size of
larger than two (2) megabytes. You can configure this option from the
Options:Preferences:Directories and Applications menu.

<font color="000088"><H4> Connections</H4> </font>
We recommend that you configure the number of connections to be
at least four, if not eight (earlier versions allow you to use more sockets).
This setting affects the number of sockets secured by Netscape<sup>&reg</sup> on entry
to a new server (a new site) and determines how many images it can
download simultaneously. A higher number of connections will generally
speed Netscape's response time.

<font color="000088"><H4> Helper Applications</H4></font>
You should use the default options for displaying gif, 
jpeg, and jpg graphic file formats, as well as the .au sound file.

<P>

<font color="000088"><H4> Fonts</H4></font>
On the Macintosh, we recommend that you set your proportional font
to be Times in 12pt and your fixed width font to be Courier in 10pt.
<P>
On the PC, we suggest using the default Netscape<sup>&reg</sup> settings.

Unfortunately, all browsers were not created equal. We designed this site using Netscape Navigator<sup>&reg</sup> 2.0, chiefly because it implements a number of proposed and yet-to-be proposed features that allow much better-looking page layout.  
Please note that several of the cutting-edge features we have implemented on this site simply will not work on other browsers.

<font color="880000"><H2> <IMG SRC="./images/gif/ball_yellow.gif" border=0><A NAME=HELPERS>Helper applications</A></H2></font>

Helper applications allow you to view files or listen to sounds that
you could not otherwise view or listen to in your Web browser. Most 
browsers provide a choice of which external helper application
to invoke when you encounter a file type not supported by the browser.
For example, most browsers don't handle video at all. Therefore, you
will have to configure your browser to hand off control to an application like  MPEGView<sup>&reg</sup>. You will have to perform the same task for a number of
different file formats: text, several types of audio files, such as Real Audio<sup>&reg</sup> and True Speech<sup>&reg</sup> and several types
of video formats.
<P>
Because of the number of browsers available out there, we cannot offer specific advice with any browser other than Netscape Navigator<sup>&reg</sup>.

<font color="880000"><H2> <IMG SRC="./images/gif/ball_yellow.gif" border=0><A NAME=DOWNLOAD>Downloading files</A></H2></font>

Most World Wide Web browsers handle the transfer of files to your local
machine in a seamless manner. You simply need to click on the 
non-HTML file that you want and the browser will download it and
decompress it for you. 
<P>
However, you should make sure on both the Macintosh and the PC
that you have the right utilities available to your browser. On the
Macintosh you should have copies of Stuffit Expander  in the same directory as your browser. On the PC
you want to make sure that you have a copy of PKZIP or Winzip lurking somewhere on your machine.  
<P>
Note that many browsers allow you to set an option that specifies
a directory into which downloaded files will be placed.  This is
especially needful with the Macintosh version of Netscape<sup>&reg</sup>, which 
sets its default download folder to the System Folder.

<FONT COLOR="#006600"><H2><A NAME="Summ1">Energy Efficiency</A></H2></FONT>
<UL>
<P><LI>Computer models indicate that the <A HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A>
exceeds <A HREF="http://www.energy.ca.gov/energy/">California Energy
Commission</A> Title 24 standards for new buildings by 45%.</P>
	
<P><LI>Non-CFC, rigid-foam insulation added to the walls provides a total
R-value of 11. This reduces heat gain and loss through the building walls by
50%. (The tilt-up concrete walls from the old building have an insulation
R-value of 7.) </P>
	
<P><LI>Roof insulation in the remodeled east and west sections provides an
R-value of 38, double the R-value of traditional California roofs. Insulation
on the new center roof section has an R-value of 30.</P>
	
<P><LI>Careful sealing of doors and seams minimizes energy loss through air
infiltration. </P>
	
<P><LI>A highly reflective roof coating reduces heat absorption between 10 and
40%, which dramatically decreases air conditioning requirements.</P>
	
<P><LI>Low "e" glass windows further reduce heating and cooling needs by
allowing light, but little heat, to penetrate during warm months or escape
during winter.</P>

<P><LI>Skylights and translucent window walls allow natural daylight to
illuminate interior spaces. These "daylighting" techniques combined with
energy-efficient lighting systems reduce electrical lighting requirements by
40%, to slightly less than one watt per square foot. </P>
	
<P><LI>Installation of  T-8 compact fluorescent lamps and electronic ballasts,
dimmer switches, and occupancy and light sensors reduces energy demand.
High-efficiency lighting also reduces the internal heat load, requiring less
energy for air conditioning. </P>

<P><LI>Unlike most conventional buildings, which typically use only one heating
and cooling system, both gas and electric systems were installed in the <A
HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A>,
thereby minimizing energy requirements. The four systems include:
indirect/direct evaporative cooling, desiccant units, absorption
chillers/heaters, and package units.</P>
	
<P><LI>An automated energy management system monitors all major building
systems and adjusts them for optimum efficiency. The digital system controls
temperature and air flow throughout the building on a continuous basis,
reducing mechanical system needs. Daylighting controls routinely adjust the
amount of electrical lighting used to augment natural light that enters through
the high-performance windows and skylights. The system also monitors and logs
energy use, which is helpful for evaluating and improving designs and
equipment.</P>
</UL>
<FONT COLOR="#006600"><H2><A NAME="Summ2">Resource Conservation</A> - Saving
energy reduces resource consumption and pollution.</H2></FONT>
<UL>
<P><LI>We made use of an existing <A HREF="../../about/history.html">Southern
California Gas Company</A> building. Instead of demolishing
the 1957 office complex in <A
HREF="http://www.cityguide.com/us/ca/downey/">Downey, CA</A>, the former
structure was dismantled only as
needed. Approximately 60% of the old building materials were either left in
place, removed for future reinstallation or recycled. </P>
	
<P><LI>Hundreds of tons of construction and demolition materials were recycled
and reused, including concrete, roofing materials, asphalt, metal, ceiling
tiles, wood flooring, electrical equipment and mechanical systems. </P>
	
<P><LI>About 80% of all <A HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A> construction
materials, interior furnishings and
displays are either recycled, contain recycled materials, or are made of
renewable resources. </P>
	
<P><LI>Recycled building materials incorporated throughout the <A
HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A> include
recycled steel, glass tiles, plastic bathroom partitions, metal from weapons
confiscated by the L.A. County Sheriff's Department, discarded materials from
studio movie sets, surplus aircraft aluminum, and plastic scraps from natural
gas distribution pipe.</P>

<P><LI>The use of environmentally sourced building materials helps protect
fragile ecosystems. Instead of specifying virgin wood products, the ERC
incorporated previously used lumber. The <A HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A>
entry <A HREF="../tour/tour2.html">lobby</A> is laid with
reprocessed wood from an old Banana Republic warehouse.</P>
	
<P><LI>Water-conserving plumbing fixtures and landscaping practices reduce
water, energy and sewage treatment requirements. <A
HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A> landscaping includes
plants native to arid climates which require little water. A drip irrigation
system further maximizes water efficiency. Ultra-low flush toilets use half the
water of conventional toilets. </P>
</UL>
<FONT COLOR="#006600"><H2><A NAME="Summ3">Indoor Air Quality</A></H2></FONT>
<UL>
<P><LI>Building designers avoided selecting materials that "off-gas" harmful
chemicals, where feasible. Low and nontoxic products used include paint,
caulking, floor sealers, carpet adhesives and carpet tiles. In addition,
wherever practical, natural finishes were used.</P>
	
<P><LI>Sensors monitor carbon dioxide levels and control fresh air intake to
optimize indoor air quality and energy efficiency in the main exhibit hall.</P>
	
<P><LI>Periodic inspection and maintenance of the <A
HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A>'s air conditioning
systems help to ensure optimal indoor air quality. Maintenance includes
adjusting outside air intake volumes, cleaning cooling coils and drain pans,
and changing air filters.</P>
</UL>
<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>The Context</H3></FONT>
<UL>
<P><LI>Energy use. Buildings use one-third of the energy and two-thirds of the
electricity in the United States, at a cost of more than $110 billion a year.
</P>
	
<P><LI>Energy savings. It is typically cheaper to invest in energy-saving
strategies than to invest in new power production. Saving one unit of
electricity avoids burning three units of energy at the power plant. In
addition to costs, saving energy reduces resource consumption and
pollution.</P>
	
<P><LI>Appliances and fixtures. High-efficiency appliances and fixtures are
available today that use two to four times less energy and water than
conventional models. </P>
	
<P><LI>Lighting. Lighting accounts for 20 to 25% of the electricity used in the
U.S. annually. Offices in the U.S. spend 30 to 40¢ of every dollar spent on
energy for lighting power, making it one of the most expensive and wasteful
building features. According to Amory Lovins, Research Director at the <A
HREF="http://solstice.crest.org/efficiency/rmi/index.html">Rocky
Mountain Institute</A>, replacing incandescent lamps with compact fluorescent
lamps
can cut lighting costs 60 to 85%. Compact fluorescents also last 4 to 13 times
longer and can pay for themselves by reducing maintenance and replacement
costs.</P>
	
<P><LI>The environment. A single, compact fluorescent bulb saves enough
coal-fired electricity over its lifetime to keep a power plant from emitting
three-quarters of a ton of carbon dioxide, a suspected contributor to global
warming, and 15 pounds of sulfur dioxide, which causes acid rain. </P>

<P><LI>Computers. Computer systems account for approximately 5% of the
electricity used by the commercial sector, according to the <A
HREF="http://www.epa.gov/">U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency</A>.</P>

<P><LI>Insulation. Up to 30% of heating and cooling energy is lost from leaking
or non-insulated duct work in U.S. homes with forced-air systems. Adding
insulation and sealing leaks are among the most cost-effective ways to reduce a
building's environmental impact.</P>

<P><LI>Roof structures. A <A HREF="http://www.lbl.gov">Lawrence Berkeley
Laboratory</A> study found that if all
roof structures in Los Angeles were reflective, power needs in the city would
be reduced by as much as $500 million a year. <A
HREF="http://www.fsec.ucf.edu/">The Florida Solar Energy Center</A>
determined that reflective roof coatings can reduce a building's air
conditioning requirements by 10 to 40%. </P>
	
<P><LI>Air conditioners. Nearly one-quarter of all ozone-depleting
chlorofluorocarbons (CFCs) are emitted by building air conditioners and the
processes used to manufacture building materials. </P>
</UL>
<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>The ERC Approach</H3></FONT>

<P>The <A HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A> is designed to optimize energy
efficiency while maintaining a
high-quality, high-performance space. This is achieved through careful
integration of lighting, heating, cooling, insulation and energy management
control systems. Design techniques and building technologies work together to
minimize heating and cooling requirements, maximize the use of natural daylight
and maintain healthful indoor air quality.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#000088"><H1>Energy Efficiency</H1></FONT> </center>
<BR> 
 
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT COLOR="#006600"><H2><A NAME="Eff1">Building Envelope</A></H2></FONT>

<P>The building envelope can be thought of as a shell or barrier separating
interior spaces from the outside environment. Roofs and walls protect
inhabitants from the elements, while windows transmit light, views and
ventilation to occupants. </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Insulation Systems</H3></FONT> 

<P>The building's insulation is comprised of both old and new systems. The
existing building is fabricated predominantly from tilt-up concrete. Non-CFC
rigid foam added to the existing walls, often referred to as an "Exterior
Finish Insulation System," or "EFIS," enhanced the walls' insulation value from
R-7 to R-11. The new exterior walls combine foil-backed fiberglass batt
insulation and EFIS to achieve an R-value of 11. These insulation systems
reduce heat gain and loss through the building walls by 50%.</P>

<P>Roof insulation in the remodeled east and west sections of the <A
HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A> provides
an R-value of 38, double the R-value of traditional California roofs.
Insulation on the new center roof section has an R-value of 30. </P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Infiltration Techniques</H3></FONT>

<P>Poor caulking and sealing of building wall seams and connection points
result in substantial energy loss in buildings. A "no-leak, no-loss" specified
design, along with carefully executed installation, reduces infiltration. </P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Duct Work</H3></FONT>

<P>The <A HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A> air distribution system was
carefully planned for accurate supply
and return. State-of-the-art diffusers and duct work design enhance the
efficiency of mechanical systems. One of the key features of this system is the
Variable Air Volume controls placed strategically throughout the building.
Careful installation from the supply fan to the diffuser further minimizes
energy use.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Roof System</H3></FONT>

<P>The <A HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A> displays both old and new roof
systems. The old, traditional roof is
made from hot asphalt and toxic adhesives. The new second-story roof membrane,
which covers one-third of the building, is mechanically fastened, eliminating
the need for heat equipment, hot asphalt, and toxic adhesives and sealants. A
highly reflective white roof coating dramatically reduces captured heat,
thereby decreasing air conditioning needs by 10 to 40%. This low-maintenance
roof is also highly resistant to extreme temperatures, puncture and
oxidation.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Windows</H3></FONT>

<P>Low "e" Glass. In order to reduce radiant heat gain or loss, low "e"
(emissivity) glass was used in all windows. The windows are gas-filled and
dual-glazed with a "heat mirror" sheet, a transparent material that allows
light, but little heat, to penetrate during warm months and retains heat in
winter. These windows not only provide energy savings but also acoustic
benefits by minimizing external noise. </P>

<FONT COLOR="#006600"><H2><A NAME="Eff2">Lighting</A></H2></FONT>

<P>Natural lighting reduces electrical lighting needs by as much as 80%</P>

<P>The use of high-efficiency T-8 fluorescent lamps, electronic ballasts,
daylighting systems, and light and occupancy sensors reduces electrical energy
requirements for ambient and task lighting by 47%. Reducing the use of
electrical lighting and heat-emitting lamps also decreases the cooling load
during the summer months. This savings is partially offset by a slight increase
in heating load during winter months, due to the absence of waste heat from
traditional lighting.</P>



<P>Additional monitoring points were added to the equipment to again measure
the energy performance of the units. The Desiccant System uses two packaged
units
containing a desiccant and thermal wheel to condition the outside air
temperature and humidity to meet comfort conditions inside the building. The
space served by these units contains a small kitchen. The desiccant units
control the humidity in the space and allow the dry-bulb supply-air temperature
to rise above the traditional 55F DB when it is not required.</P>

<P>The units use a gas-fired hydronic heater to regenerate the desiccant and to
provide space heating. The result is a unit that primarily consumes gas to
provide heating and cooling, making it extremely cost-effective during the
summer months, when electricity typically is most expensive. The main HVAC
system consists of a 90-ton central plant (three 30-ton, gas-fired,
double-effect chillers/heaters connected in parallel) serving two main air
handlers.</P>

<P>The air distribution system consists of a variable air volume (VAV) system
using VFCs
on the main supply fans and VAV boxes with hot water-reheat controlling the air
flow to each zone. Both air-handling units use two exhaust air fans along with
motorized exhaust, return and outside air dampers to facilitate the economizer
cycles. The central plant is a four-pipe system with the chiller/heater units
using three-way changeover valves to supply chilled water to cooling coils
located in the air-handling units and hot water to 
the VAV boxes.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Daylighting and Building Orientation.</H3></FONT>

<P>Maximum use of "free" natural light reduces the need for energy-intensive
electrical lighting. Daylighting techniques and proper building orientation
allow for considerable mechanical system downsizing. Although the former
building's orientation limited solar benefits, the design team worked closely
with mechanical engineers to optimize the solar orientation of the second-story
addition in order to cut electrical lighting needs.</P>

<P>During full sunny days, natural lighting from the second story reduces
electrical lighting needs by as much as 80%. Lighting usage prior to the
building's redesign was above 1.7 watts per square foot. Daylighting and
advanced lighting techniques decrease lighting requirements by 40%, to just
under one watt per square foot.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Skylights (So-Luminaire Active Daylighting Systems).
</H3></FONT>

<P>Three skylights in the main <A HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A> first-floor
corridor incorporate a
sun-tracking system that uses mirrors, reflective light ducts and efficient
diffusing lenses to create a technologically advanced interior lighting system
for daytime use. One So-Luminaire skylight can eliminate the use of over two
million watt-hours of electric lighting per year. The skylights pay for
themselves through energy cost savings after two to five years. </P>

<P>Kalwall Translucent Clerestory. Translucent window wall sections are
strategically placed to allow natural daylight to saturate interior spaces,
providing a soft ambient light while minimizing heat transfer and loss. </P>

<P>T-8 Fluorescent Lamps and Electronic Ballasts. T-8 fluorescent lamps and
electronic ballasts provide most of the ambient and task lighting in the ERC.
T-8 lamps are 25% more efficient than standard T-12 fluorescent lamps. Their
one-inch diameter allows for the design of smaller, more compact fixtures with
improved photometrics. Electronic ballasts increase lamp life and reduce heat
normally generated by magnetic ballasts, ultimately lowering air conditioning
needs and energy bills.</P>

<P>Occupancy and Light Sensor Controls. Occupancy and light sensors are used
throughout the <A HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A>. The sensors have a
significant impact on energy savings,
estimated between 35 and 60%. Infrared occupancy (motion) sensors, which switch
the lights on and off, are installed in most interior spaces of the <A
HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A>.</P>

<P>In addition, in rooms with windows, light sensors continuously adjust the
amount of electrical lighting used, depending on natural light levels. Through
energy savings, occupancy and light sensors have a payback of one to three
years. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<FONT COLOR="#006600"><H2><A NAME="Eff3">Heating and Cooling
Systems</A></H2></FONT>

<P>While most buildings use only one type of heating and cooling system, the
<A HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A> uses both natural gas and electric systems
in order to maximize efficiency
and lower energy costs.</P>

<P>Use of energy-efficient design and technologies has reduced the building's
cooling energy needs by 54%. Four types of equipment - indirect/direct
evaporative cooling, desiccant units, absorption chillers/heaters and package
units - create a combined system that balances the uses of electricity and
natural gas. By controlling peak uses of both energy sources, mechanical system
sizing and energy costs are reduced.</P>

<P>The <A HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A>'s air conditioning system consists
of portions of the existing
building system, including two 30-ton and two 7.5-ton gas-fired
chillers/heaters, coupled with new equipment to meet projected needs. Using the
existing air conditioning system significantly reduced new equipment and
disposal costs. </P>

<P>Indirect/Direct Evaporative Cooling System. Indirect and direct evaporative
cooling serves the new portion of the <A HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A>'s
first floor, including the <A HREF="../tour/tour9.html">main
hall</A> and <A HREF="../tour/tour2.html">lobby</A>. Large quantities of
outside air are brought into the space due
to its high occupancy levels. Indirect/direct evaporative cooling uses a wetted
media to cool air, both directly and indirectly (using a heat exchanger). </P>

<P>Although the system operates using solely evaporative cooling for most
periods, it is connected to an electric, air-cooled condensing unit, which
allows for additional mechanical cooling during extremely hot weather. On a
seasonal basis, the system is 50% more efficient than a conventional system.
</P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Desiccant Units</P>
</H3></FONT>
<P>Two dual-wheeled desiccant cooling units have been installed in part of the
building to improve indoor air quality. These units service the <A
HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A>'s
multi-purpose room and catering kitchen. By removing moisture, the desiccant
units decrease the potential for growth of the biological contaminants which
accompany moist air. They are designed to intake 100% outdoor air when
temperature and humidity levels are appropriate.</P>

<P>While moisture removal in conventional air conditioning systems typically
requires significant energy consumption, the desiccant units reduce
conventional mechanical cooling requirements to these sections of the building
by approximately 40%.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Absorption Chillers/Heaters</H3></FONT>

<P>The <A HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A> utilizes three 30-ton natural
gas-fired, double-effect absorption
chillers/heaters to serve the majority of the existing building areas on the
first floor and the entire second story in the new Center section. These
CFC-free chillers reduce electrical demand and keep harmful ozone-depleting
substances out of the atmosphere.</P>

<P>While most electric air conditioning systems still use CFC-based
refrigerants, absorption chillers are more environmentally benign in that they
use water as the refrigerant. Absorption chillers/heaters also supply the
majority of the Center's heating needs. The chillers are piped to air-handling
units that feature outside air economizers and variable
air volume distribution.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3><P>Package Units</H3></FONT>

<P>Package units for electric cooling and gas heating serve different parts of
the Center, including the <A HREF="../tour/tour13.html">Telecommunications</A>
and <A HREF="../tour/tour3.html">Large Equipment</A> rooms. These
advanced units have a Seasonal Energy-Efficiency Rating (SEER) of 11.0,
exceeding <A HREF="http://www.energy.ca.gov/energy/">CEC</A> requirements by
10%. </P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Variable Frequency Drives</P>
</H3></FONT>
<P>All major air-handling systems in the <a HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A>
use variable frequency drive
technology to conserve energy. This feature varies the speed of the fans
depending on cooling or heating demand. Conversion from constant volume to
variable
air volume distribution (VAV) results in a 75% reduction in fan energy
requirements. Fan energy is generally the third largest energy user in
commercial buildings, behind lighting and cooling.</P>

<P>In addition, one of the drives being demonstrated is a "clean power" unit
that virtually eliminates the need for the costly electronic harmonic filter
systems typically required in data processing and other power-sensitive
operations.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Make-up Air Unit</P>
</H3></FONT>
<P>The make-up air unit (MAU) serves the large equipment demonstration area.
When the exhaust fans are working to remove heat from the equipment, the MAU
draws in outdoor air to make up exhausted air and maintain appropriate air
pressure in the room.  The unit employs a gas-fired heater and direct
evaporative cooling module, which temper the air in lieu of costly mechanical
cooling. </P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3><P>Compensating Hood</H3></FONT>

<P>A compensating hood, located in the roof above the <A
HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A>'s Catering Kitchen,
acts as a self-contained exhaust and make-up air system, reducing the amount of
electrical fan energy required to control kitchen ventilation. </P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3><P>Building Automation</H3></FONT>

<P>A computerized energy management system optimizes energy use at the <A
HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A> by
monitoring and controlling the building's heating, ventilation and air
conditioning systems through an extensive network of more than 230
data-gathering sensors. The system incorporates equipment from both the
existing building and new equipment.</P>

<P>The Center utilizes a new generation of advanced client/server technology
that brings high-end functionality to the operation and maintenance of the
Center.  With this Computerized Maintenance Management System (CMMS), the
Center's state-of-the-art equipment can perform more effectively, its operation
runs more smoothly, and it is able to maintain maximum performance and
cost-efficiency. </P>

<P>In addition, this system allows for the interaction of building engineers
and managers, in a relational database, to track and analyze equipment
availability, total equipment downtime, and operational downtime to identify
the root causes and frequency of failures and downtime. The Center's staff
manages everything from work orders and job plans to purchasing and inventory.
With this type of operation and maintenance plan, the <A
HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A> can implement sound
management principles such as Total Productive Maintenance (TPM) and Total
Quality Management (TQM). </P>

<P>The Center is able to keep and update records of all of its equipment. It
can add new pieces of equipment to the database, along with their relationship
to other equipment, and track maintenance costs, and enter and review meter
readings. In addition, the Center is able to add "as-built" computer file
drawings, pictures of equipment and a database history of all of the equipment
at the <A HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A>. </P>

<P>Preventative Maintenance (PM) Masters are used to generate work orders for
regularly performed tasks on either an elapsed-time or metered basis.
Predictive maintenance is provided through associating PM Masters with preset
alarm conditions. In addition, work orders are a central element of the
Center's operations and maintenance management system, coupled with job plans,
which are utilized as a detailed description of work to be performed on a job.
</P>

<P>Along with job plans, which typically include procedural descriptions, labor
and tools used on the job, the Computerized Maintenance Management System
details work, generates work orders, schedules work and provides a
comprehensive way of operating and maintaining the <A
HREF="../tour/index.html">Energy Resource Center</A>.</P>

<P>A computerized energy management system optimizes energy use at the
<A HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A>.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3><P>Computers</H3></FONT>

<P>All 34 <A HREF="../tour/tour6.html"> Compaq<FONT SIZE="1">(tm)</FONT>
</A>computers installed on the first floor of the ERC are "Energy
Stars." Computers designated by the <A HREF="http://www.epa.gov/">U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency</A> as
Energy Stars will switch to a low-power state when left inactive. In this state
they draw 30 watts or fewer, for a 50 to 75% reduction compared to normal power
draw. </P>

<P><A HREF="../tour/tour13.html">Video Teleconferencing</A>. The <A
HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A>'s
state-of-the-art video-teleconferencing
room dramatically demonstrates how future meetings and mini-conferences can be
easily and economically conducted over great distances, thus saving the energy
typically required for travel.</P>
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3><P>The Context</H3></FONT>
<UL>
<P><LI>Solid waste landfills. Solid waste landfills across the country are
reaching capacity and natural resources are being depleted at a rapid rate. To
reduce waste and conserve resources, the <A HREF="http://www.epa.gov/">U.S.
Environmental Protection Agency</A>
promotes the following waste management hierarchy: source reduction (decreasing
the amount of waste generated in the first place), reuse and recycling,
followed by incineration and landfilling. </P>
	
<P><LI>Waste reduction. <A HREF="http://www.ca.gov/">The State of
California</A> has called for the reduction of
waste disposal in the state by 25% by 1995 and 50% by the year 2000. Recycling
will become viable only if markets are created for end products made from
post-consumer recycled waste. </P>
	
<P><LI>Water conservation. California has experienced drought conditions for 7
of the last 20 years. In response, the <A
HREF="http://www.mwd.dst.ca.us/">Metropolitan Water District</A> cut water
deliveries by 31%, forcing local agencies to impose rationing; higher user
fees; penalties for exceeding allotments; moratoriums on new water connections,
construction and landscape uses; and ordinances requiring low-flow toilets and
fixtures in new and remodeled buildings. Due to our arid climate, expanding
population and limited water supplies, water conservation must become a way of
life for Southern Californians.</P>
	
<P><LI>Lumber use. Building construction is responsible for one-fourth of the
demand for forest resources. The use of exotic tropical timber, such as teak
and mahogany, contributes to the destruction of rain forest ecosystems, which
are disappearing at a rate of one acre every second.  Less than 1% of tropical
timber harvested in the world is certified as "sustainable." </P>
	
<P><LI>Drilling and mining. Environmental impacts from drilling and mining
include landscape destruction, toxic runoff from mines and tailing piles, and
air and water pollution from processing.</P>
</UL>
<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>The ERC Approach</H3></FONT>

<P>The <A HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A> building design approach seeks to
preserve and minimize the use of
natural resources by decreasing consumption, reusing materials, recycling,
incorporating products that contain post-consumer recycled content, and
sustainable sourcing that does not threaten fragile ecosystems. </P>

<P>Specific steps include reusing materials from the former <A
HREF="../../about/history.html">Southern California
Gas Company</A> office
building, recycling demolition waste, using recycled and reused building
materials, installing water conservation devices, and avoiding the use of
tropical hardwoods. </P>

approximately 60% of the old building materials remaining in place or removed
for storage and future reinstallation.  Reused materials from the former
building include: </P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Ceiling Tiles</H3></FONT>

<P>Between 5 and 10% of the ceiling tiles found in open office areas of the

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Uninterruptible Power System (UPS)</H3></FONT>

<P>The UPS electrical system from the former building was reused, alleviating a
$20,000 expenditure for a new system. The building's automatic transfer switch
was also reused, for a savings of $5,000. While these systems may require
overhauls, their reuse is preferable to what many view as "the easy fix" --
simply purchasing new equipment for every building remodel. </P></BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT COLOR="#006600"><H2><A NAME="Cons2">Recycling Construction and Demolition

<P>Steps were taken to reduce the amount of waste destined for local landfills
by recycling hundreds of tons of demolition material. Items separated for

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>The Context</H3></FONT>
<UL>
<LI>In 1984, the <A HREF="http://www.who.ch/">World Health Organization</A>
estimated that up to 30% of new or
renovated buildings may experience "sick building syndrome," which is a
condition of buildings with tightly sealed ventilation systems that recirculate
stale air, molds, bacteria, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) and other
pollutants.

<LI>Building material choices and system designs significantly impact indoor
air quality. Many building materials and furnishings contain formaldehyde and
other toxic substances that "off-gas" and pollute indoor air. Carpeting,
paints, finishes and furniture are potential contributors.
	
<LI>According to one study, indoor air pollution costs an estimated $60 billion
each year through reduced productivity and worker illnesses and absences.
	
<LI>Studies conducted by the <A HREF="http://www.epa.gov/">U.S. Environmental
Protection Agency</A> reveal that
the air we breathe indoors can be 100 times more polluted than outdoor air.
Americans spend over 85% of their lifetime indoors.  
	
<LI>Studies indicate that "green" buildings enhance worker productivity and
reduce absenteeism due to illness. 
</UL>
<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>The ERC Approach</H3></FONT>

<P><A HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A> building designs, systems and material
choices optimize the quality of
the indoor environment. Efforts were made to minimize the installation of
products containing toxic substances and to maximize the use of fresh air in 
energy-efficient ventilation systems. </P>

<BR> 

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT COLOR="#006600"><H2><A NAME="Air1">Establishing a Healthy
Environment</A></H2></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Goals</H3></FONT>
<P>Using a consulting firm, Healthy Buildings International, Inc. (HBI), the
<A HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A> was designed and established as a living
model of <A HREF="../../about/history.html">Southern California Gas
Company</A>'s
environmental awareness. It was therefore essential that the <A
HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A> begin
operations and remain as a healthy building - a productive and efficient place
reflecting a strong commitment in this arena.</P>

<P>HBI helped in the realization of this goal -- first, by reviewing and
evaluating the building design, including the construction materials and the
mechanical systems. Second, it developed an indoor air quality plan which
included indoor air quality commissioning guidelines to allow the establishment
of baselines for the indoor environment shortly after the building was
occupied. Finally, HBI established an indoor air quality monitoring program to
evaluate the building construction practices. This established the baselines
and has included periodic inspections to ensure that indoor air quality goals
continue to be achieved in the months and years to come.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Air Quality by Design</H3></FONT>
<P>The design outdoor air quality requirement for the <A
HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A> is 20 cubic
feet/minute/person, which is in line with <A
HREF="http://www.ashrae.org/">ASHRAE</A> Standard 62, and equates to
800 ppm carbon dioxide assuming an occupancy level of 142 square feet/person.
Consideration had been given to the different activity levels expected in the
various parts of the new complex; the three air-handling units (AHUs) serving
the building are to be equipped with carbon dioxide sensors for control of the
outside air dampers, depending on the occupancy loads in the areas served.
These sensors will be placed in the return-air ducts of these units to modulate
the outside air dampers and maintain carbon dioxide levels below 700 ppm.
Airborne particulate levels in the supply-air to the building will be
controlled by the use of 12-inch-deep box filters and 2-inch-deep pleated panel
filters in the main AHUs, with respective efficiencies of 65 and 35%, as
determined by the <A HREF="http://www.ashrae.org/">ASHRAE</A> Atmospheric Dust
Spot test. Energy-efficient
technologies used included directed evaporative cooling systems for two
AHUs.</P>

<P>Desiccant cooling systems are installed in <A
HREF="../tour/tour12.html">kitchen areas</A>, where
higher-than-normal latent heat loads are expected. These are an efficient type,
incorporating a desiccant heat recovery wheel, allowing for the economic intake
of outside air for proper ventilation.</P>

<P>Prior to occupancy, ventilation procedures were carried out to coincide with
the application of interior finishes, etc., in order to minimize the build-up
of construction pollutants.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>The Results</H3></FONT>
<P>The results of IAQ measurements over a six-week period (January through
February, 1995) confirmed that the ventilation rates were preventing any
build-up of indoor pollutants. From accompanying tables, summarizing these
results, it can be seen that RSP levels never exceeded 70 ug/m3. Carbon dioxide
levels ranged between 550 and 875 ppm before the AHUs were in operation; after
they were started, the levels were consistently between 400 and 600 ppm.</P>
<IMG SRC="./images/jpeg/rsp.jpg" HEIGHT="230" WIDTH="472" border=0
alt="graph1">
<P>After start-up of the AHUs, the temperature levels in the occupied space
ranged from 68 to 79F and relative humidity from 25 to 51%. The levels of
total VOCs showed a marked reduction after construction was finished and the
AHUs were operating. (A minor increase was noted during February, but the
levels then settled below 500 ug/m3.) Formaldehyde gas levels were never higher
than 0.044 ppm during the sampling period.</P>
<IMG SRC="./images/jpeg/voc.jpg" WIDTH="483" HEIGHT="223" border=0
alt="graph2">
<P>Further air quality measurements of these same indoor pollutants were made
during a consultant's inspection in July, 1995. Results showed that under
normal occupancy and operating conditions, all levels were well below any
suggested standards. Temperature and relative humidity readings were within the
<A HREF="http://www.ashrae.org/">ASHRAE</A>-suggested comfort ranges.</P>

<P>Pressure differential checks showed that the <A
HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A> was operating under a
positive air pressure to the outside and that the exhaust systems were
effectively ensuring air flow into toilets from the adjacent areas. Microbial
sampling from AHU internal surfaces and airborne samples from the occupied
space gave satisfactory results.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#006600"><H2><A NAME="Air2">Other Factors That Influence ERC
Indoor Air Quality</A></H2></FONT>

<P><FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Interior Paint</H3></FONT>
<P>Nontoxic paint was used in the <A HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A>. The
paint contains no petroleum
derivatives, volatile organic compounds (VOCs) or other organic solvents.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Flooring Sealers</H3></FONT>
<P> Nontoxic alternatives to urethanes, lacquers and varnishes were used on
hardwood floors, thus reducing VOC emissions which react with nitrogen oxides
and sunlight to form smog. </P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Sheet Flooring</H3></FONT>
<P>A nontoxic, durable linoleum flooring made from linseed oil is installed in
various <A HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A> spaces, including the multi-media
control room and various storage
areas. This product is made from flax, pine tree resins, wood flour, jute and
cork and does not emit dangerous gases when exposed to extreme heat. It is also
antibacterial; under laboratory conditions, linseed oil inhibits the growth of
staph and/or bacillus. Linoleum also requires less maintenance, cleaning and
buffing compared to vinyl flooring because linoleum promotes a matte finish,
while vinyl flooring promotes a gloss finish, which requires more product and
labor.  Manufacturing is environmentally friendly and requires very little
energy use. Production waste within the factory is also reused.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Carpet and Padding Adhesives</H3></FONT>
<P>A nontoxic acrylic, pressure-sensitive adhesive is used in the <A
HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A>'s carpet
and carpet padding installation. Off-gassing from traditional carpet and
construction adhesives is a major contributor to poor indoor air quality. This
product forms a tough, permanently tacky, resilient glue line that withstands
heavy traffic. </P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Tile Adhesive (3-in-1 Adhesive).</H3></FONT>
<P>The tile adhesive used in the <A HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A> is a
nontoxic, nonflammable product
containing no petroleum-based solvents. It is used to bond ceramic, vinyl,
parquet and Formica tiles.  </P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Carpet Padding</H3></FONT>
<P>Filler material on the back of the <A
HREF="http://www.ifsia.com/">Interface</A> carpet tiles installed in the
<A HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A> is treated with a broad-spectrum,
anti-microbial product called
"Intersept." Intersept inhibits the growth of bacteria and fungi, which are
major contributors to unhealthy indoor air.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Office Partition Panels</H3></FONT>
<P>The fabric covering the <A HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A> office
partition panels is also treated with the
Intersept anti-microbial agent to improve indoor air quality. </P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>HVAC System</H3></FONT>
<P>In the <A HREF="../tour/tour9.html">main hall</A>, sensors monitor carbon
dioxide levels and adjust fresh air
intake to optimize indoor air quality. In addition, periodic inspection and
maintenance of the air conditioning systems help to ensure optimal indoor air
quality. Maintenance includes adjusting outside air intake volumes, cleaning
cooling coils and drain pans, and changing air filters.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#000088"><H1>Appendix</H1></FONT> </center>
<BR> 

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT COLOR="#006600"><H2><A NAME="Post1">Cost-Effectiveness</A></H2></FONT>

<P>A common question concerning recycled buildings like the <A
HREF="../tour/index.html">ERC</A> is: "Do they
cost more?" Because every project is unique, direct comparisons to
traditionally built projects are almost impossible to achieve, according to the ERC architect, Larry Wolff, principal and
founder of Wolff/Lang/Christopher,
Architects, Inc. Detailed cost analyses for recycled buildings are difficult to
find because these methods are new. Wolff's comparison is reflected in the
<A HREF="./post.html#Post2">accompanying chart</A> in this section. Wolff uses
the fact that as a "building
type," the ERC is similar to a convention or
corporate center. He uses the
costs-per-square-foot for recently constructed convention and corporate centers
to compare results between recycled and conventional construction.</P>

<P>Estimated labor and material costs for conventional construction are
organized into a breakdown of 16 categories identified by the <A
HREF="http://www.aecinfo.com/csi/index.html">Construction
Specification Institute (CSI)</A>. For the ERC, labor and material costs resulting
from the project are organized and used for each <A
HREF="http://www.aecinfo.com/csi/index.html">CSI</A> category. For either
design or construction method, the cost analysis confirms that expenditures for
convention and corporate centers can be significant due to the amount of
special technical and interior improvements required being greater than for
traditional administrative office buildings. Facilities like the ERC include media centers, exhibition areas, laboratories, R&D space, computer centers and food service facilities.</P>

<P>Nevertheless, Wolff's findings show that the project cost for the recycled
ERC was much less than a conventionally
constructed project of a similar
nature. The data used to support these findings, according to Wolff, include
recycled building costs attributable to selective dismantling, material
sorting, recycling existing on-site materials, hauling to recycling centers,
and the use of environmentally sensitive materials, processes and
technologies.</P>

<P>Cost benefits for recycled buildings increase when consideration is given to
savings generated from avoided property acquisition/land costs and the value of
site improvements, building portions retained and the in-place utility
infrastructure. Cost benefits further accelerate when energy-efficiency
considerations are applied over the expected facility life.</P>

<P>Annual costs for operation and maintenance are just beginning to be
determined, but early commissioning evaluations (by Robert Bein, William Frost
& Associates) show equal or greater achievement of energy-efficiency goals set
for the basis of the facility's design.</P>

<P>As related in the <A HREF="./indoor.html">Indoor Air Quality</A> section,
operating and maintenance
expenses are minimized and employee productivity is advanced by the ERC's
state-of-the-art, healthy work environment. Over time, this will pay great
dividends. The facility is a productivity center for both the customers who use
it and the employees who help operate it.</P>

<BLOCKQUOTE><P>When you think of heat, what's the first thing you think of?  A
flame. 
Right.  But with catalytic infrared heating systems, a reaction occurs that
oxidizes natural gas into harmless carbon dioxide and water vapor, while at the
same time generates heat.  Because catalytic-infrared heating offers tremendous
cost-saving, environmental and operating advantages, the <A
HREF="../ercsource/ercsource.shtml"> Energy Resource Center</A>
has devoted its Large Equipment Room to showcasing and demonstrating this
flameless technology.</P>

<P><B>Catalytic Infrared Heating Systems:  Meeting the Demand For Industrial
Heating, Drying and Curing Applications</B></P>

In this room, you will learn more about the following important concepts:<BR>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
 	<LI>The catalytic-infrared heating principle
 	<LI>The features and benefits of catalytic-infrared heating systems
 	<LI>Use of modular catalytic-infrared heating systems
 	<LI>Various applications of catalytic-infrared heaters
 	<LI>Cost savings that can be realized through installation of
catalytic-infrared heating systems
</UL>

<P>To find out more about specific catalytic-infrared heating applications that
can benefit your business, ask an Energy Resource Center staff member to
arrange a demonstration addressing your business's needs.</P>
<P>The Large Equipment Room is ideal for showcasing state-of-the-art equipment
in an operating environment.</P></BLOCKQUOTE>

<P><A HREF="http://www.clix.com/">Compression Labs Inc. (CLI)</A>, San Jose,

<P>Users need not have previous experience in conducting or participating in
video conferencing. A "self-guide" user interface in the <A

<P>If you're in the food service industry, you're aware of the cooking
advantages of natural gas - faster, cheaper, easier to control. The hard part
is choosing the right cooking equipment for your operation.</P>

<P>With so many gas griddles, fryers, ovens and ranges to choose from, making
the right decision can be overwhelming. The wrong decision can be downright
expensive.</P>

<P>Fortunately, there's an easy solution. <A
HREF="./tour/tour12.html">Southern California Gas Company's FoodService
Equipment Center</A> is where we've been putting high-tech commercial
equipment to the test for more than twenty-five years. Here, at the largest

<P>No sales pressure. No obligations. No charge. Just objective test conditions
and knowledgeable food service consultants to help you find the best cooking
equipment for your specific needs. So while you conserve your energy
expenditures, we conserve your energy.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3> Food Quality. Speed. Operating Costs. Energy
Consumption.</H3></FONT>

<P>All these factors weigh on your equipment choices. And all can be accurately
evaluated through computerized monitoring at the FoodService Equipment Center.
You can measure equipment performance with our sophisticated testing system and
walk away with hard data to make your decision easier.</P>

<P>Or we can bring equipment to you. We'll measure your equipment's energy
consumption-gas or electric-and then compare its cost, speed and quality with
the trial equipment of your choice.</P>

<P>Either way, it's a one-of-a-kind test drive. You fire up the equipment and
see for yourself what happens. Your product. Your choice of equipment. Your
place or ours.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#006600"><H2> Catering to Your Kitchen</H2></FONT>

<P>Whether you dish up fast food, institutional fare, or high end cuisine, our
food service consultants cater to your cooking environment. We create
individualized demonstrations, so you can discover your own bottom-line
difference. Sometimes the differences are substantial. Other times the
differences are pennies per batch. Either way, you stand to profit.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#006600"><H2> Blow Off Steam</H2></FONT>

<P>Besides getting the latest information to help you make well-informed
purchase decisions, when you visit the <A
HREF="./tour/tour12.html">FoodService Equipment Center</A>, you also
help your equipment manufacturers. They want to know what you like and don't
like about their equipment. What you tell us, we tell them. And they
listen.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#006600"><H2> Preparing Tomorrow's Professinals</H2></FONT>

<P>More than a resource for those working in the food industry today, the
<A HREF="./tour/tour12.html">FoodService Equipment Center</A> also keeps
tomorrow's food service professionals
up-to-date on today's latest technology and tomorrow's hot ideas. Providing
this opportunity is just one more way we stay on the leading edge of
foodservice technology.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3> Helping professionals. Helping manufacturers. 
Helping students. Together, we're making the next generation of food service even better.</H3></FONT>

Let Us Make Your Equipment Decisions Easy

<P>If you smell a strong gas odor:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Don't light a match. Don't turn electrical appliances or lights on or
off and don't use the telephone in your home since these devices may produce
sparks.

	<LI>Make sure everyone gets out of the house.

	<LI>Call <A

<P>A slight gas odor near a gas appliance may mean that the pilot is out and

to relight it, or do it for you.</P>

Tips</H3></FONT>

<P>To operate efficiently and safely, your gas appliances must be kept clean
and in good working order. Improperly installed or maintained appliances may
produce carbon monoxide, a toxic gas. There are many sources of carbon
monoxide, such as automobile engines, gasoline-powered lawn mowers, charcoal
grills, and
cigarette smoke. Some of the conditions that can
cause its formation in appliances are:</P>

<UL>
	<LI>Lint or dust in the burner compartment

	<LI>Obstructed vents, exhausts or chimneys

	<LI>Ill-fitting or missing blower doors on forced-air
furnaces

	<LI>Blocked or restricted fresh air intakes or openings.
</UL>

<P>Although carbon monoxide is colorless, tasteless and odorless, exposure to
it can cause nausea, drowsiness, and other flu-like symptoms. Prolonged
exposure to high concentrations can result in death. If you suspect your
natural gas appliances are not operating properly, please have them inspected
and serviced by contacting
a qualified service provider (for example, a licensed plumber or heating
contractor) or <A
HREF="../../about/history.html">Southern
California Gas Company</A>.</P>

<LI> Until you are sure that there are no gas leaks, do not turn electrical
switches on or off, do not use the telephone, and do not use matches or
candles.

Gas Room Heaters Are
Unsafe</H3></FONT>

<P>If you use an unvented gas room heater, your family's safety is at stake.
What's more, you are violating the California Health and Safety Code.</P>

<P>These heaters are not approved for use and, if not operating correctly,
can result in an accumulation of hazardous fumes. </P>

<P>Unless such a heater has enough air from an outside vent or an open
window, all the oxygen in the room can be used up, causing illness or death.
(The air supply is used up slowly and usually goes unnoticed.)</P>

<P>Unvented gas room heaters are unsafe for other reasons, too. Because the
flames of these heaters are not fully covered, there's a real danger of
serious burns or fire from contact with flammable materials.</P>

Safety</H3></FONT>

<P>Attic insulation can help you keep your energy bills as low as possible.
However, improperly installed insulation can create a fire hazard. Therefore,
whether you are planning to install insulation or have already done so, here
are some safety measures you should check for:</P>
<UL>
<LI>Keep insulation away from all heat sources: 	furnaces, water heaters,
recessed light fixtures, fan motors, doorbell transformers, chimneys,flues
and vents. Install barriers made of non-combustible material around these
heat sources.

<LI>Keep insulation away from all bare wires or 	"knob and tube" wiring.

<LI>Keep the air supply openings to the forced-air furnace free of any
insulation.

<LI>Leave attic or eave vents uncovered.

<LI>Check your attic periodically for any movement of the insulation.

<LI>Contact a state-licensed insulation contractor if you have any questions
about proper installation.

<P>Look at the drawings of the different types of heating systems and find
the one that heats your home.</P>



	<IMG ALIGN=LEFT HEIGHT="148" WIDTH="160"
SRC="/res/existres/images/gif/floorfurn.gif">

	<B>Floor Furnace</B>
<UL>
<LI>Vacuum the floor furnace regularly to avoid lint build-up.

<LI> The grill on your floor furnace gets very hot, so keep children away
from it.

<LI> Never place rugs, furniture, or combustible items over the grill or stop
air circulation in any way. Otherwise, a fire may result.
</UL>

	<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT HEIGHT="289" WIDTH="160"
SRC="/res/existres/images/gif/wallfurn.gif">

	<B>Wall Furnace</B>
<UL>
	<LI>Clean the burner compartment of built-in vented wall furnaces once a
month during the heating season to ensure safe and efficient operation of the
burner and vent system.
</UL>

<B>Central Gravity Furnace</B>
<UL>
	<LI>Keep furnace heat registers free of lint and dust.
	<LI> Don't store items nearby which might stop the air flow. 
</UL>

<B>Central Forced-Air Heating</B>
<UL>
	<LI>Most central forced-air heaters have a filter that cleans the air
before heating and circulating it throughout the home. A clogged filter can
reduce your heater's efficiency and its ability to circulate heat.



	<LI> Check your filter once a month by holding it up to a light. If the
filter is clogged,
light will not pass through it. A clogged filter should be cleaned or
replaced.

	<LI> When installing a new or cleaned filter, be sure to reinstall the
filter access panel/door correctly. If this panel is not securely in place
before operating your furnace, you may risk personal injury or loss of life
from asphyxiation. Please refer to your owner's manual for correct panel
locations.

<td width=450><p>Our Title V Strategic Planning Seminars (which we held late last year) were well attended. In fact, the first seminar, in November, was sold out with over 100 attendees! So, we held a second seminar in December--60 more people showed up.  Since the response was so good (our audience response surveys:  65% rated it excellent; 97% good or better), we've planned more for 1996.</p>
<ul>
<li>March 21, Compliance Certification
<li>April 18, Monitoring Plans
<li>May 1, Permit Hygiene/Negotiating Permit Conditions
<li>June 16, Completing Permit Applications
</ul>
<p>The cost is $50 per workshop--with $5 off if you register more than one, and $50 off if you pre-pay and pre-register for all four workshops.</p>
<p>For information about upcoming seminars, call our Fax-On-Demand service or call (310) 803-7500 to register.</p>
<p>This seminar series focuses on required Title V compliance certification, monitoring requirements, the negotiation of advantageous permit conditions, and completion of the Title V permit application forms.  Please keep in mind, however, that each facility differs, and this seminar series provides guidance on a general level.</p>
<p>Also, each attendee receives the update to the Title V Strategic Planning Guide, a document published by The Gas Company to help our customers with Title V compliance.

<p>If you don't know already, the Internet is becoming much more than just an e-mail conduit or place to find arcane information. It's developing into a tool to help business do what the governmental, scientific, and education institutions did before the "Information Highway" became a household term.  There are already many business- and industry-related locations on the Internet, and the number is growing.</p>

<p>One of these we like is <a href="http://www.industry.net">Industry Net</a>. Its URL (uniform resource locator) is http://www.industry.net. In their own words: "Industry.Net was formed with one primary goal -- to simplify the buying and selling process. Coming from industry ourselves, we knew that the best way to do that was to bring the buyers and the sellers together in a dynamic, interactive environment."</p>

<p>"That's why we've developed 25 on-line services for industry, linking you to catalog information, brochures, product photos and news items -- effectively eliminating the need to mail costly catalogs or sift through volumes of directories."</p>

The MCS also uploads energy data daily to the GasSelect® system, which gives our transportation customers, who subscribe to this service, the ability to monitor their gas consumption and transportation imbalances.</p>

<p>Whenever malfunctions are encountered with GEMS devices that affect measurement, they are given the highest possible priority for repair. Specific problems related to GEMS device failures are generally identified within one day. If possible, we try to repair the malfunctioning GEMS device within two days.</p>

<td width=450><p>We're pleased to announce a new 10-year settlement with the El Paso Natural Gas Company that resolves the issue of unsubscribed interstate pipeline capacity costs.  The settlement was negotiated by a coalition of about 30 stakeholders, including us, other gas distribution companies, municipal utilities, and state regulatory commissions.  Most are members of the Southwest Customer Coalition that we helped form in 1994 to tackle this issue.</p>

<p>The settlement will be filed at the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission on March 15, 1996.  It was approved by the California Public Utilities Commission in February, following months of confidential negotiations.</p>

<p>The settlement provides that over the 10-year settlement period, customers will pay less than 15% of the cost of capacity turned back to the pipeline under "step-down" provisions or contract expirations. In return, they will receive 35% of the revenue, in the form of credits, that El Paso receives from selling returned capacity over eight years.</p>

<p>"The settlement also resolved several issues in El Paso's general rate case to SoCalGas' satisfaction," said Lad Lorenz, Director of Capacity and Operational Planning, ETS.  "For example, a new base reservation charge (for capacity) will be implemented this year.  It will increase at half the inflation rate in 1998-2005.  It won't reach the equivalent of the current charge until 2000," Lorenz said.</p>

<td width=450><p>The Hot Mix Asphalt Industry with help from SoCalGas (in particular, Dinah Madamba, Account Executive, and Cherif Youssef, Market Segment Analyst) has demonstrated a new burner that can reduce NOx emissions by 70%. This reduction meets the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) NOx RECLAIMs end-point requirements for the year 2003. Under RECLAIM, this industry would have also been required to install Continuous Emissions Monitors (CEMs) at a cost of about $300,000. But, since the Asphalt Industry has elected to install new burners, which achieves the NOx end-point requirement now rather than waiting until 2003, the SCAQMD agreed to waive the requirement of installing CEMs. This solution, efficient and cost saving, gives the Asphalt Industry  more business flexibility and Southern California cleaner air.</p>

<td width=450><p>Need a document from or want to send one to your Account Executive quickly? You can do it easily with e-mail across the Internet. Just attach the document to your e-mail message. Your e-mail program will handle attachments in a specific way, but generally, attachments can be any type of computer file--you just identify it to your e-mail message as an attachment.</p>

<p>One of the biggest problems weve found when sending attachments is that the recipient might have a different version of software from the one used to create the attachment (or doesnt even have the software).  Problem:  You as the recipient cant open or read the attachment.  For example, if you only have MS Word 2.0 on your computer, you wont be able to read an attachment created and formatted as a MS Word for Windows 6.0 file. Solution: make sure your AE (or anyone sending you a Word document) sends you the attachment in a format that Word 2.0 can read.</p>

<p>If you have problems sending or receiving e-mail attachments, talk to your e-mail service supplier to make sure you can accept attachments; then talk to your AE to make sure each of you are using compatible document formats.</p>

Often you need to invest a significant amount of time and effort to accurately complete all the paperwork. Even then, you never know if you've done everything correctly--until your application has been approved or denied.  PermitWorksSM, the software we created to help you complete your SCAQMD permits, is now available.</p>

<p>PermitWorksSM can complete permit applications for many types of natural gas-fired equipment in the SCAQMD, including: afterburners, boilers/process heaters, internal combustion engines, ceramic kilns, gas turbines, solution tanks, ovens (curing, drying or baking), and charbroilers. (Note:  RECLAIM and Title V facilities are subject to additional permitting requirements that are not covered by the software.)</p>

<p>The software is actually just one of a three ways-to-get-your-paperwork-done options: let us do the work, use the PermitWorksSM installed at our <a href="/erc/">Energy Resource Center</a>, or license the software to use it at your computer.  The software has many features that help you complete the paperwork, perform what-if scenarios, etc.  Ask your Account Executive for more details (or visit the PermitWorks(SM) World Wide Web site at <a href="/airqual/envsoft/permitworks.html">http://www.socalgas.com/airqual/envsoft/permitworks.html)</a>.</p>

For instance, if your contract contained an <b>automatic renewal clause</b> that required you to provide 60 days' prior written notice to cancel or renegotiate, you would only have until <b>May 31</b> to cancel or renegotiate.

<td width=450><p>SoCalGas is a member of the Coalition for Comparable Transmission (or Coalition) that opposes an electric transmission pricing plan by Californias three largest electric utilities (PG&E, SCE, & SDG&E). Their plan, advocating a "single-part access fee", is included in a proposal filed with the FERC on April 29 by the Western Power Exchange (WEPEX). The "single-part" means that the price of transmission access is the same whether the customer receives electricity from a generator located next door or one located hundreds of miles away. The Coalition represents municipal utilities, energy providers, and public interest groups.</p>

<p>The main reason for the Coalitions opposition is that the electric utilities plan does not differentiate between local and "long-distance" tranmission services. The Coalition proposes instead that electric tranmission pricing be based on "cost causation", which charges end-users for the cost of accessing transmission facilities they actually use.</p>

<p>The Coalition for Comparable Transmission (CCT) today filed its opposition to a single access fee plan for pricing electric transmission service, calling the pricing scheme "an unfair tax on all electricity delivery service" and urging the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) not to accept such a plan and instead consider a two-part pricing fee.</p>

<p>The CCT says the single access fee proposal -- submitted to the FERC by the three California investor-owned utilities that make up the Western Power Exchange (WEPEX)  -- is not sufficiently distance-sensitive and does not distinguish between local and regional transmission functions.  Transmission service is treated as a common cost to be shared by all electricity users equally, regardless of the parts of the transmission systems that are used to deliver power.</p>

<p>This violates the fundamental notions of cost causation, fairness and economic efficiency, the CCT filing states.</p>

<td width=450><p>We've all read the hype, listened to the news reports. We know there's information to be found, more than enough to read in a lifetime. The <i>big question is</i>: "How do I find the information I want?" <i>The answer</i>: Learn how to "search" the internet.</p>

<p>Just like a library, some of the internet information is indexed in specialized guides or catalogs: Yahoo or Alta Vista, each with their own particular way to search inside the index. It'll save you time in the long run if you spend some time to learn how each search tool works.</p>

<p>For example, if you're looking for current natural gas prices and search AltaVista's index for "natural gas", you'll get several thousand possible sources. Narrow the search by entering: <tt>current "natural gas" prices</tt> and ask the search tool to look for the entire phrase -- even then you'll still get plenty of possible of sources. If you're looking for a specific information, you'll probably find an index for just that information.

<p>A recent Business Week (July 29, 1996) chart showed that the most common way to find information on the WWW is through family and friends, followed by just plain browsing (or surfing) on the internet, magazines, television, and newspapers.

<td width=450><p>The company was informed in June by the National Labor Relations Board (NLRB) that a petition has been filed with the NLRB by the companys represented employees seeking a decertification election.  The company decided to support the decertification election after reviewing the difficulty the unions and their leadership have had responding to the tide of change and threats of competition.  We would like the opportunity to work directly with our employees to resolve the business challenges we face.</p>

<p>A decertification election has not yet been scheduled by the NLRB.  In the meantime, negotiations with union representatives are continuing as legally required.  We do not expect these negotiations to affect the companys ability to provide its customers with safe and reliable service.</p>

</tr>
<tr>
<td valign=top width=50></td>
<td width=450><p>Our customers have been asking for help in derating their gas-fired equipment.  We can help with our new Equipment Derating Service.</p>  

<p>Typically, equipment derating requests are related to compliance or benefits associated with air quality regulations.  Many such regulations apply only to equipment greater than a specified size. For example, each air district has an input rating threshold below which equipment doesnt need a permit.  In the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) and many other air districts, equipment below 2 MMBtu/hr rated capacity doesnt need a permit; the threshold is 1 MMBtu/hr in some other air districts.   In many cases, you  now have a choice of obtaining an air quality permit to operate your equipment as is, or--if your equipment is oversized--you can modify the equipment so its rated capacity is less than the threshold values for permitting.</p>

<p>Boilers in the SCAQMD may be a good application for derating if they are rated at slightly above 2 MMBtu/hr, in which case they are subject to emission control limits, according to SCAQMD Rule 1146.1.  Boilers below this size are exempt.  Before deciding to derate your equipment, check your fuel consumption.  Boilers using less than 18,000 therms/year only need to be tuned up twice a year, which Southern California Gas Company currently does for free.  You would also need to monitor your gas use to be sure you stay below the 18,000 therms/year consumption limit and to not risk forfeiting your exemption.</p>

<p>To take advantage of this new service, just call your Account Executive or your service technician.  Or call 1-800-GAS-2000.</p>

<td width=450><p>On July 22, we filed, with the CPUC, to have the Basic Storage Service (BSS) Program modified.  The proposed changes respond to customer needs.</p>

<p>In Advice Letter 2511, we requested the following modifications:</p>

<ul>
<li>Add a Fall storage year.There should be two open seasons per year instead of just one.  In addition to our Spring open season during March for storage year beginning April 1, we have requested a second open season to be held during the month of September  for storage year beginning October 1. (ref: Special Condition 5)
<li>· Remove the 3,300 therms per day maximum withdrawal capacity limitation.  Customers should be able to contract for as much as they need, subject to availability.  (ref. Special Condition 16)
<li>· Automatically roll over existing BSS customer's contracts to the following storage year, unless otherwise specified by the customer.  This would eliminate administrative work for customers whose operations and needs have not changed from the previous year. (ref. Special Condition 20)
</ul>
<p><font color="#ff0000"><b>Note:</b></font> Remember, these changes are PENDING and subject to a 40 day approval process at the CPUC.  The effective date for our proposed changes should be September 1, 1996, if there are no protests at the CPUC.  If you have any questions regarding the filing or about Basic Storage Service, please call your Account Executive.</p>

<td width=450><p>The Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC), along with the help of a committee of gas producers, interstate pipelines, marketers, local distribution companies, and other voluntary participants called the Gas Industry Standards Board (GISB), has developed standards for 140 critical business practices through the issuance of FERC Order 587.  The business practices, which cover nominations and confirmations, flowing gas, invoicing, capacity release, and standard mechanisms for electronic communications between the pipelines and those with whom they do business, are designed to help create an integrated gas pipeline grid to complement the deregulated market for natural gas.  With the standardization of various business practices, customers and their agents will be able to move gas supplies from wellhead to burner tip using basically the same rules.  In addition, through the use of standardized electronic communications, customers will be able to avoid using a number of different Electronic Bulletin Boards (EBBs) to schedule their gas supplies.</p>

<p>The FERC order incorporates, by reference, the 140 standard business practices developed by GISB.  SoCalGas, a strong supporter of the GISB, participated in the GISB process by having representatives on the Executive Committee and on the Business Practices Subcommittee and participated in numerous task forces that developed the standard business practices.</p>

<p>As we move from the development stage to implementation of the standards, we'll keep you informed of changes in our business processes necessary to incorporate the recommended standards.  The FERC has ordered interstate pipelines to implement the standards from April 1997 to June 1997.  Most interstate pipelines serving southern California have an implementation date of April 1997.</p>

<p>W're looking forward to providing our customers with enhancements to our business processes through adoption of the GISB standards that make gas easier to use.  If you have any questions about the standards contact your Account Executive.</p><br>

Customers then used these RFPs to solicit bids from marketers, and to evaluate and choose the best options to meet their procurement needs.</p>

<p>SoCalGas has voluntarily discontinued the program, effective August 13, 1996, in response to concerns raised by gas marketers and TURN about whether the utility should offer a marketer consulting service to its customers. SoCalGas continues to encourage customers to keep abreast of market prices of gas; however, we do not want to disturb the relationship between customers and their marketers. SoCalGas' account executives will not provide recommendations regarding specific gas pricing strategies or the choice of particular gas suppliers.</p>

<p>The California Public Utilities Commissions Division of Ratepayer Advocates (DRA) late last month issued its long-awaited report on Southern California Gas Companys (SoCalGas) Performance-Based Ratemaking (PBR) application and base margin filing.</p>

<p>The thousand-page report challenged SoCalGas base margin request--reducing it an additional $164 million beyond the $62 million reduction we had volunteered.  DRA basically supported SoCalGas proposed PBR framework, but suggested several notable changes:</p>

<ul>
<li>a higher productivity factor
<li>financial sharing with ratepayers on the upside (but solely shareholder liability for the downside)
<li>maintaining the current residential rate design
<li>more onerous customer satisfaction measurement mechanisms
<li>less flexibility for new product and service introductions
</ul>

<p>We feel we need a reasonable PBR framework and starting base margin to be able to transition successfully into a more competitive energy market.  SoCalGas rebuttal to the DRA report will be filed November 1, shortly before the start of public hearings.</p>

<p>Most businesses look forward to inspections by air quality regulators with as much enthusiasm as a trip to the dentist. Part of the trepidation comes from uncertainty about what inspectors are really looking for, and a nagging worry that your plant may have overlooked some fine points in the regulations.</p>

<p>SoCalGas can help you prepare your plant--and yourself--for an inspection.  Our "Surviving an Inspection" seminar will give you helpful information about:

<ul type="round">
<li>setting up an in-plant compliance assurance program
<li>training your employees on what should and should not be said
<li>predicting what inspectors will be looking for
<li>understanding your rights and obligations if you do receive a notice of violation.
</ul>

<p>To help make setting up your own compliance program even easier, we will provide a diskette containing summaries of South Coast Air Quality Management District rules affecting natural gas combustion, and suggested checklists to verify compliance with these rules.</p>

<p>The seminar will be held at the <a href="http://www.socalgas.com/erc/erchome.html">Energy Resource Center</a> in Downey on November 20, 1996, from 8:00 a.m. to noon.  The seminar fee is $50.  To reserve your seat, call (310) 803-7500.</p>

<td valign=top width=50></td>
<td width=450>
<p>The South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) released its draft 1997 Air Quality Management Plan (AQMP).  The AQMP outlines the SCAQMDs proposed steps over the next three years to bring southern California into attainment with air quality standards. Once the AQMP is adopted, the regulators take the sketchy control measures and develop them into actual regulations.  The control measures estimate how much emission reductions will occur and at what cost.</p>

<p>The most interesting issue for commercial and industrial businesses is a proposal to require emission reductions from small boilers--those with rated capacity below 2 MMBtu/hr. If adopted, the control measure would require an estimated 30% reduction in NOx from small boilers. This control measure applies to everything that heats water between 75,000 and 2 MMBtu/hr, including what we refer to as water heaters. The proposal may not require retrofit of existing boilers, but might only require that low NOx boilers be installed at the time of equipment purchase or replacement.</p>

<p>Other proposed controls affecting gas-fired equipment include emission reductions from char-broilers.</p>

<p>SoCalGas plans to voice objections to the proposed control measure during the AQMP process and during rule development, because we think the emissions attributed to small boilers are greatly overstated and that the cost effectiveness is vastly understated. The SCAQMD estimates that 11 tons/day of NOx are emitted from small boilers (out of about 1400 tons/day total); SoCalGas estimates 2 to 4 tons/day. The SCAQMD estimates cost effectiveness of the control measure to be $4300/ton of NOx removed; SoCalGas estimates between $16,000 and $21,000 per ton. In addition, SoCalGas feels that regulating these small boilers will be an administrative nightmare.</p>

However, the information that was to be presented is available on <a href="http://www.socalgas.com/airqual/workshops/lstworkshop.htm">Large Source Testing Workshop page</a>. The information includes two new protocols the SCAQMD has released. The two new protocols cover the source-test requirements for boliers and internal combustion engines classified as large sources. These new protocols may reduce your cost of source testing.  Please note that for customers in Cycle 1 of RECLAIM, you must complete your source testing by December 31, 1996.

<p><a href="http://www.pacent.com">Pacific Enterprises'</a> (&quot;PE&quot;) merger with <a href="http://www.enova.com">Enova Corporation</a>
and <a href="http://www.socalgas.com">Southern California Gas 
Company's</a> (&quot;SoCalGas&quot;) Performance-Based Ratemaking (&quot;PBR&quot;) application and Biennial Cost 
Allocation Proceeding (&quot;BCAP&quot;), all pending before the California Public Utilities Commission 
(&quot;CPUC&quot;), dominated discussions during SoCalGas' fourth annual Executive Forum held last week 
in Ojai, California. Surrounding this all, however, was the feeling that SoCalGas' Energy 
Transportation Services (&quot;ETS&quot;) customers have become aware and appreciative of SoCalGas 
strides to enhance its customer focus. </p>
<p>Thirty-four customers attended this year's event-- the largest turn-out in the four-year history of the 
Forum-- plus senior PE and SoCalGas executives Warren Mitchell, Debbie Reed, Eric Nelson, 
Fred John and Forum-host Lee Stewart. Customer attendees represented all ETS market 
segments, with the largest representation yet from commercial and industrial customers-- 
particularly from cogeneration and refinery customers. </p>
<p>Pacific Enterprises Chairman Bill Wood opened the Forum by outlining the recently announced 
merger with Enova Corporation. Customers probed Bill on the effects this union would have on 
pending PBR proceeding (&quot;none, since they are separate issues, although some savings realized 
from the merger ultimately will be passed along to ratepayers of the combined companies&quot;) and our 
commitment to utility customers (&quot;it will be sustained&quot;). ETS Senior Vice President Lee Stewart 
followed by emphasizing that the PE and SoCalGas visions both have customer focus as 
cornerstones, and that emphasis on the core utility business will continue being a foundation for our 
strategic direction. </p>
<p>Greg Schmid from the Institute for the Future described how the </p>
<p>emergence of sophisticated consumers who demand choice and control are driving businesses to 
forge partnerships to deliver the products and services these customers want. </p>
<p>Political observer Chuck Rund offered the November 1996 election and recent polls as evidence 
of growing levels of public dissatisfaction with institutions like business, Congress and the media. 
He warned businesses not to expect any changes in how government intrudes into business issues. </p>
<p>Over half the attendees participated in the Customer Advisory Board meeting that closed the 
Forum. Most attendees focused on questions relating to their specific rates and operating needs. 
That's why BCAP issues gathered so much attention. SoCalGas representatives outlined what's at 
stake in the pending BCAP decision: noncore rates could increase over 20% if the Organization of 
Ratepayer Advocates and Towards Utility Rate Normalization proposals are adopted in this ruling. 
Customers were encouraged to convey their opinions to CPUC commissioners and other state 
policy makers. In addition, several customers-- during a discussion on the Winter Operations 
Plan-- suggested some refinements to the undernominations plan that SoCalGas agreed to 
consider. </p>
<p>Forum discussions demonstrated that SoCalGas is moving in the direction contemplated when it 
launched these annual meetings and created the Customer Advisory Board. Both forums are 
intended to provide opportunities for customers and SoCalGas representatives to interact regularly 
and candidly on critical issues. Within this environment exist opportunities to build business 
relationships that benefit all parties. </p>

<p>If you are a transportation customer, then last month you received a letter from SoCalGas about 
the possibility of undernomination events on our system this fall and winter. Please call your 
Account Executive immediately if your facility representative did not receive this letter.</p>
<p>We hope the following information about Undernomination notification and daily balancing 
nomination requirements is helpful for you and your gas nominator (gas marketer or agent), who 
will also receive this information.</p>
<p>When storage levels are low and risk of an Undernomination condition is high, SoCalGas will 
provide notice on GasSelect&#174; 3 to 5 days before an event is called. This should give nominators 
adequate time to prepare to procure additional gas supplies. If an event is called, then the following 
occurs. All times are Pacific Standard Time.</p>
<p><u>Day 1 - Forty-eight (48) Hours Before the Undernomination Event</u></p>
<p>SoCalGas places a notice on GasSelect&#174; by approximately 10:45 a.m., declaring an 
Undernomination event beginning in two days. Nomination revisions are due to SoCalGas within 
two (2) hours from the time the GasSelect&#174; notice is posted. If nominators desire to move gas 
from the PG&amp;E system to SoCalGas, the PG&amp;E nomination deadline is 11:00 a.m. SoCalGas&#146; 
nomination deadline to PG&amp;E as an interconnecting pipeline is 1:00 p.m. Both your nominator and 
SoCalGas will have approximately 15 minutes each to make revisions to the PG&amp;E Day 1 
nominations. This is why making prior arrangements for additional gas supplies is important. The 
nomination deadline to El Paso Pipeline (El Paso) is 3:00 p.m. for shippers and interconnecting 
pipelines. SoCalGas will accept late nominations to the extent possible to accommodate the later El 
Paso deadline.</p>
<p><u>Day 2 - Twenty-four (24) Hours Before the Undernomination Event</u></p>
<p>Day 2 nominations are available for additional gas supplies to enter the SoCalGas system and are 
due to PG&amp;E by 9:00 a.m. El Paso nominations for Day 2 are due by 10:00 a.m. In order for 
SoCalGas to send interconnection nominations to PG&amp;E and El Paso, we will need your 
nomination changes at least thirty (30) minutes prior to the above deadlines (or by 8:30 and 9:30 
a.m., respectively).</p>
<p><u>Day 3 - Gas Flow During An Undernomination Event Day</u></p>
<p>Nominations for flow day diversions (rerouting of flowing gas) are due to SoCalGas by 1:00 p.m. 
Nominations for flow day diversions are due to El Paso by 2:00 p.m. SoCalGas will notify 
nominators via GasSelect&#174; when Undernomination conditions end.</p>
<p>If you or your marketer/agent desire to move gas supplies from other interconnecting pipelines, than 
those mentioned above, or have any other questions please call your SoCalGas Account Executive.

<td valign=top width=50></td>
<td width=450><p>On November 13, 1996, the Federal Energy Regulatory Commission (FERC) issued an "Order Directing Amendments to Proposals to Restructure the Pennsylvania-New Jersey-Maryland (PJM) Interconnection and Providing Guidance."  The Order specifically highlighted the shortcomings contained in the two separate filings made by nine of the ten PJM pool members called the Supporting Companies and the tenth member, PECO Energy Company, on the creation of an independent service organization (ISO) and transmission pricing.  On page 44, FERC addresses the issue of cost shifting:  "The zonal feature of the Supporting Companies proposal appears to be one acceptable way to mitigate cost shifts.  However, ultimately the Supporting Companies should provide for a transition over a reasonable time to more appropriate pricing, for example, rates based on electrical characteristics and power flows instead of corporate boundaries."</p>

<p><font color="#0000ff">The transmission pricing proposal we put forth to have the generator pay for regional transmission facilities is consistent with FERCs desire for a flow based method for dealing with (avoiding) cost shifts.</font></p>

<p>On page 50, FERC states its preference that transmission users should face the long-run costs of transmission and these rates should not distort short-run dispatch and consumption decisions.  "We are sympathetic to the view that over the long run transmission costs increase with distance, and that transmission users over the long run should face the real long-run costs of transmission.  We also are sympathetic to the view that rates should recover prudently-incurred sunk costs in a way that does not distort short-run dispatch and consumption decisions."</p>

<p><font color="#0000ff">The pricing proposal we put forth allocates the fixed costs of regional transmission facilities to generators on a MW miles basis.  The regional access fee reflects the distance based allocation of fixed costs.  Since the regional access fee is not collected on a volumetric basis, it does not directly impact dispatch and consumption decisions.</font></p>

<td width=450><p>Natural gas prices have increased as a result of suppliers anticipation colder weather coupled with very low storage inventory levels throughout the nation.  These two factors have increased gas prices, compared to prices last winter.  For Core Subscription customers, the WACOG has increased 250% since October (reflecting the increase in the market cost of gas).  Transportation customers have seen similar price increases if their gas supply contract are tied to market indices.</p>

<p>The November San Juan and Permian basin prices were $2.45 and $2.48 per MMBtu, respectively, as compared to December prices of $3.55 and $3.59 per MMBtu.  The probability of strong natural gas prices through the winter period looks likely, but, of course, this will depend on weather conditions and overall demand.</p>

<BLOCKQUOTE>
<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>The Southern
California Gas Company has published
this 
pamphlet to help you understand the air quality regulations for boilers in the
South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD).</H3></FONT>

This pamphlet is divided into six sections for your easy reference:<BR>
<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>The SCAQMD's Boundaries
	<LI>Permitting a New Boiler
	<LI>Rule Compliance for Existing Boilers
	<LI>How Can Boiler Emissions Be Reduced?
	<LI>How Much Do the Permits Cost?
	<LI>How Do I Start the Compliance Process?
</UL>

<P><B>What size boiler requires a permit?</B></P>
<P>Anyone wishing to install a new boiler with rated heat input of greater than
2 MMBtu/hr must apply for a permit from the SCAQMD before installation (see map
for area boundaries). </P>

<P><B>How do I get a permit?</B></P>
<P>Permit application packages are available from the SCAQMD, (909)396-2468. If
you need assistance, contact your equipment supplier, an environmental
consultant or your local Gas Company representative. </P>

<P><B>What emission limits will I have to meet?</B></P>
<P>For most new boilers the limit is 30 ppm NOx.  However,
emission limits for new equipment are regularly updated to reflect the latest
in control technology. Check with the SCAQMD for the latest limit. </P>

<P><B>What strategies should I use to obtain a permit?</B></P>
<OL>
<LI>Don't oversize.<BR>
<P>	Correctly sized equipment will have lower permitting
costs, lower emission control costs and will operate with greater efficiency.
</P>
<LI>Buy low NOx equipment.<BR>
<P>	Specify the lowest emission, highest efficiency equipment
economically available. It is much less expensive to reduce emissions before
installation than after, and it is easier to obtain a permit for the lowest
emissions equipment.</P>
<LI>Shop around.<BR>
<P>	Many equipment manufacturers are offering low NOx
equipment today, and many more models are being released every year. Call your
local Gas Company representative for a list of low NOx   boiler
manufacturers.</P>
<LI>Insist on a NOx guarantee. <BR>
<P>	Most boiler manufacturers will guarantee NOx emission
values before purchase. Since you are required to guarantee the emissions to
the SCAQMD, you should expect the same from your equipment vendor. </P>
<LI>Know the system.<BR>
<P>	The SCAQMD has 30 days to tell you if your application is complete and
another 180 days to make a decision on issuing your permit. Find out which
engineer at the SCAQMD has been assigned your permit and call regularly to find
out about its progress. </P>
<LI>Ask for assistance. <BR>
<P>	If you need help on any part of the permit process, you can call the SCAQMD
at (909)396-2468, or contact your Gas Company representative for a list of
environmental consultants. </P>

<LI>Call on us!<BR>
<P>	If you have any questions, you can call your Gas Company representative, or
you can call Southern California Gas Company's Air Quality AnswerLine at
1-800-GAS-2000.</P>
</OL>

<P><B>What size boiler requires a permit?</B></P>
<P>All boilers with rated heat input of greater than 2 MMBtu/hr must have an
air quality permit. </P>

<P><B>How do I get a permit?</B></P>
<P>Permit application packages are available from the SCAQMD, (909)396-2468.
The information you will need to complete the application is fairly simple:</P>
	


<BLOCKQUOTE>Company name and address<BR>
Boiler manufacturer and model number <BR>
Boiler rating and description<BR>
Fuel types used<BR>
Hours of operation<BR>
Drawing or sketches of your facility and boiler<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>

	
<P>If you need assistance, contact an environmental consultant,
your local Gas Company representative, or <a
href="../../about/history.html">Southern California Gas Company's</a> Air
Quality
AnswerLine at 1-800-GAS-2000.</P>

<P><B>What are the emission requirements for my boiler?</B></P>
<P>If your boiler has a maximum heat input greater than 2 MMBtu/hr, you are
subject to NOx emission limits under Rules 1146 and 1146.1. If your boiler has
a maximum heat input of less than or equal to 2 MMBtu/hr, you are not subject
to these emission limits. You can call the SCAQMD at (909)396-2468 for a copy
of each rule.</P>

<P>There are several methods available to reduce your boiler's NOx emissions.
Two of the most economical methods are discussed below:</P>
<IMG WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="130"
SRC="/clients/socal/airqual/images/jpeg/fluegas.jpg" ALT="recirculatin
illustration" ALIGN=RIGHT>
<B>Flue Gas Recirculation (FGR)</B><BR>
<P>FGR is the relatively simple process of recirculating a portion of the gas
exhaust back to the air intake of the boiler.  Depending on the design of your
boiler, FGR may utilize the existing burner and fan. In other applications, a
new burner, an auxiliary fan and
additional controls will be necessary.</P>
<BR>

SRC="/clients/socal/airqual/images/jpeg/noxburn.jpg" ALT="burner illustration"
ALIGN=LEFT>
<B>Low NOx Burners (LNB)</B><BR>
<P>Many manufacturers offer a wide range of LNB. Some utilize radiant heat,
others rely on staged fuel, staged air or internal FGR. These burners are
designed to replace existing burners and often result in improved operating
efficiencies.</P>

<P>Permit fees are based on the rated capacity of your boiler as shown
below:*</P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Permitting a New Engine</H3></FONT>

<P><B>Why do I need an air quality permit for my new engine? </B></P>
<P>Any stationary equipment that burns fossil fuels, including natural gas,
emits air contaminants.  The SCAQMD is responsible for regulating stationary
equipment that
emit these air contaminants.  One way this organization regulates equipment is
by requiring that certain stationary equipment have a Permit to Operate.</P>

<P><B>What size engine requires a Permit to Operate?</B></P>
<P>Anyone planning to install a new gas engine rated > 50 HP must apply for a
permit from the SCAQMD before installation.  Engines used to pump water
exclusively for agricultural operations are exempt from the permit process.</P>

<P><B>What do I need to provide the SCAQMD to obtain a permit?</B></P>
<P>To obtain a Permit to Operate you need to provide the SCAQMD with the
following:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Business name and address
	<LI>Engine manufacturer and model number
	<LI>Engine rating and description
	<LI>Fuel types used
	<LI>Hours of operation
	<LI>Emission control equipment manufacturer and model number
	<LI>Drawings and sketches of your facility, engine, and emission control
system
	<LI>Calculation of criteria and toxic pollutant emissions
	<LI>Proof of compliance with SCAQMD New Source Review regulations (BACT)
	<LI>Proof of compliance with SCAQMD Air Toxics regulations
	<LI>Completed SCAQMD forms 400A, 400T, and 400C-28
	<LI>A check to cover the cost of reviewing your application
</UL>

<P>There are many people ready to help you through this process.  If you need
assistance, you can contact your Gas Company Account Executive, The Gas
Company's Air Quality AnswerLine at 1-800-GAS-2000, or you can contact an
environmental consultant.</P>

<P><B>Isn't the Best Available Control Technology (BACT) 
for prime mover applications an electric motor?</B></P>
<P>No!  The SCAQMD recently adopted new BACT emission levels for internal
combustion engines.  These levels are values that the SCAQMD considers
equivalent to those emissions associated with an electric motor.  (Note: BACT
is defined as the most stringent emission control that is considered
technologically feasible or has been demonstrated on similar equipment.  BACT
can also include process equipment alternatives and/or clean fuel usage
requirements.)</P>
 
<P><B>What emission limits will my new engine have to meet?</B></P>
<P>The SCAQMD recently set the standards for new internal combustion engines to
the following levels:</P>

Nitrogen Oxides (NOx):  0.15 gm/BHP-hr	<BR>
Carbon Monoxides (CO):  0.60 gm/BHP-hr		<BR>
Non-Methane Hydrocarbons (NMHC):  0.15 gm/BHP-hr<BR>

<P><B>How can an engine meet these standards?</B></P>
<P>The easiest and least expensive way to meet these new standards is to
install a rich burn engine with a nonselective catalytic reduction system
(NSCR).  NSCR is similar to the emission control system in your automobile. For
more information on emission control systems, please see the section titled
"How Can Engine Emissions Be Reduced?"</P>


<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Rule Compliance for Existing Engines</H3></FONT>

<P><B>What SCAQMD rules target engines?</B></P>
<P>SCAQMD Rules 1110.1 and 1110.2 regulate emissions from internal combustion
engines.</P>

<P><B>What size engine must comply with these rules?</B></P>
<P>All stationary engines with a rated capacity > 50 HP and portable engines
larger than 100 HP must comply with this rule.  Engines used for agricultural
water pumping are exempt. Also, stand-by engines operating less than 200 hours
per year are exempt.</P>

<P><B>What are the compliance deadlines?</B></P>
<P>For engines that did not have NOx controls in 1990:</P>

the SCAQMD for the time you have been out of compliance. If you are considering
this option, please contact your Gas Company representative as soon as
possible.</P>

<P><B>How Can Engine Emissions Be Reduced?</B></P>
<P>There are two methods available to reduce your engine's emissions.  Both
methods involve installing catalytic control devices on your engine.</P>

<P>Non-Selective Catalytic Reduction (NSCR):  NSCR is similar to the emission
control system in your automobile.  It can be applied to any rich-burn engine. 
The catalyst in the NSCR reacts with carbon monoxide and NOx to
produce nitrogen, oxygen and CO2.  For optimum catalyst
efficiency, the engine is required to run "fuel rich." To maintain the proper
exhaust gas mixture that ensures the required reaction over various
engine-operating loads, an air-fuel ratio controller is necessary.  Currently
there are several NSCR emission control systems that can meet the new BACT
emission levels.</P>

<P>Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR):  SCR can be applied to any lean burn
engine.  It differs from NSCR in that ammonia is injected into the engine's
exhaust stream.  The ammonia reacts with NOx in the catalyst to form water and
nitrogen.  Since ammonia is used in this process, an Environmental Impact
Report may have to be prepared.</P>
<P><B>How Much Do the Permits Cost?</B></P>
<P>Permit fees are based on the size of your engine as shown below.** </P>

Alteration/Modification Permit Fee<BR>
All non-emergency engines 50 to 500 HP	$575<BR>
All non-emergency engines > 500 HP	$1,172<BR>
<BR>
Permit Processing Fees for New Engines<BR>
All non-emergency engines 50 to 500 HP	$730<BR>
All non-emergency engines > 500 HP	$1,878<BR>


<P><B>How Do I Start the Compliance Process?</B></P>
<P>Shop around. Conduct a survey of available emission-control options or hire
a consultant to do it for you.  There are currently many emission-control
equipment vendors, so competition is strong.  Contact your Gas Company Account
Executive, or the Air Quality AnswerLine, to obtain a list of emission-control
equipment vendors.</P>

<P>Insist on a NOx guarantee. Most reputable engine vendors will guarantee NOx
emission values before you purchase your emission-control system.  Since you
are required to guarantee the emissions to the SCAQMD, you should expect the
same from your equipment vendor.</P>

<P>Know the system. The SCAQMD has 30 days to tell you if your application is
complete, and another 180 days to make a decision on issuing your permit.  Find
out which engineer at the SCAQMD has been assigned your permit and call
regularly for information about its progress.</P>

<P>Ask for assistance. If you need help on any part of the permit process, you
can call Southern California Gas Company's Air Quality AnswerLine at
1-800-GAS-2000 or the
SCAQMD at 909-396-2468.</P>

        <FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>How to Estimate Potential Gas Cost Savings</H3></FONT>
        <BR>
</center>

<p>
Customers who choose to receive procurement service from SoCalGas pay for gas based on a 30-day forecast of gas commodity prices.  SoCalGas passes through the cost of gas to our procurement service customers.  This forecast is adjusted monthly to "true up" the difference between forecasted and actual gas costs for the previous month.  SoCalGas adds a California Public Utilities Commission-mandated brokerage fee of 0.1 &#162 per therm.  Customers who buy their gas from SoCalGas also pay an incremental interstate pipeline demand charge (for access to the San Juan Basin) of 0.212 &#162 per therm.  
  </p>
<p>
Each month, SoCalGasí actual weighted average cost of gas (WACOG) for the current month appears on the gas bill.  This can be used to estimate the savings, if any, from purchasing gas from an aggregator for a given month.
  </p>
<p>
To calculate the monthy savings, complete the <font color="#000088"><b>blue</b></font> bordered areas (also designated by a <b>*</b>).  Use the tab key to move between fields and to activate the calculator.  Please note that all data should be entered in cents/therm and therms.  (The total estimated savings have been converted to dollars.)

<A NAME=NEW><FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Permitting a New Boiler</H3></FONT></A>

<P><B>What size boiler requires a permit?</B></P>
<P>Anyone wishing to install a new boiler with rated heat input of greater than
2 MMBtu/hr must apply for a permit from the SCAQMD before installation (see map
for area boundaries). </P>

<P><B>How do I get a permit?</B></P>
<P>Permit application packages are available from the SCAQMD, (909)396-2468. If
you need assistance, contact your equipment supplier, an environmental
consultant or your local Gas Company representative. </P>

<P><B>What emission limits will I have to meet?</B></P>
<P>For most new boilers the limit is 30 ppm NOx.  However,
emission limits for new equipment are regularly updated to reflect the latest
in control technology. Check with the SCAQMD for the latest limit. </P>

<P><B>What strategies should I use to obtain a permit?</B></P>
<OL>
<LI>Don't oversize.<BR>
<P>	Correctly sized equipment will have lower permitting
costs, lower emission control costs and will operate with greater efficiency.
</P>
<LI>Buy low NOx equipment.<BR>
<P>	Specify the lowest emission, highest efficiency equipment
economically available. It is much less expensive to reduce emissions before
installation than after, and it is easier to obtain a permit for the lowest
emissions equipment.</P>
<LI>Shop around.<BR>
<P>	Many equipment manufacturers are offering low NOx
equipment today, and many more models are being released every year. Call your
local Gas Company representative for a list of low NOx   boiler
manufacturers.</P>
<LI>Insist on a NOx guarantee. <BR>
<P>	Most boiler manufacturers will guarantee NOx emission
values before purchase. Since you are required to guarantee the emissions to
the SCAQMD, you should expect the same from your equipment vendor. </P>
<LI>Know the system.<BR>
<P>	The SCAQMD has 30 days to tell you if your application is complete and
another 180 days to make a decision on issuing your permit. Find out which
engineer at the SCAQMD has been assigned your permit and call regularly to find
out about its progress. </P>
<LI>Ask for assistance. <BR>
<P>	If you need help on any part of the permit process, you can call the SCAQMD
at (909)396-2468, or contact your Gas Company representative for a list of
environmental consultants. </P>

<LI>Call on us!<BR>
<P>	If you have any questions, you can call your Gas Company representative, or
you can call Southern California Gas Company's <a href="/airqual/tech/tech.html">Air Quality AnswerLine</a> at
1-800-GAS-2000.</P>
</OL>


<A NAME=EXISTING><FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Rule Compliance for Existing Boilers</H3></FONT></A>

<P><B>What size boiler requires a permit?</B></P>
<P>All boilers with rated heat input of greater than 2 MMBtu/hr must have an
air quality permit. </P>

<P><B>How do I get a permit?</B></P>
<P>Permit application packages are available from the SCAQMD, (909)396-2468.
The information you will need to complete the application is fairly simple:</P>
	


<BLOCKQUOTE>Company name and address<BR>
Boiler manufacturer and model number <BR>
Boiler rating and description<BR>
Fuel types used<BR>
Hours of operation<BR>
Drawing or sketches of your facility and boiler<BR></BLOCKQUOTE>

	
<P>If you need assistance, contact an environmental consultant,
your local Gas Company representative, or Southern California Gas Company's <a href="/airqual/tech/tech.html">Air
Quality AnswerLine</a> at 1-800-GAS-2000.</P>

<P><B>What are the emission requirements for my boiler?</B></P>
<P>If your boiler has a maximum heat input greater than 2 MMBtu/hr, you are
subject to NOx emission limits under Rules 1146 and 1146.1. If your boiler has

<A NAME=REDUCE><FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>How Can Boiler Emissions Be Reduced?</H3></FONT></A>

<P>There are several methods available to reduce your boiler's NOx emissions.
Two of the most economical methods are discussed below:</P>
<IMG WIDTH="250" HEIGHT="130" SRC="/airqual/images/jpeg/fluegas.jpg" ALT="recirculatin
illustration" ALIGN=RIGHT>
<B>Flue Gas Recirculation (FGR)</B><BR>
<P>FGR is the relatively simple process of recirculating a portion of the gas
exhaust back to the air intake of the boiler.  Depending on the design of your
boiler, FGR may utilize the existing burner and fan. In other applications, a
new burner, an auxiliary fan and
additional controls will be necessary.</P>
<BR>
<IMG HEIGHT="121" WIDTH="231"
SRC="/airqual/images/jpeg/noxburn.jpg" ALT="burner illustration"
ALIGN=LEFT>
<B>Low NOx Burners (LNB)</B><BR>
<P>Many manufacturers offer a wide range of LNB. Some utilize radiant heat,
others rely on staged fuel, staged air or internal FGR. These burners are
designed to replace existing burners and often result in improved operating
efficiencies.</P>

<P>The <A HREF="../about/history.html">Southern
California Gas Company</A> has published this pamphlet to help you
understand the air quality regulations for natural gas-fired engines in the
South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD).</P>

<A NAME=NEW><FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Permitting a New Engine</H3></FONT></A>

<P><B>Why do I need an air quality permit for my new engine? </B></P>
<P>Any stationary equipment that burns fossil fuels, including natural gas,
emits air contaminants.  The SCAQMD is responsible for regulating stationary
equipment that
emit these air contaminants.  One way this organization regulates equipment is
by requiring that certain stationary equipment have a Permit to Operate.</P>

<P><B>What size engine requires a Permit to Operate?</B></P>
<P>Anyone planning to install a new gas engine rated > 50 HP must apply for a
permit from the SCAQMD before installation.  Engines used to pump water
exclusively for agricultural operations are exempt from the permit process.</P>

<P><B>What do I need to provide the SCAQMD to obtain a permit?</B></P>
<P>To obtain a Permit to Operate you need to provide the SCAQMD with the
following:</P>

<UL TYPE=DISC>
	<LI>Business name and address
	<LI>Engine manufacturer and model number
	<LI>Engine rating and description
	<LI>Fuel types used
	<LI>Hours of operation
	<LI>Emission control equipment manufacturer and model number
	<LI>Drawings and sketches of your facility, engine, and emission control
system
	<LI>Calculation of criteria and toxic pollutant emissions
	<LI>Proof of compliance with SCAQMD New Source Review regulations (BACT)
	<LI>Proof of compliance with SCAQMD Air Toxics regulations
	<LI>Completed SCAQMD forms 400A, 400T, and 400C-28
	<LI>A check to cover the cost of reviewing your application
</UL>

<P>There are many people ready to help you through this process.  If you need
assistance, you can contact your Gas Company Account Executive, Southern California Gas
Company's <a href="/airqual/tech/tech.html">Air Quality AnswerLine</a> at 1-800-GAS-2000, or you can contact an
environmental consultant.</P>

<P><B>Isn't the Best Available Control Technology (BACT) 
for prime mover applications an electric motor?</B></P>
<P>No!  The SCAQMD recently adopted new BACT emission levels for internal
combustion engines.  These levels are values that the SCAQMD considers
equivalent to those emissions associated with an electric motor.  (Note: BACT
is defined as the most stringent emission control that is considered
technologically feasible or has been demonstrated on similar equipment.  BACT
can also include process equipment alternatives and/or clean fuel usage
requirements.)</P>
 
<P><B>What emission limits will my new engine have to meet?</B></P>
<P>The SCAQMD recently set the standards for new internal combustion engines to
the following levels:</P>

Nitrogen Oxides (NOx):  0.15 gm/BHP-hr	<BR>
Carbon Monoxides (CO):  0.60 gm/BHP-hr		<BR>
Non-Methane Hydrocarbons (NMHC):  0.15 gm/BHP-hr<BR>

<P><B>How can an engine meet these standards?</B></P>
<P>The easiest and least expensive way to meet these new standards is to
install a rich burn engine with a nonselective catalytic reduction system
(NSCR).  NSCR is similar to the emission control system in your automobile. For
more information on emission control systems, please see the section titled
"How Can Engine Emissions Be Reduced?"</P>


<A NAME=EXISTING><FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Rule Compliance for Existing Engines</H3></FONT></A>

<P><B>What SCAQMD rules target engines?</B></P>
<P>SCAQMD Rules 1110.1 and 1110.2 regulate emissions from internal combustion
engines.</P>

<P><B>What size engine must comply with these rules?</B></P>
<P>All stationary engines with a rated capacity > 50 HP and portable engines
larger than 100 HP must comply with this rule.  Engines used for agricultural
water pumping are exempt. Also, stand-by engines operating less than 200 hours
per year are exempt.</P>

<P><B>What are the compliance deadlines?</B></P>
<P>For engines that did not have NOx controls in 1990:</P>

<A NAME=REDUCE><FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>How Can Engine Emissions Be Reduced?</H3></FONT></A>

<P>There are two methods available to reduce your engine's emissions.  Both
methods involve installing catalytic control devices on your engine.</P>

<P>Non-Selective Catalytic Reduction (NSCR):  NSCR is similar to the emission
control system in your automobile.  It can be applied to any rich-burn engine. 
The catalyst in the NSCR reacts with carbon monoxide and NOx to
produce nitrogen, oxygen and CO2.  For optimum catalyst
efficiency, the engine is required to run "fuel rich." To maintain the proper
exhaust gas mixture that ensures the required reaction over various
engine-operating loads, an air-fuel ratio controller is necessary.  Currently
there are several NSCR emission control systems that can meet the new BACT
emission levels.</P>

<P>Selective Catalytic Reduction (SCR):  SCR can be applied to any lean burn
engine.  It differs from NSCR in that ammonia is injected into the engine's
exhaust stream.  The ammonia reacts with NOx in the catalyst to form water and
nitrogen.  Since ammonia is used in this process, an Environmental Impact
Report may have to be prepared.</P>


<A NAME=COST><FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>How Much Do the Permits Cost?</H3></FONT></A>

<P>Permit fees are based on the size of your engine as shown below.** </P>

Alteration/Modification Permit Fee<BR>
All non-emergency engines 50 to 500 HP	$575<BR>
All non-emergency engines > 500 HP	$1,172<BR>
<BR>
Permit Processing Fees for New Engines<BR>
All non-emergency engines 50 to 500 HP	$730<BR>
All non-emergency engines > 500 HP	$1,878<BR>


<A NAME=START><FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>How Do I Start the Compliance Process?</H3></FONT></A>

<P>Shop around. Conduct a survey of available emission-control options or hire
a consultant to do it for you.  There are currently many emission-control
equipment vendors, so competition is strong.  Contact your Gas Company Account
Executive, or the <a href="/airqual/tech/tech.html">Air Quality AnswerLine</a>, 
to obtain a list of emission-control equipment vendors.</P>

<P>Insist on a NOx guarantee. Most reputable engine vendors will guarantee NOx
emission values before you purchase your emission-control system.  Since you
are required to guarantee the emissions to the SCAQMD, you should expect the
same from your equipment vendor.</P>

<P>Know the system. The SCAQMD has 30 days to tell you if your application is
complete, and another 180 days to make a decision on issuing your permit.  Find
out which engineer at the SCAQMD has been assigned your permit and call
regularly for information about its progress.</P>

<P>Ask for assistance. If you need help on any part of the permit process, you
can call Southern California Gas Company's <a href="/airqual/tech/tech.html">
Air Quality AnswerLine</a> at 1-800-GAS-2000 or the SCAQMD at 909-396-2468.</P>

<blockquote>
<font color="#880000" size="+1"><b>PermitWorks<font size="-1"><sup>(TM)</sup></font> Was Designed to Help You Breathe Easier</b></font>

<p>Permitting your equipment can be resource-intensive.  Often you need to invest a significant amount of time and effort to accurately complete all the paperwork.  Even then, you never know if you've done everything correctly--until your application has been approved or denied--relax, we can help.</p>

<font color="#880000"><h3>Types of Equipment</h3></font>
<p>PermitWorks<font size="1"><sup>(TM)</sup></font> can complete permit applications for many types of natural gas-fired equipment* in the South Coast Air Quality Management District, including:</p>

<ul>
<li>Afterburners
<li>Boilers/Process Heaters
<li>Internal Combustion Engines
<li>Ceramic Kilns
<li>Gas Turbines
<li>Solution Tanks
<li>Ovens (curing, drying or baking)
<li>Charbroilers
</ul>

<p><font size="-1">*RECLAIM and Title V facilities have additional permitting requirements that are not covered by the software.</font></p>


<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>PermitWorks<font size="-1"><sup>(TM)</sup></font> Features</H3></FONT>
<P>The first step is to enter your basic facility and equipment information.  The permitting program does the rest.  Weve linked many types of gas-fired equipment with applicable emission control equipment, and built in default emission factors to go along with them.  You can calculate emissions of criteria pollutants and air toxics using these factors, or customize the software by entering your own emission data.</P>

<P>Just press a few more keys on your keyboard, and you can find out whether you need to conduct more detailed analysis, such as air quality dispersion modeling or an air toxics health risk assessment, and tell you whether your facility requires emission offsets.</P>

<P>If you find that youd like to bring your emissions down to avoid purchasing offsets or conducting modeling or a health risk assessment, the software can help you test different operating scenarios.  You can modify your emission data or operating characteristics and see the impact on your facility emissions, as well as on your criteria pollutant or toxics screening results, with just a few keystrokes.  Once youve decided on your final operating conditions, you can print out your completed application forms and all the associated calculations.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>How PermitWorks<font size="-1"><sup>(TM)</sup></font> Can Help You</H3></FONT>
<P>Weve created three ways you can use the software to take the hassle out of permitting:</P>

<P><b>1.</b> Let us do it for you.  With our new permitting service, we can provide you with low-cost permit assistance.  All you do is provide us with the necessary facility and equipment information, and we send you back your completed permit application.  We can work with you via e-mail, fax, or in person at our Energy Resource Center.</P>

<P><b>2.</b> Take advantage of our Self-Service Permit Station.  Just make an appointment at the Energy Resource Center, and you can come in at your convenience to work on the software yourself.  Using your knowledge of permitting regulations and our easy-to-use software, you will be able to complete your permit applications quickly and inexpensively.  You can even make an appointment to meet with a SCAQMD permitting engineer while youre at the Energy Resource Center to make sure your application is complete.</P>

<p><font size="-1"><b>Note:</b> If you choose to use the self-service station or to license the program, you'll want to attend the quarterly software sessions we hold at the ERC--check <a href="http://www.socalgas.com/erc/seminars.html">schedule</a>.</font></p>

<P><b>3.</b> Take it with you.  If you prepare a lot of permit applications, you may want to license the software for use at your own office or plant.</P>

<FONT COLOR="#880000"><H3>Interested in finding out more?</H3></FONT>
<P>Come see this premier permitting tool demonstrated, and try it out yourself, at the <a href="http://www.socalgas.com/erc/ercsource/ercsource.shtml">Energy Resource Center</a>.  For more information, send us an <a href="mailto:aqservice@pacent.com">e-mail</a> (aqservice@pacent.com), call 1-800-GAS-2000, or call your account executive.</P>

<h2 align=center>
	<font color="#880000">Customers Who Use SoCalGas to Provide Their Gas Commodity Procurement Will Soon Have Monthly Pricing</font>
</h2>

Core Commercial, Core Industrial customers can choose to purchase natural gas from either an independent gas marketer or aggregator or Southern California Gas Company ("SoCalGas").  In January 1997, SoCalGas will implement a change to monthly pricing for those customers who procure gas from SoCalGas.   This means the commodity charges on your bill, if you use SoCalGas to procure gas, will reflect a 30-day forecast of our cost of gas, rather than the 12-month forecast used in the past.  The <i>monthly price</i> will also include an adjustment to reflect the difference between actual gas costs and forecasted gas costs for the previous month.
<p>
<i>Monthly pricing</i> will provide you with our "real time" gas commodity prices to make it easier for you to compare our price with the prices of independent gas marketers.  The 30-day forecast used in calculating the <i>monthly price</i> should track the actual market prices paid by SoCalGas more closely than the 12-month forecast did.
<p>
SoCalGas has a world class gas commodity procurement department.  Our <a href="/corecom/molyprice/pricechart.html">Natural Gas Price Comparison</a> charts show you just how effective we are in procuring gas at the lowest cost for our customers.  
<p>
<a href="/corecom/molyprice/pricechart.html">Natural Gas Price Comparisons</a> allow you to compare our prices to the reported average cost of gas at the California border.  These benchmarks may be useful for you in monitoring gas market conditions.  
<p>
<a href="/corecom/molyprice/estimator.html">The Monthly Savings Estimator</a> is a tool you can use to estimate your savings or losses when evaluating your gas purchase alternatives.  

<!-- COMMENT OUT UNTIL DOC IS READY -->
<!--For information on other considerations in choosing between SoCalGas and an aggregator for gas procurement, please refer to <a href="??????.html>A Consumerís Guide to the Core Aggregation Transportation Program.</a> -->

	<p><font size=+1>S</font>outhern California Gas Company is please to announce that, beginning next month, the gas commodity charges (the cost of gas) on your bill will reflect a <b>30-day forcast</b>, rather than the 12-month forecast used in the past.  We believe this change to <i><b>monthly pricing</b></i> will allow you to make more informed gas usage decisions.  <i><b>Monthly pricing</b></i> means your gas rates will now vary each month to reflect the changes of gas prices in the natural gas commodity market.  The change to <i><b>monthly pricing</b></i> was requested by Southern California Gas Company and was authorized by the California Public Utilities Commission.
	 </p>
	<p><font size=+1>I</font>n the past, Southern California Gas Company's rates were based, in part, on an estimate of our cost of gas for the year.  Although the price Southern California Gas Company paid fluctuated each month, these changes were not reflected in our monthly rates.  At the end of the year, any differences between the annual forecast and what was actually paid to our suppliers for gas were either refunded to our customers or collected in a rate adjustment over the next 12 months.
	  </p>
	<p><font size=+1>A</font>lthough the <i><b>monthly price</b></i> will still include an adjustment to reflect the difference between actual gas costs and those estimated by Southern California Gas Company each month, no additional charges will be recovered in this adjustment.  Southern California Gas Company will continue providing the same high quality procurement service with no change in charges for this service.
	  </p>
	<p><font size=+1>S</font>oCalGas' rates will now more closely reflect the current market price of gas.  Under <i><b>monthly pricing</b></i>, if market prices fall, you would receive the benefit of lower prices more quickly.  Conversely, if market prices increase, you will pay for the increase as it occurs.  Because gas price forecasts are inherently uncertain, it is not possible to predict whether <i><b>monthly pricing</b></i> will increase or decrease core gas rates in a given month; however, there will be no change in the overall recovery of gas costs by Southern California Gas Company.  Instead, only the timing of when the recovery is reflected in your rates will change.
	  </p>
	<p><font size=+1>T</font>imely information on actual gas prices allows you to make more informed gas usage decisions, which is why we are please to announce this change to <i><b>monthly pricing</b></i>.  If you have questions on <i><b>monthly pricing</b></i>, or any other issues related to your natural gas service, please call us at:,

	<p><font size=3>Seminar #1527</font></p>

	<p><em><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong></em>

	<p>At least twice a year, the federal Clean Air Act amendments require certain facilities to certify that they
	are in compliance with all applicable air quality regulations.  If you are subject to these requirements, known as
	Title V, you need to know all about this certification requirement.  This seminar will help you learn to identify
	which state, federal and local air quality regulations apply to your facility; set up an in-plant compliance
	assurance program so you can make the certification with certainty; and understand the implications of the
	certification requirement.

<p><em><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong></em></p>
<p>Even if a boiler is operating efficiently, there can be a significant amount of energy lost up the stack. In many 
cases, much of this energy can be recovered and put to use. Among the possible uses are preheating make-up 
water or preheating make-up air to improve system efficiency. Another is heating water for general use. </p>
<p>This seminar will give you the information you need to determine if this equipment will fit in your facility, and 
help you select the proper design of economizer and design the system. The seminar will also review the 
impacts of boiler economizers on plant profits and emissions, as well as the potential increase in equipment 
capacity. </p>

<p><em><strong>COURSE WORKBOOK:</strong></em></p>
<p>Each attendee will receive an information-packed course workbook designed to serve as a valuable guide not 
only during the program, but also as you apply your knowledge on the job. It contains information about 
designing and operating the compressed-air systems, as well as the necessary engineering data.</p>

<p><em><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong></em></p>
<p>This seminar will present a basic foundation for the application of natural gas engines used
as the primary power source. The presentation will provide material that can be used for virtually
all applications of natural gas engines as the prime mover in industrial, commercial, or government 
settings.</p>
<p>Electric motors are most commonly used for these applications because of ease of installation.
In many applications, natural gas engines will provide an attractive return on your investment,
compared to an electric motor. This program will show you the possible applications and how to
analyze the costs and benefits. In addition, improvements in emissions controls make it possible
to obtain a permit from the South Coast Air Quality Management District for these applications.</p>

<p><em><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong></em></p>
<p>It's just another four-letter word until you learn how to use it. Then, you'll want to shout
it out all the way to the bank. The word is: "sell!" A well-run sales effort can transform your
business by making your company less dependent on "plan and spec" work, opening doors to higher
margin projects you earn by your qualifications, and enhancing your firm's image.</p>
<p>So why do most of us want nothing to do with sales and selling? Almost everyone wants the 
success an effective sales program can offer -- provided we don't have to use manipulative, 
high-pressure sales tactics to get it. The good news is, we can -- if we adopt a professional, caring
approach to sales that focuses on listening to, addressing and anticipating our clients' real needs.</p>
<p>That's the kind of selling you'll learn in this workshop. You'll learn how to combine energy
management and a purposeful sales effort with your existing technical expertise to attain excellence
in customer service.</p>
<p>You'll return to the job prepared to organize and deliver winning sales presentations that shun
gimmicks and tricks and ready to write more persuasive project proposals. You should also be able
to better communicate benefits to clients and prospects, set achievable sales goals, add the right
kind of "value" to technology, and track company and individual sales performance.</p>

<p><em><strong>COURSE MATERIALS:</strong></em></p>
<p>Each participant will receive an information-packed workbook, as well as a copy of "The
Business of Energy Management...Doing it Right and Making Money." Both are full of checklists,
forms, illustrations and examples that will help you apply what you learn in the session.</p>

<p><em><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong></em></p>
<p>The cooling tower is a critical component of large air-conditioning systems. Its purpose
is to reject the heat that the air-conditioning processes. If this is not done, the air-conditioning
system will not operate properly. Proper operation and maintenance of the cooling tower will
improve the energy efficiency of the air-conditioning system.</p>
<p>Sand filters can be an important addition to the cooling tower system. By improving the 
cleanliness of the system, they provide energy efficiency and reduce water use and maintenance
requirements.</p>
<p>This seminar is intended to give building operators an improved understanding of the basic
design of cooling towers and the purpose of the various parts of the tower. Factors such as changing
ambient conditions, changing load conditions and the need for cold-water temeprature control affect
the manner in which a tower is operated. This will depend on the nature of the air-conditioning system,
as well as on the tower itself. The seminar will also include a description of the proper procedures
to establish an effective maintenance program for the cooling tower.</p>

<p><em><strong>BACKGROUND:</strong></em></p>
<p>In this seminar, you will learn how to use software tools to manage energy-use and cost information.
It will begin with an overview of the fundamental principles of energy use, utility pricing and 
economic analysis of energy data. Basic principles of energy accounting and analysis will be
discussed and illustrated, using a variety of energy-accounting software tools. Each participant
will receive working copies of several software tools and demonstration versions of current
energy-accounting software programs.</p>
<p>Energy accounting is an essential part of an ongoing energy management program. The federal
government recognized this by including it in the list of required topics for a "trained energy
manager" in the Energy Policy Act of 1992. With many organizations using energy-savings performance
contracting to implement energy upgrades, energy accounting is needed to document actual avoided
costs in light of changes in weather, building use, production, etc. Energy accounting software
provides the necessary tools to accomplish these functions.</p>

die-casting process, metal-melting and environmental concerns. The 
subjects covered in the die-casting process section are: </p>
<ul>
<li>Types of die-casting equipment</li>
<li>Die design</li>
<li>Rapid prototyping</li>
<li>Lubricants and release agents</li>
<li>Automation and robotics applications</li>
<li>Quality assurance</li>
<li>Related processes</li>
</ul>
<p>The section on metal-melting covers: </p>
<ul>
<li>Furnace types and selection criteria</li>
<li>Refractories</li>
<li>Charge materials</li>
<li>Dross and fluxing</li>
<li>Hydrogen absorption and degassing</li>

furnaces based on their design, burner application and energy 
efficiency. A section on applications follows, with consideration given 
to furnace atmospheres. </p>
<p>Subsequent sections describe temperature measurement and control 
and the design of piping systems. They are followed by a review of 
new and emerging technologies in heat treating and a summary of 
environmental issues pertinent to heat treaters. </p>
<p>This handbook bolsters its presentation on heat-treat furnace 
designs and applications with descriptive <a href="images/gif/Metalhea.gif">illustrations</a>. </p>

<P>All gas appliances have a main burner flame and most also have a pilot
flame. The pilot flame is large enough to ignite any vapors which come into
contact with it.</P>
<UL>
<LI>Do not install a water heater where flammable products will be stored or
used. Water heaters installed in garages should be elevated a minimum of 18"
above the floor. This will reduce, but cannot eliminate, the risk of vapors
being ignited by the main burner or pilot flame.
<IMG SRC="/res/existres/images/gif/burnguy.gif" border=0
alt="flammable vapors">
<BR>
<EM>Remember: Vapors cannot be seen. They are usually
heavier than air and can travel great distances. They
can be carried from other rooms by air currents to
the pilot and main burner flames.</EM><BR>
<BR>
</UL>
<IMG ALIGN=RIGHT WIDTH="150" HEIGHT="180"
SRC="/res/existres/images/gif/burnhand.gif" border=0 alt="feel
water temperature"><BR>
<UL>
<LI>Lower water temperatures to prevent scalding accidents. Children, the
disabled, and elderly people are particularly vulnerable to scalds. Water
temperatures over 125F can cause severe burns or even death from scalds.
Read your water heater instruction manual before setting the temperature.
Feel water temperature before bathing or showering. Temperature-limiting
valves are available - see your hot water heater owner's manual.<P>

<LI>Earthquakes can cause unsecured water heaters to move or topple. In order
to prevent movement of your water heater during an earthquake, we recommend
you strap it solidly to the wall studs.
</UL>
<P>Unsecured water heaters can move or topple during
the shaking of an
earthquake. For a fee, <A
HREF="../../about/history.html">Southern
California Gas Company</A> or a licensed contractor
or plumber
can help you anchor your water heater to the wall. However, many of our
customers enjoy the savings and personal satisfaction of doing this home
improvement project themselves.</P>

<P><A NAME="instruct">H</A>ere are directions for securing a typical water
heater.</P>

<LI>Using a felt-tip marker, mark water heater on both sides, six inches down
from the top and four inches above the thermostat control valve. Transfer
these marks horizontally across to the wall behind it.

<LI>Locate and mark the center of existing wall studs, approximately 24
inches from either side of the water heater when possible. Place marks two
inches above and below marks on wall. The 2 x 4s will be centered between
these marks.

<LI>Cut the 2 x 4s to reach across at least four existing wall studs.
Drill 5/16" holes in the 2 x 4s at 16" +/-  on center to match the center of
the wall studs marked in Step 2. See Figure 1 below. 

<LI>Holding the 2 x 4s level against the wall with the holes lined up on the
center of the wall studs, mark the wall at the center of the holes. Drill
3/16" diameter holes through the wall at the marks, approximately one inch
into the wall studs. See Figure 1 below. Note: Use caution not to drill through
electrical circuit or water pipes.

<LI>Attach 2 x 4s to the wall behind the water heater with 5/16" x 3 1/2" lag
bolts and washers, through holes drilled in the 2 x 4s, as described in Step
3. See Figure 2.

<LI>Wrap the plumbers' tape (strap) completely around the top of the water
heater with two inches of overlap and cut the strap. Make a 90 degree bend in
the
strap 1 1/4" from each end. Make bottom strap the same way.

<LI>Place the straps at the top and bottom marks on the water heater. Insert
1/4" x 1 1/2" standard bolts with washers through holes in each end of the
straps. Install nuts and tighten enough to put tension on straps. See Figure
3.

<LI>To install shelf brackets, three 3/8" holes are required. Drill or
enlarge one hole near each end of the shelf bracket and another hole 1 1/2"
+/- from the center bend. (The side with two holes will go against the 2 x
4s, and the other side will go against the straps on the water heater.)

<LI>Hold shelf bracket against 2 x 4. Slide it over until it touches the
strap on the water heater. Line up the hole in the bracket with a hole in the
strap. (You may have to slide the strap around a little.) Mark this hole.
Loosen the strap around the water heater and put a 1/4" x 3/4" bolt with
washer through the hole in the strap from the back side and through the shelf
bracket. Attach with nut and washer. Repeat for all brackets. See Figure 3.

<LI>Drill 3/16" holes into 2 x 4 through holes in shelf bracket. Install
5/16" x 1 1/2" lag bolt with washer through the end hole to attach the
bracket to the 2 x 4s. Install 5/16" x 3 1/2" lag bolt with washer through
the hole near the center bend. Repeat for all brackets. See Figure 3.

<LI>Cut four pieces of plumbers' tape (strap) approximately 24 inches
long. Hold one strap next to the water heater, with one end two to six inches
in front of the tip of the shelf bracket where it's attached to the 2 x 4.
Place the other end against the strapping on the water heater, approximately
two inches in front of the tip of the bracket. Locate and mark a matching
hole in the straps. Insert a 1/4" x 3/4" bolt from the inside of the strap
that is wrapped around the water heater and through the new bracing strap.
Attach with a nut and washer. (You will have to loosen the water heater strap
again.) Repeat this operation on the other side and snug up the water heater
strap again. Hold the loose end of the bracing strap up to the 2 x 4. Mark
and drill a 3/16" hole where the lag bolt will go. Do this in all four
locations. Then install the 5/16" x 1 1/2" lag bolts through the strap and
into the 2 x 4. Tightening the lag bolts will normally apply tension to the
bracing straps satisfactorily. If not, adjust the tension by tightening the
water heater straps as discussed in Step 7. See Figure 4.

<LI>Change semi-rigid gas connector, such as aluminum tubing. The connector
should be several inches longer than the distance between where it attaches
to the wall and
the appliance to prevent the connector from being damaged in the event of a
slight movement of the water heater.

</center>

<blockquote>
<p>The SCAQMD's two new protocols have been released.  The Gas Company and SCAQMD have jointly held one workshop (July 18, 1996) at our Energy Resource Center where these new protocols and general emission testing procedures for verifying RECLAIM Large NOx Source compliance limits were discussed</p>

<p>At the July 18th workshop, the South Coast Air Quality Management District (SCAQMD) unveiled the two new standard protocols for boilers and engines.  (These documents are available below.)   According to the SCAQMD, it is not necessary to submit test plans prior to an emission test if the permit holder follows the standard protocol.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, not all sources will be able to take advantage of the standard protocols.  Therefore, permit holders should start working with a source test contractor as soon as possible to determine their testing needs.  Considering that it takes about two months for the SCAQMD review of a non-standard protocol, and that source test contractors are expecting an end-of-the-year rush for large source testing, many Cycle 1 permit holders may be hard pressed to finish the tests by the December 31, 1996 deadline.

<p>Also included below are two presentations made during the workshop.</p>

<p><font size=-1><b>Note:</b> These documents are in Adobe Acrobat format (PDF) so you'll need the free reader to open them properly.  You can get the reader and more information about this format at <a href="http://www.adobe.com/acrobat/main.html">Adobe's Acrobat web site</a>.</font></p>

<h3>Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Canterbury's</H3><p>
<H1>Mechanical Engineering Wood Group</h1>
    
<h2>Overview</h2><p>

This group aims to <b>relate the anatomy and mechanics</b> of wood, and
to use such knowledge to <b>improve wood utilisation</b>. As well as
advancing fundamental wood science, this work has potential applications
in the fields of silviculture and wood processing.<p>

Because of New Zealand's committment to <i>Pinus radiata</i> we
inevitably find ourselves working with this species. In general however,
the work being done could be applied to other softwood species,
hardwoods, or even other plant materials, though the translation task
would become increasingly more difficult.<p>

One part of the work being undertaken centers around using mathematical
techniques, notably homogenisation and finite element methods, to
construct models capable of predicting the mechanics of wood from the
wood's structure and composition.<p>

Such models require structural, compositional and mechanical data for
their construction and verifiction. <a
href="kathrin/verifdata.htm">Work</a> is being done to obtain this
information both from the literature, and by using methods we have
developed. While the techniques being used could be applied to determine
wood parameters, and their variations, across a whole tree, or even over
a species, our focus is on obtaining a complete dataset for a small
sample, since doing so simplifies the task of correlating measured
results with model predictions.<p>

Work is also being done on cutting wood and other natural materials. In
part this involves modelling wood-tool interactions. It also includes
novel cutting techniques (high speed slicing), and using advanced
control techniques to improve existing tools (such as the bandsaw).<p>

Finally we are also concerned with making our work and its findings
available to others, industry in particular.<p>

<h1>Introduction to the BE Degree</h1>
<p>
Mechanical engineering in New Zealand has traditionally been broadly based with our graduates being employed in a diverse range of engineering activity.  The more recent trend to short term contract employment means also that many engineers may change employment from time to time, possibly into widely diverse engineering endeavours with some of these being quite specialised.
<p>
In recognising the above diverse range of educational needs, the Department attempts to provide Mechanical Engineering students with a broad based degree concentrating on fundamental concepts and basic principles over a  4 year full-time programme.  These fundamentals are taught in the first three years of the course, which comprise the Intermediate year, plus the First and Second Professional years. The final undergraduate year (Third Professional) provides for some specialisation in the student's chosen field.  
<p>
The Intermediate year may be taken at any of the recognised New Zealand universities and as a consequence, the course may vary slightly in content.  At Canterbury, Intermediate year courses comprise Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Engineering Mechanics and an optional course taken from any other discipline.  The concept of a short course from some other discipline has been included to encourage a broader interest in educational activities.
<p>
The First Professional year comprises compulsory courses which concentrate on engineering fundamentals.  These courses have received some revision over the last few years, with significant changes being made to the teaching of mathematics, and the inclusion of a course in engineering computation.  The Second and Third Professional year courses have recently been completely revised.  These courses are now divided into modules and taught 
on a half-yearly semester system.  The new course structure commenced in 1992 for the Second Professional year, and was introduced to the Third Professional year in 1993.
<p>
The principal aims of the new semester courses are:

<ol>
<li>To break away from traditional teaching methods based on copious note taking, so as to provide an incentive for students to become actively involved in the learning process.  Previous course material that was spread over 48 lectures has been reduced in content to the equivalent 36 lectures and this revised content is now taught in 24 formal lectures.  To ensure the material is adequately covered, students are now expected to spend more time engaged in guided private study.  Hence lectures, periods of private study, tutorials and laboratory work make up a course module, and each module is taught within one semester.
<li>
<li>To enable all Second and Third Professional year modules being taught by the Department to be examined on a semester basis.
<li>
<li>To increase slightly the range of courses taken in the Third Professional year, and so carry through some of the broadening aspects of the First and Second Professional year courses.
<li>
<li>To introduce in the Third Professional year a compulsory module in engineering management.  This module builds on a corresponding management course taught in the Second Professional year.  An extension of management studies at postgraduate level is available.
<li>
<li>To provide students with the option of joining an honours or a non-honours stream.  Honours stream students are expected to attempt six elective modules, compared with five for the non-honours stream.   Approximately 50% of the graduating class is awarded honours on merit, and the remainder receive pass degrees (even if they have passed six elective modules).  All students must also take five compulsory modules, including Mechanical System Design, Engineering System Study, Industrial Management and a Project equivalent to two modules.
<li>
<li>Finally the new modular courses are designed to reduce the weekly hours of study to approximately 40 hours of lecture, formal and informal study, and assignment work for the average student.
<li>
</ol>

Third professional year students are guided in their selection of elective modules into professional streams.  These streams provide a degree of specialisation considered advantageous to students seeking employment in the engineering industry.  
<p>
The current professional streams are based on:
	<p>	
Building Services Engineering
Energy Utilisation Technology
Intrumentation and Control Engineering
Manufacturing Systems Engineering
Materials Engineering
Mechanical Engineering Science
Mechanical System Design

<b><h1>Postgraduate Studies</h1></b>
<p>
<b>Programmes of Study </b><br>
The Department offers Master's and Doctoral programmes in Mechanical Engineering in addition to its undergraduate programmes. At present all ME and PhD students in the Department undertake research projects and present a thesis which is examined externally.  However, university regulations also allow ME degrees to be gained by studying advanced courses and presenting a mini thesis.  Currently there are 35 Mechanical Engineering students studying for ME or PhD degrees.
<p>
<b>The University and Department</b>  <br>
The University of Canterbury was established as a constituent college of the University of New Zealand in 1873 and has been fully autonomous since 1961. The University has approximately 9,700 full-time undergraduate students and 1,600 postgraduate students. The Engineering Faculty includes the other Engineering Departments; Civil, Electrical, Chemical, Forestry and Natural Resources. The Department of Mechanical Engineering has an academic staff of 20 and has one of the largest student enrolments (300) in Engineering. The Department also receives visiting academic staff from all parts of the world which give a truly international aspect to the Department.
<p>
<b>Location</b><br>
The  University of Canterbury is situated on a scenic campus, 5km from the centre of Christchurch, which is the largest city in the South Island of New Zealand. Christchurch has a population of 330,000, an equable climate and is situated close to the beach and is 1 hour's drive from the mountains, thus providing for a wide range of recreational activities. Christchurch has an international airport. The university district is well provided for with parks, schools, shopping and service facilities.
<p>
<b>Administration</b><br>
Current Masters students normally enrol for a Masters degree by research and thesis.  These students may take several existing courses in the final undergraduate year or a postgraduate course in another department if they are relevant to their research activity.
<p>
The University has recently instigated a system of registration and annual progress reports for Doctorate students to facilitate progress and identify weak students or stalled programmes.  The Department has extended the requirement for annual progress reports to Masters students for internal assessment of the students' progress. Students have the opportunity for paid tuition and laboratory demonstration work which is a valuable contribution to the work of the Department.

The library is linked to the data bases in the Lockheed "Dialog" network in the USA.<br>
<p>
<b>Housing</b><br>
The University has limited accommodation available for graduate students at the Ilam Flats adjacent to the campus. This is useful for new students arriving to Canterbury. Many graduate students prefer to rent private accommodation in the vicinity of the University.<br>
<p>
<b>Cost of Study</b><br>
The fee structure for students enroling in the University is available from the University Registry along with information on Partial Fee Waivers and details of enrolment.<br>
<p>
<b>Financial Aid </b><br>
Various scholarships are awarded by the University and other institutions and companies.  The amount and tenure of these awards varies from time to time and further information is available from the Registry Office.<br>
<p>
<b>Future plans</b><br>
The resulting increase in supervisory duties and administration has been responsible for a sharp rise in workload for some staff.  However, the development of masters courses has still to be undertaken to allow the Department to reach its full potential in this area.  It is envisaged that postgraduate courses would be first introduced only in the areas of strength in the Department.  A Masters degree in management which began this year within the Faculty has 4 students enroled from this Department and points the way for other Faculty initiatives in the future. The development of postgraduate courses would also promote the establishment of short courses for professional development to the engineering community.<br>
<p>
The rise in postgraduate student numbers has produced a much improved atmosphere amongst the students.  The Department wishes to encourage further the social and professional interaction of the postgraduate students amongst themselves and the staff.<br>
<p>

<b><h1>Computing Facilities </h1></b><br>
<p>
The Mechanical Engineering Department has access to a range of computing facilities to support teaching and research requirements.  These computing facilities are available from the University Computer Centre resources, the School of Engineering Computer Aided Design Facility and the Mechanical Engineering Departmental facilities.<br>
<p>
<b>Computer services centre:</b><br>
<p>
The Micro Computing Teaching facility is the first introduction to computing in the School of Engineering for undergraduates.  This system consists of a cluster of 40 386-based diskless PCs and four printers attached to Novell file servers.  It is located in the extension to the Engineering Library.  <br>
<p>
Postgraduate and staff research is supported by a range of Digital Equipment Corporation computers (VAX 7610, VAX 6410, VAX 8350, MicroVAX II) in a cluster configuration as well as a SUN SPARCserver 690.  These computers have a wide range of software packages available including higher level programming languages.  In the limited number of cases where computing requirements can not be meet from the Department's resources, Third Professional Year project students use these facilities.<br>
<p>
Computer communications within the campus is achieved via an ETHERNET local area network system; the maintenance and development of this communications system being the responsibility of the Computer Services Centre.  This network is used for computer communications within the Department as well as globally.  The centre also supports the operation of E-MAIL with CANTVA being the external contact node.<br>
<p>
Eight programmer/system analyst consultants are employed by the centre and advise on the software systems and applications packages available on the Centre's computers.  This consultancy support extends to a wide range of commonly used PC software packages.<br>
<p>
School of engineering computer-aided design facility:<br>
 <p>
The last six years has seen a commitment by the University and Faculty to the ongoing development of suites of PCs in the Engineering School to support the teaching programme.  These PCs are housed at two locations in the School.<br>
<p>
The Lower CAD suite contains 22 486/33MHz-based PCs and 4 386/33MHz-based PCs as well as a HP LaserJet III and HP 7550 plotter.  The main usage of this suite by the Department of Mechanical Engineering, is associated with the CAD software, MICROSTATION, and finite element package ALGOR.  This takes advantage of the large screen sizes and the greater computational speed of the PCs located in this suite.  The Upper CAD suite contains 16 386-based PCs and 8 286-based PCs and as with the Lower CAD suite they are connected to file-servers for the purposes of software management.  This suite gives the undergraduates access to spreadsheets, mathematical packages and wordprocessors as well as higher level programming languages.  <br>
<p>
While the primary function of these facilities is to support the formal teaching programme of the Department they can also be used by undergraduate students as a general computing facility with access to all the installed software.  Hence when there is no timetabled teaching commitment on the facilities they are used by the undergraduates for assignments and the preparation of reports and drawings. Students have twenty-four hour access to these facilities via a CARDAX system.<br>
<p>
<b>Department facilities:<br></b>
<p>
Currently the Department has several workstations and a   PC laboratory with 6 Pentiums, 7 486/50MHz and 12 486/33MHz PCs as well as a HP LaserJet II, Laserjet 4's, HP 7550 and HP DRAFTPRO for hardcopy output. <br>
<p>
A campus-wide ETHERNET and Fibreoptic network provides access to the Department's servers as well as to the central VAX and SUN clusters.  The central VAX is used to run finite element packages and to provide access to internet services such as WWW and E-MAIL.The Intergraph workstations are mainly used for three dimensional CAD applications, NC programming and finite element analysis.  <br>
<p>
The PCs are used to complement the equipment supplied by the Faculty i.e. to meet the demand for seats when teaching First and Second Professional Year students design. They support similar software to that supplied on the School of Engineering system and are linked via ETHERNET to the Faculty Novell fileservers.  Access to these computers is available to both the undergraduate and postgraduate students under similar conditions to those mentioned for the Faculty system.  The emphasis for this PC laboratory is to supply the students with access to modern PCs with range of applications software such as design, spread-sheets, mathematical application and word-processing packages appropriate to their education.<br>
<p>
<b>Software:</b><br>
<p>
Software normally available on Faculty and Mechanical Engineering Department Computers: <br>
<p>
MicroStation, Algor, Fluent/PC, FAN, Z80, SLC,<br>
Simulink, MATLAB, Quattro-PRO, Turbo Pascal, Turbo C, Watfor, WordPerfect, MS Word, Windows, Excel, Microsoft Fortran, Oracle.<br>
<p>
Additional software available in the Mechanical Department computers: <br>
<p>
ModelVue, I/EMS, I/FEM, I/NC, I/MILL, I/MAXMILL, MSC/XL, Excel,  Lusas, Ansys-PC, Oracle, Simulab, Microsoft C/C++, MasterCam, Modula 2, Quick Basic, Watcom C++, Labview.<br>
<p>
<b>Staff computing:</b><br>
<p>
Most staff members have access to a 386/486 PC to support their teaching and research needs.  These PCs are linked to the Departmental Administrative Novell fileserver and hence able to access the University ETHERNET system so that their PCs can act as a terminal to the VAX systems operated by the Computer Services Centre as well as the faculty and Departmental facilities.<br>
<p>
<b>PC purchasing policy:<br></b>
<p>
The policy of the Departmental Computer Committee when purchasing PCs is that the primary aim is to ensure the equipment and software available in the PC Laboratory is maintained at a standard equivalent to what a student would expect to encounter in progressive engineering practice. <br>
<p>
 As new equipment is introduced into the Laboratory the replaced PCs are either transferred to the studies of staff members or placed in laboratories for experimental control and data acquisition.<br>

<h1><b>Administration and Staff Development</b></h1><br>
<p>
The administration of the Department is shared by the academic staff and co-ordinated by several committees (Academic, Finance, Staffing, Laboratory, Publicity and Office) which report to the Head of Department and a small executive group.  The position of Head of Department is chosen by consent of the staff and is normally for a period of 3 or 5 years. <br>
<p>
The Department encourages personal development programmes.  The opportunity for personal development has always been one of the more positive aspects of university employment.  Within the Department of Mechanical Engineering opportunities for leave by academic staff are:-<br>
<p>
<b>Study Leave:<br></b>
<p>
Awarded by the University but subject to the merit of the proposed leave programme.  The period away from the Department varies according to the length of quantifying services (see terms of employment).  The months of December and January are expected to be included in any leave period.<br>
<p>
<b>Erskine Fellowship:<br></b>
<p>
Administered by the University and awarded on academic merit.  The grant in aid is for overseas travel and study for periods of one to three months.<br>
<p>
<b>Conference Leave:<br></b>
<p>
Awarded by the Department Executive to enable academic engineers to present research papers at national and international conferences.<br>
<p>
Leave in each of the above instances is subject to continuation of teaching duties (ie colleagues available and prepared to carry additional work load).<br>
<p>
The Department is also able to obtain two to three Visiting Erskine Fellowships each year.  These Fellowships are prestigious and adequately funded, but the award is very competitive and is decided on the academic record and research achievements of recommended applicants plus contributions to undergraduate teaching in the Department.  Erskine Fellows visit the Department for between one to three months, and have a positive influence on research, teaching and staff development.  In recent years the Department has also been privileged to have longer term visitors from Israel and China.  These visitors have funded their own visits and the Department has benefited appreciably from this additional contact.<br>

Department Safety Officer:	Mr M J Flaws	<BR>
Deputy Safety Officer:	Dr J R Pearse<BR><P>

All work places, including Education Institutions, now have to comply with the Health & Safety in Employment Act 1992, which came into effect on 1st April 1993.<P>

This Act seeks to make Health & Safety an issue in which we all have a part to play and all have responsibilities.  We are all required to ensure that what we do (or fail to do) does not cause harm to other persons or to ourselves.
As students, this will involve the following:<BR>
(a)	being aware of the hazards in the area of work;<BR>
(b)	knowing about and using any protective safety equipment provided to minimise hazards, for example safety glasses.  Such equipment MUST be used;<BR>
(c)	being aware of emergency procedures in the event of an accident in the area of work.<BR>

You must be instructed in the safe operation of equipment and processes involved in your laboratory work.  This will usually be done by the academic or technical staff concerned, or by laboratory demonstrators if appropriate.  If you are unsure at any time, you must seek help.<P>

Students must get written authority to use any items of equipment or chemicals in the Mechanical Engineering Laboratory.  Students will be given a form indicating which equipment/chemicals they are authorised to use.  A record of equipment/chemicals showing which students are trained to use them will also be kept in the laboratory.<P>

The Department has a Department Safety Officer, and a Safety Committee.  Anything related to the safety of the environment in which you work within the department should be brought to their attention.<P>

A Career in Mechanical Engineering<BR>
A Guide for 3rd/4th Formers <BR>

<STRONG>What is Engineering?<BR></STRONG>

Engineering is concerned with the production of goods and services for the world at large.  In a technological society, the engineers task is vital and the role both challenging and demanding.  Until comparatively recently, engineers made things like bridges, engines, even aeroplanes, on a trial and error basis, slowly acquiring experience.   This experience is still important, but real progress requires an understanding of the basic principles involved.  Engineers now prepare new designs using modelling techniques, actual models in some cases, but more often theoretical and computer based models.  Even so engineering is not an exact science, there are no best ways of doing anything, only better ways. <P>

A University course equips the student with the necessary skills of engineering, how to absorb and evaluate the experience of others, an understanding of the fundamental  principles, and an appreciation of modern theoretical techniques.  Above all, it helps the student to think in a certain logical way.  An engineering course is hard work and not an easy option, however it can be the grounding for a worthwhile and useful career. The number of women engineers is small but growing steadily and women are now accepted on their merits on equal terms.<P>

<STRONG>Why Mechanical Engineering?<BR></STRONG>

Modern mechanical engineering is interesting and diverse.  It covers all manner of energy utilization with minimal pollution of the environment.  It covers transport, machinery and manufacture and the efficient use of mechanisms without excessive vibrations and stresses.  It covers materials and measurement and the research, economic, social and management dimensions that support its activity.  All these aspects are coordinated through design and information technology.  The result is an attractive diversity of the profession and a wide demand for its graduates. <P>


<STRONG>Careers in Mechanical Engineering<BR></STRONG>

Most engineers choose a career in design, production, development, sales, research, management, or maintenance.  During the early years of a career, it is usual to gather experience in different fields, and organisations often make this their policy for young graduates.  There is also a wide choice of industries, each with a flavour of its own: <P>



Aerospace: aircraft, satellites<BR>
Building services: air conditioning, heating and ventilating <BR>
Communications: television, radio, telephones<BR>
Heavy manufacturing: ships, capital plant<BR>
Light manufacturing: car assembly, consumer goods, clothing <BR>
Processing: food, drugs, chemical, steel, oil<BR>
Raw materials: mining and mineral<BR>
Services: electricity, gas, water, transport<BR>

Mechanical engineering graduates are valued for their analytical skills and some have found other career outlets:<BR>

insurance assessment, inland revenue, teaching, consultancy, 
				    civil service, accountancy, technical writing, banking, industrial archaeology.<BR>

Some graduates choose to travel overseas to either gain industrial experience or to study for a higher degree in a specialised area prior to returning to New Zealand. <BR>

<hr>

 
Mechanical engineering in New Zealand has traditionally been broadly based with our graduates being employed in a diverse range of engineering activity.  The more recent trend to short term contract employment means also that many engineers may change employment from time to time, possibly into widely diverse engineering endeavours with some of these being quite specialised.<P>

In recognising the above diverse range of educational needs, the Department attempts to provide Mechanical Engineering students with a broad based degree concentrating on fundamental concepts and basic principles over a  4 year full-time programme.  These fundamentals are taught in the first three years of the course, which comprise the Intermediate year, plus the First and Second Professional years. The final undergraduate year (Third Professional) provides for some specialisation in the student's chosen field.  <P>

The Intermediate year may be taken at any of the recognised New Zealand universities and as a consequence, the course may vary slightly in content.  At Canterbury, Intermediate year courses comprise Mathematics, Physics, Chemistry, Engineering Mechanics and an optional course taken from any other discipline.  The concept of a short course from some other discipline has been included to encourage a broader interest in educational activities.<P>

The First Professional year comprises compulsory courses which concentrate on engineering fundamentals.  These courses have received some revision over the last few years, with significant changes being made to the teaching of mathematics, and the inclusion of a course in engineering computation.  The Second and Third Professional year courses have recently been completely revised.  These courses are now divided into modules and taught 
on a half-yearly semester system.  The new course structure commenced in 1992 for the Second Professional year, and was introduced to the Third Professional year in 1993.<P>

The principal aims of the new semester courses are:<P>

To break away from traditional teaching methods based on copious note taking, so as to provide an incentive for students to become actively involved in the learning process.  Previous course material that was spread over 48 lectures has been reduced in content to the equivalent 36 lectures and this revised content is now taught in 24 formal lectures.  To ensure the material is adequately covered, students are now expected to spend more time engaged in guided private study.  Hence lectures, periods of private study, tutorials and laboratory work make up a course module, and each module is taught within one semester.<P>

To enable all Second and Third Professional year modules being taught by the Department to be examined on a semester basis.  
To increase slightly the range of courses taken in the Third Professional year, and so carry through some of the broadening aspects of the First and Second Professional year courses.<P>

To introduce in the Third Professional year a compulsory module in engineering management.  This module builds on a corresponding management course taught in the Second Professional year.  An extension of management studies at postgraduate level is available.<P>

All students take five compulsory modules, including Mechanical System Design, Engineering System Study, Industrial Management and a Project equivalent to two modules. Students also choose six elective modules.<P>

Finally the new modular courses are designed to reduce the weekly hours of study to approximately 40 hours of lecture, formal and informal study, and assignment work for the average student.<P>


Third professional year students are guided in their selection of elective modules into professional streams.  These streams provide a degree of specialisation considered advantageous to students seeking employment in the engineering industry. <P> 

The current professional streams are based on:<P>
				Building Services Engineering<BR>
		Energy Utilisation Technology<BR>
		Intrumentation and Control Engineering<BR>
		Manufacturing Systems Engineering<BR>
		Materials Engineering<BR>
		Mechanical Engineering Science<BR>
		Mechanical System Design<BR>

 All items of mains electrical equipment used in the department should carry a label, usually close to the plug, indicating that they have been tested for electrical safety.  If you find any electrical equipment that does not carry such a label you should ask the technical staff in the electronics workshop to check it before it is connected to the mains supply.<P>

<hr>

 All  people who use computers for more than three hours total per day are considered at risk of getting OOS.  It is important to realise that the onset of severe OOS can occur  very quickly after the first minor pains are noticed.  It can be very disabling and recovery is very slow.  It is therefore important to adopt correct work techniques so as to prevent OOS rather than hope for a cure.  Information about OOS and appropriate keyboard and mouse techniques to prevent it are displayed in the computer laboratories.  All students should study this information and ensure they adopt safe working practices.<P>

(a)	If the fire alarm bell or siren sounds continuously, leave the building immediately in an orderly manner and assemble in the assembly area appropriate to each lecture room, laboratory or concourse.  These are designated on the Emergency sheet displayed in each room.  Obey the fire wardens (those with red arm bands and bats), and stay out of the building until a warden allows you back in.<BR>
Note:  Lifts are not to be used.<BR>
<P>
(b)	If you discover a fire, break the glass on the nearest alarm and push it, then ring 111.  Give the location of the fire as accurately as possible.  A natural reluctance to cause a disturbance upon the discovery of a fire can be a major error.
(Query: Do you know where the alarms are located?  No?  Well, find them.)<BR>
<P>
(c)	Hose reels and fire extinguishers are distributed about the buildings and may be used to try to extinguish a small fire.  To confine a fire, all doors, including smoke doors in the corridors, must be shut.	<BR>
<P>
(d)	Do not obstruct exit doors with furniture, apparatus, cycles, etc.<BR>
<P>
(e)	After evacuating the building keep well clear.<BR>

In the first and second professional years of the mechanical engineering degree, students are introduced to fundamental principles of engineering through core courses in the engineering sciences, mathematics and engineering design.  All courses are compulsory at this stage, specialisation occurring in the third professional year when students are required to select specific courses from a range of options.  
<P>
Some courses are taught during the first half of the academic year (March-June) and examined in a three week break from lectures in late June.  Others are taught in the second half of the year (July-October) or throughout the entire year and examined during a second examination period in October.  Most courses also involve a significant proportion of in-course assessment; this is particularly true of design.  The courses which must be completed in each year of study are listed below.

<STRONG>An Overview of the Structure<BR></STRONG>
Unlike the First and Second Professional year where all the courses are compulsory, the Third Professional year provides an opportunity for students to select subject options in areas of Mechanical Engineering which are of particular interest to them.  There are, however, some core Third Professional subjects which all students must take: these are discussed separately below, before the range of optional subjects offered by the Department is described, along with some suggested groupings of these options to give a specialist flavour to the mechanical degree.  In effect these groupings mean that under the Mechanical Engineering umbrella the department teaches courses that would lead to specialised degrees at some other universities.<P>

<STRONG>Honours Degree<BR></STRONG>
The Honours degree is divided into First Class; Second Class, Division I; Second Class, Division II and Third Class.  <P>

The class of Honours awarded is primarily an indication of the quality of the academic grades achieved by the student.  This is assessed by calculating each students grade point average (GPA) over the Second and Third Professional courses, with unequal weighting on the two years (20% on 2nd Pro and 80% on 3rd Pro).  All departments in the Faculty of Engineering use this same rating procedure and guidelines     <P>

<STRONG>Compulsory Subjects<BR></STRONG>
<A HREF="ENME438.htm">ENME 438</A>	Project	<BR>							
<A HREF="ENME440.htm">ENME 440	</A>Mechanical System Design		<BR>
<A HREF="ENME442.htm">ENME 442	</A>Engineering System Study		<BR>			
<A HREF="ENME450.htm">ENME 450	</A>Industrial Management		<BR>			
<P>
The subject ENME 438 is an approved project, the work of which is required to be described and presented in a written report; the project work and the report together carry the weight of two papers.  ENME 442 comprises an end-of-year five day task with no directly
associated lectures or other assessment.  While primarily a design-oriented exercise, this task is structured to encourage students to apply to a substantial engineering problem some of the course material covered in their selected options.<P>


<STRONG>Selected Subjects<BR></STRONG>
Honours degree candidates must offer a selection of six subjects from the list below.<BR>

<A HREF="ENME430.htm">ENME 430	</A>Computational Solid Mechanics					<BR>
<A HREF="ENME431.htm">ENME 431	</A>Advanced Strength of Materials		Not offered in 1996<BR>
<A HREF="ENME432.htm">ENME 432	</A>Mechanics of Vibration			<BR>	
<A HREF="ENME433.htm">ENME 433	</A>Modern Control Theory			<BR>	
<A HREF="ENME434.htm">ENME 434	</A>Applied Fluid Mechanics			<BR>			
<A HREF="ENME435.htm">ENME 435+	</A>Heat & Mass Transfer			<BR>	
<A HREF="ENME436.htm">ENME 436	</A>Advanced Manufacturing Technology		<BR>
<A HREF="ENME437.htm">ENME 437	</A>Metallurgical Engineering			<BR>				
<A HREF="ENME441.htm">ENME 441	</A>Advanced Engineering Design			<BR>		
<A HREF="ENME443.htm">ENME 443	</A>Computer Control & Instrumentation		<BR>
<A HREF="ENME445.htm">ENME 445	</A>Energy Engineering				<BR>				
<A HREF="ENME446.htm">ENME 446	</A>Manufacturing Processes			<BR>			
<A HREF="ENME447.htm">ENME 447	</A>Metallurgical Process Engineering		Not offered in 1996<BR>
<A HREF="ENME448.htm">ENME 448    </A> Special Topic (Robotics)				<BR>		
<A HREF="ENME455.htm">ENME 455+</A>	Thermal Power & Environment Eng		<BR>			
<A HREF="ENME457.htm">ENME 457	</A>Fracture Mechanics & Failure Analysis		<BR>
<A HREF="ENME467.htm">ENME 467	</A>Polymeric Ceramic & Composite Materials		<BR>	

 <BR>
Depending on timetable limitations, staff availability and on indicated student demand for each subject, not all of these options will necessarily be offered each year.  Each available optional subject is presented as a one-semester, 24-lecture module that is taught only once each year.  Particularly in the final year, spoon-feeding of all lecture material is considered inappropriate.  <P>

Accordingly, although there are only 24 actual lecture hours in each module, students are required to spend a further 12 hours of guided study on material related to but not covered in lectures, giving an overall equivalent of 36 hours of lectures per module.  As in all undergraduate courses, an overall 2:1 formula should be applied, giving an expected total time commitment of 108 hours to each Third Professional option.<P>

Subject to Departmental approval, a candidate may offer in place of up to two of the subjects listed above any two subjects from outside the Department of Mechanical Engineering, provided that the candidate satisfies the necessary prerequisites for the subject concerned.  <P>

Normally at least one of these external subjects must come from within the Faculty of Engineering.  Subjects taken from outside the Faculty must be worth at least 6 points each and not have been already credited to a degree course.<P>


<STRONG>Non-Honours Degree<BR></STRONG>
Candidates who have met all the requirements for a BE(Hons) but whose performance is not of honours standard, will be awarded the BE degree without honours.  Students who enroled in Engineering Intermediate or for a BE prior to 1996 may graduate under the 1995 regulations, which allow for a BE without honours to be awarded to candidates who have passed only five of the selected subjects listed under 5.4.4.<P>

<STRONG>Advice on SelectingAppropriate Options<P></STRONG>
Late in their Second Professional year, students are given general advice and then asked to make a tentative selection of the options they propose taking in their final year; the fine tuning of this selection is later completed during enrolment.  To some extent at least, the subjects selected should reflect a students probable (or possible) graduate mechanical engineering career, and his/her areas of interest and proficiency (as gauged from academic performance to date).  A students particular Project topic (ENME 438) is normally selected on the basis of interest and proficiency as well so that the chosen combination of optional subjects and the project topic together should represent a sensible and complementary grouping rather than being an apparently random selection of unrelated material.  A reasonable balance of load between the two semesters is also required, and this may place some restriction on freedom of choice.<P>

To guide students in their selection, the Department has identified a number of specialist streams within Mechanical Engineering; these streams are labelled below, and the core optional subjects within each stream are given.  (Most streams provide the latitude for some freedom of choice outside the core subjects.  Where course code numbers are linked by a slash, one or more could be omitted.)<P>

<P>
In the Total Heat Capacities column a flow that is loosing heat
as a negative heat capacity.   The Heat transfer is given by multiplying
the Total Heat Capacity value by the temperature difference. 
 
<P>
A negative sign in front of the Heat transfer represents that
it is heat available for transfer out of a hot stream while a
positive sign shows that the amount of heat is needed for transfer
into a cold stream.  Therefore the 80 kW available between adjusted
temperatures of 285C and 245C can be transferred to between adjusted
temperatures of 245C and 225C.  In the next interval 120kW is
needed.  As this amount is unavailable from previous temperature
differences it must be added through external heating.  This brings
the amount of heat transfer back to zero.  In the next interval
80kW is needed and so a further 80kW of external heating is required.
 For the remainder of the temperature differences no more heating
is needed and so the net heat available is summed to the final
value of 300kW.  After the final temperature difference has been
dealt with then it can be seen that 300kW of external cooling
is required.<BR>

Since the Total External Heating and Total External Cooling duties
have been calculated the only value needed to be calculated is
the Pinch Temperature.  This is calculated by inserting the Total
External Heating value <U>Above</U> the first adjusted temperature
interval and repeating the process that was used to determine
the external duties.  The pinch temperature occurs where the Carried

<P>
 This value represents the Total External Heating Duties<BR>
<BR>

<P>
It can be seen that the value that 0 kW is transferred over is
165C.  This then is the adjusted pinch point.  Finding the Pinch
Points for the Hot and Cold streams is done by simplly adding
half of the Pinch Point Temperature Difference to the Adjusted
Pinch Temperature to obtain the Upper Pinch Point.  Half the difference
is subtracted from the Adjusted Pinch Point Temperature to get
the Lower Pinch Temperature.  The upper Point corresponds to the
Hot streams and the lower point refers to the cold streams.<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>

<P>
There are 3 main rules that must be observed when designing the
optimum heat recovery system  - No heat transfer across the Pinch
as this would cause heat transfer     across a temperature differential
less than the pinch.  The pinch is     the minimum temperture
difference in the system
<P>
  - No external heating below the Pinch.
<P>
   This is because that extra heat will have to be rejected above
    the pinch, thus increasing the amount of external cooling.
<P>
  - No external cooling above the Pinch as this will increase
the     amount of external heating required.<BR>

<P>
Therefore <U><I><B>a</B></I></U> solution to the situation is
<BR>
<BR>

<BR>

<P><IMG SRC="a2.gif"><BR>
Note that in all situations the pinch point temperature difference
must be the minimum temperature difference between any hot and
cold streams.<BR>

<P>
It is important to note that in many situations there is more
than one solution but it is the Energy Manager's responsibility
to choose the solution that will give the lowest cost.  This usually
involves the least number of Heat Exchangers.  After this the
main consideration is running costs and capital considerations.

<IMG SRC="kuchen2.gif" ALT="structure"><p>

Validation of the <A HREF=""> models for wood mechanics </A> being
developed requires structural and compositional data for wood whose
elastic properties are also known. The wood to be used for model
verification will come out from somewhere within the trunk of a 25 year
old <I> Pinus radiata </I> tree grown in New Zealand. Since all the
different tests should be to be conducted on the same piece of wood, or
at least on pieces from a restricted locale, all the steps from the
first cutting to the last test need have to be planned thoroughly.<p>

The size and shape of the sample to be characterised has to be
appropriate for all the testing procedures. As close to homogenous
sample is desirable, hence the sample has to be able to be cut from a
single growth ring, and the chosen growth ring must be closer to the
bark than the pith. <p>


<A NAME="liste"></A> Working with wood is a rather new subject in our
department therefore methods are being established for:<br>

<UL>

 <LI><A HREF="#structure"> sudy of the structure</A> 
</UL><P> 
          
<A NAME="prepare"><H2>Sample preparation</H2></A>          
          
Most of the cutting is done using a <B>microtome</B>. This allows the
preparation of samples with smooth surfaces and their cells oriented in
the main directions (L, T or R), as is required for the mechanical
testing. Shavings (15µm thick) are kept for structural study. Cutting is
also done with a guillotine using a razor blade. The current method
allows cuts of up to 3mm in depth to be made. Another method would need
to be developed for thicker samples.<p>

The wood is soaked in water before cutting. After being cut it is
treated with acetone and ethanol to remove water and extractives, such
as resin. <BR> Common histological methods, such as <B>staining</B>,
<B>resin embedding </B>and <B>maceration</B>, are then used to reveal
the structure. Some of the preparation equipment is provided by <A

<A NAME="elasticity"><H2>Measuring the elastic properties</H2></A>          
<IMG SRC="wuerfel2.gif"><p>

Because wood can be considered as an <B>orthotropic </B>material its
elastic behaviour, in a linear regime, is characterised by nine
independent elastic constants. Engineers commonly choose to use the
<B>Young's moduli</B>, <B>Poisson ratios</B>, and the <B>shear
moduli</B>, for which there are three of each.<p> 

A method has been established for measuring the Young's moduli and the
Poisson ratios for wood samples having <B>12 % moisture content</B>. The
samples are 3x3x35mm in size and are cut from early wood. The ends of
the samples are glued into aluminium grips (about 10 mm long), these end
grips preserve the cells against damage during clamping in the testing
rig. They samples are tested in tension along each of the three
orthotropic axes using a 1 000 lbs tensile substage (<A
HREF="http://www.fullam.com/sem_subs.htm">Ernest F Fullam Inc.,
USA</A>). The strains developed are measured using strain gauges glued
onto the sample, and are digitally recorded. <p> 

In the future this method will be extended to permit:          
<UL>          
<LI> determination of shear moduli          
<LI> determination of elastic constants for samples over a range of moisture contents.

<B>Cell shape</B>, <B>size and length</B>, <B>cell-wall thickness
</B>(possibly even cell- wall layer thicknessses), and <B>microfibrillar
orientation </B>constitute the structural features for which
quantitative data is required if the cellular mechanics models are to be
validated.<p> 
         
Cell shape, size and length, and cell-wall thickness can be determined
using a light microscope in conjunction with a digital image analyser.
Thin transverse sections (5µm) from resin embedded samples give high
resolution images and reveal the original cell shape, size and cell wall
thickness. The cell length can be determined from macerated cells. <p> 


The microfibrillar angle will be either analysed by the <B>iodine-
method </B>(by J.F. Senft and B.A. Bendtsen (1985): "Measuring
microfibrillar angles using light microscopy", Wood and Fibre Science,
17 (4) 564- 567) or by means of <B>x-ray analysis</B>. The first method
is time consuming in comparison to the x-ray method and requires careful
specimen preparation. However, iodine- method gives a more direct
measure of microfibril angle, and permits observations for individual
cells whereas the x-ray method yields an average measure over a large
number of cells. At present results from these methods are being
compared for adjacent samples of Pinus radiata. The x-ray measurement is
to be carried out by Dr Robert Evans at the Forest Products Laboratory,
CSIRO in Victoria, Australia.<BR> A method has yet to be established for
measuring the cell wall layer thickness. <p>

<h1>MEWG Future Directions</h1><p> 

Until I (or Kathrin ;-) figure out how to use java or some such fancy
frippery to add ideas to this page it had better stay blank. Otherwise,
people will think this group's destiny is controlled by me, and we
wouldn't want that now would we?<p> 

I lied.
<ul>
<li>Here's something begging to be done. Think of a better
name/acronym for this group 'cos MEWG=uuuggghhh!!! 

<li>Figure out a way to examine continuum hypothesis validity. Large
clusters of atoms (approx 20,000) cannot be considered as tiny crystals.
They apparently possess different bonding structures and hence probably
different mechanics. (Is this true for polymeric type matls. or only
metals/small molecule crystals?).

<h1><b>ENERGY EFFICIENCY RESEARCH - SHOWERSAVER</b></h1><p><br>


<IMG SRC="EER.JPG"><br>

A Showersaver test rig has been developed to prove the concept of heat recovery
from showers. While in use a typical domestic shower uses in excess of 10 Kw
and around 90% of this power is wasted down the drain. Mechanical Engineering
student, Christopher Durno, and supervisor, Dr Donald Clucas, are shown adjusting
the apparatus with the prototype heat recovery shower tray in the foreground.
While the shower is in use cold water passes through the coiled tube fixed to the
base of the tray before going to the water heater. The cold water receives heat
from the drain water via this tray heat exchanger, reducing the heat required to
raise it to a comfortable shower temperature.<p><br>

<h1><b>AIR CONDITIONING AND ENVIRONMENTAL RESEARCH</b></h1><p><br>

<IMG SRC="AC.JPG"><br>

Prominently featured above is a rig which demonstrates the characteristics of
various air conditioning components (heating coil, steam humidifier, cooling and
dehumidifying coil, etc) which are used on a larger scale for maintaining
comfortable air conditions in buildings. This rig has been computer-linked so that
the changing state of the air as it moves through the components can be displayed
on the screen, superimposed onto a computer-generated psychrometric chart. On
the left in the photograph is an environmental chamber in which the air temperature
and humidity can be controlled over a wide range of conditions.<br><p>

<h1><b>STIRLING ENGINE - BATTERY CHARGER AND POWER GENERATION<br><p></b></h1>

<IMG SRC="se.JPG"><br>

Quiet, efficient and weather-independent ways of remote power generation have
been a subject for considerable research in the Department. The Stirling engine is
highly regarded for its quiet and environmentally friendly operation, but there are
few commercially available electricity-generated systems. Postgraduate student,
Craig Van Rij, and supervisor, Dr Donald Clucas, are seen making adjustments to
a new Stirling engine generator previously developed in the Department. The
Stirling engine battery charger (centre) runs on LPG fuel and charges a 12 volt
battery at 15 amps. Endurance testing and scaling to a 3 Kw unit for remote
homes is a subject of further undergraduate and postgraduate study.<br>

<h1><b>MATERIALS RESEARCH</b></h1><p><br>

In the non-ferrous foundry castings can be produced in aluminium, brass, zinc and
lead. A separate induction furnace can be used to melt steels either in the air or
in a vacuum chamber to ensure a contaminant free environment. These foundries
enable the production of alloys of specific composition as well as investigation into
casting methods and structures.<p><br>




<IMG SRC="MR.JPG"><br>



Shown here is the casting of an aluminium-silicon alloy test bar which will be
analyzed for composition, strength, hardness, porosity, grain size and ductility.
The Materials Section contains testing machines which are used to measure these
mechanical properties; the machines are also used for student projects, laboratory
classes and some outside work. Optical and scanning electron microscopes are
available to examine the material microstructures.<p><br>

Ceramic and composite materials research is also being undertaken.<p><br>

<h3>Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Canterbury's</H3><p>
<H1>Mechanical Engineering Wood Group</h1>
    
<h2>Overview</h2><p>

This group aims to <b>relate the anatomy and mechanics</b> of wood, and
to use such knowledge to <b>improve wood utilisation</b>. As well as
advancing fundamental wood science, this work has potential applications
in the fields of silviculture and wood processing.<p>

Because of New Zealand's committment to <i>Pinus radiata</i> we
inevitably find ourselves working with this species. In general however,
the work being done could be applied to other softwood species,
hardwoods, or even other plant materials, though the translation task
would become increasingly more difficult.<p>

One part of the work being undertaken centers around using mathematical
techniques, notably homogenisation and finite element methods, to
construct models capable of predicting the mechanics of wood from the
wood's structure and composition.<p>

Such models require structural, compositional and mechanical data for
their construction and verifiction. <a
href="kathrin/verifdata.htm">Work</a> is being done to obtain this
information both from the literature, and by using methods we have
developed. While the techniques being used could be applied to determine
wood parameters, and their variations, across a whole tree, or even over
a species, our focus is on obtaining a complete dataset for a small
sample, since doing so simplifies the task of correlating measured
results with model predictions.<p>

Work is also being done on cutting wood and other natural materials. In
part this involves modelling wood-tool interactions. It also includes
novel cutting techniques (high speed slicing), and using advanced
control techniques to improve existing tools (such as the bandsaw).<p>

Finally we are also concerned with making our work and its findings
available to others, industry in particular.<p>

	<center><h1>Softwood Structure</h1></center>

The term softwood refers to both a class of tree and to the wood from these trees. Softwoods are  conifers, or cone-bearing trees, such as pines, spruces, larches, firs and cedars. Most are evergreen, have small narrow leaves and prefer temperate regions. Softwoods native to New Zealand include the totara, rimu, kahikatea and kauri. <p>
The wood in a trees stem exists to provide structural support for the foliage and a conduit for water and nutrients. These functions, and the need to fulfill them in a manner which is both optimal and in accord with biological principles, dictate wood structure.<p>
The structure of a generic softwood at seven different levels is illustrated on the right. The dimensions below each of the level labels are indicative of the size of features at that level. <p>
The majority of the material in the stem (1) of a living tree is dead. However, there is a thin layer of living and dividing cells known as the cambium (2), from which both the phloem and xylem are derived. Outside the cambium is the inner bark (3) which contains the active phloem as well as other tissue. Outside that is the outer bark (4). Inside the cambium is the xylem or wood. Very few of the cells in the sapwood (5), and none in the heartwood (6), remain alive. Water conduction from roots to crown occurs in the sapwood (primarily in the outer sapwood) but not in the heartwood. In many species the heartwood has a colour quite distinct from that of the sapwood.<p>
Corewood (7) is formed near the centre of the stem, generally making up the first 10-20 growth rings. Depending on the age of the tree, the heartwood may or may not be contained within the corewood. Juvenile wood is wood formed early in the trees life, and is not the same as corewood.<p>
Once the tree has been felled and sawn into boards other natural features become evident. These include knots, resin pockets, checks (splits), compression wood, grain pattern and growth rings. The latter are due to radial variation in the shapes and sizes of cells, generally brought on by seasonal changes. Earlywood (8) is laid down upon commencement of new growth. As the season progress-es this gradually changes to latewood (9), passing through a middlewood (10) zone. In some trees an abrupt boundary exists between one seasons late-wood and the following seasons earlywood, in others (particularly those from milder climes) the growth rings are almost invisible.<p>
The predominant type of cell in softwoods is the tracheid (11). Tracheids make up around 95% of softwood volume and are highly elongated in the direction of the grain. These cells give the stem its strength and stiffness as well as conducting water from the roots to the crown. In earlywood, the tracheids are larger and thin-walled whereas in the latewood the tracheids are smaller and thick-walled.<p>
While the tracheids are aligned with the grain, rays (12) are rows of cells oriented in the radial direction. Each tracheid comes into contact with a ray at some point along its length. The living parenchyma cells in the rays store food reserves and participate in damage control. <p>
Associated with some rays are radial resin canals (13). These have a counterpart in the grain direction knownnot surprisinglyas axial resin canals (14). Resin canals are tunnels through the woody tissue, and are lined with epithelial cells.<p><p>
Bordered pits (15) connect the lumens (the spaces previously occupied by the living cells) of adjacent tracheids forming a network in which water can flow. In the earlywood, bordered pits act as valves pre-venting vapour bubbles from spreading through the sapwood, rendering the trees water con-duction system useless. Other types of pits exist between tracheids and ray cells, and between adjacent ray cells.<p><p>
The double cell-wall is formed from the walls of two adjacent tracheids and the middle lamella (16) which glues them together. When a cell is cut off from the cambium it has only a very thin primary wall (17). After the cell attains its full size a much thicker secondary wall (18) is laid down inside the primary wall, and then the cell dies. In cross-section the secondary walls of tracheids appear to consist of three layers. These have been denoted S1, S2, and S3, with S1 immediately inside the primary wall and S3 adjacent to the lumen. The lumen surface is often covered with nodules known as warts (19).<p><p>
The three secondary wall layers are built up from hundreds of concentric lamellae. Each cell-wall lamella (20) consists of a single layer of long, aligned fibres known as microfibrils (21). In general, the orientation of the microfibrils varies only a little from one lamella to the next. However, in zones between the major secondary layers abrupt and significant reorientations occur giving rise to the layer boundaries. The microfibrils in the lamellae of the inner secondary wall are densely packed and well aligned whereas in the primary wall and the outer S1, the microfibrils have a looser texture.<p><p>
The microfibrils are highly ordered bundles of cellulose chains. They impart both strength and stiffness to the cell wall. Each cellulose chain (22) is made up of tens of thousands of glucose residues strung together to form Earths most abundant polymer.<p><p>
The microfibrils themselves are each covered in a polyose sheath (23) and embedded in an amorphous matrix (24). This matrix is a macromolecular complex of lignin, polyose and water. The polyoses or hemicelluloses are polymers similar to cellulose but are much shorter, branched, and incorporate residues of other sugars as well as glucose. Portions of these polymer chains may substitute into the outermost parts of the cellulose crystals, creating a paracrystalline cortex. The polyose chains in the sheath may form direct links with other microfibrils as well as with the matrix.<p><p>

<p>In November 1995 I returned from a postdoc at the University of Melbourne.
I was employed at Melbourne from May 1994 to October 1995. </p>

<p>While at Melbourne I worked on the development of the hydrogen assisted
jet ignition system for multi-cylinder application. <a HREF="http://sungear.mame.mu.oz.au/~jeremyl/haji.html">Hydrogen
Assisted Jet Ignition (or HAJI)</a> utilises a special igniter for a spark
ignition engine which offers advantages of lean operation, reduced NOx
emissions, reduced cycle by cycle variability and improved thermal efficiency.<BR><P>
Back at Canterbury in 1996 I was responible for the hardware interfacing and software development to 
control and gather data from test cells in the automotive laboratory.<BR>
</p>

<p>Early in 1997 I start a six month contract with Moffat Limited.  Note my new email 
address below </p>

The complexity, variability and uncertainty associated with wood anatomy makes the task of relating the behaviour of wood to its structure impossible unless some assumptions are introduced. Such assumptions provide a model for wood structure. They also permit generalisation, suggesting ways of applying analytical techniques developed in other situations and for other materials.<p>
What a model retains from botanical knowledge, and what it omits will depend on what facet of wood behaviour is being investigated, from what perspective, and to what depth.<p>
The model illustrated on the right is a structural one, focussed on determining the mechanics of straight-grained knot-free wood from the woods microstructure and the properties of its constituents.<p>
A trees stem (1) is modelled as an axisymmetric laminate, and boards (2) as portions of this laminate. Each layer of the laminate is homogenous and orthotropic with a thickness which varies in the axial direction. Ring-wander, knots, splits, grain aberrations and the like are ignored. <p>
Within a growth layer (3) the tissue is treated as being composed solely of tracheids, neglecting rays, resin canals and other cellular elements. Furthermore, the tissue is either earlywood (4) or latewood (5), with no gradual transition between the two as the season progresses. <p>
The earlywood is modelled as a hexagonal honeycomb with walls of uniform thickness; the latewood as a rectangular honeycomb with elliptic cell lumen cross-sections.<p>
The model tracheids wall (6) is a 4-ply orthotropic laminate. The 3 inner layers of this laminate corres-pond to the three secondary cell-wall layers. The outer layer of the laminate corresponds to the primary wall and the middle lamella. Pits are not included and any variation in the wall thickness is attributed solely to the outer layer. <p>
The material of the cell-wall layers (7) is considered to be a continuous fibre-reinforced composite in which straight, parallel and regularly arranged cellulose fibres (8) of rectangular cross-section are coated with a polyose sheath (9) and embedded in an amorphous matrix (10).<p>
Finally, the matrix itself is treated as having an inter-penetrating cross-structure, forming a three-dimensional network of lignin and polyose.<p>
This model, and others similar to it, form the basis for work being undertaken on wood mechanics in the Department of Mechanical Engineering at the University of Canterbury, New Zealand.<p>

<h3>Department of Mechanical Engineering, University of Canterbury's</H3><p>
<H1>Mechanical Engineering Wood Group</h1>
    
<h2>Overview</h2><p>

This group aims to <b>relate the anatomy and mechanics</b> of wood, and
to use such knowledge to <b>improve wood utilisation</b>. As well as
advancing fundamental wood science, this work has potential applications
in the fields of silviculture and wood processing.<p>

Because of New Zealand's committment to <i>Pinus radiata</i> we
inevitably find ourselves working with this species. In general however,
the work being done could be applied to other softwood species,
hardwoods, or even other plant materials, though the translation task
would become increasingly more difficult.<p>

One part of the work being undertaken centers around using mathematical
techniques, notably homogenisation and finite element methods, to
construct models capable of predicting the mechanics of wood from the
wood's structure and composition.<p>

Such models require structural, compositional and mechanical data for
their construction and verifiction. <a
href="kathrin/verifdata.htm">Work</a> is being done to obtain this
information both from the literature, and by using methods we have
developed. While the techniques being used could be applied to determine
wood parameters, and their variations, across a whole tree, or even over
a species, our focus is on obtaining a complete dataset for a small
sample, since doing so simplifies the task of correlating measured
results with model predictions.<p>

Work is also being done on cutting wood and other natural materials. In
part this involves modelling wood-tool interactions. It also includes
novel cutting techniques (high speed slicing), and using advanced
control techniques to improve existing tools (such as the bandsaw).<p>

Finally we are also concerned with making our work and its findings
available to others, industry in particular.<p>

This application note explains how to use interrupt programming on computers based on the 80x86 family of 
microprocessors.  This family includes the 8086, 8088, 80286, 80386, and 80486 microprocessors that are used in 
PC/XT/AT, EISA, and IBM PS/2 computers.  This application note describes interrupts, explains how interrupts 
work and how they are implemented on 80x86-based computers, and discusses programming guidelines when 
designing an interrupt-driven application.  Finally,  this application note contains example programming code to 
demonstrate how to program interrupts for a data acquisition application.<P><U>

<P>
Interrupts are very important to the operation of any computer.  Interrupts give the processor the ability to respond 
quickly to its peripherals (such as the keyboard and the hard disk) and to the outside world in general.  Without 
interrupts, a processor would be unable to service more than one task efficiently and reliably.  The importance of 
the interrupt is illustrated when comparing an interrupt to a doorbell.  If your door did not have a doorbell, you 
would have to periodically go to the door to see if anyone happened to be there at that time.  Of course, that would 
be very inefficient.  With a doorbell, you only need to go to the door when the doorbell rings, and you are then 
confident that someone is there waiting.  Likewise, it is not efficient for the processor to continually check 
whether any of its peripherals require attention at a given time.  An interrupt is a doorbell to the processor to 
signal that some device needs service.<P>
<P><U>
</U>During normal execution of a program, instructions are read from memory and executed sequentially by the 
processor.  The processor uses a special register called the <I>instruction pointer</I> to keep track of the next 
instruction to be executed.  A set of general-purpose registers are used for manipulation and temporary storage of 
any data used by the program.<P>
<P><U>
</U>An interrupt is a special input to the processor.  When the processor is signalled that an interrupt has 
occurred, the processor finishes the instruction currently being executed and saves the instruction pointer and a 
status word to the stack.  The <I>stack</I> is a special block of memory used to keep track of information during 
function calls and interrupts.  The processor uses a special register called the <I>stack pointer</I> to keep track 
of the location of the <I>top</I> of the stack, which is where the last item was added to the stack.<P>
<P>
After the processor saves this information to the stack, the processor branches to a special routine called an 
<I>interrupt service routine</I> or <I>interrupt handler</I>.  If needed, this routine can determine the source of 
the interrupt and then service the device that requested the interrupt.  This process may involve reading a 
character from the keyboard and updating the monitor, or moving data from an adapter board into computer 
memory.  After handling the interrupt, the last instruction executed in the interrupt service routine is an 
<I>interrupt return instruction</I>.  This instruction causes the processor to restore the instruction pointer and 
status register with the values that were saved to the stack at the time of the interrupt and to resume 
execution.<P><U>

<P>
<H4><A NAME = data_acqui></A>Interrupts for Data 
Acquisition</H4>
<P>
Many data acquisition applications can benefit greatly from the interrupt capability of the processor.  Interrupts 
can be used for immediate communication between the data acquisition hardware and the computer.  They can be 
used to time or synchronize data acquisition with external events or to respond promptly to external events and 
alarm conditions.  However, interrupts are not always the best approach in data acquisition applications.  You 
must consider the advantages and disadvantages of various data acquisition methods before deciding to use 
interrupt-driven acquisition.<P>
<P>
Data acquisition involves the monitoring of one or several sources of physical data at a regular rate, which is often 
determined by a clock signal.  Commonly, the data originates from analog-to-digital converters (ADCs), 
counter/timer devices, or switches.  In general, there are three approaches to acquiring data from an external 
device or synchronizing communication between devices.  These three approaches are described as follows:<P>
<P>
<I>Polling</I> - This method involves periodically reading the status of the device to determine whether the 
device needs attention.<P>
<P>
<I>Direct Memory Access (DMA)</I> - A dedicated processor, the DMA controller, transparently transfers data 
from the device to computer memory, or vice versa.<P>
<P>
<I>Interrupts</I> - The device is configured to interrupt the processor whenever the device requires 
attention.<P>
<P>
For some applications, polling a device can be a very effective way to service a data acquisition operation.  The 
polling method is simple, easy to understand, and easy to debug.  If the processor can be dedicated to the single 
task of monitoring and servicing the device, high acquisition rates can be realized.  However, dedication to a 
single task is often not possible.  Other devices may also require timely monitoring, or the processor may be 
required to do other work, such as handling previously acquired data.  DMA or interrupts would then be a better 
approach.<P>
<P>
DMA uses a DMA controller to move data from one location to another, making fast data transfers of large blocks 
of data possible.  DMA is fast because dedicated hardware transfers the data and requires only one or two 
read/write bus cycles per transfer.  In addition, the processor is free for other activities (such as processing 
acquired data) because the DMA controller proceeds with the data acquisition in the background.  However, the 
processor may need to access the data on a point-by-point basis as it is being acquired.  DMA is not well-suited 
for this type of application, and interrupts or polling may be preferable.  Furthermore, the number of DMA 
channels in a PC is limited, and a dedicated DMA channel is required for each unique data acquisition source.<P>
<P>
With interrupts, the processor can respond quickly to an event (such as a clock signal) to transfer data or to 
synchronize different events.  Unlike DMA, an interrupt-driven system has the advantage of being able to process 
the data on a point-by-point basis, which can be particularly important in control applications.  Consider a typical 
control application synchronized with a clock signal, for example.  The application may require that, with every 
pulse of a clock, the processor read the result of an A/D conversion, read the state of several digital lines, use 
these results to compute a new control value, and write this value to a digital-to-analog converter (DAC).  DMA 
would not be useful for such an application, and a polling routine would not directly provide synchronization with 
the clock signal.  Interrupts, however, make it easier to synchronize the input and output with the clock signal and 
for the processor to perform other general processing tasks in the foreground, if needed.<P>
<P>
One disadvantage of interrupts, however, is that they require processor time, and there can be a significant amount 
of software overhead time associated with the interrupt service routine.  When designing a data acquisition 
system, you must estimate the amount of this overhead time, which consists of the time required by the processor 
to vector to the proper interrupt service routine, known as <I>interrupt latency</I>, and the time necessary to 
perform the task required within the service routine.  If the overhead is too large for the required acquisition rate, 
then DMA or a very efficient polling routine must be used.  In applications that are time critical, the interrupt 
service routine must be written to be as fast as possible.  As a result, interrupt service routines for data acquisition 
applications are often written in assembly language.<P>
<P>
Many driver software packages use both interrupt and DMA methods to handle data acquisition servicing.  
LabDriver® and LabWindows®, for example, all include sophisticated, high-level routines for data acquisition 
that take advantage of the interrupt and DMA capabilities of the hardware.  Application developers should 
seriously consider using such a driver package, which spares the developer the complexity and details of 
programming the low-level hardware of the computer and the adapter board.  Using a driver package can 
significantly decrease the amount of time required to develop an application.<P>

<B>The 80x86 Family Register Set</B><P><B>
</B><P>
The 80x86 family of microprocessors use 14 separate 16-bit registers that can be grouped into four categories:  
general-purpose registers, segment registers, offset registers, and the flags register.  The registers, their categories, 
and their use are listed in Table 1.<P>
<P>

</PRE>
<P>
<P>
<P>
The general-purpose registers are used by the processor for temporary storage of data.  To facilitate use of 8-bit 
and 16-bit values, each of these 16-bit registers can also be addressed as a pair of 8-bit registers.  AL, AH, BL, 
BH, and so on are used to address the lower (L) or higher (H) bytes.<P>
<P>
The segment registers are used to store the base address of 64 kilobyte memory segments.  The absolute or 
complete address of a memory location is obtained by combining the segment registers with an offset value stored 
in one of the offset registers.  A segment register identifies a distinct 64 kilobyte segment.  A particular memory 
location within the segment is indicated by a 16-bit offset register.  For example, the memory location 01F0:0009 
refers to byte 9 within segment 01F0.<P>
<P>
The instruction pointer (IP) holds the offset address of the next instruction to be executed by the processor.  The 
absolute address of the instruction is determined by combining the IP offset register with the Code Segment (CS) 
Register.  The IP Register is automatically updated each time the processor loads an instruction.<P>
<P>
Another offset register is the Stack Pointer (SP) Register, which, when combined with the Stack Segment Register 
(SS), points to the current top of the stack.  The stack is a last-in first-out (LIFO) memory structure.  As items or 
data are added, the stack gets larger.  When an item is removed, the first item to come off the stack is the last item 
added to the stack.  When data is added to or removed from the stack, the value of the stack pointer is 
appropriately updated.<P>
<P>


The Flags Register, as the name implies, stores the state of nine CPU status and control flags.  Six of the bits are 
status flags, which are automatically set or cleared after the execution of every instruction.  The three other bits 
are used for control purposes.  These bits include the direction flag, the trap flag, and the interrupt flag.  The 
interrupt flag (IF) bit is used to enable or disable hardware interrupts.<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>The 80x86 Family Interrupts</B><P><B>
</B><P>
The first 1024 bytes of memory are reserved for the interrupt vector table.  This table holds up to 256 vectors, 
each of which is a 4-byte pointer to a specific interrupt service routine that is executed when the corresponding 
interrupt is processed.  The design of the 80x86 family requires certain interrupt vectors to be used for specific 
functions.  While many of these vectors are reserved for software interrupts, a limited number of vectors are 
reserved for hardware interrupts.<P>
<P>
When a hardware interrupt occurs, the processor first responds by pushing the contents of the Flags, CS, and IP 
Registers onto the stack and disabling any further hardware interrupts by clearing the IF bit in the Flags Register.  
The processor then looks to the system bus for an 8-bit interrupt number, multiplies the number by 4 (the size of 
each vector in bytes), and uses the result as an offset into the interrupt vector table.  The vector address pointed to 
by the result is then loaded into the CS and IP Registers, and the processor resumes operation at this new location 
pointed to by the instruction pointer.  After processing the interrupt, the processor restores the Flags, CS, and IP 
Registers with the values saved to the stack when the interrupt occurred.  Because the IF bit is cleared after the 
Flags Register is saved to the stack, restoring the Flags Register also resets the IF bit, which enables hardware 
interrupts.<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Hardware Interrupts and the Intel 8259A Programmable Interrupt 
Controller</B><P><B>
</B><P>
Hardware interrupts are sent to the processor through an Intel 8259A programmable interrupt controller, which 
provides the system with eight prioritized hardware interrupts.  When the 8259A receives an interrupt request, 
typically from a peripheral device, the controller drives high its output (INT), which is connected to the 
processor's interrupt input pin (INTR).  The INTR pin is used by the processor to signal the occurrence of a 
maskable interrupt.  If the IF bit in the Flags Register is set, the processor sends an acknowledge signal to the 
8259A controller.<P>
<P>
After receiving the interrupt acknowledge signal (INTA) from the processor, the interrupt controller places the 
appropriate interrupt vector on the system bus.  The eight hardware interrupts (IRQ0 through IRQ7) on the 8259A 
are mapped by the controller to interrupt vectors 8 through 15 (0Fh).  The interrupts are prioritized, IRQ0 having 
the highest priority and IRQ7 having the lowest priority.  The PC design assigns interrupts IRQ0 through IRQ7 for 
particular peripherals.  Table 2 lists these assignments.  IRQ0 and IRQ1 are reserved for the system timer and the 
keyboard, respectively, while IRQ2 is reserved for cascading additional interrupt controllers.  IRQ3 through IRQ7 
are assigned to various peripherals but are connected to the I/O bus (see Figure 1).  If these peripherals are not 
present, interrupts IRQ3 through IRQ7 can be used for other purposes.<P>

The PC AT computer is designed with a second interrupt controller for eight additional IRQ levels.  The INT line 
of the second controller, the <I>slave</I>, is cascaded to the IRQ2 line of the first controller, the <I>master</I>, 
as illustrated in Figure 2.  The eight interrupts (IRQ8 through IRQ15) from the second controller are mapped to 
interrupt vectors 112 (70h) through 119 (77h).  Because these additional interrupts are effectively connected to the 
IRQ2 line of the master 8259A controller, they take priority over IRQ3 through IRQ7 of the master 8259A.<P>

Figure 2.  Cascaded Configuration of the Intel 8259A as Used in PC AT Computers<P><B>
</B><P>
<P>
A device, such as a plug-in adapter board, issues an interrupt by causing a high-to-low transition on one of the 
IRQ lines.  With most adapter boards you can choose which IRQ line to use, usually by positioning a jumper.  The 
board is then programmed to assert an interrupt signal under certain conditions, such as the completion of an A/D 
conversion or the pulse of a counter/timer output.  Many adapter boards are able to cause interrupts under more 
than one condition.  Therefore, the interrupt service routine must determine the cause of the interrupt, usually by 
reading a status register on the adapter board.<P>
<P>
The Micro Channel bus, used in many of the IBM PS/2 computers, and the EISA bus also use the cascaded Intel 
8259A configuration shown in Figure 2 for prioritized interrupts.  The previous discussion applies to these 
computers as well.  However, there is one significant difference concerning how the interrupt line works.  While 
interrupts on PC/XT/AT computers are triggered by a high-to-low transition, or edge, of the interrupt line, the 
Micro Channel bus defines an interrupt signal as asserted by the state of the interrupt line.  With this 
configuration, referred to as <I>level mode</I>, an interrupt is considered to be asserted, or active, as long as the 
interrupt line is held in the high state.  With the EISA bus, on the other hand, both level mode and edge-triggered 
interrupts can be used.<P>
<P>
<P>
<H4><A NAME = programming></A>Interrupt Programming</H4>
<P>
There are three basic operations to programming an interrupt-driven application:  installing the interrupt vector, 
which points to the interrupt service routine, into the interrupt vector table; handling the interrupt with an interrupt 
service routine; and removing the interrupt vector.  These operations are described as follows.<P>
<P>
<P>
<B>Installing the Interrupt Vector</B><P><B>
</B><P><U>
</U>Installing an interrupt vector consists of putting the correct address of the interrupt service routine, or 
interrupt vector, in the interrupt vector table, and enabling interrupts.  First, you determine the proper location in 
the interrupt vector table to install the handler address.  As mentioned previously, interrupts IRQ0 through IRQ7 
map to interrupt level 8 through 15, and interrupts IRQ8 through IRQ15 map to interrupt levels 112 (70h) through 
119 (77h).  For example, the address of a handler that is to service an IRQ0 interrupt must be installed at location 
or index 8 in the vector table.  DOS has two functions, accessible through the DOS function call INT 21h, for 
setting and retrieving interrupt vectors.  Function 25h is used to set an interrupt vector.  When function 25h is 
called, the AL Register holds the interrupt table index, and the DS and DX Registers point to the address of the 
interrupt service routine.  Function 35h is used to <I>get</I>, or return the value of, an interrupt vector from the 
table.  This function should be called before the interrupt is set so the original vector can be saved and then 
restored when removing the interrupt.<P>
<P>
For the interrupt controller to recognize an interrupt, the appropriate interrupt must be enabled.  Enabling 
interrupts is done via the Interrupt Mask Register of the interrupt controller.  This register contains bits that mask 
each of the interrupt request lines.  If the bit is cleared or set, then the corresponding interrupt is enabled or 
disabled, respectively.<P>
<P>
Whenever the interrupt controller is to be programmed, interrupts to the processor <I>must</I> be disabled.  
Interrupts are disabled with the assembly language call cli and re-enabled with the function sti.  These two 
instructions manipulate the interrupt flag (IF) bit in the Flags Register.  Interrupts should be also be disabled 
during any manipulation of the interrupt vector table.<P>
<P>
Some high-level languages include function calls that operate in the same manner as functions 25h and 35h.  
These functions provide a convenient way to install interrupt vectors without having to resort to assembly 
language programming.  Table 4 lists these functions for some popular languages.  Consult the user manual for the 
particular language you are using for more information concerning these or similar functions.<P>

<P>
<P>
<B>Interrupt Handling</B><P><B>
</B><P>
In an interrupt handler or service routine you must first save any registers that the interrupt service routine will 
modify so the registers can be restored before returning from the service routine.  The interrupt handler may then 
need to address the device to verify that the interrupt originated from the device.  Many devices are capable of 
causing interrupts for a number of different reasons, so reading a Status Register may be necessary to determine 
the exact cause of the interrupt.<P>
<P>
Having verified the source and cause of the interrupt, the interrupt service routine then does the particular task for 
that application.  For example, in a typical data acquisition application, the routine reads a value from the adapter 
board, stores the value into memory, and increments a counter.  After handling the interrupt,  the routine must 
restore the processor registers that were saved at the beginning of the routine.<P>
<P>
Finally, a non-specific end of interrupt (EOI) is sent to the interrupt controller.  If the EOI is not sent, no further 
interrupts of equal or lower priority can occur.<P>
<P>
<B>Note:</B>	In systems with cascaded interrupt controllers (non-XT computers), EOI instructions must be 
sent to both the master and the slave 8259A interrupt controllers.<P>
<P>
Again, interrupts to the processor <I>must</I> be disabled while writing the EOI instructions to the interrupt 
controllers.<P>
<P>
When writing an interrupt service routine, do <I>not</I> use DOS functions unless special precautions are taken.  
DOS is not re-entrant.  If the processor is interrupted during a DOS call, and the service routine attempts to call 
another DOS function, the computer may lock up.  To prevent this problem, you may use an undocumented INT 
21h function, function 34h, to determine if a DOS function is in progress.  The 34h function returns a pointer in 
the ES Register and the BX Register that points to a DOS busy flag (InDOS flag).  When an INT 21h function 
starts, the flag is incremented by one; when the function ends, the flag is decremented by one.  If the flag is zero, 
then no DOS functions are currently being executed. <P>
<P>
<B>Note:	</B>The INT 21h function is undocumented and not officially supported by IBM and 
Microsoft.  Therefore, the function may not be available in all versions of DOS.<P>
<P>
<P>


<B>Removing Interrupts</B><P><B>
</B><P>
Finally, the application must remove the interrupt and restore the vector table to its original state.  First, disable 
the interrupt level using the Interrupt Mask Register.  Then, using the data stored during the interrupt installation, 
the original interrupt vector is restored using function 25h or a similar high-level function call.<P>

Interrupts can be a powerful mechanism for servicing data acquisition and control operations.  With interrupts, the 
processor can respond quickly and efficiently to data acquisition hardware.  Besides simply transferring acquired 
data, interrupts can be used to synchronize different events, or process data as it is acquired.  However, interrupts 
are not always the best method for data acquisition.  DMA is useful for moving blocks of data at high rates with 
minimal processor intervention.  Polling is the most straightforward technique, but not very effective for multiple 
devices or high throughput rates.<P>
<P>
The PC design uses the Intel 8259A programmable interrupt controller to provide several prioritized interrupts for 
the I/O bus.  A data acquisition board plugged into the I/O bus can interrupt the processor by asserting the 
appropriate interrupt line.  The processor then jumps to an interrupt service routine located at a preprogrammed 
address.  The example program, IRQESP.ASM, included in this application note shows you how to program 
interrupts.<P>
<P>
Alternatively, National Instruments has developed sophisticated driver software for PC/XT/AT, Micro Channel, 
and EISA data acquisition hardware.  This software includes high-level, easy-to-use functions that take advantage 
of the interrupt and DMA capabilities of the data acquisition hardware.  Many applications developers who use 
driver-level software instead of low-level hardware programming realize a substantial savings in time and 
effort.<P>

<H1>Double Buffering for Continuous Data Acquisition</H1>

<H1>D. Potter</H1>

<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>
Conventional data acquisition software techniques, such as single-buffered
data acquisition, work well for most of today's applications.
However, more sophisticated applications involving larger amounts
of data acquired at higher rates require more advanced techniques
for collecting and managing the data. One such technique is double
buffering. National Instruments uses double buffering techniques
in its driver software to provide continuous, non-interrupted
acquisition of large amounts of data.
<P>
This application note discusses the fundamentals of double-buffered
data acquisition, how double buffering works, the factors that
affect throughput rates, and a double buffering application-streaming
data continuously to disk in real time. Finally, this application
note has three appendices.* Appendix A discusses circular buffer
implementation on Macintosh and PC1 platforms. Appendix B and
Appendix C each contain a programming example that demonstrates
the specifics of programming double-buffered data acquisition
with National Instruments driver software for the Macintosh and
the PC, respectively.
<H2>Single-Buffered Versus Double-Buffered Data Acquisition</H2>

<P>
The most common method of data acquisition found in conventional
driver software is single-buffered data acquisition. In single-buffered
acquisition, a fixed number of samples are acquired at a specified
rate and transferred into computer memory. After the data is stored
into the memory buffer, the CPU can then analyze the data, display
the data, or store the data to the hard disk for later processing.
<P>
PC-based data acquisition hardware is well suited for single-buffered
data acquisition. Single-buffered data acquisition is relatively
simple to implement, can usually take advantage of the full hardware
speed of the data acquisition hardware, and is very useful for
many applications. The major disadvantage of single-buffered data
acquisition is that the amount of data that can be acquired at
any one time is limited to the amount of free memory available
in the computer.
<P>
In double-buffered or continuous mode data acquisition, the memory
buffer is arranged as a circular buffer that is actually divided
into two or more smaller buffers, or <I>blocks</I> (Figure 1).
As data from the I/O device is transferred into these blocks,
the CPU can concurrently access and process blocks of already
acquired data. The buffer is circular because after the last block
of the buffer is filled with data, the acquisition automatically
reinitializes to the first block of the buffer. This first block
of data has already been processed, so no data is lost. By reusing
the circular
<P>
buffer, data can be continuously sampled <I>and processed</I>without
interrupting the acquisition of the data, using a limited amount
of memory.
<P>
<B>Figure 1. Circular Buffer of <I>n</I> Blocks Used for Double-Buffered
Data Acquisition</B>
<P>
The major advantage of double-buffered data acquisition is that
the amount of data that can be acquired is not limited by the
amount of available computer memory. By storing the blocks of
data as they are acquired to the hard disk or other mass storage
device, data acquisition can continue without interruption for
an extended length of time. Also, acquired data can be easily
accessed before the entire acquisition sequence is completed.
This capability is valuable for applications that require real-time
response, such as a control loop or real-time display of the data.
The CPU can access a block of the circular buffer as soon as it
is filled with new data, without having to wait for the entire
acquisition to complete.
<P>
One possible disadvantage of double-buffered data acquisition
is that the throughput rate is limited by the ability of the processor
to handle the blocks of data in a given period of time. If the
CPU does not service the blocks of data fast enough, newly acquired
data is eventually transferred into a block that has not been
already processed by the CPU. Therefore, this data is lost. The
amount of time needed by the CPU to process the block of data
depends on what this processing consists of, but it often bottlenecks
the system. Today's high-performance boards can collect data at
rates of up to millions of samples per second, well beyond the
processing and storage capabilities of most systems. However,
faster machines and specialized hardware, such as a DSP accelerator
board, dedicated to processing large amounts of data, are continuously
increasing the real-time capabilities of the PC-based system.
<H2>Background Data Acquisition</H2>

<P>
Double-buffered data acquisition requires the acquisition sequence
to proceed as a <I>background</I> task of the computer system.
In other words, data produced by the data acquisition board must
be transferred to computer memory in the background while the
CPU operates concurrently on a separate task in the foreground,
such as processing blocks of data. The PC provides two mechanisms
for implementing background acquisition: interrupts and direct
memory access (DMA). With interrupts, the CPU is interrupted from
executing the main program whenever data is available to be transferred.
The processor then temporarily halts what it is doing and jumps
to a special subroutine to transfer data from the I/O device to
memory. With DMA, a special DMA controller takes control of the
I/O bus and performs the transfer of data with minimal CPU intervention.
The design of the PC/XT/AT/EISA and IBM PS/2 computers includes
a DMA controller for use by peripherals. The Macintosh II computers
use the NuBus as the I/O bus and do not include a DMA controller.
Therefore, a DMA master board, such as the National Instruments
NB-DMA2800 board, must be used to transfer data to system memory
using DMA.
<P>
While both DMA and processor interrupts provide background data
acquisition, DMA is definitely the more effective method for double-buffered
data acquisition. Because specialized hardware transfers the data,
very high throughputs to computer memory are realized. More importantly,
the CPU is not burdened with the additional task of moving the
data into the memory buffer. The DMA controller performs the task
of data transfer, leaving the CPU free to do other tasks, such
as processing blocks of data retrieved from the circular buffer.
With interrupt-driven acquisition, the CPU is used to transfer
the data as well as process acquired blocks of data. Therefore,
throughput rates can be very limited if interrupts are used as
the method of acquisition. The throughput of a double-buffered
application often improves by a factor of 10 or more when using
DMA instead of interrupts to transfer data.
<H2>How Double-Buffered Data Acquisition Works</H2>

<P>
The basic component of double-buffered data acquisition is the
circular memory buffer that consists of two or more blocks. Theoretically,
the circular buffer only needs to consist of two blocks to implement
double-buffered data acquisition. In practice, several blocks
are used to allow for variations in CPU and data transfer efficiency.
Figure 2a illustrates a circular buffer comprised of six blocks.
As data from the I/O device is deposited into the buffer, blocks
of data are pulled out or copied to a secondary transfer buffer
for processing by the CPU. The transfer buffer is the same size
as one data block and is needed as a temporary storage location
for blocks retrieved by the CPU.
<P>
After the data acquisition operation starts, the CPU begins the
task of retrieving and processing filled blocks of data. When
the first block of data is available, that block is copied into
the transfer buffer (Figure 2b). The CPU then processes this block
of data, which may consist of storing the data to disk, plotting
the data, or performing some calculations. Alternatively, the
block of data could be processed in place, without copying the
data to a second transfer buffer. However, the use of a transfer
buffer guarantees that the retrieved data is not overwritten during
the processing and provides a method by which the driver software
can keep track of which blocks have been retrieved by the CPU.
Therefore, the second call to retrieve a block of data returns
the next block of available data (Figure 2c). Meanwhile, the background
acquisition process continues to transfer data into the circular
buffer. When the last block of the buffer is filled with data,
the process is reinitialized and data is acquired into the first
block of data (Figure 2d). The CPU continues to retrieve the oldest
block of unretrieved data, and the circular buffer is continuously
refilled with newly acquired data. Assuming that the blocks of
data are retrieved in time by the CPU, this process can proceed
indefinitely.<HR>

<PRE>
                                                                               
The circular buffer is segmented into   The first block of data is copied to   
six blocks and the transfer buffer      the transfer buffer for processing.    
holds temporary copies of acquired      Meanwhile, several blocks of data are  
blocks.                                 acquired into the buffer.  A marker    
                                        keeps track of retrieved blocks.       
After the first block is processed,     When the acquisition reaches the end   
the second block is retrieved and       of the buffer, it is reinitialized to  
processed.                              the beginning of the buffer.           
</PRE>
<HR>

<P>
<B>Figure 2. Sequence of Filling and Retrieving Data Blocks During
Double Buffering</B>
<H2>Throughput Considerations</H2>

<P>
This process of retrieving and processing acquired blocks of data
can continue without interruption as long as the CPU can process
each block of data within a certain period of time. If the CPU
cannot copy the data in a block to the transfer buffer before
the data acquisition process begins writing new data into that
block, the block is overwritten and the data is lost. Continuing
the example of Figure 2, this situation is depicted in Figure
3. When the retrieval of block 4 is attempted, the block has already
been overwritten with new data and the previous data is lost.
The software should be able to detect and report this condition.
To sustain a double-buffered data acquisition operation indefinitely,
the CPU must be able to process the blocks of data at least as
fast as the blocks are acquired. Therefore, throughput rates of
double-buffered acquisition depend on the speed and efficiency
with which the CPU can process each block of acquired data and
also handle any other tasks required by the application.<HR>

<P>
                                                             
                 <BR>
Processing of blocks by the CPU is taking too long, so new data
(block 10)     <BR>
overwrites block 4, which has not been processed yet by the CPU.
              <HR>

<P>
<B>Figure 3. Overwrite Condition</B>
<P>
In general, the process of handling an individual block of data
consists of three tasks: copying the block of data to the transfer
buffer, checking markers and status registers for overwrite or
other error conditions, and processing the block of data. This
last task may involve storing the data to disk, reducing the data,
or calculating new control values as part of a PID loop. Driver
software that supports double buffering typically handles the
tasks of copying blocks to the transfer buffer and error checking.
These tasks are optimized to be as efficient as possible. In most
cases, the time required by the CPU to perform these tasks is
negligible compared to that of processing the block of data.
<P>
Because the bottleneck of double-buffered applications almost
always is the task of actually processing the acquired blocks
of data, the programmer must carefully develop this portion of
the application to be as efficient as possible. Using a powerful
CPU and an efficient programming language, such as assembly or
C, is helpful. The programmer must also be careful to avoid any
unnecessary time-consuming activities. For time-critical applications,
the programmer must decide which tasks must be done in real time
as the blocks are acquired, and which tasks can be postponed until
the acquisition sequence is finished. For example, graphical and
even simple numeric displays of data can consume a great deal
of valuable CPU time. Also, scaling binary data to voltage levels
or physical values may need to be postponed, streaming only the
raw, unscaled data to disk. Even seemingly harmless tasks such
as updating numeric displays on the computer screen can add a
significant burden to the CPU.
<P>
To illustrate the amount of overhead associated with different
processing operations, Figure 4 shows the time required to process
one block of 1000 data points acquired from a National Instruments
NB-MIO-16 data acquisition board and a National Instruments NB-DMA2800
DMA controller board using LabVIEW&#174;, a National Instruments
software system for the Macintosh. Also illustrated is the time
window used to acquire one block of 1000 points sampled at two
different sample rates. This time window is the amount of time
available to process each block of data, if the operation is to
proceed without overwriting data. Notice that a block of data
acquired at the higher sampling rate of 100 ksamples/sec can be
retrieved and stored to disk unscaled within the required time.
However, if the data is first scaled and then stored to disk,
the process cannot be sustained even at the slower rate of 25
ksamples/sec. Also notice the extreme costliness of graphical
data plots on this system. Real-time graphical plots of data are
only viable for very low bandwidth applications. It is very important
to remember that the times illustrated in Figure 4 are specific
to that particular system only and can vary a great deal from
system to system.

<P>
One of the most frequently used applications of double-buffered
data acquisition is continuous and seamless acquisition of data
directly to the hard disk. When the number of data points to be
acquired is greater than the amount of available computer memory,
and a non-interrupted record of the data is required, double-buffered
data acquisition techniques are used to continuously stream the
data to disk. Streaming data to disk is a direct application of
double buffering: as blocks of data are retrieved from the circular
buffer by the CPU, they are written to a data file.
<P>
The speed at which data can be acquired and written to the hard
disk depends on a number of factors and is difficult to predict
for a given system. The speed of the processor, the efficiency
of the software, and the speed and structure of the hard disk
all effect the throughput to disk. For a given system, it is probably
not easy to increase the speed of the CPU. However, the code executed
by the CPU can be optimized for maximum efficiency. As mentioned
earlier, it is important to avoid operations that are not absolutely
necessary, such as calculations or screen displays and messages.
Instead, these operations should be performed when the acquisition
is finished.
<P>
The speed and structure of the hard disk is a very important factor
in determining stream-to-disk throughputs. Disk-drive manufacturers
quote burst transfer rates and seek rates, but do not reveal the
sustained data rate. For example, a heavily fragmented disk slows
the transfer rate because the blocks of a data file are not contiguous
and there is more movement of the disk head. Disk optimizing programs
are available that decrease disk fragmentation and create more
contiguous space on the disk, which can help increase sustainable
throughputs to the disk. Given the many factors involved, the
best way to determine the rate at which data can be streamed to
disk is to do real-life testing on the specific computer system.
<P>
Refer to the Appendix B and Appendix C of this application note
for programming examples that demonstrate programming a stream-to-disk
application.
<H2>Conclusion</H2>

<P>
Double buffering is a data acquisition software technique for
continuously acquiring large amounts of data with limited available
system memory. Because data is collected into one buffer while
the CPU concurrently processes data collected in another buffer,
double buffering allows large amounts of data to be collected,
processed, or streamed directly to disk without interruption.
<P>
However, double buffering may not be practical for high-speed
acquisition applications. The throughput of a double-buffered
acquisition is typically limited by the ability of the CPU to
process the data within a given period of time. Specifically,
blocks of data must be processed at least as fast as the rate
at which the blocks are acquired. For many applications, this
requirement depends on the speed and efficiency of the computer
system and programming language. The use of DMA to transfer the
acquired data is very important for obtaining high throughputs.
In addition, certain time-consuming tasks, such as scaling or
displaying data, may need to be postponed until the acquisition
is completed.
<P>
National Instruments data acquisition driver software implements
a powerful and flexible double buffering scheme. Programmers have
a high degree of flexibility in configuring their circular buffer,
with options for several triggering modes, and in retrieving data
from the circular buffer. In addition, the driver software provides
the error checking required for data integrity.
<H2>Appendix A</H2>

<H2>Circular Buffer Implementation</H2>

<P>
While double buffering is a software technique, the actual implementation
depends on the hardware used. For example, different characteristics
of DMA controllers are reflected in the structures of the circular
buffers used by National Instruments driver software. On the 
<BR>
Macintosh II platform, National Instruments offers the LabVIEW
and LabDriver&#174; for Macintosh software packages. On the PC
platform, National Instruments offers the LabWindows&#174; and
LabDriver for DOS software packages.
<P>
LabVIEW is a complete instrumentation software system for data
acquisition, instrument control, DSP, data analysis, graphics,
and data presentation. With LabVIEW you can graphically build
software modules called virtual instruments (VIs) that have front
panel user interfaces and block diagram programs. LabVIEW also
includes a library of VIs for acquiring data and generating signals
with NB Series data acquisition boards.
<P>
LabDriver for Macintosh controls all NB Series data acquisition
boards from conventional programming languages. LabDriver for
Macintosh is a library of functions for programming the NB Series
data acquisition boards from MPW C, THINK C, THINK Pascal, Microsoft
QuickBASIC, and any language that can be used with system toolbox
device manager calls.
<P>
LabWindows is a set of software tools for developing data acquisition
and control systems using Microsoft C and QuickBASIC-compatible
libraries. LabWindows uses a function panel for interactive configuration
and control of PC-based National Instruments data acquisition
boards. Function panels automatically generate Microsoft C and
QuickBASIC source code that can be executed interactively or compiled
as a stand-alone application. LabWindows has libraries to acquire
data and includes functions for formatting, analyzing, and graphing
data.
<P>
LabDriver for DOS is a library of functions for programming all
PC/XT/AT/EISA Series data acquisition boards from Microsoft C
or QuickBASIC.
<H3>Macintosh Implementation</H3>

<P>
The Intel 82380 DMA controller chip, used on the National Instruments
NB-DMA-8-G and NB-DMA2800 DMA controller boards for Macintosh
computers, includes a feature called <I>buffer chaining</I> that
is useful for implementing double buffering. With buffer chaining,
at the end of every buffer transferred by the DMA controller,
the CPU can seamlessly program the DMA controller with the address
of the next buffer to be used. The LabVIEW and LabDriver for Macintosh
software uses this buffer chaining feature for double buffering
by programming the DMA controller with the address of the next
block of the circular buffer. With buffer chaining, the user has
a great deal of flexibility in defining the size and number of
data blocks comprising the circular buffer. The user makes a configuration
call to set the total size of the circular buffer and the size
of each data block.
<P>
<B>Figure A-1. Double Buffering with LabVIEW</B>
<H3>PC Implementation</H3>

<P>
IBM PC and compatible computers use the Intel 8237 DMA controller
chip. Unlike the 82380 DMA controller, the 8237 does not implement
buffer chaining. Therefore, the LabWindows and LabDriver software
implement double-buffered data acquisition for these computers
using a circular buffer divided into two <I>half-buffers</I> of
equal size. Using only two data blocks also simplifies programming
and reduces software overhead. The user simply specifies the total
size of the circular buffer. Each call to retrieve a block of
acquired data returns one half-buffer of the circular buffer.
For greater flexibility, LabDriver also has routines to retrieve
smaller segments of each half-buffer without disturbing the acquisition.
<P>

<H2>Appendix B</H2>

<H2>Example of Streaming Data to Disk with LabVIEW</H2>

<P>
This appendix presents a common use of double-buffered data acquisition:
streaming data continuously from a National Instruments NB-MIO-16
data acquisition board to a hard disk using LabVIEW.
<P>
The approach to streaming data to disk is straightforward: as
blocks are retrieved from the circular buffer, they are immediately
written to a data file. As long as the CPU can write the data
to the file as fast as data is acquired, data can be streamed
to disk indefinitely, or at least until the hard disk fills up.
See <I>Throughput Considerations</I> for a discussion of the factors
affecting throughput. In particular, the use of a DMA controller
board, such as the National Instruments NB-DMA2800 block mode
DMA board, is very important for most disk streaming applications.
Figure B-1 illustrates the main components of a LabVIEW program
that streams data from the NB-MIO-16 to disk.
<P>
While this is a LabVIEW example, the data acquisition functions
used are equivalent to the LabDriver for Macintosh (see Appendix
A) data acquisition functions. An application written with LabDriver
for Macintosh would be based on the same flowchart.
<P>
<B>Note:</B> The LabVIEW and LabDriver for Macintosh software
packages include more sophisticated program examples for streaming
data to disk. The program included here is greatly simplified
to help demonstrate the fundamental components of double-buffering
and streaming data to disk.<BR>
<BR>

<P>
<B>Figure B-1. Flowchart for Streaming Data to Disk with LabVIEW
</B>
<P>
The functions <TT>DAQ2Get</TT> and <TT>SCAN2Get</TT> are used
to retrieve acquired blocks of data in sequence. LabDriver for
Macintosh and LabVIEW provide an additional method of retrieving
blocks of data from the circular buffer, referred to as <I>tapping
</I>. The functions <TT>DAQ2Tap</TT> and <TT>SCAN2Tap</TT> retrieve
the <I>latest</I> block of data acquired from the I/O board. By
contrast, <TT>DAQ2Get</TT> and <TT>SCAN2Get</TT> retrieve the
oldest block of data that has not been retrieved. In a stream-to-disk
application, a continuous, gap-free record of the data is desired.
Therefore, the <TT>DAQ2Get</TT> or <TT>SCAN2Get</TT> function
is used.
<H2>Front Panel for Stream to Disk Example VI</H2>

<P>
The front panel, or graphical user interface, is shown in Figure
B-2. The front panel includes controls for setting the input channel,
the sampling rate, and the total number of points to store to
the hard disk. The parameters needed to set up the circular buffer,
circular buffer size, and block size are also set by the user
on the front panel.
<P>
<B>Note:</B> A graph display is included on the front panel, along
with a <B>PLOT ENABLE</B> switch that is used to enable or disable
the graph. Avoid graphical displays of data, except for very slow
stream-to-disk applications.
<P>

</B>
<H2>Block Diagram for Stream to Disk Example VI</H2>

<P>
Figures B-3 through B-7 show the block diagram, or code, for the
Stream to Disk Example VI. LabVIEW VIs are programmed graphically
using the graphical language G. A block diagram of the problem
is <I>drawn</I> using icons that are connected with wires that
determine the flow of data in the program. This particular VI
consists of five Sequence frames that are executed in order. The
labeled terminals located to the left of each panel (and within
two of the panels) represent data input from the front panel controls.
<P>
<U><B>Sequence 0</B></U>
<P>
First, the file to store the acquired data is created using the
<TT>New</TT> <TT>File</TT> <TT>Dialog</TT> function. A different
VI can be substituted here if an existing file is to be opened
and appended to. The <TT>Set EOF</TT> function is used to allocate
the space required for all of the data to be stored. This way,
the allocation is done ahead of time, so the additional space
does not need to be allocated as the data is being acquired. Each
sample acquired requires two bytes of storage space.
<P>
<B>Figure B-3. Sequence 0: Create the Data File</B>
<P>
<U><B>Sequence 1</B></U>
<P>
The NB-MIO-16 board is now configured for double-buffered data
acquisition using <TT>DAQ2Config</TT>. This function allocates
a circular buffer divided into individual data blocks. The size
of the circular buffer and the size of each block, set by the
user on the front panel of the VI, is wired into this function.

<P>
<B>Figure B-4. Sequence 1: Configure the NB-MIO-16 for Double
Buffering</B>
<P>
<U><B>Sequence 2</B></U>
<P>
The data acquisition operation is initiated with the function
<TT>DAQ2Start</TT>. This function begins a single-channel data
acquisition sequence. Data is acquired and transferred into the
circular buffer as a background task using DMA, if a DMA board
is present. The rate at which data is sampled is determined by
the <B>TIMEBASE</B> and <B>SAMPLE INTERVAL</B> front panel controls
wired to the <TT>DAQ2Start</TT> function. For multiple-channel
data acquisition, <TT>SCAN_Setup</TT> and <TT>SCAN2Start</TT>are
used.<BR>

<P>
<B>Figure B-5. Sequence 2: Initiate Start of Double-Buffered Acquisition
</B>
<P>
<U><B>Sequence 3</B></U>
<P>
The program now enters a repetitive loop of retrieving a block
of data from the circular buffer (using <TT>DAQ2Get</TT>) and
processing the writing of the block of data to the disk (using
<TT>Write</TT> <TT>File</TT>). The <TT>Write</TT> <TT>File</TT>function
requires a string variable type, so the block of data is first
converted to a binary format string using the <TT>Type Cast</TT>
function. If enabled, the VI also plots the data to the front
panel graph. For multiple-channel data acquisition, <TT>SCAN2Get
</TT> is used to retrieve blocks of data.<BR>

<P>
<B>Figure B-6. Sequence 3: Repeatedly Retrieve Blocks of Data
and Write Data to Disk</B>
<P>
<U><B>Sequence 4</B></U>
<P>
After the predetermined number of blocks are written to the hard
disk, <TT>DAQ2Clear</TT> is called to stop and disable the double-buffered
data acquisition and <TT>Close</TT> <TT>File</TT> is called to
close the data file.<BR>

<P>
<B>Figure B-7. Sequence 4: Disable the Double-Buffered Acquisition
and Close the Data File</B>
<H2>Retrieving Data from Disk</H2>

<P>
After this VI has finished executing, the data file contains the
desired number of data points stored in binary two-byte integer
format. For slower applications, you can store the data in ASCII
format. However, the conversion from binary format to ASCII format
increases overhead time and may not be possible for faster applications.
Additionally, binary format is the most space-efficient method,
using only two bytes of hard disk space per data point.
<P>
To retrieve the data from the hard disk for post-processing or
review, the binary data must be interpreted by the program as
two-byte integer data. For example, if using LabVIEW, the <TT>Read
File</TT> function is used to retrieve the data from the file
as a binary string of data. This binary string must be converted
back to two-byte integers. This conversion is accomplished by
using the reverse of the process used when storing the data. The
<TT>Type</TT> <TT>Cast</TT> function can again be used to convert
the binary string into an array of two-byte integers.
<H2>Appendix C</H2>

<H2>Example of Processing and Streaming Data to Disk with LabWindows
</H2>

<P>
This appendix presents a common use of double-buffered data acquisition,
processing <I>and</I> streaming data continuously from a National
Instruments AT-MIO-16F-5 data acquisition board to a hard disk
using LabWindows. Because LabWindows includes high-level routines
for streaming binary data directly from National Instruments data
acquisition boards, this example program demonstrates an application
that also scales the data to voltage levels and monitors the statistics
of each block of data (by computing mean and standard deviation)
as the data is acquired. It is assumed that the needed throughput
is low enough to allow this extra processing.
<P>
<B>Note:</B> For applications that require continuous streaming
of data to disk and do not require real-time processing or access
to the data as it is acquired, LabWindows and LabDriver for DOS
provide a series of high-level functions (<TT>DAQ_to_Disk</TT>,
<TT>SCAN_to_Disk</TT>, and <TT>Lab_SCAN_to_Disk</TT>) that acquire
data directly to disk with a single function call.
<P>
The flowchart for this example is illustrated in Figure C-1. Most
double-buffered data acquisition applications follow a similar
procedure, with variation in the type of data processing performed.
<P>
While this is a LabWindows example, the data acquisition functions
used are equivalent to the LabDriver for DOS (see Appendix A)
data acquisition functions. An application written with LabDriver
for DOS would be based on the same flowchart.<BR>

processor.  For software, programming methods-from low-level machine code to high-level DSP operating 
systems-are compared.  The application note concludes with examples of how DSP is being integrated into test-
and-measurement systems ranging from audio and speech analysis to image processing and real-time control.<P>
<P>
<B><A NAME = defining></A>Defining DSP</B><P><B>
</B>Perhaps the most common misconception among prospective users of DSP technology is that DSP is for 
signal processing only-if a person is not doing Fast Fourier Transforms (FFTs), then he or she has no use for DSP 
technology.  Unfortunately, by limiting their perspective of DSP, these prospective users are missing some of the 
most powerful numerical processing capabilities available today.<P>
The term <I>DSP</I> is somewhat misleading because it is usually associated with the FFTs, digital filters, and 
spectral analysis theories that are taught as part of the classic DSP curriculum.  This is not to say that DSP is 
unrelated to frequency domain analysis techniques-spectral analysis remains an integral part of DSP 
technology.<P>
A more appropriate definition for DSP as it applies toward the computer industry can be derived from the name 
<I>digital signal processing</I> itself-DSP is the <I>processing</I> of analog <I>signals</I> in the 
<I>digital</I> domain.  Real-world signals, such as voltages, pressures, and temperatures, are converted to their 
digital equivalents at discrete time intervals for processing by the CPU of a digital computer.  The result is an 
array of numerical values stored in memory, ready to be processed.<P>
DSP is useful in almost any application that requires the high-speed processing of a large amount of numerical 
data.  The data can be anything from position and velocity information for a closed-loop control system, to two-
dimensional video images, to digitized audio and vibration signals.<P>
This application note describes DSP from an application point of view to demonstrate the many different and 
effective uses for digital signal and array processing.  The common factor in all of these applications is the need to 
do extremely high-speed calculations on large amounts of data in real time.<P>
<P>
<B><A NAME = what></A>What Is Real Time?</B><P><B>
</B>The concept of <I>real-time</I> processing is so subjective that it is almost impossible to apply an absolute 
definition to it.  For example, a real-time temperature monitoring system might require an update rate of only 5 
times/sec to control the climate of an environment, whereas a real-time digital audio system might require the 
ability to process data at up to 48 kHz, or 48,000 times/sec.  Thus, a system that operates in real time for 
temperature monitoring would be inadequate for a digital audio application.  Likewise, a system that operates in 
real time for a digital audio application might be inadequate for radio- or microwave-frequency experiments.<P>
What is a good definition of real time?  A good definition for this subjective concept is itself subjective-real-time 
processing depends upon the situation at hand.  If an application to be controlled or analyzed requires that time-
critical functions be completed within a given time interval, then a system can be called a real-time system if it 
will completely execute the necessary functions within the given time interval <I>for all cases</I>.  More 
specifically, real time implies real time within the constraints of the system of interest.<P>
<P>
<B><A NAME = plug></A>Plug-in DSP Boards Deliver Real-Time 
Power</B><P><B>
</B>You can attain real-time processing on the PC today with a fundamental change in the concept and 
architecture of personal computing.  System designers are introducing DSP boards that plug into PCs to produce 
multiple-processor systems that are more powerful in computationally intensive tasks than many single-CPU 
minicomputers and workstations.<P>
Plug-in DSP boards take advantage of the powerful digital signal processors being developed by companies like 
TI, AT&amp T, and Motorola.  DSP chips such as the TI TMS320C30, illustrated in Figure 1, can perform 33.33 
million floating-point operations per second (MFLOPS) or 16 million instructions per second (MIPS).  The 
number of MFLOPS performed is an indicator of the <I>processing power</I> of a chip.<P>
Figure 1.  Overview of TI TMS320C30 DSP Chip Functionality<P>
<P>
DSP chips are high-speed, dedicated microprocessors that have been optimized to perform arithmetic operations 
on the huge amounts of data required by spectral analysis and signal processing algorithms.  They are similar in 
architecture to RISC processors, in which a small set of frequently used instructions has been optimized at the 
expense of less frequently used operations.  Additionally, nearly all of these instructions execute in a single CPU 
clock cycle.<P>
In addition to the high-performance CPU, many DSP chips include I/O functionality, timing circuitry, and high-
speed memory onboard the chip itself.  Serial ports, counter/timers, direct memory access (DMA) controllers, and 
instruction caches work together with the CPU to provide the DSP board with maximum performance and 
throughput.<P>
With the addition of a plug-in DSP board to the PC, the basic architecture of the personal computer is changed 
from a single-CPU system to a dual-processor workstation.  Real-time tasks can run on the optimized hardware of 
the DSP board while system-level requirements, such as I/O and disk accesses, are handled by the PC 
microprocessor.  With an appropriate interprocessor communication protocol, the two CPUs run independently of 
one another, and the system (PC and DSP board) achieves real-time performance.<P>
<P>
<B><A NAME = software></A>Software for Maximum Flexibility and 
Performance</B><P><B>
</B>Until recently, designers had to program the DSP hardware at its lowest level to fully use its real-time 
processing power.  The idea of using assembly language to program a DSP chip was often too daunting for all but 
the most experienced software engineers.  Thus, a technology barrier existed between the powerful DSP hardware 
and the ability of the average scientist or engineer to program it.  Many system designers who could benefit 
greatly from DSP technology did not use it because of the seemingly insurmountable obstacle of software 
development.<P>
Vendors are breaking this technology barrier by offering a variety of software tools for the new generation of DSP 
plug-in boards.  These software products, ranging from low-level debugging software to high-level DSP operating 
systems, make programming the DSP hardware as easy as possible.<P>
DSP software tools can be divided into five categories-hardware evaluation and development tools, optimizing 
cross-compilers, off-the-shelf DSP libraries, block diagram development environments, and special DSP operating 
systems.<P>
At the lowest level are the traditional DSP <I>hardware evaluation and development tools</I>, including 
assemblers, linkers, and debuggers.  Maximum performance can be achieved by programs developed in this 
environment, because such programs take full advantage of the hardware.  The obvious disadvantage is the 
requirement for extensive programming expertise and special knowledge of DSP hardware.<P>
The next category includes <I>optimizing cross-compilers</I>, which convert programs written in high-level 
languages like C into their assembly language equivalents.  Code development in high-level languages represents 
an enormous increase in software productivity, providing results comparable to assembly language in a fraction of 
the development time.  There is no such thing as a perfect cross-compiler, however, and cross-compiled programs 
are neither as efficient nor as fast as programs developed in assembly language.<P>
Manufacturers of DSP hardware also offer <I>off-the-shelf DSP libraries</I> of ready-to-use functions, such as 
FFTs, filters, and windows, which are common to most DSP applications.  Off-the-shelf DSP libraries relieve 
programmers from having to develop these algorithms and require no special knowledge of the DSP hardware to 
use them.  These libraries represent a finite number of the DSP routines, however, and the user must develop 
additional routines to tailor the functions for a working application.<P>
Developers can also design their applications using <I>block diagram development environments</I>.  An 
example of a block diagram development environment<I> </I>is shown in Figure 2.  Most DSP developers start 
with a conceptual drawing, or block diagram, of the system they are building.  Using the block diagram approach, 
you can construct signal-flow diagrams on the computer and compile them to take advantage of the DSP 
hardware.  Block diagram development is limited only by the amount of DSP functionality provided by the 
application program and memory constraints of the computer.<P>
<P>
<P>
Figure 2.  Block Diagram Development Environment<P>
<P>
At the highest level, special <I>DSP operating systems</I> provide software primitives, such as I/O and memory 
management, that comprise a virtual DSP computer.  Because most DSP chips are designed without regard to the 
platform on which they will run, operating systems are not usually included with them.  The intent of the DSP 
operating system is to make programming DSP hardware similar to programming general-purpose CPUs.  The 
added functionality of the operating system, however, introduces a substantial increase in software overhead.<P>
<P>
<B><A NAME = 
applications></A>Applications</B><P><B>
</B>The performance and versatility of plug-in DSP boards bring real-time processing power to a wide variety of 
application areas.  In this section, several examples of DSP technology are presented.  In each case, the 
applications were developed using a Macintosh II computer, a TI TMS320C30-based DSP board, two 16-bit 
ADCs, and two 16-bit DACs (for cases requiring data acquisition).  For software, several options were used, 
including a cross-compiler for C, a DSP assembler, an off-the-shelf analysis library, and a block diagram 
development environment.<P>
<P>
<B><A NAME = general></A>General-Purpose DSP</B><P><B>
</B>DSP chips are optimized to efficiently process large buffers of data, making them ideal for numerically 
intensive DSP algorithms, such as FFTs, convolutions, and digital filters.   These algorithms involve repetitive 
multiplications and additions on data that is often sampled at rates exceeding 8 ksamples/sec.<P>
DSP chips can execute more than one operation at a time.  The most common example is parallel multiplication 
and accumulation.  A multiplication and an addition can be made in a single instruction cycle.  Signal processing 
applications can be designed to take advantage of these multiple operations to significantly increase execution 
speed.<P>
<B>Application:  1,024-Point Real FFT</B><P><B>
</B>An optimized 1,024-point real FFT takes 198 msec to execute on the Macintosh II CPU.  The same algorithm 
optimized for the TMS320C30 executes in 3.48 msec.  In terms of real-time processing on a signal being acquired, 
a 200-msec execution time represents an update rate of 5 times/sec, with an effective throughput of 5 
ksamples/sec.  With a DSP chip, the update rate is increased by over 50 times to almost 300 times/sec, for a 
throughput of 300 ksamples/sec.  Table 1 compares the processing speed of the Motorola 68020 to the TI 
TMS320C30.  <P>

</PRE>
<B><A NAME = real_time></A>Real-Time Control</B><P><B>
</B>One of the most useful benefits of including a DSP board in real-time control applications is that time-critical 
tasks can be distributed among the DSP processor and the host CPU for maximum performance.  Real-time tasks 
can be programmed to run on the DSP chip without the threat of interruption, while other noncritical tasks are 
executed on the main CPU.  With the tasks divided in this manner, system-level interrupts, such as keyboard input 
and disk accesses, are serviced by the main CPU and do not effect the real-time program running on the DSP 
board.<P>
DSP is a powerful solution for functions that must execute within a specified time interval, regardless of external 
interruptions.  In the past, closed-loop programs running on the main CPU were at the mercy of unexpected 
system-level interrupts.  Distributed programs that use a DSP board for dedicated parallel processing now 
eliminate that worry.<P>
<P>
<B>Application:  Closed-Loop Control</B><P><B>
</B>One of the best-known implementations of a closed-loop controller is the Proportional-Integral-Derivative 
(PID) controller.  The digital transfer function of a PID controller can be implemented easily in software on a DSP 
chip.  This chip, with fast ADCs and DACs, can be used to create an efficient closed-loop controller.  With the 
instruction cycle of the TMS320C30 being 60 nsec, a typical PID algorithm executes in less than 1 µsec.  
Assuming arbitrarily fast ADCs and DACs, you can implement a real-time PID controller with a maximum 
processing rate greater than 1 MHz.<P>

<B><A NAME = graphics></A>Graphics/Imaging</B><P><B>
</B>Graphics and image processing are two application areas for which the advantages of DSP are not readily 
apparent.  Graphic images are two-dimensional arrays of numbers.  DSP hardware is optimized to operate on 
arrays and is easily programmed to process the huge amounts of data needed for image processing.<P>
<P><B>
</B><B>Application:  128-by-128 Real Two-Dimensional FFT</B><P><B>
</B>As with its one-dimensional counterpart, the two-dimensional FFT is a key function in two-dimensional 
image processing.  A two-dimensional FFT, shown in Figure 4, is implemented by running an optimized one-
dimensional FFT on each row of the two-dimensional image, then running the one-dimensional FFT on each of 
the columns of the resulting real and imaginary matrices.  Using the Macintosh CPU, a 128-by-128 two-
dimensional FFT executes in 11.47 sec.  The same algorithm coded to run on the DSP hardware executes in 0.23 
sec.<P>
Figure 4.  Two-Dimensional FFT<P>
<P>
<B><A NAME = acoustics></A>Acoustics and Speech 
Processing</B><P><B>
</B>Acoustics and speech applications operate on data in the audio frequency range (DC to 20 kHz).  Acquisition 
and analysis programs working in this type of environment most commonly use sampling rates between 8 kHz and 
48 kHz to fully characterize the audio frequency data.<P>
With input signals near the upper audio frequencies, data must be acquired at up to 48 kHz to satisfy the Nyquist 
criterion.  At this rate, ADCs produce one point every 20.83 µsec, or 1,024 points every 21.3 msec.  For real-time 
processing of acoustic signals, execution of analysis algorithms must satisfy this constraint.  Not much work can 
be done by a general-purpose microprocessor in only 20.83 µsec.  However, a DSP chip with a 60-nsec instruction 
cycle, such as the TI TMS320C30, can execute almost 350 instructions in that amount of time.<P>
Notice that for lower sampling rates, such as 16 kHz or 22.05 kHz, processing time is less stringent and real-time 
analysis is easier to achieve.<P>
DSP technology has been an integral part of acoustics and speech processing for years.  Recent advances in digital 
audio research, speech recognition, radar, and sonar would not have been possible without the real-time 
processing capabilities of DSP.<P>
<B>Application:  10-Band Stereo Graphic Equalizer</B><P><B>
</B>A 10-band graphic equalizer, shown in Figure 5, is implemented using a TI TMS320C30-based DSP board 
and an audio-frequency I/O board.  Stereo data is sampled at 48 kHz, filtered by 20 bandpass filters (10 per 
channel), scaled by a user-selectable gain value at each frequency, and recombined for output.  All of this 
processing-two A/D conversions, 20 bandpass filters, 20 instantaneous power calculations, combination of the 20 
bandpass outputs, and two D/A conversions-is completed in less than the 20.83 µsec allotted by the 48-kHz I/O 
sampling rate.<P>

<B><A NAME = instrumentation></A>Instrumentation</B><P><B>
</B>Another type of application made possible by DSP technology is <I>real-time virtual instrumentation</I>.  
With the wide selection of plug-in A/D boards, GPIB interfaces, and waveform generators available, computers 
can be programmed to implement the characteristics of many stand-alone laboratory instruments.  Plug-in DSP 
boards add the power of real-time processing to these virtual laboratory instruments.<P>
In addition to the power that PC-based virtual instruments (VIs) have to offer, virtual instrumentation also has 
flexibility and cost advantages over traditional laboratory instrumentation.  With virtual instrumentation, the 
functionality of the instrument is implemented in software, interfacing ADCs and DSP boards into a desired 
analysis system.  Changing the functionality of a VI is as simple as changing the software that defines the flow of 
data within the instrument.  Virtual instrumentation also reduces equipment costs.  There is no need to purchase 
separate instrumentation for each function in the experiment.<P>
<P>
<B>Application:  Audio-Frequency Fourier Analyzer (AFFA)</B><P><B>
</B>AFFA, shown in Figure 6, is a VI that transforms a Macintosh II computer equipped with a TI TMS320C30-
based DSP board and an audio-frequency I/O board into a real-time dual-display Fourier analyzer.  AFFA 
completely replaces stand-alone audio-frequency (DC-to-20 kHz) Fourier analyzers.<P>
AFFA performs real-time processing and display for eight spectral analysis functions-correlation, coherence, 
impulse response, transfer function, magnitude/phase spectrum, power spectrum, X-Y plot, and time waveform 
display.  Additionally, eight optional windowing functions are available to reduce the effects of spectral leakage, 
and five optional averaging functions can be used to increase signal-to-noise ratio.<P>
Using the dual-display capabilities of AFFA, you can create some powerful processing configurations.  For 
example, Display I can be set to display the transfer function of a system, showing the frequency characteristics of 
that system, while Display II calculates the coherence function and shows the validity of the transfer function over 
all input frequencies.  As another example, Display I can be set to show the baseband power spectrum of a signal 
while Display II shows a narrow band (as small as 5 Hz) of that signal.<P>

<B><A NAME = summary></A>Summary</B><P>
By changing the fundamental architecture of the personal computer into a parallel-processing environment, DSP 
boards provide a quantum leap in performance over many powerful single-CPU computers.  Numerically intensive 
applications can be implemented on PC-based acquisition and analysis systems, replacing dedicated test-and-
measurement equipment.  With the powerful software support available for these plug-in DSP boards, system 
designers can complete in weeks what once took months or even years of research and development.<P>
DSP technology is the choice of scientists and engineers who want a cost-effective solution to their processing 
needs.  With the wide selection of hardware and software systems available, researchers can harness the power of 
DSP for use in real-time analysis applications.  The power of DSP is limited only by the developer's ability to 
combine these components into real-time processing environments.<P>

<H2>Introduction<!--Introduction--></H2>

<P>
Some of the most powerful computational engines available today
required years of research and development by high-technology
companies to produce. General-purpose microprocessors for the
personal computer, like the Motorola 68040 and the Intel 80486,
bring to the desktop a level of processing power that once required
mainframe computers occupying full rooms. In many cases, the numerical
processing capabilities of these microprocessors are being doubled
in as little as <BR>
one year.
<P>
Even with all this power, personal computers have had very limited
effectiveness in real-time, computationally intensive tasks. The
single CPU architecture of the PC puts too many demands on the
CPU&ETH;updating graphics, servicing interrupts, acquiring data
from the keyboard, accessing the disk drive, in addition to running
the application program as fast as possible&ETH;to give the user
true real-time performance. Application programs running at full
speed on the main CPU are interrupted every time a system-level
operation is required, producing periods of latency which affect
the continuous execution of real-time loops.
<P>
Additionally, real-time processing on the PC is not easily attained
by waiting for these single microprocessor systems to become powerful
enough to perform all of its tasks in real time. As the power
of the microprocessor increases, the demands of the PC environment
will also. Faster disks, better graphics, and better graphical
user interfaces (GUIs) are examples of the demands of the PC rising
to fully use the increasing power of microprocessors.
<P>
This application note discusses the fundamentals of digital signal
processing (DSP) boards and their use in real-time tasks. The
application note also discusses how you can change the architecture
of your PC using a DSP board to ensure greater processing power
and performance in applications.
<H2>Real-Time Processing on the PC<!--Real-Time Processing on

<P>
Real-time processing on the PC can be attained today with a fundamental
change in the concept and architecture of personal computing.
Rather than waiting for the microprocessor to become powerful
enough to fulfill all of its requirements, system designers are
introducing plug-in DSP boards into their PCs and producing multiple-processor
environments that are more powerful for numerically intensive
applications than many single-CPU minicomputers and workstations,
as shown in Figure 1.

<P>
By adding a plug-in DSP board to the PC, the basic architecture
of the personal computer is transformed from a single-CPU system
into a dual-processor workstation. Real-time tasks can be delegated
to run on the optimized hardware of the DSP board, while system-level
requirements, such as I/O operations and disk accesses, run on
the host microprocessor. With an appropriate interprocessor communication
protocol, the two CPUs can run independently of one another, and
true, uninterrupted, real-time performance can be achieved on
the personal computer.
<H2>DSP Architecture<!--DSP Architecture--></H2>

<P>
Plug-in DSP boards take advantage of the powerful DSP chips being
developed by companies such as Texas Instruments, AT&amp;T, and
Motorola. DSP chips such as the Texas Instruments TMS320C30 deliver
33.33 million floating-point operations per second (MFLOPS) or
16 million instructions per second (MIPS) of processing power.
When used in conjunction with A/D and D/A converters, a well-designed
plug-in DSP board has more real-time processing power than workstations
that cost thousands of dollars more, as shown in the benchmark
comparison in Figure 2.
<P>
<B>Figure 2. Benchmark Comparison of Reduced Instruction Set Computers
(RISC), Complex Instruction Set Computers (CISC), and DSP Chips
</B>
<P>
DSP boards are high-speed, dedicated microprocessors that have
been optimized to perform arithmetic operations on the huge amounts
of data required by spectral analysis and signal processing algorithms.
DSP boards maximize the performance of mathematical operations
that are common to many numerical analysis algorithms.
<P>
DSP chips can also execute more than one operation at a time.
Many signal processing applications can significantly increase
execution speed by performing multiple operations simultaneously.
For example, the response of many physical systems can be accurately
predicted by a weighted combination of previous outputs and states
of the system. The prediction algorithm is often implemented using
a difference equation. One of the most common examples of a difference
equation is the Fast Fourier Transform (FFT). Mathematically,
this involves <I>multiplying</I> the current state of the system
by some weighting factor and <I>adding</I>it to the previously
computed states and outputs of the system. DSP chips can execute
the multiplication and addition in a single instruction cycle,
making them ideal for high-performance numerical processing applications.
<H2>A Computer-on-a-Chip</H2>

<P>
DSP chips are similar in architecture to RISC computers, in which
a small set of frequently used instructions are optimized for
numerical processing at the expense of less frequently used general-purpose
operations. Nearly all of these instructions can execute in a
single CPU clock cycle. This allows maximum performance on the
core set of instructions (such as multiplication and addition)
but requires operations that are not in the reduced set to be
implemented through software (such as floating-point division).
Figure 3 gives an overview of the functionality of the Texas Instruments
TMS320C30 DSP chip.
<P>
<B>Figure 3. Texas Instruments TMS320C30 Chip Functionality Diagram
</B>
<P>
In addition to the high-performance CPU, many DSP chips include
I/O functionality, timing circuitry, and high-speed memory on
the chip itself. Serial ports, counter/timers, DMA controllers,
and instruction caches work together with the CPU to produce maximum
performance and throughput.
<H2>Pipelining<!--Pipelining--></H2>

<P>
Modern microprocessor architectures frequently use pipelining
to operate on several instructions in parallel. As shown in Figure
4, common four-stage pipelines process the following operations
in the order listed for each instruction processed:
<P>
1. Fetch instructions from memory and update the program counter.
<P>
2. Decode the instructions and generate operand addresses.
<P>
3. Read operands from memory (if required).
<P>
4. Execute the necessary operation(s).
<P>
<B>Figure 4. Four-Stage Pipelining Process</B>
<P>
After the pipeline has been filled, each of the four stages is
executed every clock cycle. Notice that each instruction actually
takes four cycles to execute, but because of the pipeline, one
instruction is completed every clock cycle.
<P>
The disadvantage of a pipeline architecture is that conflicts
can occur. These conflicts can be caused by branch instructions
or resource conflicts. Branch instructions require that the program
counter be changed to the address of the new instruction. After
a branch is executed, the three instructions remaining &quot;in
the pipe&quot; are no longer valid and must be flushed before
the new instructions can be executed. Pipeline flushes introduce
a minimum of four clock cycles in which no instructions are executed,
and can significantly affect performance.
<P>
Similarly, the speed of the processor can be reduced by memory
wait-states, which starve the CPU of instructions. A memory wait-state
occurs when an instruction requires operands and must wait a number
of clock cycles before the data can be accessed. A pipeline stall
occurs because no instructions can be executed until the data
becomes available.
<P>
However, code can often be rearranged to reduce the number of
conflicts. Software structures such as <I>zero overhead loops
</I>and <I>delayed branch instructions</I> help minimize conflicts
caused by branches. Zero wait-state memory helps reduce conflicts
caused by memory accesses. Table 1 shows how optimized code minimizes
processing delays.

<H2>Parallelism</H2>

<P>
As demonstrated by the previous discussion of pipelining, the
ability to process several instructions in parallel can significantly
increase the execution speed of a program. DSP chips often have
additional parallelism in operation to further increase the number
of instructions that can be executed.
<P>
Many DSP chips have separate program buses, data buses, and DMA
buses for parallel instruction fetches, data reads and writes,
and DMA operations. The ability to simultaneously access two or
more memory operands and instructions save instruction cycles
for operations requiring multiple operands. DMA controllers can
transfer data in the background without wasting DSP instruction
cycles.
<P>
With increased parallelism comes the increased risk of conflict.
More than one operation might need to access the same data. If
the operations do not execute in the proper order, the results
can be unpredictable. Careful timing and scheduling is required
if an instruction depends on data being manipulated by parallel
instructions.
<H2>Data Types<!--Data Types--></H2>

<P>
DSP chips are available in two arithmetic types corresponding
to the type of data on which they operate&ETH;fixed-integer and
floating-point. Fixed-integer DSP chips operate only on binary
integer data (usually 16 or 24 bits.) Floating-point DSP chips
operate on integer or floating-point numbers (usually 32 bits).
An example of each is shown in Figure 5.
<P>
<B>Figure 5. Floating-Point and Fixed-Integer Representations
</B>
<P>
The first DSP chips were fixed-integer processors. They were simple,
inexpensive hardware architectures that had numerical processing
capabilities far beyond those of general-purpose microprocessors.
Fixed-integer DSP chips have evolved into the extremely fast and
cost-effective CPUs that are common in fax machines and telephone
answering systems.
<P>
With fixed-integer DSP chips, the main disadvantage is the complexity
of programming. Because of their limited dynamic range (16-million
possible values for a 24-bit DSP chip), data for operations as
simple as multiplication and addition must be scaled, both before
and after processing, to prevent overflow. A detailed understanding
of the system being developed is required to create efficient
and accurate programs. This manifests itself in higher development
costs that often negate the benefits of using a low-cost, fixed-integer
chip.
<P>
Floating-point DSP chips are higher end processors that can handle
more numerically intensive scientific applications than the fixed-integer
CPUs. Floating-point DSP chips efficiently handle a large range
of both integer and floating-point data with far more precision
than the fixed-integer DSP chips. The dynamic range of floating-point
DSP chips is larger, and the problems of data scaling and overflow
are eliminated. This makes the application program easier to code.
Development time is minimized, while accuracy is maximized.
<P>
The higher performance of floating-point DSP chips comes with
an associated higher cost&ETH;floating-point chips are often 10
to 100 times more expensive than their fixed-integer counterparts.
The trade-offs of material costs, development requirements, desired
accuracy and speed, and ease of development, however, often make
the floating-point DSP chips well worth their premium price. Table
2 shows a comparison between fixed-integer and floating-point
DSP chips.

<H2>Peripheral Considerations<!--Peripheral Considerations-->
</H2>

<P>
Plug-in DSP boards are designed to process data as quickly as
possible. However, if the peripheral support structure is poorly
designed, the effectiveness of the DSP system decreases considerably.
<P>
The type of memory used to store data has a profound effect on
the efficiency of the DSP chip. Pipeline stalls caused by memory
wait-states introduces a delay in the pipe for every piece of
data accessed. With the DSP chip operating at full speed, such
delays can limit the efficiency of the DSP chip on data-intensive
applications.
<P>
I/O support for the DSP chip also plays a major role in its performance.
DSP chips are limited to a very small amount of very fast memory.
Data must be processed in blocks small enough to fit in memory.
The transfer of data into and out of the chip must be considered.
<P>
For moving the blocks of data, DMA controllers are a necessity.
Using the CPU to perform the memory manipulation is an unnecessary
waste of its power.
<P>
Similarly, the I/O interface between the DSP chip and the external
data source must maximize the data transfer rate. For example,
a 32-bit floating-point CPU manipulates data as 32-bit words.
Input to and output from the chip should consist of full 32-bit
word transfers. Inserting a 32-bit DSP interface into a 16-bit
data source (such as an ISA backplane) is not a good system-level
design because it requires two 16-bit data transfers for every
32-bit word of information.
<P>
Because DSP chips are often used in dual-processor systems, interprocessor
communication must also be taken into consideration. The CPU of
the DSP chip can be over 100 times faster than the general-purpose
microprocessor resident in the PC. Specifying the slower microprocessor
to be master over the faster DSP chip severely restricts its real-time
processing capabilities. Whenever possible, DSP chips should be
given master status over the microprocessor, so the DSP chip can
operate at full speed, without having to request permission.

<P>
Perhaps the most common misconception among prospective users
of DSP technology is that DSP is for signal processing only; these
people think that if they are not doing FFTs, they have no use
for DSP. Unfortunately, by limiting their perspective, these people
mistakenly miss out on all of the power that DSP has to offer.
<P>
DSP is useful in almost any application that requires the high-speed
processing of a large amount of numerical data. Data can be anything
from position and velocity information for a closed-loop control
system, to video images (two-dimensional graphic arrays), to digitized
audio and vibration signals. Table 3 shows a brief outline of
some typical applications for DSP technology.

<H2>Conclusion<!--Conclusion--></H2>

<P>
DSP boards are available for all types of platforms and applications.
DSP boards ensure real-time processing power for a fraction of
the cost of custom-built embedded systems.
<P>
Many numerically intensive applications can now be implemented
on PC-based acquisition and analysis systems, replacing what once
required dedicated test-and-measurement systems. Also, with the
powerful software support available for these plug-in DSP boards,
system designers can complete in weeks what once took months and
even years of research and development.
<P>
By changing the fundamental architecture of the personal computer
into a parallel processing environment, DSP chips provide a quantum
leap in performance over many of the most powerful single-CPU
computers.
<P>
With a multitude of hardware and software systems, researchers
need only worry about tailoring these pieces to fit their applications.
The power of DSP is limited only by the ability of the developer
to combine the components of the system into a true, real-time
processing environment.

<H1>Field Wiring and Noise Considerations for Analog Signals 
</H1>

<H2>Overview</H2>

<P>
Unfortunately, measuring analog signals with a data acquisition
board is not always as simple as wiring the signal source leads
to the data acquisition board. Knowledge of the nature of the
signal source, a suitable configuration of the data acquisition
board, and an appropriate cabling scheme may be required to produce
accurate and noise-free measurements. Figure 1 shows a block diagram
of a typical data acquisition system. The integrity of the acquired
data depends upon the entire analog signal path.
<P>
<B>Figure 1. Block Diagram of a Typical Data Acquisition System
</B>
<P>
In order to cover a wide variety of applications, most data acquisition
boards provide some flexibility in their analog input stage configuration.
The price of this flexibility is, however, some confusion as to
the proper applications of the various input configurations and
their relative merits. The purpose of this note is to help clarify
the types of input configurations available on data acquisition
boards, to explain how the user should choose and use the configuration
best for the application, and to discuss interference noise pick
up mechanisms and how to minimize interference noise by proper
cabling and shielding.
<P>
An understanding of the types of signal sources and measurement
systems is a prerequisite to application of good measurement techniques,
so we will begin by discussing the same.
<H2>Types of Signal Sources and Measurement Systems</H2>

<P>
By far the most common electrical equivalent produced by signal
conditioning circuitry associated with transducers is in the form
of voltage. Transformation to other electrical phenomena such
as current and frequency may be encountered in cases where the
signal is to be carried over long cabling in harsh environments.
Since in virtually all cases the transformed signal is ultimately
converted back into a voltage signal before measurement, it is
important to understand the voltage signal source.
<P>
Remember that a voltage signal is measured as the potential difference
across two points. This is depicted in Figure 2.
<P>
<B>Figure 2. Voltage Signal Source and Measurement System Model
</B>
<P>
A voltage source can be grouped into one of two categories-grounded
or ungrounded (floating). Similarly, a measurement system can
be grouped into one of two categories-grounded or ground-referenced,
and ungrounded (floating).
<H2>Grounded or Ground-Referenced Signal Source</H2>

<P>
A grounded source is one in which the voltage signal is referenced
to the building system ground. The most common example of a grounded
source is any common plug-in instrument that does not explicitly
<I>float</I> its output signal. Figure 3 shows a grounded signal
source.<BR>

<P>
<B>Figure 3. Grounded Signal Source</B>
<P>
The grounds of two grounded signal sources will generally not
be at the same potential. The difference in ground potential between
two instruments connected to the same building power system is
typically on the order of 10 mV to 200 mV; however, the difference
can be higher if power distribution circuits are not properly
connected.
<H2>Ungrounded or Nonreferenced (Floating) Signal Source</H2>

<P>
A floating source is a source in which the voltage signal is not
referred to an absolute reference, such as earth or building ground.
Some common examples of floating signal sources are batteries,
battery powered signal sources, thermocouples, transformers, isolation
amplifiers, and any instrument that explicitly <I>floats</I> its
output signal. A nonreferenced or floating signal source is depicted
in Figure 4.
<P>
<B>Figure 4. Floating or Nonreferenced Signal Source</B>
<P>
Notice that neither terminal of the source is referred to the
electrical outlet ground. Thus, each terminal is independent of
earth.
<H2>Differential or Nonreferenced Measurement System</H2>

<P>
A differential, or nonreferenced, measurement system has neither
of its inputs tied to a fixed reference such as earth or building
ground. Hand-held, battery-powered instruments and data acquisition
boards with instrumentation amplifiers are examples of differential
or nonreferenced measurement systems. Figure 5 depicts an implementation
of an eight-channel differential measurement system that is used
in the MIO-16 Series of boards from National Instruments. Analog
multiplexers are used in the signal path to increase the number
of measurement channels while still using a single instrumentation
amplifier. For this board, the pin labeled AIGND, the analog input
ground, is the measurement system ground.
<P>
<B>Figure 5. Eight-Channel Differential Measurement System</B>
<P>
An ideal differential measurement system responds only to the
potential <I>difference</I> between its two terminals-the (+)
and (-) inputs. Any voltage measured with respect to the instrumentation
amplifier ground that is present at both amplifier inputs is referred
to as a common-mode voltage. Common-mode voltage is completely
rejected (not measured) by an ideal differential measurement system.
This capability is useful in rejection of noise, as unwanted noise
is often introduced in the circuit making up the cabling system
as common-mode voltage. Practical devices, however, have several
limitations, described by parameters such as common-mode voltage
range and common-mode rejection ratio (CMRR), which limit this
ability to reject the common-mode voltage.
<P>
Common-mode voltage Vcm is defined as follows:
<P>
Vcm = (V+ + V-) /2;
<P>
where V+ = Voltage at the non-inverting terminal of the measurement
system with respect to the
<P>
measurement system ground
<P>
V- = Voltage at the inverting terminal of the measurement system
with respect to the
<P>
measurement system ground
<P>
and CMRR in dB is defined as follows:
<P>
CMRR (dB) = 20 log (Differential Gain/Common-Mode Gain).
<P>
A simple circuit that illustrates the CMRR is shown in Figure
6. In this circuit, CMRR in dB is measured as 20 log Vcm/Vout
where V+ = V- = Vcm.
<P>
<B>Figure 6. CMRR Measurement Circuit</B>
<P>
The common-mode voltage range limits the allowable voltage swing
on each input with respect to the measurement system ground. Violating
this constraint results not only in measurement error but also
in possible damage to components on the board. As the term implies,
the CMRR measures the ability of a differential measurement system
to reject the common-mode voltage signal. The CMRR is a function
of frequency and typically reduces with frequency. The CMRR can
be optimized by using a balanced circuit. This issue is discussed
in more detail later in this application note. Most data acquisition
boards will specify the CMRR up to 60 Hz, the power line frequency.
<H2>Grounded or Ground-Referenced Measurement System</H2>

<P>
A grounded or ground-referenced measurement system is similar
to a grounded source in that the measurement is made with respect
to ground. Figure 7 depicts a two-channel grounded measurement
system. This is also referred to as a <I>single-ended measurement
system</I>.
<P>
<B>Figure 7. Eight-Channel Ground-Referenced Single-Ended (GRSE)
Measurement System</B>
<P>
A variant of the single-ended measurement technique, known as
nonreferenced single-ended (NRSE) or pseudodifferential measurement,
is often found in data acquisition boards. A NRSE measurement
system is depicted in Figure 8.
<P>
<B>Figure 8. An Eight-Channel NRSE Measurement System</B>
<P>
In an NRSE measurement system, all measurements are still made
with respect to a single-node Analog Input Sense (AISENSE), but
the potential at this node can vary with respect to the measurement
system ground (AIGND). Figure 8 illustrates that a single-channel
NRSE measurement system is the same as a single-channel differential
measurement system.
<P>
Now that we have identified the different signal source type and
measurement systems, we can discuss the proper measurement system
for each type of signal source.
<H2>Measuring Grounded Signal Sources</H2>

<P>
A grounded signal source is best measured with a differential
or nonreferenced measurement system. Figure 9 shows the pitfall
of using a ground-referenced measurement system to measure a grounded
signal source. In this case, the measured voltage, Vm, is the
sum of the signal voltage, Vs, and the potential difference, _Vg,
that exists between the signal source ground and the measurement
system ground. This potential difference is generally not a DC
level; thus, the result is a noisy measurement system often showing
power-line frequency (60 Hz) components in the readings. Ground-loop
introduced noise may have both AC and DC components, thus introducing
offset errors as well as noise in the measurements. The potential
difference between the two grounds causes a current to flow in
the interconnection. This current is called ground-loop current.

<P>
<B>Figure 9. A Grounded Signal Source Measured with a Ground-Referenced
System</B>
<P>
Introduces Ground Loop
<P>
A ground-referenced system can still be used if the signal voltage
levels are high and the interconnection wiring between the source
and the measurement device has a low impedance. In this case,
the signal voltage measurement is degraded by ground loop, but
the degradation may be tolerable. The polarity of a grounded signal
source must be carefully observed before connecting it to a ground-referenced
measurement system because the signal source can be shorted to
ground, thus possibly damaging the signal source. Wiring considerations
are discussed in more detail later in this application note.
<P>
A nonreferenced measurement is provided by both the differential
(DIFF) and the NRSE input configurations on a typical data acquisition
board such as an MIO-16. With either of these configurations,
any potential difference between references of the source and
the measuring device appears as common-mode voltage to the measurement
system and is subtracted from the measured signal. This is illustrated
in Figure 10.
<P>
<B>Figure 10. A Differential Measurement System Used to Measure
a Grounded Signal Source</B>
<H2>Measuring Floating (Nonreferenced) Sources</H2>

<P>
Floating signal sources can be measured with both differential
and single-ended measurement systems. In the case of the differential
measurement system, however, care should be taken to ensure that
the common-mode voltage level of the signal with respect to the
measurement system ground remains in the common-mode input range
of the measurement device.
<P>
A variety of phenomena-for example, the instrumentation amplifier
input bias currents-can move the voltage level of the floating
source out of the valid range of the input stage of a data acquisition
board. To anchor this voltage level to some reference, resistors
are used as illustrated in Figure 11. These resistors, called
bias resistors, provide a DC path from the instrumentation amplifier
inputs to the instrumentation amplifier ground. These resistors
should be of a large enough value to allow the source to float
with respect to the measurement reference (AIGND in the previously
described measurement system) and not load the signal source,
but small enough to keep the voltage in the range of the input
stage of the board. Typically, values between 10 k_ and 100 k_
work well with low-impedance sources such as thermocouples and
signal conditioning module outputs. These bias resistors are connected
between each lead and the measurement system ground.
<P>
<B>Warning:</B> Failure to use these resistors will result in
erratic or saturated (positive full-scale or negative full-scale)
readings.
<P>
If the input signal is DC-coupled, only one resistor connected
from the (-) input to the measurement system ground is required
to satisfy the bias current path requirement, but this leads to
an unbalanced system if the source impedance of the signal source
is relatively high. Balanced systems are desirable from a noise
immunity point of view. Consequently, two resistors of equal value-one
for signal high (+) input and the other for signal low (-) input
to ground-should be used if the source impedance of the signal
source is high. A single bias resistor is sufficient for low-impedance
DC-coupled sources such as thermocouples. Balanced circuits are
discussed further later in this application note.
<P>
If the input signal is AC-coupled, two bias resistors are required
to satisfy the bias current path requirement of the instrumentation
amplifier.
<P>

If the single-ended input mode is to be used, a GRSE input system
(Figure 12a) can be used for a floating signal source. No ground
loop is created in this case. The NRSE input system (Figure 12b)
can also be used and is preferable from a noise pickup point of
view. Floating sources do require bias resistor(s) between the
AISENSE input and the measurement system ground (AIGND) in the
NRSE input configuration.<HR>

or negative full-scale) readings.
<P>
In general, a differential measurement system is preferable because
it rejects not only ground loop-induced errors, but also the noise
picked up in the environment to a certain degree. The single-ended
configurations, on the other hand, provide twice as many measurement
channels but are justified only if the magnitude of the induced
errors is smaller than the required accuracy of the data. Single-ended
input connections can be used when all input signals meet the
following criteria.
<UL>
<LI> Input signals are high level (greater than 1 V as a rule
of thumb).
<LI> Signal cabling is short and travels through a noise-free
environment or is properly shielded.
<LI> All input signals can share a common reference signal at
the source.
</UL>

<P>
Differential connections should be used when any of the above
criteria are violated.
<H2>Minimizing Noise Coupling in the Interconnects</H2>

<P>
Even when a measurement setup avoids ground loops or analog input
stage saturation by following the above guidelines, the measured
signal will almost inevitably include some amount of noise or
unwanted signal &quot;picked up&quot; from the environment. This
is especially true for low-level analog signals that are amplified
using the onboard amplifier that is available in many data acquisition
boards. To make matters worse, PC data acquisition boards generally
have some digital input/output signals on the I/O connector. Consequently,
any activity on these digital signals provided by or to the data
acquisition board that travels across some length in close proximity
to the low-level analog signals in the interconnecting cable itself
can be a source of noise in the amplified signal. In order to
minimize noise coupling from this and other extraneous sources,
a proper cabling and shielding scheme may be necessary.
<P>
Before proceeding with a discussion of proper cabling and shielding,
an understanding of the nature of the interference noise-coupling
problem is required. There is no single solution to the noise-coupling
problem. Moreover, an inappropriate solution might make the problem
worse.
<P>
An interference or noise-coupling problem is shown in Figure 13.

<P>
<B>Figure 13. Noise-Coupling Problem Block Diagram</B>
<P>
As shown in Figure 13, there are four principal noise &quot;pick
up&quot; or coupling mechanisms-conductive, capacitive, inductive,
and radiative. Conductive coupling results from sharing currents
from different circuits in a common impedance. Capacitive coupling
results from time-varying electric fields in the vicinity of the
signal path. Inductive or magnetically coupled noise results from
time-varying magnetic fields in the area enclosed by the signal
circuit. If the electromagnetic field source is far from the signal
circuit, the electric and magnetic field coupling are considered
combined electromagnetic or radiative coupling.
<H3>Conductively Coupled Noise</H3>

<P>
Conductively coupled noise exists because wiring conductors have
finite impedance. The effect of these wiring impedances must be
taken into account in designing a wiring scheme. Conductive coupling
can be eliminated or minimized by breaking ground loops (if any)
and providing separated ground returns for both low-level and
high-level, high-power signals. A series ground-connection scheme
resulting in conductive coupling is illustrated in Figure 14a.
If the resistance of the common return lead from A to B is 0.1
_, the measured voltage from the temperature sensor would vary
by 0.1 _ by 1 A = 100 mV, depending on whether the switch is closed
or open. This translates to 10 degrees of error in the measurement
of temperature. The circuit of Figure 14b provides separate ground
returns; thus, the measured temperature sensor output does not
vary as the current in the heavy load circuit is turned on and
off.<HR>

<H4> <A NAME = introduction></A>Introduction</H4>
Direct Memory Access (DMA) is a useful and powerful mechanism for transferring data in data acquisition and 
control applications.  A personal computer equipped with a DMA controller can transfer large amounts of data at 
high speeds between an I/O device and system memory.  Programming a DMA operation generally consists of two 
tasks:  programming the I/O device to use DMA, and programming the DMA controller.  Programming an I/O 
device for DMA transfers is relatively simple.  For example, a data acquisition board is programmed to collect 
data as usual.  Typically, the only additional programming required is to set a configuration bit which enables the 
generation of DMA requests when data is available to be transferred.  On the other hand, programming a DMA 
controller is more involved and most available documentation for programming DMA controllers is difficult to 
decipher.  This application note explains how DMA works in PC/XT/AT computers and discusses how to program 
the 8237A DMA controller that is used in these systems.  An example program is included to demonstrate the 
specifics of DMA programming. <P>
<H4><A NAME = tranferring></A>Transferring Data with 
DMA</H4>
DMA is a method of transferring data at high speeds between an I/O device and memory.  A specialized 
processor, the DMA controller, is used to transfer the data, bypassing the CPU.  The DMA controller requests 
control of the system bus from the CPU, transfers the data, and relinquishes the bus to the CPU at the completion 
of the data transfer.Besides DMA, there are two other methods used to transfer data in data acquisition 
applications:  <I>processor interrupts</I> and <I>software polling routines</I>.  With processor interrupts, the 
CPU is interrupted from the main execution program whenever data is available to be transferred.  The CPU then 
branches to a special routine that transfers the data.  With software polling, the CPU continually checks or polls 
the status of the I/O device for availability of data.  DMA is inherently faster than both interrupts and polling 
because the CPU is not needed to fetch and execute data transfer instructions.  The DMA controller is a peripheral 
device dedicated to the task of transferring data.  Only one or two bus read/write cycles are required per transfer, 
and the DMA controller can respond very quickly to requests for attention from the I/O device.  Also, the DMA 
controller offloads the burden of data transfer from the processor.  DMA can proceed as a background task of the 
computer system, freeing the CPU to operate on other foreground tasks.  In some applications, however, it may be 
desirable to involve the CPU directly in the transfer activity.  If incoming data must be examined and processed 
on a point-by-point basis in real time, interrupts or polling should be used.  DMA is better suited for transferring 
blocks of data.<P>
Figure 1.  System Implementation of DMA<P>
Figure 1 shows a generalized model of a PC/XT/AT system that uses DMA to transfer data between an I/O device 
and memory.  The I/O device communicates with the DMA Controller using DMA request and acknowledge 
signals (DRQ<I>x</I> and DACK<I>x</I>, where <I>x</I> is the channel number).  The DMA controller in 
turn communicates with the processor via bus request and acknowledge signals.  Figure 2 illustrates the general 
protocol of a DMA transfer of data from an I/O device to memory.  First, the DMA controller is programmed with 
the starting address of the block of memory to be transferred and the number of transfers to be performed.  The 
I/O device is configured to assert DMA requests whenever data is available to be transferred to memory.  The I/O 
device requests a transfer by asserting a hardware DMA request signal (DRQ<I>x</I>).  The DMA controller 
responds by asserting a hardware bus request signal to the CPU.  Once the CPU grants control of the bus to the 
DMA controller (through a hardware acknowledge signal), the DMA controller places the programmed memory 
address on the address bus and asserts the DMA acknowledge signal (DACK<I>x</I>). This signals the I/O 
device to place the data onto the bus and remove the DMA request signal.  The data is then latched into memory 
by the DMA controller.  The DMA controller decrements its internal count register and updates its internal 
address register.  This sequence of events is repeated until the transfer count reaches zero, referred to as 
<I>terminal count</I> (TC).  At this point, the DMA controller asserts the hardware TC signal that signals the 
CPU and I/O device that the DMA transfer is finished.In this example, the I/O device removes the DMA request 
signal and the DMA controller relinquishes the bus at the completion of each individual data transfer.  This is 
referred to as <I>single</I> transfer mode.  Alternatively, the DMA controller can perform multiple DMA 
transfers once it has gained control of the bus.  In <I>demand</I> transfer mode, the DMA controller performs 
multiple DMA transfers as long as the I/O device continues to assert the DMA request.  In <I>block</I> transfer 
mode, the DMA controller performs the entire preprogrammed DMA sequence in response to a single DMA 
request.  While both demand and block transfer modes of DMA are faster than single-mode DMA, they must be 
used with caution.  On PC/XT/AT computers, the I/O bus must be available every 15 µsec for memory-refresh 
cycles.  This is why block-mode DMA is not normally used on the PC/XT/AT and why demand-mode DMA 
devices must be designed to relinquish the bus at least once every 15 µsec.<P>
<BR>
<BR>
Figure 2.  Sequence of Events in DMA Transfer<P><B>
</B>The type of DMA operation diagrammed in Figure 2 is referred to as <I>flyby</I> DMA because the DMA 
controller provides the preprogrammed memory address and the I/O device reads or writes the data directly to 
memory in a single bus cycle.  Flyby DMA is faster than the second type of DMA, <I>fetch-and-deposit</I>.  
Fetch-and-deposit DMA transfers consist of two bus cycles:  a read from the I/O device and a write to memory.  
For a more complete discussion of the different types and modes of DMA used on different computer platforms, 
see <I>Application Note #11, DMA Fundamentals on Various PC Platforms</I>.  <P><B>
</B><H4><A NAME = dma></A>DMA on PC/XT/AT 
Computers</H4>
The IBM PC design uses the Intel 8237A DMA controller, which provides four channels of DMA.  The 8237A has 
16-bit memory-address and byte-count registers for each DMA channel.  This DMA controller performs flyby 
DMA in either single, demand, or block mode.<P>
The original PC design uses a single 8237A to provide four channels of 8-bit DMA (the PC/XT has an 8-bit bus).  
Three of the four available DMA channels are reserved for the floppy disk, the hard disk drive, and memory-
refresh cycles<I>.</I>  The PC design adds an 8-bit page register to extend the 16-bit address to the 24-bit PC 
memory address.  This page register does <I>not</I> automatically increment when the address register reaches 
full value (0xFFFF), referred to as a <I>page boundary</I>.  This means that DMA transfer sequences cannot 
cross the 64-kilobyte page boundary without reprogramming the DMA controller.  The design of the IBM PC AT 
adds a second 8237A DMA controller that increases the total number of DMA channels to seven (the first channel 
of the second DMA controller is used to cascade the two DMA controllers).  The first DMA controller provides 
DMA Channels 0 through 3.  DMA channels are no longer used for the hard drive and memory refresh, leaving 
three channels of 8-bit DMA available.  The second DMA controller adds three channels (Channels 5 through 7) 
of 16-bit DMA.<I> </I> Again, a page register holds the upper byte of the memory address, but because Channels 
5 through 7 are 16-bit channels, a single DMA sequence is limited to <BR>
64-kiloword transfers.The clock frequency for the 8237A is usually derived from the system clock, varying from 3 
MHz to 5 MHz in different systems.  A single-mode DMA transfer needs five bus cycles for the data transfer plus 
a few more cycles for the transfer of bus control.  The exact number of cycles needed to transfer bus control will 
depend on the system and the amount of bus traffic.  Practical maximum throughput rates for single-mode DMA 
transfers will typically be on the order of 300,000 to 500,000 transfers per second.<P>
<H4><A NAME = programming></A>Programming the 8237A DMA 
Controller</H4>
The 8237A DMA controller has three registers for each DMA channel and seven general-purpose registers.  The 
I/O addresses for both 8237A DMA controllers in a PC/XT/AT computer are listed in Table 1.<P>

</I>Each DMA channel has a 16-bit Base Address Register and an 8-bit Page Register, which together are 
programmed with the starting address of the memory block to be written to or read from.  When programming 
DMA Channels 0 through 3 (for 8-bit transfers), the Base Address Register is programmed with the lower 16 bits 
of the 20-bit <I>physical</I> address, while the Page Register is programmed with the upper four bits.  If 
programming DMA Channels 5 through 7 (for 16-bit transfers), the physical address is first shifted one bit to the 
right (equivalent to dividing by two), and the least significant bit of the Page Register is always set to zero.  Figure 
3 illustrates the programming of the Base Address and Page Registers for both 8-bit and 16-bit transfers.<P>
<BR>
<BR>
Figure 3.  Programming Base Address and Page Registers<P>
Again, it is important to remember that the Page Register does not automatically increment, and must be 
reprogrammed at each page boundary.  Therefore, the maximum number of DMA transfers that can be performed 
without reprogramming the DMA controller is equal to the size of the Base Address Register, 216 =  65,536.  The 
actual number is usually less because the lower 16 bits of the physical starting address are rarely all zero.  There 
are two methods of working around this limitation.  First, the DMA controller can be programmed so that TC is 
reached at the page boundary.  When TC occurs, an interrupt routine programs the DMA controller to resume data 
transfer after the page boundary.  The drawback of this method is that no DMA transfers are performed while the 
DMA channel is reprogrammed.  This may cause loss of data in a data acquisition application.  The second 
method, referred to as <I>dual DMA</I>, uses two DMA channels and special circuitry on the I/O board to 
perform DMA across page boundaries with no pause in DMA services.  The first DMA channel is programmed to 
transfer data from the beginning of the buffer to the location of the page boundary.  Before the transfer starts, a 
second DMA channel is also programmed to begin transferring at the location of the DMA page boundary.  The 
I/O board must implement special DMA circuitry to support dual-DMA mode.  DMA requests are generated by 
the I/O board on the first DMA channel until the I/O board senses the TC signal asserted by the DMA controller at 
the first page boundary.  At this point, the I/O board stops asserting DMA requests on the first DMA channel and 
begins asserting DMA requests on the second programmed DMA channel.  Therefore, there is no pause in DMA 
transfers while the controller is being reprogrammed.  If the DMA data buffer contains more than one page 
boundary, then the DMA channels are alternated, each one being reprogrammed as the other channel is used to 
transfer data.  National Instruments has a line of high-speed multifunction and digital I/O boards which implement 
this dual-DMA technique.Each DMA channel also has a 16-bit Transfer Count Register, which is programmed 
with the total number of DMA transfers to be done, minus one.  When the Transfer Count Register is read, it 
returns the current transfer count, which is decremented after each DMA transfer.  Note that even if the Page 
Register were able to auto-increment, the Transfer Count Register would still impose a 65,536-transfer limit.Both 
the Transfer Count Register and the Base Address Register must be programmed eight bits at a time using the 
Clear Byte Pointer Register.  When the Clear Byte Pointer Register is written to, an internal pointer used to point 
to the upper or lower byte of the 16-bit Address and Count Register is cleared.  The following 8-bit write to the 
Base Address Register or Transfer Count Register will address the lower byte of the register.  The write operation 
automatically increments the internal pointer, and the next 8-bit write is addressed to the upper byte of the 
register. Each DMA group also has a write-only Command Register and a read-only Status Register.  However, 
these two registers are rarely if ever needed when programming the 8237A on PC/XT/AT computers.  The 
Command Register sets the signal polarity of the DRQ<I>x</I> and DAK<I>x</I> lines, sets the group 
arbitration priority scheme to fixed or rotating, and can be used to enable or disable the channel group.  The Status 
Register identifies channels that have pending DMA requests and channels that have reached TC.  Bits 0 through 
3 are set every time the respective channel reaches TC.  These bits are cleared on each read of the Status Register.  
Bits 4 through 7 are set whenever the respective channel requests DMA service.The Single Mask Register and 
Write All Mask Register are used to enable and disable DMA channels.  The Single Mask Register is used to 
enable and disable individual DMA channels, while the Write All Mask Register can be used to mask the entire 
channel group.  The Clear Mask Register, when written to, clears the Command and Status Registers, disables 
DMA requests, and executes a Clear Byte Pointer command. <P>
<BR>
<BR>
Figure 4.  Single Mask and Write All Mask Register Descriptions<P>
Each channel group has a Mode Register, which sets the DMA mode and direction, enables and disables auto-
initialization, and determines whether the address register is incremented or decremented.  Bits 2 and 3 set the 
type of transfer as a read (from memory to I/O device) or as a write (from I/O device to memory).  Bit 4 of the 
Mode Register is to used to enable auto-initialization.  When auto-initialization is enabled, the DMA controller is 
automatically reinitialized with the starting base address and transfer count when TC is reached.  Auto-
initialization is useful for implementing circular memory-buffer schemes used for double-buffered data 
acquisition.  Bits 6 and 7 of this register set the DMA mode to single, demand, block, or cascade.  Cascade mode 
is used only by DMA Channel 4 (for cascading Channels 0 through 3).<P>

This section contains a listing of the file DMAESP.C.  This program is Microsoft C code that programs the 
PC/XT/AT DMA controller (the 8237A) to transfer a preprogrammed number of data points from an I/O device to 
memory.  Also included in the listing is an example of a C program that calls the DMA routine.The program 
checks the DMA buffer for the presence of a DMA page boundary.  If a page boundary is detected, the routine 
simply returns an error code and exits without performing the DMA transfer.  The user can modify the code to 
either relocate the buffer so that it does not contain a page boundary or perform DMA across the page boundary 
using one of the techniques discussed briefly in this application note<P>

<H4><A NAME = conclusion></A>Conclusion</H4>
DMA is very effective for moving large amounts of data at high rates between I/O devices and memory with 
minimal CPU intervention.  For this reason, DMA is very useful for data acquisition and control applications.  The 
PC/XT/AT computers use the Intel 8237A DMA controller chip.  The original PC used a single 8237A to provide 
four 8-bit DMA channels.  The PC/AT computer design added a second 8237A to provide three additional 16-bit 
DMA channels.  The 8237A DMA controller implements flyby DMA in single, demand, or block mode.  
However, due to memory refresh requirements, demand and block mode are rarely used on PC/XT/AT computers.  
For developers of driver-level software, the example program DMAESP.C (included in this application note) 
demonstrates how to program the 8237A DMA controller to transfer a block of data from an I/O device to 
memory.  The code can be used for a data acquisition application by simply adding the code to configure the I/O 
device to collect data and generate DMA requests.<P>
