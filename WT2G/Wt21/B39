TECHNOLOGY BRIEF<br>
<h2>The final frontier</h2><p><b>Why tart up the old telephone networks when you can bypass them by satellite? This is the last of our briefs on access to the Internet. The box compares the rival technologies</b></p>

<p>BILL GATES and Craig McCaw have a dream. The founders, respectively, of Microsoft and McCaw Cellular (now part of <font size=-1>AT&T</font>) want to swathe the earth with satellites--840 of them. The name of their dream is Teledesic, and if it came true it would bring cyberspace to outer space--providing direct satellite links to personal computers and freeing them from the constraints that affect telephony, cable television and even wireless transmission.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Satellites have been part of the world's telephone and television networks for decades. Some carry calls over oceans. Others broadcast pictures directly to millions of viewers. But as they stand, neither sort is quite right for the Internet, which requires individual, two-way and preferably high-speed ("broadband") connections.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Combining all three requirements is difficult. Over the past decade, satellite companies have been preparing to extend cellular telephony to space. Four projects--Globalstar, <font size=-1>ICO</font>, Iridium and Odyssey--plan to launch satellite networks to provide global telephone services. Such networks are "individual" and "two-way", but hardly "broadband". To carry lots of calls, they give each little room: most carry data no faster than the 2,400 bits per second (bps) modems of a decade ago (see <a href="st1.gif">chart</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In contrast, broadcast satellites like those used for digital television have plenty of bandwidth, but at the cost of individual channels and two-way communications. They simply beam one massive data stream over an area as big as a continent. Hughes Network Systems uses a few tricks to make this one-way flood imitate a two-way personal Internet connection. With Direct<font size=-1>PC</font>, its Internet service, subscribers send data requests over their regular telephone lines. Hughes routes the responses to its control centre, which codes them so that a subscriber's <font size=-1>PC</font> can recognise them as its own, and then sends them up to a satellite for broadcasting.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Leasing only one satellite channel in America (similar services will soon be offered in Europe and Canada) Hughes has just 12m bps of bandwidth to serve the entire country--about as much as cable <font size=-1>TV</font> networks plan to distribute between 300 homes. Hughes limits each subscriber's connection to 400,000 bps, but even so it can handle only a few hundred users simultaneously (only a tiny fraction of its 2,000 subscribers use the service at any one time). Hughes can lease more satellite capacity if needed, but broadcasting data to an entire country for the sake of a single user will never be the most efficient way to do things.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the ultimate in Internet surfing, a different sort of satellite network is needed. Most communications satellites are parked 36,000km (22,500 miles) above the earth--the height at which their orbits take 24 hours and thus match the planet's rotation. From this lofty eyrie, hovering over the same spot, individual machines can communicate with large areas of land.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Gates's and Mr McCaw's flock will fly lower (at around 700km) and faster than this. With enough satellites, one will always be overhead when necessary. Each satellite will be like a cell in a cellphone network, except that the cells can move as well as the callers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The advantage of this is broadbandedness. Each satellite can devote all its capacity to the relatively few users beneath it. Teledesic's cells will be 53km across, small enough to keep the number of users in each to a manageable level. The network aims to provide 18 simultaneous 1.5m bps Internet links in each cell, and 20,000 worldwide. And because the satellites are so close to earth, they avoid the half-second delays that are the price of the lofty orbits required by Direct<font size=-1>PC</font> and its proposed competitors.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even so, plenty of experts are sceptical. No one has ever built satellites with off-the-shelf parts as Teledesic plans to do. Nor have so many satellites been put into orbit so quickly.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The plan is to have the network operating by 2002. This would mean launching all 840 satellites in two years--more than the rest of the world's launches combined. Add in an orbit full of dangerous space debris, and the complexities of passing signals from one satellite to another as the first goes out of range, and it is easy to see how Teledesic might fail.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But if the technology works, a market for Teledesic's "Internet in the sky" should be there. New Yorkers and Londoners may be able to wallow in the abundant data of their own fibre-optic cables in a few years' time, but it will be a while before many others can do the same. Counting on traditional telecommunications to be inadequate for the Internet in most parts of the world is one of the safest bets around.

<h1><center>The zillion dollar games</center></h1>

A SPORTING event? Or merely a branch of the advertising and entertainment industry? In the centenary of their reinvention by Baron Pierre de Coubertin, the Olympic Games look more like a celebration of the marketing muscle of Coca-Cola, Kodak and <font size=-1>BMW</font> than a display of human prowess and courage. The gold, silver and bronze that clinks loudest in Atlanta is that handed over for the rights to televise, sponsor and advertise through the games. No wonder so many sports fans blame television and corporate cash for the erosion of amateurism and the endless drug scandals. No wonder they yearn for a return to the days when Eric Liddell pulled on his Scottish tweeds and set off for the 1924 Paris Olympics (where, as every fan of "Chariots of Fire" remembers, he was too high-principled to run on a Sunday).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of course the Olympics has changed almost beyond recognition in its first modern century. Few of the athletes, especially those in the most popular sports, lead ordinary lives away from the track or pool. Training to Olympic standard takes hours out of the day, years out of a young life. So amateurism has given way to shamateurism: many of those who parade in the stadium owe their running shoes, training facilities and airline tickets to corporate promotional budgets.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For companies, the Olympics is a golden moment. Around the world, some 3.5 billion pairs of eyes will notice their logos, slogans and billboards. Television will bring these Olympics to a larger audience than any previous sporting event (see <a href="sf1.html">page</a>). Moreover sport, with its wholesome image, is a perfect way to pitch products (especially ones that are not particularly wholesome themselves). As ever more brands clamour for public attention, a plug from a world-beating athlete is a way to stand out from the crowd.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The result is that the rewards of sport have vastly increased. Once an athlete can attract an audience of millions or billions of viewers rather than merely hundreds of thousands, his cash value soars. So a top professional sportsman now earns Hollywood money: Michael Jordan, America's basketball star, has just signed a contract that will pay him $25m a year. But those rewards will go not to those who nearly made it to Atlanta, even if their performance is better than earlier sportsmen could have dreamt of. They will go only to the best. It is all very well for the One Great Scorer (in the sonorous words of Grantland Rice) to mark "not that you won, or lost--but how you played the game." All the sponsor wants to know is whether you got the gold.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And getting the gold grows ever tougher. More and more countries compete, as nations fragment: the bands at Atlanta need the music for 197 national anthems. More important, the limits of the human frame in some sports have almost been reached. Champion racehorses run no faster today than they did half a century ago. Eventually, human champions will stop breaking records too. Ever more minute improvements in training regimes, equipment and style lop ever smaller fragments of a second off sporting records. Small wonder many athletes succumb to the temptation to turn sport into a pharmacological challenge, using drugs to push their bodies beyond the natural limits.
</p><p><b>Pay up and play the Games</b>
<br>But is commercial pressure to blame? It is not company money but the ruthless arrogance of undemocratic governments that has done most to give the games their reputation as a pill-poppers' convention. The Communist regimes of the 1970s and 1980s saw the Olympics much as Hitler did in 1936 or China does today: as a chance to prove the superiority of their citizens or systems. If dope was needed to ensure that, then doped their athletes would be. Companies, by contrast, tend to shun athletes found guilty of using drugs: think of the fortune in sponsorship that Ben Johnson sacrificed after drug tests disqualified his win in Seoul in 1988.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The more that companies support athletes, the less sportsmen will have to rely on the state. Is that so bad? Corporate sponsorship ensures that far more money finds its way into sport than would otherwise be the case. Companies, more than governments, have a powerful interest in making sure that sporting events are seen by as many people as possible. They also have an interest in sport that is seen to be clean, fair and exciting. That is surely in fans' interests too.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Television provides the main link between sport and corporate sponsorship. Its effect has been profoundly democratising: people who would once have seen only their local teams can now enjoy ringside seats at world-class events. It has also been, on balance, benign for sport: as television companies spend an increasing share of their budgets on sports rights, they acquire a strong interest in making sure that sporting bodies run their games efficiently and fairly, developing new talent and new audiences.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Above all, the power of corporate hype linked with global television is a marvellous machine for promoting sports. Far more people run or swim or kick a ball for sheer pleasure than ever before. Thanks to television, many have discovered sports they might never have known existed: rock-climbing, perhaps, or archery or synchronised swimming. It is surely better that television and corporate muscle should sell sport and the glory of human achievement than that the Olympics should be merely a way to trumpet national pride.

<h2>Jumbo crash</h2><p>
<p>A <font size=-1>TWA</font> <b>jumbo jet</b> bound for Paris crashed soon after take-off from New York, apparently killing all 229 people on board after exploding.
<p>A <i>New York Times</i>/<font size=-1>CBS</font> poll showed that seven out of ten Americans expect Bob Dole, the Republican candidate, to lose to Bill Clinton in the <b>presidential election</b>. Mr Dole, continuing his gyrations over abortion, named Susan Molinari, a fiercely pro-choice congresswoman from New York, as the keynote speaker at the Republican convention in San Diego.
<p><b>Joe Klein</b>, a <i>Newsweek</i> journalist, admitted that he was the anonymous author of "Primary Colors", a gossipy novel about President Clinton's 1992 campaign. Mr Klein had long denied authorship and said he would stake his credibility as a journalist on the denial.
<p>Oscar Camilion, Argentina's defence minister, resigned in a scandal over the <b>secret sale of weapons</b> to Ecuador and to Croatia. Rodolfo Barra, the justice minister, resigned after a magazine revealed youthful neo-Nazi activities.
<p>Portugal and six of its former colonies launched a <b>Portuguese-speaking commonwealth</b> to protect their common language and promote co-operation. Some 200m people, 160m of them Brazilians, live in Portuguese-speaking countries. Sao Tome and Principe, islands off Africa, have 125,000 Portuguese speakers.
<p><h2>At odds</h2></p>
<p><p>Fierce rioting in Catholic areas of <b>Northern Ireland</b> and the bombing of a hotel followed a decision by police to allow Protestants to march through Catholic areas in Portadown and Belfast. The Irish prime minister accused the British government of backing down in the face of mob rule. Multi-party talks restarted in Belfast but were immediately bogged down amid recriminations and procedural wrangles.
<p>Fearing the collapse of peace in Bosnia, the United States sent <b>Rich</b><b>ard Hol</b><b>brooke</b>, the former diplomat who brokered the peace, to arrange the removal of the Bosnian Serb leader Radovan Karadzic, who has been indicted for war crimes.
<p>Russia's President Boris Yeltsin cheered reformers by appointing one of their leaders, <b>Anatoly Chubais</b>, his chief of staff. Igor Rodionov, a hawkish general allied to the new security chief, Alexander Lebed, was appointed defence minister.
<p>Worries about <b>Mr Yeltsin's health</b> persisted. America's vice-president, Al Gore, found him in "very good shape" on a visit to his sanatorium but other witnesses said he found walking hard.

<p>Ukraine's prime minister, Pavel Lazarenko, narrowly escaped death in a <b>bomb attack</b> on his car. He blamed "criminals" opposed to his plans to shut inefficient coal mines. Ukraine's security chief ordered "elements" of a state of emergency, including tighter security for politicians, the sacking of some officials and closer monitoring of state funds.
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%><p>Silvio Berlusconi, a former right-wing prime minister, and Bettino Craxi, a former Socialist one, were indicted on charges relating to <b>illicit financing</b> of Italian political parties by Fininvest, a company Mr Berlusconi controls. A draft law on media ownership would oblige Mr Berlusconi to change one of the three television channels he controls into a satellite or cable service, but he would not have to sell any.
<p>France said it would disband 38 regiments, removing all but 3,000 of its 20,000 troops in Germany, and close barracks, air bases and army hospitals. The plan, part of a change to an all-professional army, is intended to cut <b>military spending</b> by FFr20 billion ($4 billion) a year from its 1994 level.</p>
<p><h2>Open season</h2></p>
<p><p>News leaked of a riot in Libya when spectators at a football match chanted slogans against a son of <b>Muam</b><b>mar Qaddafi</b>. They were fired on by bodyguards, stormed the pitch and attacked the referee. Some 20 people may have died.
<p>Contact began between Israel's new hardline prime minister, <b>Binyamin Netanyahu</b>, and some Arab governments. Jordan's prime minister met him in Tel Aviv; Egypt's president, Hosni Mubarak, met him in Cairo.
<p>Turkey's ruling Islamist party held a secret parliamentary debate on the West's <b>air patrols</b> to protect Kurds in northern Iraq. The debate puts the future of the patrols, which are staged from Turkey, in doubt.
<p>Up to 150<b> Sudanese refugees</b> were killed when their camp in northern Uganda was attacked by a rebel group called the Lord's Resistance Army, which Uganda says is backed by Sudan.</p>
<p><h2>Saving children</h2></p>
<p><p>
<p>
<p>Pakistan ordered officials to raid factories using <b>child labour</b>. The country has often been accused of tolerating the employment of children to make carpets and sports goods.
<p><b>Floods </b>and landslides in Bangladesh and eastern India killed about 130 people and made some 2m homeless. At Ujjain and Hardwar, two Hindu shrines in northern India, 60 people died when crowds of pilgrims panicked.
<p>In the latest of a series of <b>food poisoning</b> cases, more than 5,500 people, mostly children, fell ill in Japan. The chief suspects are roast pork and sea-eel sushi. Four victims have died since May.
<p>At a <font size=-1>UN</font> conference on <b>climate change</b>, the United States called for binding international targets for cutting emissions of gases that cause global warming.

<p><h2>Ups and downs</h2>
<p><p>
<p>(See <a href="wtw1.gif">chart</a>)<br><b>Share prices</b> in New York fell nearly 3% on July 15th but recovered later. The London stockmarket fell to its lowest point this year. Not meltdown, was the initial verdict, just investors nervous about possible overheating in the American economy, falling investment in mutual funds, and disappointing corporate earnings.
<p>Two American high-tech companies, <b>Texas Instruments</b> and <b>Compu</b><b>Serve</b>, gave warning that profits would be lower than expected. But <b>Intel</b>, the world's biggest chip maker, exceeded expectations, reporting a 19% increase in revenues for the second quarter. <b>Apple Computer</b> did much better in its third quarter. It lost only $39m, having lost $800m in the previous two quarters. And Germany's <b>Siemens</b> forecast a 20% rise in earnings.
<p><b>General Motors </b>reported a fall of 17% in net profit for the second quarter, to $1.9 billion. But, excluding the $208.8m cost of spinning off <b>Electronic Data Systems</b>, a subsidiary, this was a slight increase on the previous year. <b>Ford</b> also announced an encouraging rise in earnings, contributed mainly by its financial-services arm.
<p>The two largest American banks both announced unexpectedly good second-quarter results. <b>Chase Manhattan's </b>earnings rose 17% to $856m;<b> Citicorp's</b> were up by 12% to $952m.
<p>A trading quarrel between America and Europe was averted, for a while, when Bill Clinton delayed by six months the right of Americans to sue foreign companies "trafficking" in confiscated Cuban assets. The European Union had threatened to retaliate, and still may. Other provisions of America's controversial <b>Helms-Burton Act </b>are already in force.
<p>Germany and Japan are reducing the extent to which their industrial companies are <b>controlled by banks</b>. A draft law in Germany would limit banks' voting power at shareholders' meetings. The Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan said that poor yields had persuaded it to sell a large but undisclosed portion of its large shareholding in Japanese companies.
<p>The annual general meeting of <b>Lloyd's of London </b>backed its Reconstruction and Renewal (<font size=-1>R</font>&<font size=-1>R</font>) recovery plan. Under it, the "names" who lost money in the London insurance market in 1987-92 will receive compensation of $3.2 billion. Although the 34,000 investors have until the end of August to approve their individual offers, most are likely to accept. Further legal challenges are possible in Britain and America, in spite of a new agreement between Lloyd's and American securities regulators.
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>There was a truce, of sorts, between investment banks. Germany's Deutsche Morgan Grenfell, which has lured more than 70 staff from <font size=-1>ING</font> Barings, has promised to <b>stop poaching</b> if the Dutch bank drops a lawsuit against it.</p>
<p><h2>Arm's length</h2></p>
<p><p><b>Bertelsmann</b>, Germany's biggest media company, wants an American partner to join its digital-television consortium, which has been stranded by last week's alliance between <b>Kirch </b>and Rupert Murdoch's <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font>.
<p>In a further step towards the convergence of the news and software industries, America's <b>Microsoft</b> launched a broadcast network in conjunction with <b>NBC</b>, a television-news network. The new cable-<font size=-1>TV</font> channel, coupled with a Web site on the Internet, aims to provide an interactive rival to Ted Turner's <b>CNN</b>. 
<p>
<p>Kirk Kerkorian, a veteran corporate raider who was recently stalking Chrysler, helped the managers of <b>MGM</b> to buy the Hollywood studio he formerly owned for an estimated $1.3bn from <b>Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais</b>, a troubled bank owned by the French state.</p>
<p><h2>Switched off</h2></p>
<p><p>
<p>Britain's sale of <b>British Energy</b>, a nuclear utility, raised a disappointing &#163;1.4 billion ($2.2 billion), about half what the government had hoped for. The shares fell further when trading started.
<p>The European Union's competition commissioner is to investigate the links between America's <b>Philip Morris</b> and Italy's state-owned tobacco monopoly, <b>Azienda dei Monopoli di Stato</b>. The pair control 89% of the market.
<p>Monitoring of trades on America's <b>Nasdaq </b>electronic stock exchange will be increased, including the use of tape recorders, following a two-year investigation by the Justice Department into allegations of price fixing. There will be no other sanctions.

<p><h2>Hard sell</h2></p>
<p><p> 
<p>(See <a href="wtw2.gif">chart</a>)<br>Currency traders, worried by the New York stockmarket's jumpiness, sold <b>the dollar</b> heavily. It fell particularly far against the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark, causing speculation that Germany's central bank might cut interest rates.
<p>To <b>deter currency speculators</b> as Western Europe approaches monetary union, the president of the European Monetary Institute, Alexandre Lamfalussy, suggested that central bankers announce in advance the exchange rate at which their currencies would join.

<h1>Swifter, higher, stronger, dearer</h1>
<p><b>Television and sport are perfect partners. Each has made the other richer. But is the alliance really so good for sport?</b></p>

<p>BACK in 1948, the <font size=-1>BBC</font>, Britain's public broadcasting corporation, took a fateful decision. It paid a princely &#163;1,500 (&#163;27,000 in today's money) for the right to telecast the Olympic Games to a domestic audience. It was the first time a television network had paid the International Olympic Committee (<font size=-1>IOC</font>, the body that runs the Games) for the privilege.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But not the last. The rights to this year's Olympics, which open in Atlanta on July 19th, raised $900m from broadcasters round the world. And the American television rights to the Olympiads up to and including 2008 have been bought by America's <font size=-1>NBC</font> network for an amazing $3.6 billion (see <a href="sf1.gif">chart</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Olympics are only one of the sporting properties that have become hugely valuable to broadcasters. Sport takes up a growing share of screen time (as those who are bored by it know all too well). When you consider the popularity of the world's great tournaments, that is hardly surprising. <i>Sportfests </i>generate audiences beyond the wildest dreams of television companies for anything else. According to Neilsen Media Research, the number of Americans watching the 1996 Super Bowl, the main annual football championship, averaged 94m. The top eight television programmes in America are all sporting events (see <a href="sf2.gif">table</a>). A staggering 3.5 billion people are likely to watch some part of the 1996 Olympiad--two-thirds of mankind.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The reason television companies love sport is not merely that billions want to tele-gawk at ever-more-wonderful sporting feats. Sport also has a special quality that makes it unlike almost any other sort of television programme: immediacy. Miss seeing a particular episode of, say, "<font size=-1>E.R.</font>" and you can always catch the repeat, and enjoy it just as much. Miss seeing your team beat hell out of its biggest rival, and the replay will leave you cold. "A live sporting event loses almost all its value as the final whistle goes," says Steven Barnett, author of a British book on sport. The desire to watch sport when it is happening, not hours afterwards, is universal: a study of South Korea by Spectrum, a British consultancy, finds that live games get 30% of the audience while recordings get less than 5%.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This combination of popularity and immediacy has created a symbiotic relationship between sport and television in which each is changing the other. As Stephen Wenn, of Canada's Wilfrid Laurier University, puts it, television and the money it brings have had an enormous impact on the Olympic Games, including on the timing of events and their location. For instance, an Asian Olympics poses a problem for American networks: viewers learn the results on the morning news.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The money that television has brought into professional basketball has put some of the top players among the world's highest-paid entertainers: a few are getting multi-year contracts worth over $100m. Rugby has begun to be reorganised to make it more television-friendly; other sports will follow. And, though soccer and American football draw the largest audiences, television has also promoted the popularity of sports which stir more local passions: rugby league in Australia, cricket in India, table tennis in China, snooker in Britain.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What is less often realised is that sport is also changing television. To assuage the hunger for sports, new channels are being launched at a tremendous pace. In America, <font size=-1>ESPN</font>, a cable network owned by Capital Cities/<font size=-1>ABC</font>, is starting a 24-hour sports news network in the autumn; in Britain, <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font>, a satellite broadcaster partly owned by Rupert Murdoch, has two sports channels and is about to launch a third. Because people seem more willing to pay to watch sport on television than to pay for any other kind of programming, sport has become an essential part of the business strategy of television empire-builders such as Mr Murdoch. Nobody in the world understands the use of sport as a bait for viewers better than he.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In particular, sport suggests an answer to one of the big problems that will face television companies in the near future: how can viewers, comfortable with their old analogue sets, be persuaded to part with the hefty price of a new digital set and a subscription to an untried service? The answer is to create an exclusive chance to watch a desirable event, or to use the hundreds of channels that digital television provides to offer more variety of sports coverage than analogue television can offer. This ploy is not new. "Radio broadcasts of boxing were once used to promote the sale of radios, and baseball to persuade people to buy television sets," points out Richard Burton, a sports marketing specialist at the Lundquist College of Business at Oregon University. In the next few years, the main new outlet for sports programmes will be digital television.
</p><p><b>Going for gold</b></b>
<br>To understand how these multiple effects have come about, go back to those vast sums that television companies are willing to pay. In America, according to Neal Weinstock of Weinstock Media Analysis, total spending on sports rights by television companies is about $2 billion a year. Easily the most valuable rights are for American football. One of the biggest sporting coups in the United States was the purchase by Fox, owned by Mr Murdoch's News Corp, of the rights to four years of National Football League games for $1.6 billion, snatching them from <font size=-1>CBS</font>. Rights for baseball, basketball and ice hockey are also substantial (see <a href="sf3.gif">table</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Americans are rare in following four main sports rather than one. America is also uncommon in having no publicly owned networks. As a result, bidding wars in other countries, though just as fierce as in America, are different in two ways: they are often fought between public broadcasters and new upstarts, many of them pay channels; and they are usually about soccer.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nothing better illustrates the change taking place in the market for soccer rights than the vast deal struck in early July by Kirch, a German group owned by a secretive Bavarian media mogul. The group spent $2.2 billion for the world's biggest soccer-broadcasting rights: to show the finals of the World Cup in 2002 and 2006 outside America. That is over six times more than the amount paid for the rights to the World Cups of 1990, 1994 and 1998.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such vast bids gobble up a huge slice of a television company's budget. In America, reckons London Economics, a British consultancy, sport accounts for around 15% of all television-programme spending. For some television companies, the share is much larger. <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font> spends &#163;100m ($155m) a year on sports, about a third of its programming budget.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This seems to pose a threat to public broadcasting, for, in any bidding war outside America, public broadcasting companies are generally the losers. A consortium of mainly public broadcasters bought the rights to the 1990-98 World Cups for a total of $344m. This time around, the consortium raised its bid to around $1.8 billion, and still lost. Public broadcasters often do not have the money to compete: in Britain, the <font size=-1>BBC</font> spends about 4% of its programme budget on sport in a non-Olympic year, about &#163;15m a year less than <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The problem is that the value of sport to viewers ("consumer surplus", as economists would put it) is much larger than the value of most other sorts of programming. Public broadcasters have no way to benefit from the extra value that a big sporting event offers viewers. But with subscription television and with pay-<font size=-1>TV</font>, where viewers are charged for each event, the television company will directly collect the value viewers put on being able to watch.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Because of this, many people (especially in Europe) worry that popular sports will increasingly be available only on subscription television, which could, they fear, erode the popular support upon which public broadcasters depend. In practice, these worries seem excessive. Although far more sport will be shown on subscription television, especially outside America's vast advertising market, the most popular events are likely to remain freely available for many years to come, for two reasons.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;First, those who own the rights to sporting events are rarely just profit-maximisers: they also have an interest in keeping the appeal of their sport as broad as possible. They may therefore refuse to sell to the highest bidder. Earlier this year, the <font size=-1>IOC</font> turned down a $2 billion bid from Mr Murdoch's News Corp for the European broadcasting rights to the Olympic Games between 2000 and 2008 in favour of a lower bid from a group of public broadcasters. Sometimes, as with the sale of World-Cup rights to Kirch, the sellers may stipulate that the games be aired on "free" television.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Second, the economics of televising sport mean that the biggest revenues are not necessarily earned by tying up exclusive rights. Steven Bornstein, the boss of <font size=-1>ESPN</font>, argues that exclusive deals to big events are "not in our long-term commercial interest". Because showing sport on "free" television maximises the audience, some advertisers will be willing to pay a huge premium for the big occasion. So will sponsors who want their names to be seen emblazoned on players' shirts or on billboards around the pitch.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is not only a matter of audience size. Sport is also the most efficient way to reach one of the world's most desirable audiences from an advertiser's point of view: young men with cash to spend. Although the biggest audiences of young men are watching general television, sporting events draw the highest concentrations. So advertisers of products such as beer, cars and sports shoes can pay mainly for the people they most want to attract.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are other ways in which sport can be indirectly useful to the networks. A slot in a summer game is a wonderful opportunity to promote a coming autumn show. A popular game wipes out the audience share of the competition. And owning the rights to an event allows a network plenty of scope to entertain corporate grandees who may then become advertisers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the moment, though, advertising revenue is the main recompense that television companies get for their huge investments in sport. Overall, according to <i>Broadcasting &amp; Cable</i>, a trade magazine, sport generated $3.5 billion, or 10%, of total television advertising revenues in America last year. The biggest purchasers of sports rights by far in America are the national networks. <font size=-1>NBC</font> alone holds more big sports rights than any other body has held in the history of television. It can, obviously, recoup some of the bill by selling advertising: for a 30-second slot during the Super Bowl, <font size=-1>NBC</font> asked for $1.2m.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such deals, however, usually benefit the networks indirectly rather than directly. The Super Bowl is a rarity: it has usually made a profit for the network that airs it. "Apart from the Super Bowl, the World Series [for baseball] and probably the current Olympics, the big sports don't usually make money for the networks," says Arthur Gruen of Wilkowsky Gruen, a media consultancy. "But they are a boon for their affiliate stations, which can sell their advertising slots for two or three times as much as other slots." Although Fox lost money on its <font size=-1>NFL</font> purchase, it won the loyalty of affiliate stations (especially important for a new network) and made a splash.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Almost everywhere else, the biggest growth in revenues from showing sports will increasingly come from subscriptions or pay-per-view arrangements. The versatility and huge capacity of digital broadcasting make it possible to give subscribers all sorts of new and lucrative services.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In America, Direct<font size=-1>TV</font> and Primestar, two digital satellite broadcasters, have been tempting subscribers with packages of sporting events from distant parts of the country. "They have been creating season tickets for all the main events, costing $100-150 per season per sport," says John Mansell, a senior analyst with Paul Kagan, a Californian consultancy. In Germany <font size=-1>DF</font>1, a satellite company jointly owned by Kirch and <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font> and due for launch at the end of July, has the rights to show Formula One motor racing. It plans to allow viewers to choose to follow particular teams, so that Ferrari fanatics can follow their drivers, and to select different camera angles.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Italy, Telepiu, which launched digital satellite television in February, plans to offer viewers a package in September which will allow them to buy a season ticket to live matches played by one or more teams in the top Italian soccer leagues. The system's "electronic turnstile" is so sophisticated that it can shut off reception for subscribers living in the catchment area for a home game, to assuage clubs' worries that they will lose revenue from supporters at the gate. In fact, top Italian clubs usually have to lock out their fanatical subscribers to avoid overcapacity.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most skilful of all at using sports rights to generate subscription revenue is <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font>. It signed an exclusive contract with the English Premier League which has been the foundation of its success. Some of those who know <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font> well argue that &#163;5 billion of the business's remarkable capital value of &#163;8 billion is attributable to the profitability of its soccer rights.
</p><p><b>Winner take all</b></b>
<br>Just as the purchase of sporting rights enriches television companies, so their sale has transformed the finances of the sports lucky enough to be popular with viewers. On the whole, the biggest beneficiaries have not been the clubs and bodies that run sports, but the players. In the same way as rising revenues from films are promptly dissipated in vast salaries to stars in Hollywood, in sport the money coming in from television soon flows out in heftier payments to players.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In America, the market for sportsmen is well developed and the cost of players tends to rise with the total revenues of the main sporting organisations (see <a href="sf4.gif">chart</a>). Elsewhere, the market is newer and so a bigger slice of the revenues tend to stick to the television companies. "The big difference between sports and movies is the operating margins," says Chris Akers, chairman of Caspian, a British media group, and an old hand at rights negotiations. "Hollywood majors have per-subscriber deals. No sports federation has yet done such a deal."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Guided by the likes of Mr Akers, they soon will. Telepiu's latest three-year soccer contract gives the television firm enough revenue to cover its basic costs, guarantees the soccer league a minimum sum and then splits the takings down the middle. In Britain, <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font> is locked in dispute with the Premier League over the terms of the second half of its rights deal: should the league then be able to opt for half the revenue from each subscriber on top of or instead of a fixed hunk of net profits?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The logical next step would be for some clubs or leagues to set up their own pay-television systems, distributing their games directly by satellite or cable. A few people in British soccer are starting to look with interest at America's local sports networks, such as the successful Madison Square Garden cable network, and to wonder whether Europe might move the same way.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If it does, not all teams will benefit equally. In America, football has an elaborate scheme to spread revenues from national television across teams. But in other sports, including baseball, the wealth and size of a team's local market mean large differences in rights from local television. The New York Yankees make almost $50m a year from local television rights, says Brian Schechter, a Canadian media analyst. At the other end of the scale, the Kansas City Royals make $4m-5m a year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not all players benefit equally, either. Television has brought to sport the "winner-take-all" phenomenon. It does not cost substantially more to stage a televised championship game than a run-of-the-week, untelevised match. But the size of the audience, and therefore the revenue generated, may be hugely different. As a result, players good enough to be in the top games will earn vastly more than those slightly less good, who play to smaller crowds.
</p><p><b>The referee's whistle</b></b>
<br>The lure of money is already altering sport and will change it more. Increasingly, games will be reorganised to turn them into better television. British rugby-union officials are squabbling over the spoils from television rights. Rugby league, whose audiences had been dwindling, won a contract worth &#163;87m over five years from <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font> earlier this year in exchange for switching its games from winter to summer. Purists were aghast.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other reorganisations for the benefit of television will surely come. Mr Murdoch wants to build a rugby superleague, allowing the best teams around the world to play each other. A European superleague for soccer is possible. "At the moment, Manchester United plays <font size=-1>AC </font>Milan every 25 years: it's a joke," complains one enthusiast.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sports traditionalists resist changing their ways for the likes of Mr Murdoch. So far, the big sporting bodies have generally held out against selling exclusive pay-television rights to their crown jewels, and have sometimes deliberately favoured public broadcasters. Regulators have helped them, intervening in some countries to limit exclusive deals with pay-television groups. Britain has just passed a law to stop subscription channels tying up exclusive rights to some big events, such as the Wimbledon tennis championship. In Australia in March, a court threw out News Corp's attempt to build a rugby superleague as the lynchpin of its pay-television strategy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the real monopolists are not the media companies, but the teams. Television companies can play off seven or eight Hollywood studios against each other. But most countries have only one national soccer league, and a public that loves soccer above all other sports. In the long run, the players and clubs hold most of the cards. The television companies are more likely to be their servants than their masters.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?838421999,iss">Search</a>

<h4>LEXINGTON</h4><br><h1>Victor ludorum</h1>


<p>HERE is a seasonal riddle. It happens once every four years, features a marathon race and is watched by the whole
world. What is it? (Or, as they say in Atlanta, referring to the peculiar lizard-like mascot of the Games, What Izzy?)
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If your answer is the Olympic Games, you are right. If, on the other hand, your answer is the American presidential election, you are also right. This year the twain are, inevitably, intertwined. The Olympic Games may now be post-cold-war. But they are not, never have been and probably never will be even remotely post-political.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;True, the boycotts that kept the Americans from Moscow in 1980 and the Russians from Los Angeles in 1984 are a thing of the past. But the intrusion of politics did not begin or end with the superpower conflict. War prevented the summer Olympics from taking place in 1916, 1940 and 1944. In other years, politics has almost always forced its way into the Games, be it through brutal suppression of dissent (Mexico, 1968), black-power salutes (ditto), terrorist atrocity (Munich, 1972), or strange boycott (Montreal, 1976). The 1976 boycott by African countries was in protest against a tour of South Africa by a New Zealand rugby team, never mind that rugby is not an Olympic sport. For sheer absurdity, it is hard to beat the time when Brazil sent two teams representing different political persuasions; neither was allowed to compete.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That was in 1936, at the infamous "Nazi Games". Hitler was neither the first nor the last to use the Games for national propaganda. People who run countries have all too often fallen for the notion that sporting success somehow confers political legitimacy. Each new victory, proclaimed a Stalinist propagandist in 1951, "provides irrefutable proof of the superiority of socialist culture over the decaying culture of the capitalist states." On the other side, the commercial success of the 1984 Los Angeles Games irrefutably proved that there was life in capitalism yet.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With the collapse of communism, the number of countries taking part in the Games has grown, and the propensity for high political drama has shrunk. Yet the temptation to use the Games for political purposes remains irresistible. So it was for the Spaniards--or should one say Catalans?--who were the hosts of the first post-cold-war Olympics in Barcelona four years ago. And so it is this time.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Clinton-Gore campaign has long said that its model is Ronald Reagan's re-election campaign in 1984. The Clintonites well remember how President Reagan basked in the patriotic glow of the Los Angeles Games that year, donning the jacket of a gold-medal winner and talking of national heroism. They know the modern trick is to extract the maximum political benefit from the Games without appearing to politicise them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The question is not whether Mr Clinton will exploit the Olympics (he is already doing so, with all his customary enthusiasm), but whether he can restrain himself from going over the top. Mr Reagan had a sixth sense that told him not to upstage the athletes during the Games, says Peter Ueberroth, the impresario of the 1984 Olympics. The sense was not always shared by his staff. Before the Olympics, for example, White House aides wondered whether the president might deliver more than the statutory formula of words to open the Games, and had to be reminded that the last person who had had that idea was Hitler in 1936. Mr Reagan himself wisely refrained from attending any Olympic events beyond the opening ceremony, and left the possibility of putting the Games to more blatant political usage until after they were over.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Clinton has been less patient. He dispatched his wife and daughter to Greece for the lighting of the Olympic torch in April. His vice-president has been busy opening the Olympic stadium and announcing dollops of federal help (worth at least $230m) for the Games. Last month, after the Olympic flame spent the night at the White House on its way to Atlanta, Mr Clinton staged a parting ceremony timed for the morning television news. He opens the Games on Friday, he will entertain the American Olympians after the competition (and just before the Republican convention), and he will be back in Atlanta on August 16th to open the Paralympics for the disabled.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Starting with his state-of-the-union address in January and with increasing intensity since, Mr Clinton has been weaving references to the Games into his speeches and linking his campaign themes to Olympic values. The Olympic spirit, he says, is the "spirit of personal responsibility and best effort, the spirit of community, the spirit of unity." At the Rose Garden signing ceremony for the Church Arson Prevention Act last week, it was no surprise to find the president constrasting the evil flames destroying southern churches with the virtuous Olympic flame, symbol of the best of the human spirit, "now burning throughout the South."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Over the top? "It's become almost obscene," complains John McCain, a Republican senator from Arizona, who objects in particular to the deployment of some 13,000 military personnel to tasks that include driving buses for athletes. Mr McCain sees the White House's Olympic antics as the latest example of Clintonian excess. But whether the flag-waving American public will see things that way is doubtful.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At his party for the Olympic torch last month Mr Clinton singled out for special mention one of the torch-bearers, Carla McGhee, who almost died in a car accident but fought back to basketball triumph at the University of Tennessee and into the American Olympic team. The president did not mention another fine young athlete who years ago fought back from the brink of death and is also going for gold this year. His name is Bob Dole. But he is limping along some way down the track; it is, for the moment, Bill Clinton who wins the resounding title of <i>victor ludorum</i>.

<h1>Terrific Pacific</h1>

<p>AFTER a year or more of living too dangerously for their own liking, the foreign ministers of virtually all the countries of East Asia, and the United States, are converging on Jakarta for security talks early next week in the wake of this weekend's annual meeting of <font size=-1>ASEAN</font>, the Association of South-East Asian Nations. Seemingly little more than a giant cocktail party and only formally established two years ago, the <font size=-1>ASEAN</font> Regional Forum, as the wider gathering is called, nonetheless stands out as a diplomatic must in a region that otherwise lacks the habits of multilateral diplomacy. But already the forum is under fire for its failure to confront the main challenge to stability in East Asia: the rise of a more assertive China.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For those who had argued that the new focus on wealth-creation and trade would be enough to protect East Asia from the sorts of tensions that have disfigured it for much of this century, the events of the past 18 months have come as a rude shock. <font size=-1>ASEAN</font>'s seven governments (Brunei, Indonesia, Malaysia, the Philippines, Singapore, Thailand and Vietnam) are still reeling from China's occupation last year of Philippine-claimed Mischief Reef, one of the Spratly chain in the South China Sea. Since then China has reaffimed its long-standing claim to virtually the entire sea, adding to <font size=-1>ASEAN</font>'s troubles. More recently, China's attempts to intimidate Taiwan before its presidential election in March, by firing missiles into nearby waters, brought the largest flotilla of American warships to the region since the Vietnam war ended more than 20 years ago.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tensions have since subsided somewhat. America and China recently agreed to work to improve their strained relations and there is talk of an exchange of presidential visits next year. Last week, Anthony Lake, President Clinton's national security adviser, won China's approval for a joint American-South Korean proposal to include prickly and possibly nuclear-armed North Korea in four-way talks aimed at reducing tensions on the divided Korean peninsula. Meanwhile, the general regional unease has bolstered support, at least in private, for a continued American presence in the region as a stabilising force. It has also brought about a needed strengthening of the American-Japanese alliance (though neighbouring governments remain wary of Japan's taking on any wider security role).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To the region's trade-weighted optimists, all this shows that East Asia's recent troubles were nothing more than a few inevitable bumps on the road to a prosperous Pacific century. But there are potentially deadlier hazards ahead.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Taiwan is one. Although both China and Taiwan have since sought to talk down their differences, their confrontation earlier this year sent a frisson of fear through the region. Though most countries recognise only one government of China, in Beijing, Taiwan pays a large role in the region's trade and investment flows. A future Chinese grab for an increasingly independent-looking Taiwan could do enormous economic and financial damage to several countries. What is more, China's bullying of Taiwan augurs ill for the stability of Hong Kong, after its handover from Britain to China in 1997.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Though China is East Asia's biggest worry, it is not the only one. Continued economic growth is fuelling competition for the region's reefs and their nearby oil deposits and fish. Ironically, the <font size=-1>UN</font> Convention on the Law of the Sea, which was devised to help settle competing claims, has added to them. Since governments can now claim "exclusive economic zones" that stretch up to 200 nautical miles from their shores (well beyond their 12-mile territorial limit), the number of overlapping claims has multiplied. Many will eventually be sorted out amicably. However, the demand for new patrol boats, submarines and aircraft to police these zones--to keep out pirates, as well as acquisitive neighbours--is pushing up defence spending around an already jittery region.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In theory all this should give East Asia's assembled foreign ministers plenty to talk about when they meet next week. In practice, however, <font size=-1>ASEAN</font>'s regional forum has played little part in sorting out the recent tensions. As Michael Leifer argues in a new analysis for the London-based International Institute for Strategic Studies, <font size=-1>ASEAN</font>'s own preference for ducking difficult issues rather than confronting them presents the forum that it sponsors with "the same order of difficulty as the biblical Hebrew slaves in Egypt who were obliged to make bricks without straw."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet any new organisation in the region would have many of the same limitations. The forum includes China, because to leave out the region's fastest-growing economic and political power would be to emasculate it from the start. Yet China has blocked all mention (and membership) of Taiwan. The blight not only affects official discussions, but also those in "track two" , where academics and policy analysts toss about practical ideas on how to create regional confidence-building measures, environmental protection and the like.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is concern, too, that the forum is losing what little coherence it once had by taking in too broad a membership. This year India joins the forum, along with Myanmar. Yet India refuses to go along with the forum's support for the Nuclear Non-Proliferation Treaty and a ban on nuclear testing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>ASEAN</font>'s regional forum is, however, a beginning. What is needed now is the will to apply the habit of dialogue that <font size=-1>ASEAN</font> has sought to foster to the region's real security problems. Though some would argue that bricks without straw are better than no bricks at all--that talks for their own sake are better than no talks at all--East Asia's continued economic success needs a sturdier security foundation to rest on.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?838421999,iss">Search</a>

<p><b>Brazil</b></p>
<h1>Love or money</h1>

<font size=1>SAO PAULO</font>
<p>BRAZILIANS love a good soap opera. The <i>telenovelas </i>that fill their television screens follow a standard formula: glamorous women, sex, infidelity, violence, a touch of political intrigue and a dash of social realism. For the past month, the country has been gripped by just such a soap--but this is a real-life one.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It began on the morning of Sunday June 23rd, when two bodies were discovered sprawled across a bed in an opulent beach house outside Maceio, the capital of the north-eastern state of Alagoas. One of the bodies was of the house's owner: Paulo Cesar Farias, a 50-year-old former used-car salesman who achieved notoriety as the man who operated a huge influence-peddling scheme that led to the resignation of Fernando Collor as Brazil's president in 1992. The other victim was Suzana Marcolini, Mr Farias's 28-year-old lover.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the local police, the case was a straightforward crime of passion. Mr Farias, a widower, had been introduced to the exuberant Miss Marcolini, who counted Mr Collor among her former lovers, while he was serving a lenient sentence for his part in the corruption scheme, in an improvised cell in Maceio's fire station. But he had begun to tire of the liaison, having met Claudia Dantas, a blonde divorc&eacute;e from a prominent local family whom he may have planned to marry. He invited Miss Marcolini to a late (and drunken) dinner at the beach house to tell her of his decision to end their relationship. She objected, and they argued. Miss Marcolini shot Mr Farias and then herself with a revolver she had bought nine days earlier.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That is the hypothesis, and the evidence appears to support it; but few Brazilians are persuaded. This is because there are many powerful people who may be presumed to wish Mr Farias dead. As Mr Collor's campaign treasurer in 1989, Mr Farias was deluged with donations from Brazilian businessmen who feared the election of a left-wing president. After the election, he went on to extract money from many of the country's leading firms in return for promises of public contracts or other government favours. He assembled a fortune of at least $300m. Some was spent on Mr Collor and other officials. Much of the rest may be in the 50 or so bank accounts opened by Mr Farias in the world's tax havens.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ever the loyal retainer, Mr Farias had refused to reveal the details of this massive corruption scheme, although he was the only one involved to be punished. (Mr Collor is living, comfortably, in Miami.) But Mr Farias faced further charges. Some of those compromised by the scandal, it is argued, may have feared his silence would not last forever. For the many conspiracy theorists, his death amounted to "burning the files" . They point to shortcomings in the police investigation as suspicious. Why was Mr Farias's family allowed to burn the bloodstained sheets before they were submitted to forensic analysis? And why were Mr Farias's bodyguards, who discovered the bodies, not subjected to tests to discover whether they had recently fired a gun?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For many in Brazil's more sophisticated south, such questions merely reveal the feudal backwardness of Alagoas, a state which was a Collor family fief for decades. Its policemen are owed several months' wages and many of them (including those who worked for Mr Farias) double up as private security guards. The state Institute of Forensic Medicine is so hard up that the post-mortems on Mr Farias and Miss Marcolini were carried out with a kitchen knife, as the institute's director admitted in a tearful television interview.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The federal police and some distinguished forensic scientists, called in to help with the case, are due to report their findings later this month. Whereas in television soap operas all the loose ends are tied up in the final chapter, in this case Brazil will probably never know beyond all doubt whether Mr Farias was a victim of passion or of more sinister intrigue--or whether Miss Marcolini killed herself, or was also murdered. However, if there is one thing Brazilians like more than soap operas, it is sport--and already the country's attention is moving on to the Olympic Games.

<p><b>Government</b></p>
<h1>Overcooked leak</h1>

<p>AT <i>The Economist,</i> the leak this week of a Treasury paper canvassing a British version of Newt Gingrich's "Contract with America" triggered an odd sense of <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i>. Fourteen years ago, a paper by the government's Central Policy Review Staff (<font size=-1>CPRS</font>) was leaked to us. It warned ministers that, without dramatic cuts in spending on social security and education, public spending would rise as a percentage of gross domestic product. "Publish the lot and let the people judge," we said. Instead, the cabinet threw out the document, and Britain's welfare state staggered on.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The latest leaked document should be a lot less controversial than that earlier one. Its origins are not political at all, but managerial. Sir Terry Burns, the Treasury's permanent secretary, wanted to rebut claims that his department was short-termist and reactive. So he commissioned one of his brightest younger officials to look at possible scenarios facing the department in the years 2000-2005, and to advise on how it should tool up to meet them. Any public company which failed to plan ahead in this way would deserve to be roasted alive by its shareholders.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The document sketches out different possible futures, including one in which pensions, unemployment benefit and sickness pay are covered by private insurance. But since Labour will probably be in power in the year 2000, more important than the Newt Gingrich scenario may be one which attempts to get to grips with New Labour thinking. As the document points out, "Treasury officials have a high level of commitment to the efficiency of the market mechanism, to neo-classical welfare economics and to the utilitarian ethics on which they are based". So have current ministers, but even "New" Labour may not be so keen.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bravely--though ironically in view of the leak--the author explains that traditional Treasury secrecy is a dead letter. With greater parliamentary demands for information and the drive towards greater accountability "we would not be able to rewrite or edit papers or fillet files as now". It canvasses options for a greater openness which is now inevitable as well as overdue.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The document's firmer conclusions do not concern policy but manpower. The Treasury will probably need more lawyers to regulate private pension providers. It will certainly need more officials who understand the European Union. Hear, hear.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All this represents a creditable attempt at forward planning. So why did Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, instantly take to the airwaves to denounce the document, which he had not read, as the work of "kids in the office"? The reason, alas, is the same as that that caused Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, to denounce it as a plan for "the demoliton of Britain's welfare state": politics. With a Commons debate on the economy held on July 17th, the day the leak appeared in the <i>Times</i>, any ammunition was welcome to an opposition eager to snuff out Mr Clarke's attempts to propagate the "feelgood factor".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1982, as recorded above, our appeal for the <font size=-1>CPRS</font> document to be published in full was ignored, and it was suppressed. However, there was a sequel. During the 1983 election campaign, Peter Shore, the shadow chancellor, was able to provide a full text of a paper by the Chancellor which went with the <font size=-1>CPRS</font> paper to the <i>Sunday Times</i>. "It gave us the most uncomfortable few days of the election campaign," one Tory aide of the time recalls. If they do not want to suffer <i>d&eacute;j&agrave; vu</i> again during the forthcoming campaign, the Tories would do well to take the advice we proffer to them today as we did then: publish the document now, in full, and relish a public debate of its contents. They are not scary--indeed, the evidence that Whitehall is for once planning ahead before the future hits it in the face might win the government some credit.

<p><b>Public spending</b></p>
<h1>
EDXpendable
</h1><p>FOUR years ago, John Major forged a bright new sword to chop public spending. Tarnished bilateral deals between spending ministers and the Treasury were out. Instead, how much each department got was decided by a new cabinet committee, <font size=-1>EDX</font> (<font size=-1>ED</font> equals "economic and domestic", <font size=-1>X</font> equals expenditure, since you ask). Tough spending limits?--since <font size=-1>EDX</font> was stuffed with non-spending ministers, you got them. Better priorities?--since <font size=-1>EDX</font> weighs all spending bids against each other you got them too. "My bet is that it will survive to become institutionalised, almost constitutionalised," said Sarah Hogg, a former head of Mr Major's policy unit and one of the system's inventors.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;She may have spoken too soon. <font size=-1>EDX</font> will begin its work over the summer, following the cabinet's discussion on overall spending limits at its meeting on July 18th. But, according to some insiders, it has lost its edge.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It used to set about its work with relish. Hapless spending ministers had only a few minutes to present a case, before a summary verdict. Moreover, the system laid down that if one minister got more money out of cabinet after <font size=-1>EDX</font> had fixed his spending, some other minister would get less. Spending ministers tended to back the chancellor against any colleague who asked cabinet for more. Few appeals to cabinet against <font size=-1>EDX</font> decisions as a result succeeded.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Treasury ministers are less impressed with <font size=-1>EDX</font>'s recent record. A particular problem has been the presence of Michael Howard, the home secretary. Originally put on the committee as a right-winger who was tough on spending, Mr Howard now also needs more and more money to send more and more people to jail. Nor is he the only one. The rest of the committee either have biggish budgets (see <a href="br1.gif">table</a>), or have the job of getting cuts through Parliament.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor is <font size=-1>EDX</font> now any good at setting priorities. The limits on public spending have been tough. The 1995 Budget looked for a real cut of 1.1% between 1995-96 and 1996-97. Never mind priorities: in order to hit their targets, ministers had to cut.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The usual low tricks have come into play, including slashing capital budgets to pay for current spending. The government is thereby storing up trouble for itself--or its successor. For example, the efficiencies it wants to achieve in administering social security benefits require big investment in information technology. But the government has yet to find the cash to pay for it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How might things be improved? First, the government could move away from the concept that all programmes are re-set every year. Pensions and social security spending is the place to start. Because Britain is now a low-inflation economy (at least for the moment), increases need not be made every year. Had there been no increases this year, the Treasury would have saved &#163;2.7 billion.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Without such big automatic increases, the government would have more room at the margin to fix its priorities. However, under the present system, no minister has an interest in priorities across the government. The chancellor is mostly out to deliver low spending so he can cut taxes. Individual ministers are mostly out to get every penny they can for their own programmes so they look virile. The only person in government with overall responsibility for its performance is the prime minister. But he is not even on <font size=-1>EDX</font>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He should chair the committee, with his own independent briefing, measuring what was being proposed against his government's political priorities. Until he is, he will remain on the margins of some of the most important decisions his government has to make.

<h1>Conviction politician</h1>

<p>"PRISON works," the rallying cry of Michael Howard, the home secretary, has made him unpopular with all sorts of people, not least the Treasury. Although he has been squeezing costs per prisoner, numbers are rising so swiftly that the prison service is unlikely to be able to live within its budget. Still, if the extra money were going to bang up violent offenders, which politicians think the public wants, it might be well spent.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Figures just released, however, indicate that things are going the other way. Between 1993, when the prison population reached its lowest point for nine years, and June 1995, the most recent available figure, there was a slight drop in the proportion of offenders in jail for all categories of violent offences, and a slight increase in those for all categories of non-violent offences. The effect of changes at the margin on the overall figures is small. However, over the years, if current sentencing practice continues, they will be magnified.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The proportion of those in jail for violence against the person is down from 22.7% to 22.3%; mugging is down from 14.9% to 13.6%. Those inside for drug offences are up from 9.7% to 10.8%, those for motoring offences up from 3.2% to 4.3%. As the prison population has gone up by 20% during those two years, the numbers of violent as well as non-violent offenders is increasing, but the numbers of non-violent offenders show a remarkable jump: drug offenders in jail, for instance, are up from 3,208 to 4,260.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One reason for this is probably the 1993 Criminal Justice Act, which made provision for jailing offenders for a series of minor offences. Another may be what is described as the "sentencing climate" for judges. If judges think that the home secretary wants more people in jail, they tend to act accordingly. Paul Cavadino of the National Association for the Care and Resettlement of Offenders speculates that the figures may reflect the fact that violent offenders would have been sent to jail anyway, so if judges wish to send more people to jail, much of the impact is bound to fall on non-violent offenders.

<p><b>Roads</b></p>
<h1>Murdering the cathedral</h1>


<p>PRESSED by a fearsome alliance of the Treasury and environmentalists, the government has ditched most new road construction. The notable exception is city bypass roads. But although saving cities from thundering lorries sounds like sense, such roads have many opponents, and not all of them are hairy tree-dwellers camped around Newbury. John Gummer, the environment secretary, has for six months been locked in dispute with the Department of Transport over its determination to build a bypass around Salisbury. This battle, on which a decision is expected shortly, is the culmination of an argument that has been going on for a generation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Described by its opponents as "a concrete necklace which will disfigure one of the loveliest cities in England", the 11-mile bypass has been controversial since it was first mooted twenty years ago. It would carve through chalk hills, three sites of scientific interest and one of the most beautiful views in the whole of England, made famous by Constable: Salisbury Cathedral seen across the Avon water meadows.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Local opposition is fierce. An official from the environment department reckons that if ministers gave the go-ahead, the resulting row would make the protests that obstructed the building of the Newbury by-pass look like a picnic. On the other side, the local Tory <font size=-1>MP</font>, Robert Key, a former minister for roads, is infuriated by Mr Gummer's resistance to a scheme which he claims is widely backed by local opinion. "The lone figure of Mr Gummer is now throwing doubt on this project. If it is kicked into touch, it will have very serious consequences," he warns.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The project's fate appears to be finely balanced. The environment secretary's filibuster is making his cabinet colleagues uneasy. The transport secretary, Sir George Young, who is scarcely less green than Mr Gummer, is expected to announce that, after a lengthy public inquiry, he is "minded to approve" the bypass but is prepared to listen to further representations from interested bodies.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One such group, Salisbury District Council, called on July 15th for the public inquiry to be re-opened to consider new evidence on traffic growth. The government's own environmental watchdog, English Nature, also wants the inquiry reopened. The most pressing case for a rethink is made in a new study by the government's Standing Advisory Committee on Trunk Road Assessment, which casts doubt on the claimed benefits of the bypass. Using this research, the Metropolitan Transport Research Unit, a consultancy, claims that additional traffic generated by the bypass would cancel any benefits to the city.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Gummer may be a lonely figure in government but his case is strong. There are other ways of restricting the city's traffic growth without ruining some of the most beautiful countryside in Britain. Pricing people out of the centre of the city, for instance, would do it; or, if a bypass were essential, build it in a tunnel. Those options, however, would require political courage--or money.

<p><b>Price-fixing</b></p>
<h1>Drug wars</h1>

<p>SINCE 1964, it has been illegal for manufacturers to fix retail prices for everything except books and drugs. Last September, the net book agreement, the book industry's price-fixing agreement, collapsed when supermarkets started discounting. Now Britain's last legal resale price maintenance arrangement is in danger. The supermarkets are attacking it, and both the Office of Fair Trading (<font size=-1>OFT</font>) and the European Commission are trying to decide whether it is justified any longer.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The supermarket chain Asda, which is leading the crusade against price-fixing, maintains that it represents a &#163;300m tax on consumers. Of that, Asda claims, 80% goes into the drugs companies' pockets.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The price-fixers' defence is mounted by the Community Pharmacy Action Group (<font size=-1>CPAG</font>) which, despite its grassroots sounding name, is an umbrella organisation representing drug manufacturers and retailers. They maintain that price-fixing must be retained not because it fattens manufacturers' profits, but because it sustains small chemists' shops.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These are important, they say, both because they provide local access to drugs and because the higher mark-up allows them to offer services which cost-paring supermarkets would not. Pharmacists, who receive a basic training, offer free medical advice and their shops hold a wider range of medicines than a supermarket would.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>CPAG</font> maintains that trained pharmacists also help the health service. If they were not available to give advice, more people would go to their doctors.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A report commissioned by <font size=-1>CPAG</font> from Deloitte &amp; Touche, a firm of accountants, predicts apocalyptic consequences should the agreement be scrapped. Some 3,000 chemists' shops, it maintains, would go under, at a net cost of 3,000 jobs. The range of drugs directly available to the public, says the report, would shrink to a tenth of its current level. The additional burden on the <font size=-1>NHS</font> would cost around &#163;4.7 billion.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Similar predictions were made by the publishers and book retailers when they were struggling to maintain the net book agreement. So far, there is little sign that they are being borne out. According to Bookwatch, the industry's sales monitor, sales are running around 1.3% higher than last year. The Booksellers Association says that it has not noticed a net loss of bookshops; rather, its membership has risen by 10% since last year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is also far from certain that scrapping drugs price-fixing would increase the burden on the <font size=-1>NHS</font>. Alan Maynard, a health economist at York University, argues the opposite. He reckons that high prices in pharmacies may drive people to their doctors to get their drugs more cheaply on prescription. Lower prices, accordingly, would promote self-medication and keep people out of the surgery.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>OFT</font> is expected to make up its mind in the autumn. Even if it does decide to ban the arrangement, the government could retain some of the benefits of the present system--for instance by subsidising pharmacists directly to continue to give free medical advice--while slashing the price of drugs. That would benefit consumers, not drugs companies.

<p><b>Apple Computer</b></p>
<h1>Small in Japan</h1>

<p>IT IS always a little worrying when a company is praised for making a smaller loss than expected. Apple Computer's $32m third-quarter loss, announced on July 17th, came as a relief, given that the erstwhile guiding light of Silicon Valley had lost $740m in the previous quarter (see <a href="wb1.gif">chart</a>). Less noticed are the first signs that its snazziest new product, a game-machine-cum-Internet-surfer called the Pippin, is doing badly. In the four months since its launch in Japan, only 18,000 Pippins have been sold, a third as many as had been expected.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is hardly surprising. Little more than a stripped-down Macintosh computer, with a joystick instead of a keyboard, Pippin resembles an upmarket compact-disc player. It is designed to sit in the living room and plug into a television set and hi-fi. Though, at around $600, it is cheaper than a multimedia computer, it is roughly $400 more than the best dedicated games machines, such as Sony's PlayStation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Apple's hope is that Pippin will appeal to people who want to dabble with multimedia and the Internet but prefer to avoid the hassle and expense of buying a personal computer. But this market has not yet developed, and when it does Pippin will not be alone in it. Dozens of companies are developing "network computers" that should allow consumers to reach the Internet via their <font size=-1>TV</font>. Such machines will be roughly $100 cheaper than Pippin, though the latter has the advantage of its own <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> drive, so that it can run its own software instead of depending on the programs it will download from the Net.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Japan, Pippin has been manufactured and marketed by Apple's licensee, Bandai, a Japanese firm responsible for Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers, a popular game. Like most game-machine makers, Bandai sells each Pippin at a loss, hoping to make its profits from the software. But despite throwing in Internet software, six <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> titles and a generous subsidy, Bandai has been unable to trigger the demand for Pippin that it had hoped. It looks certain to miss a revised (and reduced) target of 200,000 sales in the first year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What went wrong? The few Pippin buyers turned out not to be young Japanese teenagers, desperate for the Mighty Morphin' Power Rangers, but their middle-aged parents. The bundled software, aimed at children, missed its mark. Access to the Internet did not much excite these older buyers either. Bandai now sells a cheaper Pippin without the Internet gadgets; it may also adapt the package so that it contains more software for adults.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Apple says it is confident not only that the Japanese market will pick up but that Pippin will fare much better in America and Europe, where it will be launched later this year. Its optimism is based on the fact that most multimedia games and software are developed on Apple's Macintosh computers and so should be a cinch to convert for Pippin. This should set Pippin apart from previous multimedia consoles--notably one made by <font size=-1>3DO</font>, another Californian company, that flopped because nobody wrote software for it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The hitch is that, although developers design their games on Macs, they nearly always aim their finished product at the much bigger <font size=-1>PC</font> market. A few weeks later, they release a Mac version. If a market of 23m Mac users fails to attract software developers, it is hard to see how a few thousand Pippin users will. The early signs are that most big developers will stay away until Pippin develops a following.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is, though, another reason why America may be keener on Pippin than Japan has been. America is hooked on the Internet, whereas it remains a novelty in Japan. The American Pippin will be shipped with a Web browser which can understand Java, a language expected to be the future of Internet software. Even with this advantage, however, Pippin's competition will be tough: Sega recently announced a modem and Internet package to accompany its Saturn games console.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the end, Pippin's success will depend on price. The present $400 gap between it and the game machines looks daunting. One way to narrow this price difference would be to find a services firm--such as a phone or cable-television company--to lease Pippins to households. The only other licensee, Katz Media, a Norwegian firm, is rumoured to be looking for such partners in France.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By basing much of Pippin around existing technology, Apple has kept its investment in the project fairly small. That has limited its risk. But it has also limited its possible return. Apple will receive a royalty of around $15 on each Pippin sold, and a further few dollars for each <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> title. <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font> buyers seem to be a thrifty group. Last year, the average multimedia <font size=-1>PC</font> owner bought only one title. But Sony has sold around 4m of its PlayStations in the past 12 months, and the average PlayStation owner buys around five <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>s. If Pippin sells as well as the PlayStation, it will help Apple. But it will not save the company on its own.

<h1>Ringing the unwired</h1>

<p>ONE year ago the idea of using the Internet to make normal telephone calls was risible; nowadays it is supposed to herald the end of the telephone company. The truth is somewhere in between. It is possible to make an Internet call, but only if you are prepared to put up with sound quality that Marconi might have complained about; and there must be two forewarned computer owners with Internet connections and matching software at each end.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What is missing in Internet telephony is a simple device in every home that can notify its owner of an incoming call and then connect it. In short, a telephone. On July 16th, <font size=-1>IDT</font>, a New Jersey firm which is best known for its cut-price "call-back" service for international dialling, launched the first commercial Internet service that rings your telephone.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Internet service, like the call-back one, relies on using <font size=-1>IDT</font>'s calling centre as a conduit. A customer, who still needs a <font size=-1>PC</font> to initiate a call, contacts <font size=-1>IDT</font> via the Internet. <font size=-1>IDT</font>'s calling centre then transfers the call to the normal American telephone network, where it becomes an ordinary call, ring and all. The only clue that such a call has travelled over the Internet is that it sounds terrible.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But, then again, it is cheap: ten cents per minute for calls to America, and American charges for calls elsewhere. Though a "pure" Internet voice call can cost nothing, it is a lot more fuss than <font size=-1>IDT</font>'s hybrid. One consultancy, International Data, is already predicting that by 1997 more than 5m users will be phoning each other over the Internet. Whether they will be able to hear each other is another matter.</td></tr></table>

<h1>Wall Street's twists and turns</h1>

<font size=1>NEW YORK AND LONDON</font><p><b>After a long ascent, America's stockmarkets are spinning hither and thither, unnerving investors around the globe. What has changed?</b></p>

<p>DO NOT blame Hurricane Bertha, the remnants of which howled through Manhattan last weekend; the release in May of the tornado-worshipping film "Twister" was a far better portent of things to come in America's stockmarkets. Share prices have been slipping since late that month, and their volatility has increased sharply. Wall Street was hit this week by one of the most violent financial whirlwinds in its history.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On July 15th the Dow Jones industrial average declined by 161 points, or 2.9%, to 5,350. The following day, it opened modestly higher, but by midday had dropped another 85 points, and by early afternoon it was in free-fall. Then sentiment suddenly changed: spurred by buying in futures markets, the Dow rose beyond its opening level by 89 points and finally closed eight points higher, at 5,358. By July 17th, the market had recovered some of its poise, rising a modest 18 points.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The fallout from all this activity spread way beyond America's borders. Although Europe's stockmarkets have been reasonably robust of late, Germany's <font size=-1>DAX</font> index fell by 3.2% on July 16th and London's <font size=-1>FT</font>-<font size=-1>SE</font> 100 index dropped by 1.8%, partly because it closed before the Dow's late rally. Japan's stockmarket has also proved twitchy: the Nikkei index fell by 1.6% on the same day.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The recent volatility of the Dow, reflected in heavy share trading (see <a href="fn1.gif">chart</a>) has left even Wall Street's hardened veterans puzzled. Why is the Dow now some 9.2% below its peak of 5,833 on May 23rd? Why has the Nasdaq index, which contains many big, high-technology stocks, fallen some 13% this year? And why have European and Asian markets, which had seemed to be immune to Wall Street's gyrations in recent months, been hit by the turbulence this time round?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As usual, the biggest factor affecting all of these markets is America's economy. Most observers agree that it is growing fast, although there is some disagreement about exactly how fast. On July 16th the government revised its forecast for annual <font size=-1>GDP</font> growth for 1996 to 2.6%, up from 2.2%. Few Wall Street economists dissent, unless it is to argue that growth will be even higher. The same day brought news that in June, the 12-month consumer-price inflation rate fell to 2.8%.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In theory, such a combination of steady growth and low inflation should be unmitigated good news for corporate earnings and for bond yields, and hence for the stockmarket. In theory, too, the benefits should be felt beyond the United States. Many European exporters suffered badly last year when American factories cut production to shrink their stockpiles. They have thus been counting on America's rebound to help drag their economies out of the doldrums.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So why have stockmarkets suddenly spun out of control? One reason is that investors are no longer certain that America's impressive performance will continue. This week's good inflation news, for example, seem to contradict figures released on July 5th, which showed that employment and wages had risen sharply in June. That announcement sent government-bond yields soaring. By July 17th, however, 30-year Treasury yields had fallen back to around 7%--roughly where they were two weeks earlier. Nevertheless, some economists think that America's Federal Reserve will raise interest rates soon.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The outlook for corporate earnings, too, is far from clear. Motorola, Hewlett Packard and Digital Equipment, three big technology firms, announced weaker than expected profits in the week beginning July 8th. The thought that earnings assumptions had been too optimistic sent the Dow tumbling on July 12th.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet plenty of investors still think that America Inc will surprise the doomsayers. Abby Cohen, a strategist at Goldman Sachs, an investment bank, points out that by July 16th only 17% of the companies in the broad <font size=-1>S&P</font> 500 index had reported their earnings. Of those, positive earnings surprises outnumbered negative ones by two to one. Indeed, on July 16th and 17th the market was cheered by strong results from big companies such as Ford, General Electric and Intel. This helps to explain why, although it retreated, the market did not suddenly collapse--and why it is capable of bursts of strength.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Outside America, investors are equally perplexed. Electronics firms in Japan have been affected by the same factors that hammered American technology stocks. The prices of semiconductors, which account for a big chunk of their profits, have fallen sharply. This week's stockmarket weakness also suggests that Europeans are no longer sanguine about the outlook for their firms' profits, given the impact that weakness in America could have on their own exporters. To make matters worse, the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark rose sharply against the dollar, reaching <font size=-1>DM</font>1.49 on July 17th, compared with <font size=-1>DM</font>1.52 a week earlier.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Here too, however, the outlook is far from clear. Oliver Kamm, a strategist at <font size=-1>HSBC</font> James Capel, a stockbroker, thinks that much of the expected growth in Western Europe's corporate earnings will come from fatter profit margins as firms restructure, rather than from rising revenues. This suggests that export growth may not be crucial to the health of European bourses.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor is it obvious how markets will react now that the apparently inexorable connection between new investment and rising share prices has been dented. During 1995, when the <font size=-1>S&P</font> 500 index rose by 34.1%, $131 billion of net new money flowed into America's equity mutual funds. In the first five months of this year, a further $121 billion of new money has poured in, but the <font size=-1>S&P</font> has barely moved. That may partly be due to a rash of flotations and secondary share offerings by American firms, which have mopped up much of the new money.
</p><p><b>In the eye of the storm</b></b>
<br>Investors looking for clues as to what markets might do next are watching the world's central bankers closely. As <i>The Economist</i> went to press on July 18th, Alan Greenspan, the chairman of the Federal Reserve Board, was due to make his semi-annual appearance before Congress. He was widely expected to emphasise the Fed's hawkish stance on inflation; more subtle hints have in the past been enough to send the stockmarket reeling. As Byron Wien, a strategist at Morgan Stanley, an investment bank, puts it, "Most bull markets don't die of natural causes, they are killed by the Fed." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In fact, the central bank may not raise rates any time soon. Its inclination to do so may have been tempered by the same reports of weak earnings that drove down share prices. If the Fed sits tight, this will increase pressure on Germany's central bankers to take matters into their own hands. Even before this week's turmoil, many pundits were urging the Bundesbank to cut interest rates. Now that the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark has risen sharply against the dollar, Hans Tietmeyer, the bank's president, may be more willing to oblige. Indeed, on July 16th, as the dollar plummeted and the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark soared, he suggested publicly that the next move in rates was likely to be down--a surprisingly candid statement from a tight-lipped Bundesbanker. The bank's next formal meeting to discuss monetary policy will be on July 25th.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The thinking of central bankers should become clearer in the next week or two; so should the outlook for corporate America, as more firms unveil their results. In the meantime, investors are almost certainly in for a bumpy ride.

<p><b>TECHNOLOGY BRIEF</b></p>
<h1>Taken to the air</h1>
<p><b>A wired world sounds like a splendid thing. But the third in our series of articles on access to the Internet asks whether a wireless one might be better still</b></p>

<p>GETTING wired without having to use wires is an Internet zealot's dream of mobile Internet access. It even thrills some companies--but for a different reason. They see wireless as a way to challenge those telephone or cable-<font size=-1>TV</font> firms that have seemed set to capture the market for high-speed, but fixed, Internet connections.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a limited sense, it is already possible to use the Internet wirelessly. With a laptop computer, a cellular telephone, and a gadget to connect the two, you can tap into the Internet from anywhere within range of your mobile-telephone company's network. But this is expensive and slow. Data can travel no faster than 9,600 bits per second (bps), just a third the speed of transmission over an ordinary telephone line.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Three better methods are now gaining ground. They are direct satellite links (which will receive the separate article they deserve next week), packet radio networks and "wireless cable". Each is designed for different needs and markets (see <a href="st1.gif">chart</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Packet radio is for the cyberpunk on the move. A couple of firms already provide this service, which consists, much like a cellular-telephone system, of a network of cheap, short-range, two-way radios. A few of the radios are connected to a wire network, which is itself connected to the Internet. The user buys a subscription, and a special modem for his laptop computer. He can then keep in touch through the nearest radio.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This can work out to be several times cheaper than a cellular-telephone connection, because packet radio squeezes data on to the airwaves more efficiently. But it is still more expensive to use--for about the same speed--than regular telephone lines. Its advantage is its mobility; some customers may prefer a slim and agile Internet connection to a fat, fixed one.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Wireless cable, which is fat and fixed, may have broader appeal. Its oxymoronic name is due to its origin: a way to offer cable television without the cables, by beaming programmes through the airwaves from a transmitter to homes within a certain area. Also known as the multichannel multipoint distribution system, wireless cable <font size=-1>TV</font> already has about 900,000 American subscribers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Wireless cable can carry Internet traffic as well as <font size=-1>TV</font> broadcasts--all that is needed besides an antenna is a special modem to translate the signals going to and from the ether. Like wired cable, it has plenty of capacity: the amount of data delivered by a television signal is huge by Internet standards. But wireless, already fast, can be more easily and cheaply converted to carry the digital signals that will make it faster still.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At present, each wireless-cable channel carries 30m bps of data. By going digital (as America's regulators have now said they can), these wireless networks will be able to multiply that figure five or six times.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Wireless cable is also cheap to set up. A transmitting station, or "head-end", from which <font size=-1>TV</font> programmes or Internet data can be broadcast to any house in the line of sight within 40 or 50km (25-30 miles), only costs around $1m (although it will be four times that for digital broadcasts). The costs at the "foot-end"--an antenna, modem and installation--are only incurred when a paying customer signs up. The costs of wiring up a customer are therefore matched by immediate revenues--a dramatic contrast with the wired-cable business, where providers are still paying off the debts they took on to lay their underground lines.
</p><p><b>Not so fast</b></b>
<br>Investors think this sounds pretty tasty. When one of the larger wireless-cable operators, <font size=-1>CAI</font> Wireless, announced at the end of May that it was testing a wireless Internet service, its shares more than doubled. But the technology does have limitations. Unlike television, where everybody gets the same signal, on the Internet each user is typically looking at something different--and needs a separate bit of the airwaves. Further, big central transmitters beaming signals in all directions are good at sending lots of data, but less good at receiving it. Since the wireless-cable system is not broken into small cells, as are the packet-radio or cellular-telephone networks, it is less able to distribute scarce radio spectrum efficiently over the thousands of homes that may want to talk back at once.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some trials of wireless Internet access have worked around this by having users send out data through their telephone lines, while the response comes back through the airwaves. This works for most purposes, since what goes out is little more than requests for more to come in. But it is hardly wireless: it ties up a telephone line and delays connections. So companies are now trying two-way access: these systems can juggle the wireless capacity between incoming and outgoing data, but accommodate fewer users.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Though wireless operators claim impressive speeds for their modems--10m bps, soon to rise to 27m bps--these will only apply when a tiny handful of people are using a channel. In practice, operators will probably have to limit most users to 128,000 bps, with up to 1m bps for those customers willing to pay more.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Capacity can, however, be increased in several ways. One, already used in cellular-telephone systems, is called "sectorising" . Instead of sending the same signals out in all directions, the antenna splits the transmission area into wedges. Each wedge is treated as a separate area, and the frequencies reused in each one. A recent trial in Lakeland, Florida, by two operators, American Telecasting and People's Choice <font size=-1>TV</font>, used 48 wedges. Even more vigorous sectorising should become possible in the future. With digital transmission, the wireless operators estimate they will be able to serve up to 50,000 users per channel, all at a speed of 128,000 bps.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Wireless cable should also benefit from the advent of more channels. Initially, only 33 frequencies were set aside for wireless cable in any given area. America's Federal Communications Commission is now expected to license some new higher-frequency bands, which will have lots of capacity but a shorter range for transmissions, about 5km. These networks would be much more cellular, with booster transmitters to carry the signal to and from the main one. With their high capacities, these might serve densely populated areas.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nonetheless, wireless cable will not beat other rival technologies on speed. Its technical advantages are less evident to consumers than to the companies trying to get in on some Internet action. In fact, the telephone operators hope to use this to forestall competition from rival cable companies. They see it as a cheap way to reach homes with video and high-speed data while they upgrade or build faster wire networks. Last month Bell Atlantic and Nynex, two American regional telephone companies, announced a $100m investment in <font size=-1>CAI</font> Wireless to provide television and Internet access; <font size=-1>CAI</font> Wireless is meanwhile buying several smaller wireless companies. But the attitude to this kind of wireless among industrialists is still fluid. Some think that it will complement wire networks; others, only that it will prepare the way for them.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?838421999,iss">Search</a>

<h1><center>Showing Europe's firms the way</center></h1>


IN 1967 a French politician, Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber, published a best-seller called "The American Challenge". In it he argued that the influence of transatlantic multinationals in Europe was growing relentlessly and would<b>, </b>if unchecked, destroy Europe's distinctive, "civilised" capitalism.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nearly 30 years later, Europe is facing a new American challenge. As the article on pages 19-21 explains, an aggressive new-world capitalism is spreading all over the old world. Conglomerates are being broken up; shareholders are clamouring for their rights; the old stable links between managers, owners and bankers are being burst apart.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As before, many Europeans fear that this spells the end of Europe's business civilisation. They foresee an American maelstrom of atomistic competition, job insecurity and social division. Are they right to be so worried? Are they even right that something of great significance is afoot? To the second question, the answer must be Yes: the changes are far-reaching already and there will be more to come. But the critics are wrong to conclude that the changes are for the worse. Rather, the new business methods give Europeans a chance to liberate what is distinctive and advantageous in Europe from the things that hold the continent back.
</p><p><b>An end to Eurosclerosis?</b></b>
<br>The changes in Europe mostly concern management technique and business organisation. Such things are not really "European" or "American". On the whole, there are bad ways of managing and good ways. On the whole, Europe has more bad ones than America does. What is happening now--as often in the past--is that Europeans are copying good business methods from America.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That said, it is also clear that firms do affect the societies they work in, and the critics of "Americanisation" are right to say that Europe faces big changes as a consequence. In most continental European countries, strong business relationships are highly valued; the "European model" fosters long-term ties between managers, owners and workers. In contrast, in America and Britain, firms are more influenced by shareholders who rely not on personal ties but on published accounts, straightforward ownership structures and clear goals for managers. The spread of such practices is no small matter.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Critics of Americanisation are also justified when they say that the change from one system to another will be sudden, not smooth. Adopting "shareholder value" as a yardstick is a bit like getting pregnant: nothing much happens at the start but soon your whole life changes. Conglomerates are broken up. Share buy-backs and share-option schemes come in. Those in turn dissolve the old groups of investors, as managers look to the markets for new money and investors wonder whether they want their capital tied up in the new businesses. Suddenly, you are in a different world.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But in lamenting the move from one system to another, critics are mistaking the symptom for the disease--the underlying weakness of the existing system. Remember that Europeans are adopting these ideas willingly. They know that something is badly wrong with the "European model".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not all indicators of European economic performance suggest that a crisis is at hand. Though profit margins, returns on equity and job creation have all lagged far behind America, European labour productivity has increased twice as fast as America's since 1979. Not much wrong there, you might think. But the truth is that Europe is under great external strain already, and faces worse.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Today, big European firms compete for capital internationally. Their traditional ways of raising cash are too expensive: big firms can save millions by borrowing in New York or London. Europe is also experiencing a delayed response to the single-market programme of 1992. No longer are so many firms dominant suppliers in small, protected markets; no longer do they have such cosy ties with governments. A lot of protection remains, of course--too much--but the direction of reform is unmistakeable. America's more open, market-friendly structure is better suited to this new environment than Europe's traditional opacity.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More serious still, Europe has a poor record in the knowledge-based industries that will probably drive growth in the future. Europeans ought to do well here: their universities, design schools and scientific establishments are among the best. But except in a few areas (fashion and high-price engineering spring to mind) Europeans are failing--and their failures spring from the "European model" . Where personal reputation is so important, entrepreneurs are unwilling to risk bankruptcy. Where stockmarkets are not transparent and founding families or cautious bankers have big stakes, it is often impossible for outsiders to invest in a business.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For these reasons, it is good news that Europe's bosses are breaking the mould. The changes will be sudden and, to many, alarming. Because aspects of the European system are enshrined in law, such as the social chapter of the Maastricht treaty, the changes may bring managers into conflict with politicians. So be it: Europe's extensive state meddling--its welfare programmes, its labour-market rules--are the worst impediments to growth of all. The new business practices are no impediment at all, but the opposite: a way not just to raise profits, but also to invest more in what Europe is best at.

<h2>Sects and violence</h2>
<p>A stand-off between police and Orange Order marchers set off <b>Protestant riots</b> throughout Northern Ireland. On July 11th the police changed their minds and violently cleared Catholic protesters from the marchers' route.
<p>Boris Yeltsin, newly re-elected president of Russia, said he would reappoint <b>Viktor Chernomyrdin</b> as prime minister and appeared to rule out a coalition with the defeated Communist Party. Mr Yeltsin gave Alexander Lebed broad powers to fight crime in Moscow. Shortly afterwards, a bomb exploded in the city's centre, injuring at least five people.</p>
<p>Despite Boris Yeltsin's campaign pledge to end it, Russia stepped up the <b>war in Chechnya</b> by attacking two villages with artillery and air-force strikes. A news agency said at least 20 civilians had been killed in an attack on a village thought to be the headquarters of the Chechen leader, Zelimkhan Yandarbiev. A Russian general was killed by a land mine.</p>
<p>The "Serb Republic", nominally part of Bosnia &amp; Herzcegovina, has named Radovan Karadzic leader of its new senate in defiance of the Dayton peace accord, which bars those indicted for war crimes from holding public office. <font size=-1>UN</font> investigators found the remains of more than 40 people, believed to be Bosnian Muslims executed by Serb soldiers, in a <b>mass grave</b> near Srebrenica.</p>
<p>Germany's government approved a 1997 <b>budget</b> that cuts spending by 2.5% to <font size=-1>DM</font>440.2 billion ($288.4 billion). It claims that will be enough to bring public-sector deficits to below the 3% ceiling for countries joining the single European currency. The labour, transport, economics and defence ministries took the biggest cuts.</p>
<p>France is having a summer of <b>scandal</b>. Investigators detained Loik Le Floch-Prigent, chief of the state-owned railways, in connection with investments made by Elf Aquitaine, a big oil company he once headed. The defence ministry admitted tapping the telephones of two aides to a former minister, Fran&ccedil;ois L&eacute;otard.</p>
<p>A French court has sentenced <b>Claude Gubler</b>, the doctor of the late President Fran&ccedil;ois Mitterrand, to a four-month suspended prison term for breaking professional secrecy. In a book now banned, Dr Gubler wrote that Mitterrand was ill with cancer during much of his presidency.</p>
<h2>Soft on peace</h2>
<p>On a visit to Washington, <b>Binyamin Netanyahu</b>, Israel's new prime minister, told President Bill Clinton that he was committed to negotiation with Arab neighbours but would not talk to Syria unless it renounced support for terrorism. Mr Netanyahu invited the hardline Ariel Sharon to join his cabinet as minister of infrastructure.</p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>At the annual summit of the Organisation of African Unity, African leaders backed a plan to send regional <b>peacekeepers to Burundi</b>.</p>
<p>Unofficial results showed that President Idriss Deby of <b>Chad</b>, who seized power in 1990, won the country's first multi-party presidential election. In neighbouring <b>Niger</b>, General Ibrahim Bare Mainassara, who also grabbed power in a coup, was declared winner of the presidential election. Opposition groups claimed that the vote was rigged and took to the streets.</p>
<h2>Common ground</h2>
<p>Anthony Lake, America's national security adviser, held out the prospect of <b>friendlier relations </b>between the United States and China after a period of tension over trade and human rights. On a trip to Beijing, he suggested that the American and Chinese presidents should eventually visit each other's countries.</p>

<h2>All change</h2>

<p>A week after Switzerland's Credit Suisse reorganised itself, another big European bank, <b>Deutsche Bank</b>, announced that it was restructuring. Board members will each be responsible for a single business within four global operating divisions, and a new team will oversee strategy. Deutsche has also taken a 5% stake in a Bavarian rival, Bayerische Vereinsbank, for DM500m ($329m), a move that could foreshadow consolidation of Germany's crowded banking industry.</p>
<p>Another of Deutsche's new ideas meanwhile took a knock. <b>Ekkehard Wenger</b>, Germany's leading shareholder activist, filed a legal challenge to a share-options scheme for the bank's top managers, calling it excessively generous.</p>
<p>Officials said that <b>Russia</b> intended to make a $300m-500m Eurobond issue before the end of the year. The government also announced plans to privatise 200 hotels in Moscow.</p>
<p>Austria's plans to privatise its <b>Creditanstalt</b> bank through a tie-up with First Austrian was said to be in trouble. But First Austrian said no final decision had been taken.</p>
<p>Germany's Securities Trading Supervisory Office began investigating possible insider trading in the shares of <b>Escom</b>, Europe's second-largest computer retailer. The firm, which filed for protection from its creditors last week, has said it will sack 40% of its workers.</p>
<h2>Courting</h2>

<p><font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font>, a satellite-television company part-owned by Rupert Murdoch, unveiled a joint venture with Kirch, a German media group, to offer up to <b>200 digital pay-television channels </b>in Germany within the next few years. <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font> recently pulled out of a similar deal with Bertelsmann.</p>
<p>Prosecutors in Naples said that <b>Philip Morris</b>, the American tobacco-to-food giant, may have to pay $417m in back taxes. The Italians say the company's Italian subsidiary should pay tax as a local company; Philip Morris disagrees. Italian law prohibits the company from manufacturing cigarettes locally.</p>
<p>America's Justice Department launched an investigation into whether the proposed alliance between <b>British Airways</b> and <b>American Airlines </b>is anti-competitive. Combined, the carriers would operate 60% of flights between America and Britain.</p>
<p>Carlsberg, a Danish brewer, and Heineken, a Dutch rival, pulled out of projects to make beer in <b>Myanmar</b> (Burma), and halted exports to the country, in protest against human-rights abuses there. A consumer boycott aimed at Myanmar's military regime is gathering strength in America.</p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p><b>Glaxo Wellcome</b>, the world's largest drug company, said it would appeal against the decision of a North Carolina court to allow competitors to copy its top-selling anti-ulcer drug, Zantac, when the patent expires next year. Novopharm, a Canadian company planning a cheap copy of the drug in America in 1997, threatened a countersuit.</p>
<p><b>Nike</b>, which makes sports shoes, put a spring in the step of analysts by announcing post-tax earnings of $156m in the quarter to May 31st, 38% up on last year.</p>
<p>Europe's <b>Airbus</b> <b>Industrie</b> consortium is being reorganised as an ordinary company to compete better with Boeing, its American rival, in next-generation airliners. The consortium plans to integrate its four partner companies, from Germany, France, Britain and Spain, into a single entity. China meanwhile confirmed that it had chosen Airbus rather than Boeing as a partner to build a 100-seat airliner for its potentially vast market.</p>
<h2>Topsy-turvy</h2>

<p>(See <a href="wtw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>Strong growth in American jobs caused a 2% fall in the <b>Dow Jones</b> index on July 5th, as investors worried about a resurgence of inflation.</p>
<p>(See <a href="wtw2.gif">chart</a>)<br>South Korea's <b>LG Group</b> said it would invest &#163;1.7 billion ($2.6 billion) in two new factories to make chips and <font size=-1>TV</font> monitors in Britain, long one of the world's strongest magnets for foreign direct investment. In the year to April, 477 new projects were announced--a 50% rise on three years earlier. Britain's stock of inward investment stands at &#163;150 billion ($225 billion), up from &#163;44 billion in 1985.</p>
<p>America's <b>Motorola</b> was the latest victim of weak demand and falling prices for computer chips. Its share price fell after it announced a one-third drop in second-quarter earnings. The company has also been damaged by the fading fortunes of Apple, a major customer.</p>
<p>American regulators want <b>Prudential</b>, the country's biggest life-insurance company, to pay $35m in penalties for allowing widespread sales abuses by their agents to persist for more than a decade. It is not the first blow to the firm. Two years ago its securities arm paid up to $1.5 billion to compensate customers for understating the risk in various energy and property investments.</p>
<p><p><b>Hong Kong</b> needs an image makeover before China takes over in 1997, according to a Harvard Business School study. Though one of Asia's most popular business centres, it is threatened by high costs in service industries.</p>

<h1>Le D&eacute;fi Am&eacute;ricain, again</h1>

<p><b>The American way of business is winning converts in continental Europe</b></p>

<p>IN THE past three years Daimler-Benz has listed its shares in New York, adopted American accounting standards, sold loss-making subsidiaries and offered its executives bonuses linked to the share-price. Managerial performance used to be measured by a complicated formula unknown outside the company. The firm has now replaced that with the shareholder-friendly aim of increasing return on equity.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is a well-known story but one that bears further scrutiny. Daimler is not only Germany's largest conglomerate. It has also been, for many years, an exemplar of a specifically European way of conducting business. Daimler is connected to Germany's biggest bank (Deutsche Bank owns 24% of Daimler) and to large firms (Daimler owns 7% of Metallgesellschaft, a troubled commodity-trader). The European system tends to blur distinctions of ownership through a complex system of cross-holdings and encourages long-term relations between the suppliers and managers of capital. It also gives more power to "stakeholders", especially workers, than in America: Daimler's workers--as in all large German firms--have half the seats on the supervisory board (which hires and fires the managers) and run a works council which takes some day-to-day decisions.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But what is Daimler now? With its New York listing, restructuring plans and managerial incentive scheme, it clearly has some of the features of an American firm. Is that because it is a special case, forced to change by the scale of its losses--DM5.7 billion ($3.98 billion) in 1995? Or is Daimler still a symbol of European business--but this time as an early adopter of new management techniques, closer to the American model, with its shareholder values, opportunistic ways of raising capital and hostile takeovers?
</p><p><b>Busted trust</b></b>
<br>To work out the answer, begin by considering exactly what distinguishes European business practices from American ones. Differences exist at many levels, of course, from the treatment of stakeholders to tax rates, state ownership, the strength of unions, and the tendency of European countries to draw top managers from groups of people who all know one other. But at the heart of the difference is the issue of trust--the trust between those who supply capital and those who manage it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In European capitalism, trust is a personal matter, built up over many years. In Germany and Italy, there are especially close ties between companies and banks. Banks, like workers, often have seats on the supervisory board; bank managers have the friendship of a firm's bosses or founding family. The result has been "relationship" banking, with banks in it for the long haul and with a strong influence over corporate strategy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The bonds between the largest French firms are different, but no less personal. The relations have been built around a framework of cross-shareholdings between banks, insurers and industrial companies--what J&eacute;r&ocirc;me Monod, head of Lyonnaise des Eaux, a conglomerate, recently disparaged as "statist meccano". The system depends upon an elite group of like-minded managers. Most were educated at the same schools and universities--notably the Ecole Nationale d'Administration (<font size=-1>ENA</font>); many polished up their political ties by spending a year or two in some ministry. Italy has a somewhat similar business elite called the <i>salotto buono</i>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This system is quite different from that which operates in more liberal market economies, such as America. Markets have different ways of establishing who deserves trust. Anonymous lenders and shareholders cannot have seats on the board. They did not go to school with the chairman. Instead, they look for public guarantees of good behaviour, expressed in published accounts and stockmarket performance.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To many Europeans, the American system is not a different way of establishing trust; to them, it discourages trust altogether. Arms-length banking, shareholders' rights, hostile takeovers, opportunistic behaviour of all kinds--these go hand in hand, say critics, with the devil-take-the-hindmost attitude to stakeholders and workers that Europeans find callous and socially irresponsible. This attitude may be tolerable in the freewheeling United States, they argue, but it is fundamentally at odds with Europe's norms of social cohesion.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Books such as "<i>Le D&eacute;fi Am&eacute;ricain</i>" ("The American Challenge") by Jean-Jacques Servan-Schreiber, a politician and journalist, and "<i>Capitalisme contre </i>Capitalism" (ie, the French variety against the American) by Michel Albert, now on the board of the Bank of France, have engraven on European minds the sense that American capitalism is a threat. Despite recession and unemployment, many Europeans remain proud of a brand of capitalism that for decades seemed to offer both prosperity and social justice.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But whatever the social merits of the two systems, in an open trading environment both have to be judged by their long-run ability to produce decent returns on investment. Europe is failing this test  (see <a href="sf1.gif">chart</a>).
</p><p><b>The cost of failure</b>
<br>Research by Fran&ccedil;ois Langlade-Demoyen and David Asserkoff, of Credit Suisse First Boston, a Swiss-owned investment bank, shows that profit margins before tax and provisions, and net profits measured against shareholders' funds (the return on equity), have both been consistently lower among European firms than among American ones. The return on equity in German companies in 1994 was only 7.4%, half that in American firms. The two researchers believe that on average European firms' profits do not even pay for the capital invested in the business.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Part of the explanation for this low profitability is that European firms do not make good use of their capital. A recent study by the McKinsey Global Institute, a management consultancy's think-tank, found that between 1990 and 1993 German business generated a third less output from each unit of capital than American firms did. The return on capital between 1974 and 1993 was only just over 7% in Germany, compared with 9% in America.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps, you might think, this mediocre performance does not matter. Labour productivity, after all, has risen by an average of 1.8% a year since 1979, twice the American rate. And many European managers have not been trying to succeed in "American terms"--ie, measuring their performance by returns to shareholders. Instead, they seek to pursue a long-term industrial strategy, or aim to keep operating profits high. So long as the providers of finance are willing to be patient, then this can continue. But not if many European firms are failing in their own terms.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For years, German firms proved adept at making the continuous incremental improvements needed to succeed in high-value, high price metal-bashing. But Germany's engineering perfectionism is coming under threat. According to research by <font size=-1>JP</font> Morgan, an American investment bank, output by all European machine-tool makers shrank by almost 3% a year between 1987 and 1994. The older skills of step-by-step improvement have been rendered obsolete in some businesses, such as <font size=-1>X</font>-ray equipment, where electronic-imaging, based on Japanese chip technology, is increasing its share of the market.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Worse, European firms have been bad at getting into new high-tech industries. Europe's high-tech firms are feeble in comparison with American ones. Only two of the top 20 software firms are European. Staid bankers are suspicious of revolutionary ideas. Venture capitalists have no one to sell their investments to. In a world where small, even symbolic stakes give bankers or founding families a great deal of say in the management of firms, it often impossible to get outsiders in to invest.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Worst of all, poor financial discipline has sometimes undermined European firms' supposed strength in long-term planning. A drift into property just before the booming market collapsed in 1990 cost French banks and insurers up to $100 billion. The dream of becoming "an integrated technology business" led Daimler into ill-advised expansion, absorbing Dornier and Fokker, two aerospace firms. It has recently sold both.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sometimes failures reveal deep flaws in the way European firms work. Every sort of capitalism suffers from corruption, day-to-day mismanagement and strategic errors. But Europe seems to have had more than its share. Hundreds of Italian firms have been found guilty of bribery and corruption. In France in the past two years, around 30 chairmen of large companies have been placed under judicial examination (a step before a trial); a handful have been found guilty; in a poll of businessmen last year, 60% of respondents said they thought corruption was rife in France.
</p><p><b>The cost of capital</b>
<br>It is bad enough for the European system that it is no longer producing the goods. That alone would force it to change. What is worse is that the traditional system based on close ties between borrowers and lenders is up against a market system that has one crucial advantage: it is cheaper. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lehman Brothers, an American investment bank, says that Daimler and <font size=-1>BMW</font> recently borrowed at rates well below <font size=-1>LIBOR</font>, the interest rate banks pay each other for eurodollars--and far cheaper than ordinary bank loans. This is undermining the traditionally stable ties of lenders and borrowers. As Jean-Ren&eacute; Fourtou, the boss of Rh&ocirc;ne-Poulenc, a French chemicals and drugs firm, admitted to his board in April, his group of shareholders looked as if it might break up: many no longer wanted to see their capital tied up in what was for them a peripheral business. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With a big price advantage, capital markets have grown fast. Partly because of privatisations, more money is tied up in most European stockmarkets as a share of <font size=-1>GDP</font> than a decade ago--though in most countries the proportion is still small compared with America and Britain (see <a href="sf2.gif">chart</a>). In France, for example, 30 new companies were floated on the Bourse during the first six months of this year, compared with 22 in the whole of 1994.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Foreign ownership of shares has increased throughout Europe. Between 1990 and 1994, it more than doubled to 22% in Sweden, rose from 15% to 25% in France and reached almost 20% from nothing in Germany. Foreigners--including, say, Germans in France--are especially keen on American values: they are less likely to buy on the strength of a local reputation, feel at risk in places where a nod and a wink are the principles of investment, and have less to lose by kicking up a fuss.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No less important--and often forgotten--is the market for debt. A little over a decade ago, the European arm of Standard &amp; Poor's (<font size=-1>S&P</font>), an American agency that specialises in assessing bond risks, had two people in London assessing the bonds of some 30 issuers, mostly connected with governments. Now <font size=-1>S&P </font>has 200 staff following bonds from 500 issuers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And as with market instruments, so with people. Consultancies and investment banks are either opening branches in continental Europe or sending teams out from New York or London. Take Mercer Management Consulting, an American firm. It opened its first office in London in 1984; now it has 250 consultants in Paris, Munich and Madrid. According to Jean Estin, Mercer's European head, all the international management consultants are associated with American business culture. But American capitalism is not being spread by word of mouth. It is being sold.
</p><p><b>The first signs</b>
<br>The combination of falling profitability and the big growth in capital-market instruments has been deadly for the traditional way of doing business in Europe. Managers realise they need to change and have the opportunity to do it. Hence:
<font size=-1><li></font><b>Listing in New York.</b> This is the clearest sign of a firm's conversion to American ways. Daimler was one of the most spectacular, but other European firms, such as Astra, a Swedish drugs company, and Nokia, a Finnish telecoms group, have followed. Deutsche Telekom plans to make a listing after it is privatised in November (see <a href="sf3.gif">table</a>).
<font size=-1><li></font>Companies set themselves explicit <b>profit targets.</b> Typical is Commerzbank, Germany's third largest, or Lyonnaise des Eaux. Both have pledged to earn a return on equity equal to 15%, and 10-15% respectively. And once a firm has made such a commitment to shareholder value, a cascade of changes follows: taking on part of the creed usually means taking on the lot.
<font size=-1><li></font><b>Financial manoeuvres </b>sometimes dismissed as gimmicks by continental capitalists start to make good sense. One way to meet the target is for a firm to buy its own shares, something that promises to become more common as laws change in Europe. In November the Swedish government will publish a white paper likely to suggest that the law allow firms to buy back their shares.
<font size=-1><li></font><b>Restructuring.</b> On June 24th Chargeurs, a French conglomerate, split Path&eacute;, its media arm, from the rest of its business in textiles. This is characteristic of a fad for breaking up conglomerates to please shareholders. Portugal's Sonae will next year separate its wood-products business from retailing. Paribas, a French investment bank, has begun to sell off some of its holdings, including a controlling share in Poliet, a building-materials group. Sweden's Volvo, which had a sprawling empire including firms making drugs and matches, has dedicated itself to vehicles and construction equipment. All in all, according to <font size=-1>JP </font>Morgan, large companies worth over $89 billion were involved in mergers or acquisitions in Europe in the first three months of 1996--a quarterly record.
<font size=-1><li></font><b>Share options.</b> Managers are more likely to renounce empire-building and concentrate on profits if their interests are aligned with those of shareholders: share options are a way of ensuring they are. Share-option schemes are well established in some countries, including France, where they are often exploited to avoid high rates of income tax. In Germany, which has been slow to adopt the idea (partly because high capital-gains tax discourages them), Deutsche Bank and Daimler-Benz recently received shareholder approval for share-option schemes which will be introduced later this year. Siemens and Veba are considering similar plans; so is Deutsche Telekom, once it is privatised. Such schemes, however, are sometimes introduced in the teeth of opposition. Some existing shareholders suspect that the terms of the deals will be too generous to managers: they have pointed out that the options planned for Deutsche Bank's managers will bear fruit if the bank's share price beats its current level by 10% at any point over the next ten years--a 1% annual return is hardly a daunting challenge. Unions object, too: <font size=-1>IG</font> Metall, Germany's largest union, thinks that, by widening the gap between bosses' and workers' income, share options undermine their country's egalitarian pay regime and hurt employees' and companies' long-term interests.
<font size=-1><li></font><b>Corporate governance.</b> This has become a buzz-word in Europe to rein in excessively powerful bosses. A committee set up by the Amsterdam stock exchange will soon report on how better to enforce corporate governance in the Netherlands. In France, the Vi&eacute;not report, named after Marc Vi&eacute;not, the head of Soci&eacute;t&eacute; G&eacute;n&eacute;rale, recommends that executives be more closely monitored by limiting the number of boards that non-executive directors may sit on (the hope is that this will increase non-executive vigilance).
<font size=-1><li></font><b>Shareholder activism.</b> Of course managers might still abuse their powers. But at least they will have more militant shareholders to deal with--often with official encouragement (in France, the financial-markets regulator is encouraging fund managers to use their votes). In one recent case, Banque Nationale de Paris (<font size=-1>BNP</font>) agreed to buy out minority shareholders in a listed subsidiary, called Compagnie d'Investissements de Paris, which had been trading at a large discount to the value of its assets. <font size=-1>BNP</font> was responding to pressure from <font size=-1>SBC</font> Warburg, an investment bank, and Franklin Global Investor Services, a French firm that advises shareholders how to take on managers. Once Warburg had taken the first step, French fund managers followed. Astonishingly, even <font size=-1>BNP</font>'s own investment funds were ready to vote against their parent bank.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Shareholders are restive even in Germany, where there is a long tradition of obedience. This is thanks partly to the tireless efforts of Ekkehard Wenger, a professor of economics at the University of W&uuml;rzburg who has been badgering executives at annual general meetings since 1987. The country now has an organisation called the Association of Critical Shareholders, which led the attack on Deutsche Bank's share-options scheme. Such groups may alarm managers but they are really a sign of progress.
</p><p><b>The revolution to come</b>
<br>To listen to the cries of anguish in Europe, American capitalism is about to bring about the collapse of civilised business as we know it. Certainly, it could impose painful restructuring on companies, which would be no bad thing. The virtual bankruptcies of Air France and <font size=-1>SNCF</font>, the French national railway, show that to delay restructuring often merely makes a bad company worse.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But fears about rampaging Americans are somewhat exaggerated. The greatest spur to shareholder values in Europe will be the creation of millions of individual European shareholders, and that will occur over the next decade or so with the growth of funded pensions. Meanwhile, French firms, for example, do not even have to say whether they are complying with Mr Vi&eacute;not's suggestions. Rules may not be what they seem. French remuneration committees are sometimes there simply to keep the chief executive's salary secret from the unions' representative on the board.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Measured against American standards, European firms have a long way to go. That is the best reason to think that the changes will continue.

<p><b>Students in debt</b></p>
<h1>Hard to be young</h1>

<font size=1>WASHINGTON, DC</font>
<p>AMERICA's newest game-show does not have the usual sports cars, pinball machines and fabulous vacations to Hawaii. On the show called "Debt", whoever best answers a series of insipid questions on pop culture is unburdened of many thousands of dollars-worth of credit card bills or home loans. It is instructive that the show, presided over by an unctuous 60-something, Wink Martindale, was conceived by a 29-year-old producer. Increasingly, debt haunts America's young.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unemployed or still at school, often unaccustomed to budget discipline, young people now have unprecedented opportunities to outspend their means. Many bite at the credit-card offers that flood campus mailboxes--and get stuck with fat interest rates. One study, by Claritas, a market-research firm, found a 20% jump in the average credit-card balance in southern California from 1993 to 1995. For those in their 20s, the jump was a startling 70%.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These figures, however formidable, are dwarfed by the sums on student loans. Those who borrow to pay for college (and most do) end up owing an average of more than $7,500 for a public education; for private colleges, the figure is nearly $11,000. Graduate degrees bring additional debt. In 1985, only 3% of medical students graduated owing more than $75,000. In 1995, a third had debt in that range.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tuition fees are one large cause. The $100,000-plus cost of a Harvard or Yale undergraduate degree affects only a tiny minority. More telling are the precipitous cost increases at state universities, which account for four out of every five college diplomas. Governors have taken to raiding education budgets in order to finance the ballooning costs of Medicaid and prisons. So the students pay more: from 1981 to 1994, the cost of going to public universities rose by 55% in real terms (see <a href="am1.gif">chart</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At federal level, Pell grants (the chief need-based aid programme for higher education) have gone down in real terms since 1979. Last year the federal government paid out only $1.4 billion--an inflation-adjusted eighth of the 1975 figure--in <font size=-1>GI</font>-Bill money, which has provided college funds for ex-servicemen since the end of the second world war. In 1992, Congress expanded federally guaranteed loans, allowing more people to borrow larger amounts--which got more poor youngsters into college, but also into debt. The pinch is tightest on the poorest, for whom a debt of several thousand dollars can be frightening. Even students who can handle their debt are discouraged from taking useful low-paying work, such as jobs in health clinics, because their fixed-loan payments are too high.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Republicans' budget proposal for 1995 would have eliminated the subsidy students can get while in college. President Bill Clinton vetoed that, and proposed instead some small tax credits and tax deductions for higher education. He has also defended an idea started by the Bush administration, to disburse federally guaranteed loans direct from the Treasury rather than through banks. This has the advantage of saving money--banks are notoriously lax about collecting loans when they are reimbursed by the feds anyway--and also allowing the government, rather than for-profit institutions, to set the terms of the loan. The government also allows more flexible repayment options. For example, graduates can pay a percentage of their income, rather than a fixed amount, allowing them to take low-paying jobs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Every American agrees that more education leads to higher productivity and a richer country; yet the country stays stingy about paying for it. Health care for the elderly, on the other hand, though it does little to benefit society as a whole, plucks at the heart: so it now eats up an increasing percentage of the federal budget. The politician will explain this easily enough. The elderly constitute a powerful voting block. The young, less likely to vote, get stuck with the bill.

<h1>Bob Dole, neighbour and statesman</h1>

<p>BOB DOLE's advisers are missing something. To rescue their candidate from gaffes about tobacco and fights over abortion, they need a suitable distraction. Should Mr Dole attack his opponent's economic record? The latest employment figures, showing that Mr Clinton has presided over the creation of 10m new jobs, make this course seem unattractive. Should Mr Dole give another foreign-policy speech? The previous two, though worthy, failed to dent Mr Clinton's lead in the opinion polls. What does this leave? Actually, it leaves the most obvious theme of all. Mr Dole should talk about his own rich life. This will lead him to take back some of the campaign themes that Mr Clinton has stolen from him.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Dolesters have thought of playing up their man's life before; they gave up the idea for an entirely mistaken reason. The trouble with Mr Dole's life story, they thought, is that it is split. Mr Dole is the farm-town boy from Russell, Kansas; but he is also the politician who spent 35 years in Congress. Mr Dole may invoke the neighbourly virtues of Russell on the stump; but his audiences know that he has spent his own career miles from his Kansas home, trading power in the capital. It seemed impossible to reconcile these two sides.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But that was precisely the mistake. Mr Dole's split identity is actually America's as well; and his success in being two seemingly different things could teach his countrymen a useful lesson.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For America is moved by two ideals, and the conflict between them explains much contemporary confusion. Americans feel nostalgia for the fading values of small towns, which is why politicians on all sides have embraced the language of "responsibility" and "community". At the same time, Americans enjoy the grandeur of federal power, the knowledge that Washington is the world's capital. Again, Americans like to recall stable communities, the fellowship of boy-scout troops and village clubs, the civic virtues of the Founders. And yet they are also infatuated with a different myth: of the ambitious youth who leaves his community behind, and makes for the big city. America shares Bob Dole's small-town side, and it shares his big ambition.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All this suggests that Mr Dole could speak out about his divided past, and gain a sympathetic hearing. Moreover, speaking out might also heal a division within his party. Until recently, Republicans were usually clear on which national ideal was theirs. They supported freedom, ambition, dynamism. They stood for Americans who wanted to move up and on, who had no use for the old habits. To this sort of Republican, freedom was both an economic and a moral good. Ronald Reagan promised to cut government in order to promote growth, but also because untrammelled competition would foster an independence of the spirit. Nobody much cared about Ronald Reagan's home town. He was a hero without a village.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This has changed. A new kind of Republican hero has arisen to challenge the community-busting, village-deserting archetypes of the Reagan years. The new sort are solid citizens, faithful fathers, religious leaders who shelter orphans from mean streets. They do battle against dead-beat dads, permissive liberals, and other agents of social decay. To Republicans who prefer this kind of hero, freedom has its darker side: it causes self-expression to displace self-restraint, individualism to degenerate into egotism. When this happens, America is lost. A tolerant society cannot thrive unless its members themselves are tolerant; a free society cannot thrive unless citizens exercise freedom responsibly.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These two Republicanisms now coexist. Many members of the party still invoke Mr Reagan's commitment to a limited state. Others want a government that does more to foster virtue. This has given the Democrats a chance to steal new Republicanism's themes. The Clinton administration has battled the unvirtuous influence of television: it has cajoled networks into rating their programmes for sex and violence, and has ensured that <font size=-1>TV</font> sets will soon be fitted with a chip that enables parents to censor children's viewing. The president now leads a crusade to have television networks air three hours of educational programmes each week. "It Takes a Village", the title of Hillary Clinton's book, invokes the same community virtues that new Republicans are fond of.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Dole cannot match this. He attacked Hollywood for turning out "nightmares of depravity" early on in the campaign; and he has proposed a new tax break for charities, in the hope of promoting local groups that nurture civic virtue. But he opposed the smut-censoring television chip, and he has been mum on educational programming. Both ideas offended the old Reaganite belief in limited government.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the time being, therefore, the Republicans look weak. Yet their divided instincts need not put them permanently on the retreat. America's longing for community, remember, is balanced by its freedom-loving ambitious side. The Republicans could take the Clintons on, stressing the need to foster virtue, but insisting that this should not involve surrender to big government. They could strike a balance that appeals to both the ideals that animate America.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is a subtle message, difficult to get across. But the Republicans have an extraordinary weapon in their candidate. Mr Dole can tell America how, when he came home from the second world war, paralysed, the neighbours in Russell clubbed together to pay his medical expenses. But the community ties that saved him, he can also point out, were not so tight as to restrain his rise to national prominence later on. Both stories illustrate America's complementary strengths. Together, they might help the country to feel better about its split self. And that would be a good thing, whatever happens to Mr Dole's poll ratings.

<h1>Netanyahu brings the politics of low expectations</h1>

WASHINGTON, DC
<p>ISRAEL'S new prime minister returned this week to the town where, as a young diplomat appointed by the Likud party he has since come to lead, he had achieved his first public triumphs. Back in the 1980s, Binyamin Netanyahu--articulate, American-educated and good-looking--went on American talk-shows to project a hopeful side to rightist Israeli policymaking. This week, confronting a Washington desperate not to see the peace process die, Mr Netanyahu's rhetorical skills seemed to desert him. At a press conference on July 10th, he fumbled for phrases to reassure his hosts. Still, he may not have minded. He was evidently not in the mood to tell Americans that the peace process was, after all, humming along nicely under his control.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bill Clinton was less than ecstatic. He listened coldly to Mr Netanyahu's thoughts on Jewish settlements in the West Bank and remarked: "The tide of history cannot be turned back." Mr Clinton has given enthusiastic support to the Oslo accords reached in 1993 and doggedly implemented by the Labour government that Mr Netanyahu defeated in May.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But these are early days, as Mr Clinton implied when he spoke of Israel's "period of adjustment". Certainly, no serious erosion in America's relations with Israel is likely before the presidential election in November. On the contrary, both men pronounced them "rock solid". Mr Netanyahu may be resentful of Mr Clinton's open support for Mr Peres in the Israeli election, and he might prefer to see Mr Dole in the White House. But he will not be saying so.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Netanyahu came to Washington resolved to attack. He did not want to have to defend his grudging recognition of the Oslo agreements as ill-conceived and dangerous but nevertheless binding on his government. Instead, he argued in the Oval Office and on Capitol Hill that honouring commitments was a matter for both sides, and the Palestinians had not been honouring theirs. The Palestinian Authority had set up branch offices in Jerusalem in explicit contravention of the accords. The Palestinian security police had even been patrolling Jerusalem and arresting people there--another violation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Netanyahu attacked Syria too. No longer would Israel "turn the other cheek" in the face of Hizbullah's attacks on its troops in south Lebanon, attacks condoned if not instigated by Syria. Damascus itself, he said, was home to several Palestinian terrorist groups. He wanted the peace talks between Israel and Syria to resume--but if they did, terrorism would be top of the agenda. Even Egypt was not spared. Mr Netanyahu told the president that the Egyptians were launching hostile initiatives against Israel.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The message was: peace yes, but on Israel's terms. Israel would, Mr Netanyahu explained, continue the peace process "in our own way", with "our own interpretation" of the principle of land for peace, as well as of <font size=-1>UN</font> Security Council Resolution 242, the basis of all Middle East peace diplomacy. He was not setting preconditions, he insisted, any more than he would accept them: the Arabs needed to be educated as to Israel's legitimacy in the region.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The tone of such statements harks back to the doldrum years of the 1980s and even earlier to the era before the first Likud prime minister, Menachem Begin, surprised the world and struck a land-for-peace deal with Egypt. The doughty Golda Meir always demanded "direct negotiations without preconditions" and went on to issue a slew of terms whose effect was to prevent talks from ever starting.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Peace could be achieved the Likud's way, argued Mr Netanyahu. At the Madrid peace conference in 1991, Israel (under the Likud) and Syria had come with diametrically opposed positions, but this had not prevented the talks from starting. If Mr Clinton was convinced, he did not say so. He pointedly made no reference to Madrid, extolling instead the changes wrought in the region over the past four years. He repeatedly praised Yasser Arafat's efforts to curb terrorism in the Palestinians' self-ruled areas. Ignoring Mr Netanyahu's strictures, the president said he was "impressed" by the Palestinian Authority's growing ability to run its own affairs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The main conclusion to be drawn from the Israeli prime minister's performance in America is that peace will be pursued with considerably less urgency. The next item on the Oslo agenda is Israel's redeployment from the West Bank town of Hebron (which Mr Netanyahu said was to be "redeployment in Hebron, not out of Hebron"). The issue was immensely complicated. He was studying all the aspects. Similarly, on the fraught question of meeting Mr Arafat, he merely repeated that he did not preclude it--"if I deem it in the interests of peace."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some Netanyahu-watchers, believing him to be more of a pragmatist than a dogmatist, had expected him to be less strident in America. Instead, he seemed at times to be almost spoiling for a fight. On the settlements issue, for instance, which poisoned relations between the previous Likud-led government and the Bush administration, Mr Netanyahu presented figures showing that the number of settlers had risen by half (from 96,000 to 145,000) over the four years of Labour rule. "I assume", he said, "that no one here is expecting us to do less."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Americans, say Mr Netanyahu's aides, understand that things have changed in Israel. "There's a new game in town, and we're not going back to the old one. They accept that." Clearly they do. But, just as clearly, they do not like it. Nor do the Palestinians. The reaction from Mr Arafat's men back home has been ominously sharp.

<p><b>Poland</b></p>
<h1>Grab that chance</h1>

WARSAW
<p>ON THE face of things, Poland is sitting pretty. Its economy, easily the biggest in ex-communist Europe except for Russia's, grew by a stirring 7% last year. At 39m, it has the biggest population in the region after Russia's and Ukraine's, but none of the ethnic or cross-border tensions that trouble most of the other countries. Its president, Alexander Kwasniewski, a smooth ex-communist, has kept Poland looking westwards without enraging its lumbering Russian neighbour to the east. On July 11th Poland agreed to join the <font size=-1>OECD</font>, the mainly western rich countries' club. It is at the top of the queue to join the European Union and <font size=-1>NATO</font>, as President Bill Clinton no doubt assured Mr Kwasniewski on his visit to Washington this week.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Kwasniewski's term started inauspiciously in January when his prime minister, a member of his party, quit amid (unproven) accusations that he had been a <font size=-1>KGB</font> agent. But a new prime minister, Wlodzimierz Cimoszewicz, a technocrat with no formal party membership, calmed the waters--and Mr Kwasniewski has now settled with an uncanny serenity into his new job.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet progress in Poland is rarely straightforward. The "shock therapy" that laid the foundation for Poland's swift growth six years ago also spelled insecurity for millions of farmers, pensioners, bureaucrats and other state employees. That was why, in 1993, Poles voted to retreat into a seemingly safer past. The resultant government coalition brought together Mr Kwasniewski's Alliance of the Democratic Left, whose main component is a reformed version of the old communist party, with the smaller Peasant Party, successor to an obedient sister of that communist party.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So far, so good. The Alliance has managed to reconcile voters' expectations with the demands of free-market reform, above all the tight budget needed to keep the currency sound and the free markets needed to keep the economy competitive. It has cut inflation and kept the bosses of Poland's 2m small businesses happy. Indeed, many of them proved ready to risk Mr Kwasniewski as president instead of Lech Walesa, his heroically anti-communist but increasingly erratic predecessor.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All the same, the Alliance is on a tightrope. The government faces an agenda of painful reform and a parliamentary election next year. A slip could revive right-wing parties, which are showing signs of life after all but one tumbled out of parliament in the 1993 election. Their man of the moment is Jan Olszewski, a former prime minister who came fourth in the first round of last year's presidential contest, with 7% of the vote. One recent poll sees his Movement for the Reconstruction of Poland, known as <font size=-1>ROP</font>, nudging into second spot, with 16%, behind the ex-communists, with 18%. The government cannot be certain of winning next year's election.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Like the ex-communists a few years ago, Mr Olszewski and his group appeal to the disaffected. Their main weapon is a nationalist populism that blames Poland's current ills on the continuing influence of the corrupt communist nomenklatura (under whatever new guise) over business and politics. Mr Olszewski's critics call him "Poland's Le Pen". He denies that he shares the French nationalist's chauvinism but concedes that "the crazy fringe" may be "more visible" in <font size=-1>ROP</font> because its platform is "more revolutionary" than its rivals'.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He is vague about what sort of revolution he has in mind. On some things he sounds like a western liberal. It is "crucial" for Poland to join <font size=-1>NATO</font>, he says. He thinks that Polish membership of the European Union is bound to happen and claims to want more privatisation and foreign investment. Yet Mr Olszewski's party also says it would impose tariffs on some imports and would force down interest rates.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If he is to have a chance of winning power, he must find allies. They could include the Solidarity trade-union movement, whose supporters share his hatred of former communists, his suspicion of foreign influence and his friendliness to the Catholic Church. Anti-communism aside, so do many in the Peasant Party.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But even if he united such disparate malcontents, Mr Olszewski would still be a long way from the winning-post. Poland's right-wingers are a cantankerous lot. Prickly men such as Mr Olszewski and Mr Walesa despise each other. Solidarity and Mr Olszewski's movement have yet to come to terms. The reformed communists are relatively a model of discipline.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The remoulded left is not all harmony, however. Scratchiness between the Alliance's ex-communists and their Peasant partners slows further reform. The Peasant Party, for instance, inveighed against a new law that lets foreigners buy land, though that is not only a condition for Polish membership of the <font size=-1>OECD</font> but also the best way to draw job-creating investment into the countryside. Even so, foreigners wanting to buy land still face obstacles.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ambivalence within the Alliance could undermine reform of social security, which runs an annual deficit of 5% of Poland's <font size=-1>GDP</font>. Without reform, the gap could widen by 1% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> every year, driving up inflation and interest rates and stunting the growth that gives Poland its only chance of controlling its budget deficit (see <a href="eu1.gif">chart</a>). The government must raise retirement ages and slow the growth of benefits but is afraid of enraging Poland's 9m pensioners--nearly a quarter of the population. With the labour ministry suggesting feeble reforms and the finance ministry more robust ones, the government so far has wobbled.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The temptation will be to delay further change, trusting that Poland's buoyant growth will sweep the government back into power next year. But the boom will not last for ever. If Mr Kwasniewski's government dithers now, while the going is good, it could open the door to a populist like Mr Olszewski when things turn rough.

<p><b>Prostitution</b></p>
<h1>Rules of the game</h1>

<p>THE laws on prostitution do not work. That is what police, prostitutes, health workers and people who live in areas rife with prostitution told a parliamentary committee on prostitution. The only people involved who did not give evidence were the clients. Perhaps that is why the committee's solution, published in its report on July 8th, was to amend the law to be tougher on them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Residents' groups in areas such as Streatham in London and Forest Road in Nottingham say that prostitution on their streets is a nightmare. Local men are bothered by women trying to climb into their cars; local women and girls are harassed by men trying to buy sex. The nights are noisy, with people shouting, engines running and car doors banging. The streets are littered with condoms and soiled tissues. Prostitutes ply their trade in people's basements and garden sheds. The police, say locals, do nothing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The police admit that prostitution is low down their list of priorities, but say that it is impossible to implement the law effectively. Since the Police and Criminal Evidence Act of 1984, they have to release prostitutes as soon as they have arrested and charged them. As a result, they often end up arresting the same woman several times in a night. Fines go up to &#163;1,000, but many magistrates are unwilling to impose high fines because they believe they force the women to work harder to pay them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Both police and residents' groups liked the idea of targeting the clients. Currently, kerb-crawling is dealt with in the same way as traffic offences: the police cannot arrest offenders, although they can prosecute and fine them up to &#163;1,000. Police reckoned that arrest might be a more effective deterrent than a routine fine in the post; and residents' groups also favoured shaming kerb-crawlers by publishing their names in local papers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is a curious suggestion for a country with a proper respect for privacy. But this is the sort of dark alley down which attempts to make an unworkable law work inevitably lead.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The most sensible suggestion on the prostitution laws came from the prostitutes who gave evidence to the committee: scrap them. Then prostitutes would be happy because they could work indoors (which many avoid because of the risk of police raids); residents would be happy because the trade would move off the streets; and the police would be happy to be relieved of the impossible task of trying to suppress the world's oldest profession. The committee, however, rejected this option out of hand.

<p><b>Open government</b></p>
<h1> Whitehall's dark dealings</h1>


<p>TWO years ago, the government introduced a code to improve access to official information, supervised by an independent arbiter. The minister who was at the time responsible for open government, William Waldegrave, predicted that his bold initiative would lead to a new climate of openness in Whitehall. His successor, Roger Freeman, recently protested: "There is a common perception that Whitehall operates under a cloak of secrecy. This isn't true."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Journalists are constantly frustrated by the British government's visceral meanness with information, so <i>The Economist </i>was heartened by this enthusiasm for open government. To test it, we asked for details of the sale prices of 27 British Rail businesses listed in a Department of Transport (<font size=-1>DOT</font>) press release in January as having been successfully privatised. When the department refused to hand out the information on the grounds that if it were public knowledge it might prejudice future sales, we complained to the code's arbiter, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, William Reid.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Reid, who is better known as the Ombudsman, has not, so far, had a great deal to do. In his first two years, he has investigated only 97 complaints. Ours was the first from any newspaper.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Complaints to the Ombudsman have to be made through an <font size=-1>MP</font>. On February 10th we wrote to Clare Short, Labour's transport spokesman, saying that we believed the public should know how much publicly owned assets were being sold for. We pointed out that many of the businesses whose sale prices the government was refusing to disclose, such as the Red Star freight business, had nothing in common with the businesses remaining to be sold: thus the information about those sales would not affect future ones. We also noted that the government had broken its own secrecy rule by disclosing the sale for &#163;1.8 billion of the three rolling-stock leasing companies in January 1995.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Ombudsman announced that he would investigate our complaint on February 23rd. Three months later, he issued an initial finding in our favour. The <font size=-1>DOT</font>, he said, had agreed to release the sale prices of four of the smaller businesses that had been privatised. The department has now published the sale prices of some of the other businesses in a parliamentary answer timed to coincide with the Ombudsman's final report and says it will publish the rest soon.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Reid accepts that the department was entitled to refuse to disclose the sale prices of these businesses at the time we requested the information because this might have "prejudiced commercial activities", grounds for exemption under the code. But he says he expects the department to publish the remaining sale prices shortly.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So has open government arrived? Only up to a point. Contrary to our expectations, the Ombudsman's intervention did work. We got the information we wanted. Still, it took him more than five months to prise the information out of Whitehall. Without his intervention, it would still not be available. Whitehall has not yet hung up its cloak.

<p><b>Scottish devolution</b></p>
<h1>Bleeding tartan taxpayers</h1>

<font size=1>EDINBURGH</font>
<p>THE Labour Party thought it had spoilt the Tories' devolution plans. Last month it promised to hold a referendum asking Scottish voters not only whether they want a parliament in Edinburgh, but also whether they want it to have tax-raising powers. The Tories appear unimpressed by this tactic. On July 8th Michael Forsyth, the Scottish secretary, pronounced that Labour's proposed "tartan tax" showed the party's "lust to bleed Scottish wealth creators white."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Forsyth's lurid diatribe misses the point. The key question about Labour's proposals is not whether they will allow an Edinburgh parliament to bleed anyone dry, but whether they will allow it to do much of anything at all.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour says a power to tax is essential both to make a Scottish parliament accountable to its voters and to stop it whingeing about Westminster's meanness. In fact, Labour's taxing proposal is so modest that it will achieve neither.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour wants a Scottish parliament to be able to raise or lower the basic rate of income tax by up to 3p. If the parliament put up current tax rates by the maximum amount, those paying the highest tartan tax would pay an extra &#163;648 a year, which would give the Scottish parliament about &#163;450m. This would amount to a mere 3% of the parliament's revenues. Most of the money it would be responsible for spending would come from the grant currently made to the Scottish Office by Westminster (&#163;14.5bn in the current fiscal year). So much for accountability.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, the parliament's capacity to tax earned income even to this limited extent (investment income is excluded) would still depend on decisions taken at Westminster. Martyn Jones, a lawyer with Maclay Murray &amp; Spens, a corporate law firm, points out that Labour's proposal is (oddly) for a regressive tax, applicable only to the basic rate of income tax, levied presently on income between &#163;7,665 and &#163;29,265. Any decisions by the chancellor of the exchequer to narrow this band throughout Britain would also cut the Scottish parliament's revenue. So much for the idea that a Scottish parliament would eliminate Scottish grumbles about decisions taken at Westminster.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;George Robertson, Labour's Scottish spokesman, is enthusiastic about the political bartering over tax rates between Edinburgh and Westminster which might result. "There will be openness in the system instead of the closed-doors bartering which goes on all the time inside government," he says.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And yet, however desirable such a system might be from the point of view of open government, it might also mean that the Edinburgh parliament could not lower income tax in Scotland. The reason is that spending per head tends to be higher in Scotland than in England. This discrepancy has survived the introduction, back in 1978, of a formula intended to close the gap. Spending per head on the services to be devolved was 22% higher in Scotland than in England in 1976-77, and in 1993-94 it was still 21% higher.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour says that it would not change the Scottish spending formula. But the pressure to reduce the discrepancy would increase if powers were devolved to the Scottish parliament, and English <font size=-1>MP</font>s lost their say over how the money was spent. It would redouble if the Scottish parliament ever tried to reduce taxes. English <font size=-1>MP</font>s would hardly agree to the continuation of such large transfers north of the border if the Scots were using some of the money to give themselves a tax cut.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So the parliament's powers to reduce taxes would be a fiction, and its power to raise them severely restricted. Sir Edward Heath, a former Tory prime minister, was surely right when he said on July 9th that his party's predictions that devolution would produce civil war were "fantastic nonsense" . But then, on close inspection, Labour's claims that an Edinburgh parliament would be financially independent look just as wild.

<h1>Taxed in cyberspace </h1>

<p>THE success of America's $60 billion home-shopping business is often credited to whim and convenience, but the truth is more about tax. Thanks to a legal loophole, Americans rarely pay sales tax when they buy things through the post or over free "800" telephone numbers from companies based in other states. That saves them nearly $4 billion a year. On the Internet, hundreds of companies plunging into the promised boom market of electronic commerce are assuming the same is true for them--virtually all of them are treating Internet sales just like telephone sales. This could prove an expensive mistake.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Taking their lead from Connecticut and the Multistate Tax Commission, several states are proposing a rather tortured interpretation of the Internet that would make all commerce over it, in effect, local everywhere for tax purposes. Most of the 45 states that charge local sales taxes argue that a business has a sales "nexus" (the equivalent of a physical presence) in a particular state if its telecommunications equipment--usually its call centre or corporate headquarters--is in that state.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By that definition, one might think that the Internet is no different from ordinary telephony. Just as callers reach a company's telesales centre over the public-telephone system, cybershoppers reach a company's Web site over the public Internet, which is made up of hundreds of interlinked network providers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the states claim one key difference: they argue that each of the hundreds of independent firms that provide Internet access to their subscribers across the United States is, in effect, working on behalf (as an "agent") of all those companies that have a Web site or otherwise do business over the Internet. And therefore, they claim, every company selling goods over the Internet has a telecommunications nexus in every state, and must pay local sales tax on goods that it sells in each state.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Internet commerce will be worth more than $500m this year, and is expected to reach more than $6 billion by 2000, so the stakes are high--sales tax ranges from 4% to 7% among American states. Kent Johnson, head of the sales-tax practice at <font size=-1>KPMG</font>, an accounting firm which has been studying the problem, reckons that uncertainty about tax could cause companies to think twice about selling over the Internet: nobody wants to face a multi-million-dollar back-tax bill. In a <font size=-1>KPMG</font> survey of nearly 300 large companies, one-third thought that state and local taxes on Internet sales would hurt their company's electronic-commerce efforts, and some even planned to move their operations offshore to avoid them. If a sign were needed that the Internet has become a real market, the arrival of tax avoidance is surely it.

<p><b>European entrepreneurs</b></p>
<h1>Not quite the right moral</h1>

<font size=1>PARIS</font><p><b>Does the success of Business Objects symbolise the future of European high-tech companies?</b></p>


<p>IN THE rise of Business Objects, a small French software company, some see cause for great hope. With skill and a bit of luck, other high-tech European companies can also best their American rivals. Business Objects is thus much more than a rarity: it has become a symbol. Its history has even encouraged the French bourse to launch a new market for small fast-growing firms. The business press has heaped prizes on the company's founders.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is odd. For if Business Objects encapsulates any lesson, it is that European start-ups are most likely to succeed by escaping their European roots as fast as possible.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are few Porsches and Ferraris in the car park opposite the firm's head office in Puteaux, a drab suburb to the west of Paris, but that probably reflects the French antipathy to flaunting wealth. Since it was founded in 1990 by two Frenchmen in their late 20s, the company's sales have been doubling each year, reaching $60m in 1995, with net profits of $8m (see <a href="wb1.gif">chart</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is no accident that the accounts of this French firm are denominated in dollars: its shares are quoted on Nasdaq, a New York stockmarket which lists many American high-tech firms. There they climbed from $17.50 to $29.50 on the day when they were issued in September 1994. This year they have done better than the Nasdaq composite index, hitting a high of more than $50 before falling back to $27, possibly on worries about the latest version of its software.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although Business Objects is growing, it has a total market capitalisation of $650m, making it still a tiddler in the programming world. It specialises in software for client/server computing, networks of independent computers hitched to a central machine which contains shared databases and programs. The firm has made its fortune with a program that allows managers to question databases in more or less everyday language. Pulling information out of a database used to mean learning a special programming language or getting the help of a computer professional. According to a survey by <font size=-1>META</font> Group, an American market-research firm, Business Objects now accounts for a third of the worldwide sales of database-query programs, a market that is expected to grow to $800m by 1997, ten times its value in 1993.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In one respect, those worried by Europe's conspicuous weakness in computing are right to take comfort from Business Objects. The firm owes its success to solid commercial skill rather than to an unrepeatable stroke of programming genius. Bernard Liautaud and Denis Payre, the two founders, both worked for Oracle, an American database firm, as technical and commercial staff.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet the reassurance stops there. The new company turned its back on the conventional French route to prosperity. Although Business Objects was founded in France by Frenchmen, it seems mightily American to an outsider.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even the name hints at the firm's inspiration. Mr Liautaud admits that French customers thought the company was the European subsidiary of an American parent. "Objets Commerciaux" would have been more politically correct, but might have scared them off. And in the United States, where the company has grown fast, it has not suffered from the stigma, in high technology, of being European.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The new firm's capital structure is one of its most unFrench characteristics. Many entrepreneurs in France fear that selling shares to outsiders means losing control. The typical result is a series of holding companies buttressed by double-voting rights for a few privileged shares. By contrast, the founders of Business Objects invited investment from American and French venture capitalists. After successive rounds of finance, and flotation on Nasdaq, the pair retain only around 14% of the equity. As Mr Liautaud says, power comes from success: it is better to have a small part of a large company than a large part of a small one.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The typical European entrepreneur, according to Jean-Louis Barsoux, an academic based at <font size=-1>INSEAD</font>, a business school outside Paris, who has studied Business Objects, is authoritarian and unwilling to give up power. By contrast, Mr Liautaud and Mr Payre set out to hire skilled managers by offering them stock options, consciously imitating what they saw as the approach of entrepreneurs in Silicon Valley.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The result was that the company had enough capital to see it through the early years, and the confidence to spend a large part (initially as much as 50%) of its revenues on <font size=-1>R&D</font>. The money and depth of managerial talent meant that the firm could set up foreign offices almost from the start. This was essential to make an impression in a fast-moving business.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To flourish, the firm needs its niche to grow, but not so fast that really big competitors are drawn in. The fortunes of European high technology depend upon the creation of more Business Objects.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The very fact that an example is there to copy will help. So, too, will the development of European capital markets. Shocked that a French success should float in America, the French bourse has set up the Nouveau March&eacute;, which is just one of a handful of new European markets designed for small, fast-growing companies. So far only seven firms have been launched on the market, though the exchange hopes for few dozen listings in the coming years. One of the recent listings was a chain of hairdressing salons. High-tech Europe still has a lot of catching up to do.

<h1>The telephone's second chance</h1>
<p><b>Will nifty technology enable the telephone companies to provide fast Internet access over their old copper lines? The second of our briefs rates their odds</b></p>

<p>TELEPHONE companies have long envied the profits cable-television firms make by delivering television programmes into homes. But this was a business that seemed impossible for them to enter. Most telephone networks run on twisted copper wires. Even with the fastest modems, signals on these wires were interrupted by too much noise to carry much more than still pictures and text.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That would have been that, had researchers not spotted a funny thing about the noise on these lines. It is not uniform. Some frequencies are swamped by noise, but on others signals pass through untouched. The trouble is that this varies from line to line and from moment to moment, and hand-tweaking each line to carry more data is impractical. In 1987, however, along came a technology that could do it automatically.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The trick is to use fast computer chips called digital signal processors to test each line constantly and then tailor the data to travel only over the frequencies that are clearest at any time. With such a chip on each end of a line, telephone companies found they could increase the capacity of their old wires thousands of times--enough to deliver high-quality video pictures.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many firms, notably Bell Atlantic in America and <font size=-1>BT</font> in Britain, bought these boxes, called asymmetric digital subscriber line (<font size=-1>ADSL</font>) modems, to try their hand at the media mania of the moment, interactive television. But subscribers turned out to be a lot less interested in this than the telephone companies were. Trials suggested that they would not pay enough to cover the cost of the expensive equipment. <font size=-1>ADSL</font> looked like another technology that cost too much and offered too little.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Recently two things have rekindled <font size=-1>ADSL</font>'s flame. First, in America, Congress has opened the local telephone markets to competition, confronting Bell Atlantic and the six other "Baby Bells" with the first challengers they have ever seen. Some of these new competitors will be cable-television firms, which are using a different technology to offer telephone calls and high-speed Internet access on their own lines. Compared with the optical fibres such firms use, plain old telephone wires will not for long be the cash cows the phone companies are used to. They will need to offer new services, while making the most of the networks they already have.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second change is the rise of the Internet. Consumers may not have been wowed by interactive television, but it seems that they cannot get enough of the Internet. The telephone companies reckon that many people would pay a lot for really high-speed Internet access: just the thing to keep revenues up while voice-calling profits fall. Five of America's Baby Bells--<font size=-1>GTE</font>, <font size=-1>US</font> West, BellSouth, Bell Atlantic and <font size=-1>SBC</font> Communications--as well as Bell Canada, have all announced trials using <font size=-1>ADSL</font> to deliver high-speed Internet access.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>ADSL</font>, and related digital subscriber line technologies (known generically as x<font size=-1>DSL</font>), work by exploiting unused capacity in copper wire. Voice calls--and data calls using everyday modems--use barely one-half of one per cent of the capacity of ordinary telephone lines. <font size=-1>ADSL</font> modems make use of the remaining 99.5% or so. In effect, <font size=-1>ADSL</font> divides a copper wire into 255 "bins", each of which is capacious enough to hold one voice call. One of these bins is kept aside for voice calls; together, most of the rest behave like super-efficient conventional modems acting in parallel. So while top-of-the-range analogue modems struggle to reach 33,600 bits per second (bps), <font size=-1>ADSL</font> can race to 300 times that. A sub-set of <font size=-1>ADSL</font>, known as <font size=-1>VDSL</font> (the "v", with a bit of acronymic licence, stands for "very high bit-rate" ), can go five or six times faster still (see <a href="st1.gif">chart</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>ADSL</font> is ideal for providing high-speed Internet access to consumers in many other respects. <font size=-1>ADSL</font> modems are permanently connected, eliminating tiresome delays. Analogue modem users are increasingly hogging expensive telephone switches as they surf the Internet. <font size=-1>ADSL</font> bypasses all that with a direct digital connection, keeping prices down for both customers and the telephone companies.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the telephone companies, <font size=-1>ADSL</font> also has the advantage of having outgrown its teething pains. Early variants, for example, were almost entirely one-way. Now, <font size=-1>ADSL</font> rushes data in both directions (although it is still around ten times faster going into a house than it is coming out), allowing useful things like video-conferencing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another pitfall was variation in the quality of copper lines. Bell Atlantic ran trials in 1993 in the hope that 95% of homes in the Washington, <font size=-1>DC</font> area could be serviced easily using <font size=-1>ADSL</font>. In fact, they found that the real figure was closer to 30%, mostly because of interference from everything from hair-dryers to radio signals. More recent <font size=-1>ADSL</font> systems have proved more flexible. Like the modern analogue modems, newer <font size=-1>ADSL</font> modems alter their speed of transmission according to the conditions; when they encounter interference, they automatically slow down. Pairgain, an <font size=-1>ADSL</font> modem maker, reckons than 85% of America's twisted copper lines will support <font size=-1>ADSL</font> without any modification.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is, however, another worry. Early tests of <font size=-1>ADSL</font> suggested an alarmingly short reach. At a distance of 3,700 metres (12,000 feet) from a telephone company's offices, one type of <font size=-1>ADSL</font> modem will deliver 6m bps downstream. But take it 1,800 metres further away and it drops to 1.5m bps. In densely populated countries, this is not such a problem: more than 95% of Italian homes, 90% of British and nearly 80% of German homes are within 3,700 metres of a telephone central office. But in America this figure hovers around 50%, suggesting that other technologies, such as wireless connections or direct satellite, will be a better route to the Internet in rural areas.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Technical issues aside, the main worry about <font size=-1>ADSL</font> is its cost. Today a pair of modems costs between $1,500 and $3,000. But as Rupert Baines of Analog Devices, a chip maker, points out, one of the most expensive parts of <font size=-1>ADSL</font> modems is their processor chips. Since chip prices tend to halve every 18 months, <font size=-1>ADSL</font> modems should get cheaper, too.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For <font size=-1>ADSL</font> to become the favoured Internet-access technology, the telephone companies may have to change their ways. Their decades-old monopoly of voice telephony has endowed them not only with lots of money but also with slothful habits. They have done almost nothing, for example, to market a slower digital technology called <font size=-1>ISDN</font>, despite having spent billions to upgrade their networks to support it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unless they are to repeat that mistake with <font size=-1>ADSL</font>, they will need to order enough <font size=-1>ADSL</font> modems to push the price down, while marketing the service hard enough to find takers for them. There are, after all, plenty of rival technologies competing to deliver the Internet to the masses: including cable modems, satellites, and (the subject of next week's brief) wireless.

<h1><center>Yeltsin's next round</center></h1>

IT IS quite an achievement. Though Boris Yeltsin is erratic in temperament and unsound in body, and though he has presided over a period of change in which most Russians have grown poorer, they have re-elected him. Few, if any, reformers in other ex-communist countries have been given a similar second chance. That undoubtedly owes much to the alternative on offer in Russia: the primitive Communism of Gennady Zyuganov, the defeated candidate. But it is also a tribute to Mr Yeltsin. His success means that hopes for reform are still alive.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Alas, the sighs of admiration, and of relief, are already giving way to gasps of anxiety. Democracy and prosperity in Russia are far from secure. So is Mr Yeltsin's presidency. Having suffered two heart attacks in the past year, and something serious this week, he cannot be certain of serving his full four years in office. His very will to govern may even be in doubt: during his first term he occasionally seemed to abdicate for months at a time, allowing unsavoury cronies to take advantage of the ensuing vacuum. Should he leave the presidency prematurely, Mr Zyuganov's Communists might well have another crack at the Kremlin.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What if the president does die in office? The constitution says the prime minister then takes over until another presidential election is held; the swiftly reappointed incumbent, Viktor Chernomyrdin, probably therefore has a head start, if he wishes to succeed. At present, no one--and certainly no one reassuring--can be considered Mr Yeltsin's heir-apparent. Competition for the job would be intense and divisive.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Alexander Lebed, the former general whose backing for Mr Yeltsin in this week's run-off clinched the president's re-election, thinks he is already all but anointed. He is probably wrong, though he has at least a chance of emerging on top. If that happened, however, confidence would take another knock. Even in the past fortnight Mr Lebed has made a series of ugly, economically illiterate and anti-democratic remarks that confirm suspicions that he is the wrong man for the succession. If in his new post as security overseer he can reduce crime, well and good. But Mr Yeltsin will have to watch his back. The Kremlin is awash with intrigue.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In any event, a daunting pile of tasks awaits Mr Yeltsin. The rebellious territory of Chechnya must be pacified, preferably by letting it secede, if that is what most Chechens want to do. Within months, he will need to squeeze public spending brutally, despite his rash campaign promises--a good $10 billion-worth of them, by some calculations. The anger of those Russians who, for instance, have not been paid for half a year, could start to mount. But to keep the economy stable and to meet the <font size=-1>IMF</font>'s conditions for a continuing flow of loans, Mr Yeltsin must tighten belts ever more painfully.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He must also embark on a gruelling course of longer-term reforms. A drastic overhaul of land-ownership and farming is urgent. A new tax code, simpler, friendlier to businessmen and investors, especially from abroad, is also needed: partly through fear of a Communist victory, tax evasion has reached chronic proportions in the past six months. Privatisation has stalled since the parliamentary election last December. The government's ownership of vast swathes of energy and other natural resources is holding back growth. Monopolies in industries like railways and various utilities need breaking up. Despite big recent advances, Russia still lacks a truly independent judiciary and an enforceable legal system. It needs a smaller, and properly paid, professional army. And war must be waged on organised crime.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately the Duma, the lower house of parliament, which is dominated by Communists and nationalists, will oppose nearly all these changes. It has already done its best to block or hobble many of them. In the rare instances when it has approved a reform or a new institution, it has usually done so in order to take control itself.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The hope is that a more reform-friendly Duma will emerge after the next election, due in three years' time. At present, Mr Yeltsin can issue decrees, laying down broad policies which may sometimes be wangled into effect, despite the Duma's hostility. He can try to chip away at the edges of the Communist and nationalist blocks. Given the momentum of his big win on Wednesday, however, he may in due course be tempted to force a showdown, perhaps by challenging the Duma to accept a reformist prime minister to replace the dull and dependable Mr Chernomyrdin. Fresh Duma elections would be risky. But Mr Yeltsin is nothing if not a risk-taker.
</p><p><b>The hope amid the worry</b>
<br>The election showed that Mr Zyuganov's mixture of xenophobic nationalism and nostalgia for communism still has an alarmingly potent appeal in Russia. It is not much less worrying that Mr Yeltsin had to co-opt a crude law-and-order figure in the shape of Mr Lebed to ensure re-election. But time, especially if Mr Yeltsin manages to survive four more reasonably active years, is against the Communists. The most hopeful aspect of Mr Yeltsin's win is that the forces of reform, faced with the possibility of Communism's return, did manage to put their differences aside and rally to democracy's cause. If they can now help Mr Yeltsin to put Russia on the road to a just and civil society as well as a vigorous capitalist one, it may yet be said that the presidential election of 1996 was almost as significant as the collapse of Soviet power in 1991.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?836607600,iss">Search</a>

<h2>Yeltsin's victory</h2>
<p>Boris Yeltsin was easily re-elected president of <b>Russia</b>. In a run-off on July 3rd he won 54% of the votes cast, to the Communist Gennady Zyuganov's 40%. Mr Yeltsin, who made no public appearances in the days before the run-off, appeared on television to assuage worries about his health.<p>
The Czech Republic's three-party conservative coalition formed a new government after losing its majority in elections last month. The prime minister, <b>Vaclav Klaus</b>, granted more influence to the smaller partners of his Civic Democratic Party and to the opposition Social Democrats.<p>
Necmettin Erbakan, leader of the Welfare Party, became <b>Turkey's first Islamist prime minister</b> after striking a deal with the secular True Path Party. Turkey would remain a "democratic, secular and social state based on law", he said.<p>
Greece's prime minister, Costas Simitis, was elected leader of the socialist <b>Pasok</b> <b>party </b>days after the death of its founder, Andreas Papandreou. His victory in a hard-fought leadership battle should help Mr Simitis to push through budget cuts and other economic reforms.<p>
A day after the leaders of the <font size=-1>G7</font> rich countries called for his resignation, the Bosnian Serb president, <b>Radovan Karadzic</b>, said he would leave office. He may not relinquish power, however. His successor, Biljana Plavsic, is loyal to Mr Karadzic, who has been indicted for war crimes.<p>
The lower house of Germany's parliament approved cuts in <b>social-welfare benefits</b>, including unemployment and sick pay, health care and job security. Some of these measures require the approval of the upper house, controlled by the opposition Social Democrats.<p>
The European Commission threatened to take four countries to court for failing to enforce <b>European Union laws</b>. Austria refuses to outlaw anonymous bank accounts, France imposes excessive restrictions on advertising, and Greece and Italy are accused of infractions over customs duties and value-added tax.<p>
Hungary's government agreed to a plan for restitution of <b>Jewish property</b> stolen during the 1930s and 1940s that could set an example for other East European countries. A foundation will manage property once owned by Jews and money donated by the government for the benefit of the country's 20,000 remaining Jews.<p>
<b>Iceland</b> has elected a new president, Olafur Ragnar Grimsson, a left-wing former finance minister who has opposed the country's membership of <font size=-1>NATO</font>. He replaces Vigdis Finnbogadottir, a popular leader who stepped down after 16 years in office.<p></td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>



<h2>Age before beauty</h2>
<p>The congress of <b>Vietnam</b>'s Communist Party decided that all businesses should set up a Communist Party organisation. The ruling triumvirate, the president, Le Duc Anh, aged 75, the prime minister, Vo Van Kiet, 73, and the party general secretary, Do Muoi, 79, kept their jobs despite earlier reports that the party was to be "rejuvenated".<p>
Christian opponents of a plan to give Muslims some power in southern <b>Mindanao </b>jeered the Philippine president, Fidel Ramos, when he visited the area. The plan aims to end a 24-year ethnic conflict in which at least 50,000 people have died.<p>
Taiwan's President Lee Teng-hui ruled out <b>reunification with China </b>under the formula, "one country, two systems", noting that Hong Kong's experience with the concept raised doubts.<p>
The People's Revolutionary Party, run by ex-communists, lost power to the Democratic Union Coalition in <b>Mongolia</b>'s general election.

<h2>Changing tack</h2>
<p>Bob Dole, the Republican candidate for president, said he would be willing after all to pick a running-mate who did not share his opposition to <b>abortion</b>. In another show of recklessness, Mr Dole insisted that he did not know whether or not tobacco was addictive, and suggested that a former surgeon-general may have been "a little bit" brainwashed to preach that it was. <p>
The Supreme Court left intact a ruling by a federal court that struck down an <b>affirmative-action </b>admissions plan at the University of Texas law school. The ruling said that race could not be used as a factor in admissions. The court's action affects three states--Texas, Mississippi and Louisiana--with large minority populations.<p>
Federal agents arrested 12 members of an Arizona group called the <b>Viper Militia </b>and charged them with conspiracy to blow up a number of federal buildings.<p>
Leonel Fernandez narrowly won an election to become the <b>Dominican Republic</b>'s next president.

<h2>Less support</h2>
<p>The long-delayed local elections in the<b> KwaZulu-Natal</b> province of South Africa brought clear victory for the African National Congress in urban areas and an equally clear victory for the Inkatha Freedom Party in rural areas. Overall, Inkatha won more votes than its rivals but fewer than in 1994.<p>
As African and western countries prepared a peacekeeping force for <b>Burundi</b>, more than 2,000 people fled from the north-western town of Cibitoke amid reports of a fresh massacre.<p>
David Levy (left), <b>Israel</b>'s new foreign minister, threatened Binyamin Netanyahu with resignation unless Ariel Sharon, the hardest of hardliners, was brought into the cabinet.<p>

<p>In an upheaval at one of the world's biggest finance groups, <b>CS Holding</b>, recently rebuffed in its attempt to merge with Union Bank of Switzerland, said it will cut 5,000 jobs, create four core units and take a new name--Credit Suisse Group. Lukas M&uuml;hlemann, drafted in from Swiss Re, a reinsurer, will run the whole under the chairman, Rainer Gut (above).<p>
Growing risks and competition are forcing reinsurers to consolidate. General Re, <b>America's biggest reinsurer</b>, plans to pay $940m for a rival, National Re.<p>
<b>MasterCard</b> has followed Visa in banning its member banks from issuing rival cards--a jab at <b>American Express</b>, which wants to distribute its cards through banks. The European Commission has already warned Visa against using this tactic; in America, the Justice Department is investigating the whole credit-card business.<p>
The <b>dollar</b> rose above &#165;110 for the first time in 2.5 years, though mainly because interest rates in Japan were thought likely to remain at rock-bottom.<p>
<b>Copper</b> futures slid further as supplies of the metal were released from Sumitomo Corp's stockpile. A British metals-trading firm, Rudolf Wolff, suspended three employees in Tokyo after an internal check on the firm's dealings with Sumitomo, which recently admitted huge copper losses.<p>
<b>The London Stock Exchange</b> is to cut costs (and staff) by a third, to become more competitive. The imminent arrival of Crest, a paperless trading system from the Bank of England, is expected to lop off about a third of the exchange's revenues.

Of the 447 billionaires listed by <i>Forbes</i>, 149 are from the United States. The number of Japanese billionaires stays at 41; but in five years the number in the rest of Asia has risen fast, from 26 to 82.<p>
An American billionaire, Wayne Huizenga, is paying about $5 billion in an agreed deal for <b>ADT</b>, which sells burglar alarms and second-hand cars. With waste management, these have become big businesses for Mr Huizenga's <b>Republic Industries</b>.<p>
The American Supreme Court ruled that the government broke its promise to some <b>savings and loan </b>institutions (thrifts) when it changed accounting rules on intangible goodwill during the <font size=-1>S&L</font> crisis in the 1980s.

<b>Mediaset</b>, part of Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest empire, will begin trading on July 15th with a share price that values Italy's biggest commercial-<font size=-1>TV</font> group at around 8.25 trillion lire ($5.4 billion). Mr Berlusconi is floating Mediaset to avert a clash between his media and political interests.<p>
<b>Digital Equipment</b>, the world's second-biggest computer maker, issued a profit warning and said it will cut 7,000 of its 61,000 jobs worldwide in a $475m restructuring, despite strong growth last year after an earlier restructuring.

<h1>Russia's daunting future</h1>

<font size=1>MOSCOW</font><p><b>It was a stunning electoral achievement by Boris Yeltsin, but his health and a hostile Duma remain formidable obstacles to building a new Russia</b></p>


<p>TOO SICK or too tired to vote at his intended polling station, but well enough to win a landslide victory, Boris Yeltsin triumphed by 54% to 40% over his Communist challenger, Gennady Zyuganov, in the second round of Russia's presidential election on July 3rd. (About 5% of votes were cast "against both candidates".) Russian shares and government securities firmed on the news. Western leaders sighed with relief. "We can send the Communists to hell," said an elated Kremlin adviser.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a television speech on July 4th, Mr Yeltsin struck a conciliatory note, saying that Russia should not be divided "into winners and losers". The incumbent prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, said he would be presiding over Mr Yeltsin's new government, indicating a continuation of Russia's broadly reformist policies.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most people had expected Mr Yeltsin to win, but not by so wide a margin. In a first round of voting on June 16th, he had led Mr Zyuganov by 35% to 32%, with nine more candidates trailing. But regions that had favoured Mr Zyuganov in the first round swung Mr Yeltsin's way in the second. Mr Yeltsin seemed to gain many new votes from supporters of Alexander Lebed, a gruff law-and-order general who finished a strong third on June 16th with 15%. Two days later Mr Lebed entered the Kremlin as national security adviser, behaving as Mr Yeltsin's de facto deputy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Yeltsin also gained votes from supporters of Grigory Yavlinsky, a moderate reformist who came fourth on June 16th with 7.4% after an agonisingly clumsy campaign. He gave Mr Yeltsin a roundabout endorsement after round one, so may be rewarded with a job in government.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The historic victory in Russia's first free presidential election as a fully sovereign state capped a remarkable comeback for Mr Yeltsin, whose poll ratings had languished at a mere 8% in January. To restore his popularity when campaigning, he promised handouts and subsidies to dozens of regions and interest-groups, running up a bill that threatens to top $10 billion. He was helped by feeble campaigning from Mr Zyuganov, by a slavishly pro-Yeltsin bias in the Russian media, and at the end by the Kremlin's insistence that the second-round ballot should be held on a special mid-week public holiday. The president's more urban electorate, which might have defected en masse to its country dachas had the vote been held as usual on a Sunday, turned up in dutiful droves at the polling stations. In Moscow Mr Yeltsin led Mr Zyuganov by 78% to 18%; in St Petersburg by 74% to 21%, according to preliminary returns. Those two winning margins added up to 5m votes, or roughly half Mr Yeltsin's winning margin across Russia as a whole. Despite fears of election fatigue, some 67% of voters turned out across the country, only three percentage points below the first-round turnout (see <a href="eu1.gif">table</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A shadow was cast over Mr Yeltsin's victory, however, by the mysterious illness that caused him to duck a series of public engagements in the six days before the final vote. His few brief television appearances in that time were recorded by private Kremlin cameras. Officials insisted that Mr Yeltsin was suffering from "a cold" or "laryngitis", and that he was working normally again in the Kremlin on July 4th. But pessimistic outsiders worried that Mr Yeltsin's slurred speech and awkward posture when seen on television hinted at a mild stroke or heavy medication. Exhaustion, depression or a recurrence of long-standing heart trouble seemed equally plausible explanations. An unfit 65, Mr Yeltsin suffered two serious heart attacks last year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If voters seemed not to worry about Mr Yeltsin's health, that was because most of them knew little or nothing about it. The story was ignored or played down by Russian television and most newspapers, which continued their campaign coverage in a vein so partisan as to demand a good dose of soul-searching on the part of the country's journalists.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Victory safely banked, Mr Yeltsin's next big step will probably be to invite the Duma, the lower house of Russia's parliament, to endorse Mr Chernomyrdin as prime minister. That would leave the Communists, who dominate the Duma, to decide if they wanted to pick a fight (see <a href="eu2.html">page</a>). When it came to choosing other ministers, officials said, Mr Yeltsin would not want a coalition government as such, but would be looking for new allies. Attempts might be made to weaken the Communist block by dividing it rather than by attacking it head on--perhaps by inviting Aman Tuleyev, an ally of Mr Zyuganov, into government, and by scheming to unseat Gennady Seleznev, a rival of Mr Zyuganov, as speaker of the Duma.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Yeltsin cannot afford to be too conciliatory, however, if he hopes to follow through on some of the second-term policies at which he has hinted. A strong presidential agenda might include reforms of taxation, of farming and of the army, a rooting-out of organised crime and the making of a durable peace in Chechnya. It would mean riding roughshod over the Duma in pursuit of legislation, and knocking rebellious officials into line. It would also mean a return to stricter fiscal discipline and with that, almost inevitably, a fresh surge of public hostility as cash limits on public spending began to bite, dodgy banks were left to topple, and the sale of state assets resumed. For those reasons, it may be Mr Yeltsin's reserves of energy, as much as his political instincts, that determine what--and how much--he gets done.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One worry, if Mr Yeltsin remains weak, is that he will be more vulnerable to the capture of his power by others. First in the queue would be the ambitious but wholly inexperienced Mr Lebed, who within a fortnight of entering the Kremlin was urging Mr Yeltsin to appoint him vice-president. And somewhere in the shadows, doubtless, would be Alexander Korzhakov, Mr Yeltsin's long-time bodyguard and confidant. Mr Korzhakov was sacked as chief of the presidential guard on June 20th amid allegations that was he was preparing to wreck the election. But he has stayed friends with Mr Yeltsin and has kept a place in the presidential entourage.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The biggest worry of all would be that Mr Yeltsin's health might deteriorate to the point at which he could no longer continue to rule. If that happened in the near future, Russia's strained nerves could not easily cope with another presidential election--any more than Russia's newly minted democracy could cope without one.

<h1>What if he dies?</h1>

<font size=1>MOSCOW</font>
<p>ASSUMING that Boris Yeltsin proves fit enough to embark on his second term of office, his first duties under Russia's constitution will be to swear an oath of office and to offer a prime minister for approval by Russia's lower house of parliament, the Duma. The swearing-in ceremony has been provisionally set for August 9th. No more than a fortnight later, Mr Yeltsin must offer the Duma his choice of prime minister. If the Duma rejects three names in succession--which may take up to six weeks--the president must dissolve it and call a new election. If the new Duma also defies the president, the procedure is repeated.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some have suggested that Mr Yeltsin might try to by-pass the Duma by arguing that he was not a "newly elected" but a "re-elected" president and, by the constitution, at liberty to leave in place his incumbent prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, with or without the Duma's consent. Presidential advisers discount this tactic, though Mr Yeltsin has said he wants Mr Chernomyrdin to stay.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Given Mr Yeltsin's poor health, the choice of prime minister may matter more than usual. The constitution provides for the prime minister to become acting president "in all instances where the president...is unable to perform his duties". Should the president display a "persistent inability to exercise his powers for health reasons", he must step down permanently in favour of the prime minister, and a new presidential election must be held within three months.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the constitution identifies no impartial judge of the president's condition. There was no transfer of powers to the prime minister when Mr Yeltsin suffered two heart attacks last year. The question of "who rules" is bound to be raised again if Mr Yeltsin's recent illness continues, or if he recovers enough to have the heart operation that is long overdue.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The mechanics of a mid-term succession could change if Mr Yeltsin yields to pressure from his new right-hand man, Alexander Lebed, and creates a vice-president's post for his benefit. But that would mean amending the constitution, potentially a long and difficult enterprise. An amendment could pass only with a three-quarters majority in the upper house of parliament, the federation council; a two-thirds majority in the Duma; and simple majorities in local legislatures across at least two-thirds of Russia.

<p><b>Planning</b></p>
<h1>The cities come back to life</h1>
<p><b>Britain's cities are growing for the first time since the first world war. There are plenty of ideas about how to improve them, and the government has announced new measures to promote their health</b></p>

<p>IT IS hard to make anybody sit up and listen when what you have to announce is "the government's revised planning policy-guidance note on town centres and retail development." So it is not surprising that John Gummer, the environment secretary, did not get the attention he deserved when outlining his new policy at the end of last month. When future social historians record the turn-around in the fortunes of the British city at the end of the 20th century, Mr Gummer should get some credit.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Britons dream of country gardens. Their aspirations, unlike those of the continental bourgeoisie, lie outside the city. As long as the middle class has existed, it has been trying to leave the city; so when 19th-century urbanisation stopped, the cities' populations started dropping.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Because the well-off moved to the suburbs, the cities had no powerful lobby to stop the planners doing their worst. Over the past 50 years, this is precisely what they did. Aside from London, whose spots of villagey organic charm have mostly been preserved, Britain's cities have been brutally treated. In Manchester, Liverpool, Birmingham, planners ripped out the old city centres and dense streets, and redesigned them with two ideas in mind: the car and the zone.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Cars were given primacy, so radial dual-carriageways blasted away long-established neighbourhoods. And homes, factories, offices and shops were to be kept apart, so small shopping streets next to residential streets were destroyed in favour of lumping most retailers together in shopping malls, and offices and workshops in business parks.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It did not work. And the worse the cities got, the keener the middle classes were to move. So the cities' cores were left to those who could not afford to go anywhere else.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Recently, however, the drain of people from the cities seems to have stopped. According to Bob Armitage of the Office for National Statistics (<font size=-1>ONS</font>), "there are clear signs that the population of inner London is beginning to increase again." The <font size=-1>ONS</font> forecasts that six inner London boroughs will be among the 11 fastest-growing local-authority areas in the country in the period 1993-2001, with Newham, the fastest-growing, gaining 9.5% more inhabitants and Kensington &amp; Chelsea, the slowest, increasing by 7.1%.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"We're expecting the same to happen in the other metropolitan areas," says Mr Armitage. The main reason for the flow of people back to the inner cities, he reckons, is their redevelopment. The government has brought this about largely by pouring money into slums like Hulme in Manchester or old industrial wastelands like Docklands in London, where smart new estates welcome families and refurbished warehouses offer Manhattan-style lofts to young professionals.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Social trends may have something to do with it, too: the increase in single parents, for whom sociable city life is more attractive than isolation in the countryside; job insecurity, which makes people feel they need to be close to a big labour market; perhaps even the mass coming-out of gays, who openly colonise areas such as Canal Street in Manchester.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the same time, there seems to be a rebirth of civic consciousness. A Manchester Civic Society was established earlier this year to lobby for the city's welfare. In London, an organisation called Vision for London, sponsored by local government and business, has been orchestrating discussion on how to improve the city. The Architectural Foundation and the <i>Evening Standard</i> newspaper are together running a summer-long series of lectures on "London in the 21st Century" with such luminaries as Tony Blair, Labour's leader, and Lord Gowrie, the Arts Council chairman, as speakers. Audiences have exceeded 1,000. Liam O'Connor, architectural adviser to Mr Gummer, says "I have never known a time when there have been so many amenity groups taking an interest in the height of buildings and public spaces."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Behind much of the burgeoning activity is a set of ideas called "new urbanism", which originated in America and was brought to Britain by people like Rob and Leon Krier, American architects whose Seaside development in Florida has influenced many. According to Alan Baxter, an engineer in the forefront of the movement, who is currently working on the redevelopment of the site of the hideous Department of the Environment offices in Westminster, "there's a wave of new thinking going through planning 15 years after something similar went through architecture."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;New urbanism sees cities as organisms whose many parts work together to keep the whole alive; thus, it rejects the zoning that underpins existing planning regimes. Cities come alive, it believes, in places like Notting Hill Gate, in London, where people can work, live and play. It believes in dense terraces, not isolated blocks on wide open spaces; it approves of interlinked streets, not cul-de-sacs. It demands that buildings be seen in context, not as separate structures that happen to be next to each other. It upholds the unity of the European-style city that survives in Britain in places such as Bath; it decries the American, car-dominated sprawl that influenced British planners in the 1960s. The model is Siena; its antithesis, Los Angeles.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;New urbanism insists that beauty, which has been low on planners' agendas for much of the 20th century, matters as much as function. It wants the disciplines of planning, architecture and engineering, which have grown apart, to start working together, so that road engineers think about what effects they have on pedestrians, not just on traffic flows, and architects think about what will go on in the street as well as inside their buildings.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These ideas were first promoted in Britain by the Urban Design Group, which was set up in the early 1980s, bringing together around 1,000 architects, planners and engineers determined to put right the wrong that had been done to cities. This movement is at last beginning to have an impact. Local-government officials, who have seen the disaster brought upon the cities by the old ideology, are coming on board. And, most important, Mr Gummer, who has been in a position to change the planning system, has been enthusiastic.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;New urbanism is filtering into the development process partly through special projects like Hulme in Manchester. There, the deeply disgruntled locals were consulted about what they wanted, and much of what they said (dense housing, shops, lots of street-level activity, no wide open spaces, enclosed gardens) accorded with the new ideas. The planning guide for Hulme was then written by a former student from Manchester University's architecture and planning department who espoused "new urbanism"; and it is reckoned to have been so successful that it has been adopted for the whole city.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The redevelopment of the Department of the Environment site, similarly, will push the new approach. It is high time that penance was done for that piece of official vandalism, which killed off city life in a slice of Westminster. Once the buildings themselves have been vaporised, it will be returned to mixed use in the hope of bringing the streets back to life.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Gummer's changes to the planning regime, the most recent of which he announced last month, are also intended to push cities in this direction. Councils will be told to consider the city as a whole when making planning decisions, instead of proceeding case by case. They will be expected to favour mixed-use developments, rather than shopping centres, or housing estates, or business parks. Planners will be required to look at buildings in their context, so that they should be in harmony with their surroundings. And aesthetics will take a more prominent place than under the old, functional regime.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Planners, too, are changing. Many realise the damage that has been done to cities, and see that things now need to be done differently. According to Michael Hebbert, professor of town planning at Manchester University, "planning schools have been training people to do social science and administration. Now there's a stronger design element coming in to planning." All over the country, urban-design courses are springing up at universities as local authorities try to recruit a different kind of person to their planning departments.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As these ideas start having an impact, so Britain's cities should become more welcoming, and more people should want to live in them again. However, there are matters still to be resolved. One concerns out-of-town shopping centres, which drain activity away from the centres of towns. Although Mr Gummer has restrained that sort of development, it is still happening. A huge development called Dumplington is scheduled to go ahead outside Manchester, for instance; it will reduce the chances of bringing the city centre, bombed by the <font size=-1>IRA</font> last month, back to life.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Secondly, planning regulations are still not geared to the small-scale economic activity that mixed-use development implies. They are used to dealing with big proposals, not the patchwork of small-scale start-ups that is needed. If councils cannot get their officials working for, rather than against, little businesses, then Mr Gummer's ambitions will be frustrated.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The third problem is the car. "The crux of these ideas," says Mr Hebbert, "is the private car. European cities are cohesive, American ones individualistic. Public transport links bits of a city for pedestrians, while roads slice it up. You can't revive the cities and bow to the dominance of the car." Even given the new plans for the centre of London, Britain is well behind Europe in pedestrianising parts of its cities. Eventually, though, it will have to catch up.

<h1>Victory for Nelson</h1>
<p>THE government is at last thinking of pedestrianising two of the most public of London's public places, Trafalgar and Parliament Squares. At a recent meeting John Gummer, who is the minister for London as well as environment secretary, Sir George Young, the transport minister, Steven Norris, one of his junior ministers, Jocelyn Stevens, chairman of English Heritage and officials from Westminster Council, agreed that a feasibility study should be commissioned. That will probably start in November, and take around a year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The idea--since it is an obvious one--has been mooted many times before. However, according to Paul Drury of English Heritage, all previous studies have assumed that a scheme would have to be able to deal with the existing traffic flow. None of them, therefore, has worked. The big change is that politicians and local officials now seem ready to see drivers suffer a little.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The two squares will probably not be pedestrianised altogether. Cars will still be allowed through on one or two sides to minimise the effect on the traffic flow. But enough will be closed off so that they cease to be massive roundabouts and return to their former state: piazza-style places for people to relax, parade and meet. The scheme will also reclaim for the public Horseguards' Parade, one of the most beautiful pieces of urban space in Europe, which is currently used as a car park by the Ministry of Defence and the Foreign Office.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;London has lagged a long way behind most European capitals in removing traffic from the most beautiful bits of its centre. "Democracy is different here," explains Malcolm Murray-Clark, Westminster's assistant transport director. "We don't have mayors to push through schemes like this." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nevertheless, Westminster Council is trying, at last, to stand up for feet. Last year, it pedestrianised the area in front of Buckingham Palace, where an average of 20 accidents a week were taking place as motorists collided with tourists. There was a furore from drivers, and a barrage of hostile questions in the House of Commons. But fewer tourists now get run over, and the muttering has died down. After that victory, the council is moving on to greater things.

<p><b>Parliamentary pay</b></p>
<h1>Poor politicians</h1>


NOTHING is more certain to provoke hostile tabloid headlines than politicians voting themselves a juicy pay rise. Britain's politicians are already widely portrayed as a sleazy bunch of self-servers who milk their public office for all they can get. Yet, it seems, the Senior Salaries Review Board, which advises the government on the remuneration of judges, military top brass, senior civil servants and <font size=-1>MP</font>s, has recommended a 26% pay rise for ordinary backbenchers, a 49% rise for cabinet ministers, and a thumping 70% increase for the prime minister. If this is agreed by <font size=-1>MP</font>s (not a certainty), it would take effect in July 1997.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The proposed pay rise is not quite as generous as it seems. The review board wants to slash the generous mileage allowances <font size=-1>MP</font>s get for car travel to and from their constituencies. But, in any case, there is a strong case for paying British politicians more. Since 1979, ordinary <font size=-1>MP</font>s have seen their pay rise by 34% in real terms. However, the real average earnings of the whole workforce have risen by 45%. The money the prime minister receives on top of his basic parliamentary salary is actually worth 1% less in real terms than it was in 1979. As the chart shows, John Major and his predecessor Margaret (now Lady) Thatcher have shown admirable restraint.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Restoring pay ratios to their 1979 levels would mean raising backbenchers' pay to &#163;36,812 a year (compared with the &#163;34,085 they get now) and the prime minster's to &#163;85,695 (from &#163;58,557). The rises now proposed are bigger, giving backbenchers &#163;43,000 and the prime minister &#163;143,000. This is probably justified, assuming it is desirable to attract high quality people into Parliament and to give them as little reason as possible to do well-paid work on the side. Idealists may argue that public service should not be the product of market forces. Realists point out that pay for top jobs has risen much faster than average earnings, and that <font size=-1>MP</font>s have missed out entirely. To restore the 1979 ratio of the prime minister's pay to that of the highest-paid director of British Gas, Mr Major would need to earn &#163;373,500 (see <a href="br1.gif">chart</a>). And who could deny he deserves it?

<p><b>London Underground</b></p>
<h1>New destination?</h1>

<p>TO THE average passenger on London's underground railway, privatisation probably conjures up images of huge salaries for fat-cat bosses, instant profits to share-buying punters and (less justifiably) low quality and high prices. Many passengers would not regard privatisation as the obvious way to bring an end to the strikes--now as regular a part of the summer season as tennis at Wimbledon--that on June 27th and July 3rd severely disrupted services (with more disruption promised). Yet selling the Tube is the answer.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although privatisation has had many different goals, from boosting government finances to widening share-ownership, it was first proposed by the Tories as a way to curb the power of public-sector trade unions. Public ownership gave unions more clout in pay negotiations because they knew that nationalised industries, with the government's resources behind them, would not go bust even if they lost a fortune as a result of strikes. Privatisation, by allowing bankruptcy and reducing the chance of a state bailout, would concentrate workers' and managers' minds, argued the Tories.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;History has proved them right. Days lost to the economy from industrial action have fallen to barely 1% of the total in 1979, and, along with reforms to labour law, privatisation played a crucial part. Since being sold, notoriously strike-prone industries such as steel, coal and car making have barely experienced industrial action. Some of the businesses still subject to disputes are state-owned, including the Tube and the Post Office (also currently strike-affected and crying out to be sold). True, privatisation is no cure-all. But when strikes are threatened, as they are now at British Airways, disputes have mostly been settled fast, with the threat usually unexercised.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Stephen Glaister, an economist at the London School of Economics and a former board member of London Transport, London Underground's parent company, reckons that the best way to sell the Tube would be to auction franchises to run individual lines (Bakerloo, Jubilee, etc). Although the entire system could be sold as a single firm, incentives for greater efficiency would be greatest if each line were sold separately, enabling their performances to be compared. Managers currently have little incentive to provide a better service, says Mr Glaister. Running costs have crept higher on the Tube, whereas on London's buses, which are competitively tendered to private firms, real unit costs have been cut by half over the past ten years.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A sale would not be a money-spinner for the government. London Underground earns a profit but, as with the sale of British Rail, investors would want guaranteed finance for the extra investment (perhaps &#163;5 billion) that will be needed in the next few years. Sadly, without the incentive for the government of juicy sale proceeds, and given the public's deep dislike of privatisation, it seems unlikely that the Tube will be sold anytime soon. Expect strikes to remain part of the London summer.

<p><b>Mobile computing</b></p>
<h1>SuperPsionic</h1>

<p>GLORIOUS things of Psion are spoken by the businessmen who use its Series 3 electronic organisers. They effuse about the British company's miniature computers in much the same way that their predecessors raved about the product's paper precursor, the Filofax. Last year Psion sold 350,000 of the machines, which pack diary, address book and other computer tools for the slim-fingered into a plastic shell a little larger than a spectacles case. That is about a third of total world sales of such "palmtop" computers--more than either Sharp Electronics or Hewlett-Packard account for.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Psion's net profits rose 77% last year to &#163;7.5m ($11.8m) on sales of &#163;90.5m, 48% up on 1994. Its market capitalisation has trebled in the past year to &#163;304m. Dataquest, a consultancy, expects the market for palmtop computers to grow to 6m a year by 2000. So what is this rare paragon of British high technology doing sniffing around Amstrad? The latter, a shop-worn consumer-electronics firm, has been sputtering downwards since a burst of glory in the mid-1980s when it sold Britain's first cheap <font size=-1>IBM</font>-compatible <font size=-1>PC</font>s. Yet Psion's chairman, David Potter, seems close to paying around &#163;230m for the company.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Amstrad, which made a net loss of &#163;4.6m on sales of &#163;162m in the last six months of 1995, has three main divisions. Amstrad Consumer Electronics (<font size=-1>ACE</font>), the rump of the 1980s company, is a grab-bag of television, cheap hi-fi and video businesses that loses money. Viglen is a profitable direct-sales <font size=-1>PC</font>-manufacturer. And Dancall is a mobile-phone business. From Psion's point of view, <font size=-1>ACE</font> is useless and Viglen is pretty irrelevant. But Dancall has exactly what Mr Potter is after.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dancall was one of the first companies to use the Global System for Mobiles (<font size=-1>GSM</font>), a European communications standard, in its digital mobile phones, of which it now sells 70,000 a month. Psion is convinced that it needs digital-communication technology if it is to keep abreast of the way palmtop computing is developing, towards machines (which have started to appear) that are as much communications devices as organisers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Series 3 is now five years old: despite its popularity, it no longer has a clear design or technological advantage over rivals with richer parents. The new generation of palmtops will have to do more than work well alone; they will have to bind their owners into the Internet, and share information with computers at work and at home. Many companies, including Psion, think that the ambitious businessman will want his two favourite tools, palmtop and mobile telephone, in one package.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Is this true? On balance, the marriage of the palmtop and the telephone does indeed look inevitable, but it may have a rocky start. A combined phone-palmtop will be much bigger and heavier than the palmtop, much of whose value stems from its portability. One doubter, Kimball Brown, an analyst at Dataquest, cites BellSouth's unsuccessful Simon, a phone-organiser that flopped last year, as an example of the folly of doubling up.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, the main reason why Simon failed was because it did not work well, rather than because the concept was a dud. Nokia's version of a palmtop-telephone, released in March, has received warm reviews--despite a price of $1,100.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even if Psion is right to aim for a palmtop-phone combination, does it really need to buy a whole phone company (let alone a big, famously complicated consumer-products group)? Psion argues that any combined palmtop-communicator will need to integrate computing and telephone technologies so thoroughly that its developers need access to both. Designers, it says, will have to focus on minia-turisation and power management from the start in order to produce a device that, like the Series 3, is small but does not run out of zip within minutes of leaving home.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This explanation is not entirely convincing. Hewlett-Packard has collaborated with Nokia, a Finnish phone maker, to produce its OmniGo palmtop-cum-telephone. Would not a temporary partnership with another <font size=-1>GSM</font> company--for instance Ericsson, a Swedish mobile-telephone maker--work just as well for Psion?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, Psion has got where it is by marching steadily and doing a relatively simple thing extremely well. It has let others--notably Apple with its ill-fated Newton--show off, and then fail. Perhaps it was inevitable that, one day, Psion would have to make a bold takeover of one sort or another. All the same, Amstrad seems to be an unnecessarily tough test, even for the redoubtable Mr Potter.

<p>IN LATE 1994, a smouldering dispute in the computer industry erupted in a public confrontation between Eckhard Pfeiffer, boss of Compaq, the largest <font size=-1>PC</font> maker, and Andy Grove, who runs Intel, which makes most of the processor chips at the heart of <font size=-1>PC</font>s. The clash was over Intel's increasing encroachment into the <font size=-1>PC</font> maker's market. Not only was the semiconductor giant promoting its own name and technology ("Intel inside") over those of its partners. It had also begun to sell not just processor chips, but complete "motherboards"--the electronic guts (and most of the value) of a <font size=-1>PC</font>--and even fully assembled machines, ready to be resold under others' brands.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This was not just a feud between Intel and Compaq. The dispute was mirrored across the computer industry. The more of the <font size=-1>PC</font> market--and profit--Intel took, the less was left for the companies that still designed and made their own <font size=-1>PC</font>s. Motherboards were one of the last areas in which a company could still make a mark, and justify higher prices, with its own technology. Now Intel was threatening to take that away, reducing even the biggest <font size=-1>PC</font> makers to little more than assemblers and distributors of other companies' parts.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By mid-1995 Compaq was one of the few big <font size=-1>PC</font> makers that were still profitable, and the only one making money in the booming (but low-price) home market. Even harder hit were those companies, many of them relatively obscure Taiwanese contract manufacturers, that make motherboards themselves. Intel had economies of scale and market power that they could not hope to match; for them the worry was not just lower margins, but bankruptcy. Last year Intel was the market leader in motherboards, making between 10m and 15m of them, nearly a quarter of the industry's total. Analysts expected Intel to turn the screw this year, doubling its motherboard production to about 30m.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet, miraculously, the chip maker has backed off. Intel will probably make fewer motherboards than last year, even though the overall <font size=-1>PC</font> market will grow by a fifth. Even more surprisingly, rather than making most of the boards itself, Intel is licensing its technology to the same Taiwanese manufacturers (and others) it nearly killed by entering the market in the first place. Intel and Compaq are at peace again.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are two reasons for the shift in strategy. The first is that Intel seems to have achieved what it wanted from its motherboard invasion--which was to bolster its own core business of microprocessors. This required bullying the <font size=-1>PC</font> industry, but not destroying it. After all, <font size=-1>PC</font> makers are Intel's biggest customers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To stay ahead of its competition, Intel reckons it must release a new microprocessor generation (the 486 in 1989, the Pentium in 1993 and the Pentium Pro in 1995) every three years or so. Yet <font size=-1>PC</font> makers (and, for that matter, users) would rather stick to a slower cycle: they want to milk their investment in designs based on the previous generation as long as possible. It was in order to win this argument that Intel got into the motherboard business: if the big <font size=-1>PC</font>-makers would not rush out new designs to push Intel's latest chips, Intel would prime the pump itself by distributing its own designs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now, though, the pump is already primed. Thanks largely to its success in selling its own Pentium motherboards to <font size=-1>PC</font>-makers who could promote Pentium <font size=-1>PC</font>s in the marketplace, Intel is reaping the rewards of massive demand for the Pentium. At the same time, Intel has developed other chips that extend the power of the Pentium and do other essential jobs in the guts of a <font size=-1>PC</font>. The firm is increasingly selling the chips as a package, something its competitors--mainly Cyrix and <font size=-1>AMD</font>--cannot match. Cyrix and <font size=-1>AMD</font>, both profitable last year, expect to declare a loss in this quarter.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is why even the notoriously aggressive Mr Grove ("only the paranoid survive" ) decided to give up a share of the motherboard manufacturing market in order to focus more on the semiconductor business. It seems a safe bet: having tussled with Intel once already, the <font size=-1>PC</font> makers seem happy to promote Intel's next-generation chip, the Pentium Pro, on their own.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But there is a second reason for Intel to retreat from making its own motherboards. They were not much of an earner. Tom Thornhill, an analyst with Montgomery Securities, reckons that Intel was making 10% gross margins at best on motherboards, while its processors earn more than 60% returns. Since Intel started to make motherboards in 1993, its overall gross margins have dropped by 20% (see <a href="wb1.gif">chart</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Worse, the motherboard business cost it an estimated $100m at the end of last year, when it found itself forced to dump million of memory chips (which it bought at high prices from other companies to ship with its motherboards) after memory prices plummeted. If Intel can accomplish its market-moving aims by licensing its designs to Asian manufacturers, while passing on much of the risk of such price fluctuation at the same time, it is no wonder that even Mr Grove is willing to let some <font size=-1>PC</font> territories go unplundered.

<h1>A costly credibility</h1>
<p>IT NOW seems time to bury yet another piece of conventional wisdom in the computer industry: the idea that every big computer firm needs to be in the <font size=-1>PC</font> business. The latest victim of this delusion is Digital Equipment Corp (<font size=-1>DEC</font>)--a firm which until recently seemed to be recovering nicely from a very rocky patch.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On July 2nd Digital announced that it will lay off 7,000 workers (12% of its workforce) and take a $475m charge. The reason is mainly its <font size=-1>PC</font> losses (estimated at up to $90m in the most recent quarter alone). The day before, its top computer executive, Enrico Pesatori, resigned (see <a href="wb2.gif">chart</a>). <font size=-1>DEC</font>'s <font size=-1>PC</font> business has been in trouble for a long time. Earlier this year price competition forced it out of the home market. Now it is rejigging its business-<font size=-1>PC</font> division to focus more on "servers"--the powerful computers at the heart of networks--than on desktop <font size=-1>PC</font>s. Servers can bring in four times as much profit.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>DEC</font> is not, however, planning to leave the <font size=-1>PC</font> market altogether. In this, it is resisting a trend. In the past year France's Bull, America's <font size=-1>NCR</font> (recently spun off from <font size=-1>AT&T</font>) and Britain's <font size=-1>ICL</font> have all given up on <font size=-1>PC</font>s, having lost a small fortune between them. Each chose to concentrate on the more profitable markets of consulting, services and systems integration. Italy's Olivetti, which has lost more than $2 billion in the <font size=-1>PC</font> business so far, may soon do the same.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Until recently such companies argued that they had to make <font size=-1>PC</font>s in order to remain a force in the computer industry. This idea grew from two propositions. The first was that the <font size=-1>PC</font> market, which is growing by some 20% a year and passed 60m units last year, was one of the most attractive parts of their industry. The other was that making <font size=-1>PC</font>s created synergy across different lines of business.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Both propositions are now looking less robust. The <font size=-1>PC</font> business can indeed be attractive, but big computer firms tend to be generalists. About half of <font size=-1>DEC</font>'s revenues come from services, and much of the rest come from chips, software and other products of its own design. The winners in the <font size=-1>PC</font> business are increasingly specialists, such as Compaq, that drive down costs through economies of scale.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As for synergy, companies hoped that their systems-integration business would act as a sales channel for their <font size=-1>PC</font>s. But customers saw it differently: systems integrators who pushed their own computers appeared to have a conflict of interest.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>DEC</font> is trying to circumvent this conflict by positioning its systems-integration business as an independent broker, and claims some success. It also argues that its technical advantages in the demanding server business more than make up for its inefficiences. It is not the only venerable computer giant trying to fight it out in this market; <font size=-1>IBM</font>, <font size=-1>NEC</font>, and Fujitsu and Siemens Nixdorf are all still at it, with varying degrees of success (though most are losing money).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The most plausible explanation for this dogged obsession with <font size=-1>PC</font>s is psychological: the grand old men of the computer industry hate to think that they are not involved in the most inventive and competitive part of their business. They are also haunted by their history as makers of mainframe computers; they seem to think that making <font size=-1>PC</font>s gives them extra credibility. The question for <font size=-1>DEC</font> is how much money it is willing to lose to preserve that warm feeling.</td></tr></table>

<h1>From couch potato to cybersurfer</h1>
<p><b>A flaw of the Internet is that most home users lack a high-speed means of using it. A series of articles on competing solutions to this problem starts this week by looking at the efforts of the cable-TV companies</b></p>


<p>THERE is something about a computer modem, with its winking lights and noisy squeal of battle with the telephone line's 19th-century analogue technology, that deadens the souls of Internet surfers. With their screens frozen as pages from the World Wide Web trickle slowly down a telephone line, they dream of the day when home computers will be connected straight into the Internet through a fat digital pipe.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In America, cable-television companies, telephone companies and satellite and wireless firms are competing to provide that pipe. Three technologies contending to become the Internet's "on-ramp" of choice are "x<font size=-1>DSL</font>" digital phone lines, digital satellites, and wireless. This article looks at a fourth contender: the "cable modems" on offer from the <font size=-1>TV</font> companies.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Because all these solutions look technically sound so far, the battle is only partly technological. Much also depends on economics. In this respect, the cable-television companies start with two big advantages. In America, nearly two-thirds of homes are already subscribers (see <a href="st1.gif">chart</a>). And unlike telephone companies, which reach into homes via twisted copper wires, the <font size=-1>TV</font> companies deliver their signals on a coaxial cable capable of carrying 40 or so <font size=-1>TV</font> channels.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Like telephones, however, almost all cable networks are analogue. To unleash their digital potential requires a modem to convert the incoming analogue signal into digital data, and vice versa. And if it is to take advantage of the available capacity, this modem must carry data up to 1,000 times faster than the 33,000 bits per second (bps) of the best telephone modems.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More than a dozen companies have started producing cable modems (as these new devices are called) at a typical cost of between $300 and $500. Cable-<font size=-1>TV</font> companies are, naturally, wild about them. The leading cable suppliers--<font size=-1>TCI</font>, Comcast, Time-Warner and Cox--have already ordered 650,000 between them, and plan to start deploying them later this year. They see the prospect of big, badly needed revenues. Having taken on billions of dollars of debt to build their networks, they need new ways to milk their investment.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The trouble is that selling fast Internet access is not as simple as buying cable modems by the boatload. Cable networks were designed to broadcast signals to the home, not to carry data back the other way. Before they can handle two-way traffic, they must be upgraded.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is tricky. The networks are laid out, roughly, in the shape of a tree--with branches going to each home. For television, this works splendidly. Every customer receives the same signal, which is sent out along the trunk and then along the branches. But Internet users will be viewing different things at different times. And although coaxial cable can carry enough Internet data for one house, or even a few hundred, it cannot serve the needs of a whole city. To prevent the trunks of the tree becoming hopelessly crowded, coaxial cable must be replaced with something more capacious.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That something is optical fibre. As it happens, most cable companies have already been upgrading their main trunks to fibre, both because it is more reliable and because it lets them offer more channels. In the affluent areas where firms plan to offer Internet services first, virtually all of the networks are already a hybrid of fibre and coaxial cable.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To complete the upgrade, firms need to add switching and routing equipment to direct the correct information to each house, to "tighten" the network with filters to cut noise, and to extend the main branches in order to cut the number of customers each must support.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If offering Internet access over cable were no more difficult than this, most companies would be doing it already. But the few that have tried have run into technical troubles with noise. Again, the problem is the tree-and-branch structure.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Each branch to an individual home introduces a bit of noise, despite the coaxial cable and filter. Because the branches are separate, none of the cable modems in each home can hear the noise from the others. But the trunk hears the noise from them all. So, while "downstream" data (from the Internet to the home) can travel at top speed, "upstream" data must fight the noise of the entire system.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This thwarted the first generation of cable modems. Designed to operate at 10m bps, they could barely manage a few hundred. The latest versions, however, can identify a noisy frequency on the line and avoid it, or simply re-send data that have been disrupted. Sending data upstream is still a problem, but most networks should soon be able to handle 2m bps of it. Since home users usually generate little more than a bit of e-mail and a few data requests, that should probably be plenty.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet the tree-and-branch structure has another disadvantage: the trunk's capacity gets spread between its branches. Most cable networks have neighbourhood hubs that serve an average of about 300 customers. Such a hub may be able to deliver data at 10m-20m bps, but that must be shared by all its users.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Simulations by CableLabs, the industry's research consortium, suggest that customers would start to feel the drop in capacity when they had to share it with about 100 others. The cable companies' answer to this is that by the time they sign up that many subscribers in any neighbourhood, they will be earning enough to add another cable to the node, thus doubling the capacity available.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The remaining objections to the cable companies' Internet ambitions are not technical. They are that these firms are notorious for unreliable television service, know little about managing interactive networks, and have none of the telephone companies' experience in billing customers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Fortunately for prospective customers, however, someone else will be doing most of these jobs. A firm called @Home, co-owned by three of America's biggest cable operators, is setting up a national "backbone" network to connect many of the largest regional cable networks to the Internet, and will handle most of the network-management and billing problems.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Altogether, the infrastructure needed to bring a cable company into the Internet business will cost it about $500-700 a customer. Of the $40-50 a month they hope to charge for the service (including the lease of the cable modem and some Internet content), they might keep $10 at best. On its own, this might not look like much of a lure. But the same network upgrades will allow the cable firms to offer telephony, plus 150 or more channels of digital television.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With America's local telephone market newly opened to competition, long-distance telephone companies are keen to join up with the cable firms to challenge local telephone companies. No wonder the locals rubbish cable's Internet chances. Their own chances will be the subject of next week's brief.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?836607600,iss">Search</a>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<p align=center><img src="http://www.economist.com/econlogosmall.gif" width=78 height=39  alt="The Economist"></p>

<h1><center>A solution for AIDS?</center></h1>

MERCUTIO'S horrific curse on the warring family clans of Romeo and Juliet--" A plague on both your houses"--carries little terror for today's audiences. In Elizabethan England, the threat of plague was ever present. In the world's rich, developed countries it is now but a distant memory. It has been abolished by better nutrition and sanitation, and the relentless assault of the antibiotics and vaccines developed by modern scientific medicine.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With one exception. For the past 15 years <font size=-1>AIDS</font>--acquired immunodeficiency syndrome--has been stalking the auditorium. So far <font size=-1>HIV</font>, the virus that causes the disease, is reckoned to have destroyed the immune systems of 7m people across the world. Of those, 4.5m have already died--succumbing to "opportunistic" infections, such as tuberculosis, that a healthy immune system would have fought off. Almost another 19m people harbour the virus without having, as yet, developed the symptoms of <font size=-1>AIDS</font>. And, if the United Nations is to be believed, another 11m-14m people will pick up the virus by 2000.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Until recently, science has looked helpless against this disease. But there has lately come a glimmer of hope. A series of clinical trials of a new multiple-drug therapy (see <a href="st1.html">page</a>) suggests that an effective treatment for <font size=-1>AIDS</font> may be near at hand. By putting a new type of drug, known as a protease blocker, into a molecular cocktail with more familiar medicines such as <font size=-1>AZT</font>, <font size=-1>AIDS</font> researchers have devised a mixture that can suppress the virus far more effectively than before, and to which, they hope, it cannot evolve resistance.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The scientists are not yet talking of a cure. It is too early to be sure whether the treatment will work indefinitely if it is maintained, let alone whether patients will continue to be well if it is withdrawn. But that one word--"well"--is what distinguishes this approach from previous attempts to deal with <font size=-1>HIV</font>. People on the new regime of treatment, even some who were probably close to dying, are now recovering the appearance and feeling of health.
</p><p><b>The cloud behind the silver lining</b>
<br>If it is confirmed by longer and larger clinical trials, this will rightly be hailed as a scientific triumph. For researchers to have unravelled the mysteries of a novel, lethal infectious disease within a decade and a half, and to have produced a treatment, would be a remarkable feat. The tragedy is that such a victory would not, in itself, mark the the conquest of <font size=-1>AIDS</font>. Indeed, for most of the 21m or so people carrying <font size=-1>HIV</font>, the hope the treatment brings is likely to be the hope of Tantalus: ever present, but out of reach. And that is going to confront the world with a painful moral dilemma.
The reason is price. A year's course of the new therapy is expected to cost over $10,000<b>, </b>and nine out of ten people who contract <font size=-1>AIDS</font> live in countries where $10,000 a year exceeds by many times the <font size=-1>GDP</font> per head. The medicine's price will no doubt fall as manufacturing technology improves and economies of scale come into play. Competition between drug companies, and new products, should also drive prices lower (three protease blockers have already been approved by America's Food and Drug Administration, and another four are undergoing trials). But this sort of drug therapy is unlikely ever to be cheap.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As a result, the rejoicing that will accompany any confirmation that the new therapy really does "work" is pretty plainly going to be followed at once by the same mixture of fear, anger and guilt that has become familiar to people who have followed the progress of this cruel epidemic from the start. Can the rich world stomach the spectacle of its own <font size=-1>AIDS</font> victims receiving effective treatment while their poorer foreign brethren are left without hope? And what of the drug companies? They will rightly seek to profit from the huge investment they have made in <font size=-1>AIDS</font> research, even if this entails setting a price that is higher than most victims will be able to afford. It is safe to assume that there will once again be an outcry against the "excessive" profits of the drugs industry as a whole, just as there was when Britain's Wellcome brought its <font size=-1>AZT</font> treatment to market just over a decade ago.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To accusations of callousness, the drugs industry will trot out its usual defence, namely that without the chance of turning a profit, it would not be able to invest in research for new medicines. When measured against the suffering of people infected with a lethal disease, this point sounds abstract, even callous. The difficulty is that it is true. Governments can do a few things to help make drugs more affordable--for example by ensuring that competition in the industry is as open as possible--but a mindless attack on the industry's profit incentive is a prescription for fewer new medicines in future.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Does it then follow that the rich must save themselves and leave the poor to their fate? In theory, if their conscience so dictated, the rich countries could help the poor without damaging the incentives of the drug companies at all. They could simply ship the necessary drugs to sick people in the poor world as part of their overall foreign aid effort. But a glance at the arithmetic--$10,000 multiplied by 20m--shows how unimaginable this really is. And it is anyway far from obvious that a massive transfer of resources from rich to poor should concentrate on this particular disease.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the tropics, for example, malaria is by far a bigger killer. In 1990, about $1 billion was spent by governments on <font size=-1>AIDS</font> research (most of it by America, whose National Institutes for Health will, this year alone, spend almost $1.5 billion). Yet on malaria only $60m was spent although, in terms of the disability and premature death that malaria causes, it was then three times as devastating as <font size=-1>AIDS</font>. If saving lives is your aim, providing clean water should be a higher priority still.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The wretched upshot is this: that countries choose their priorities in medical research, as in just about everything else, on the basis of their selfish preoccupations. In the United States, powerful lobbying by gay people helped to mobilise a massive scientific campaign against <font size=-1>AIDS</font>, which may be about to bear fruit. That is wonderful news. Because of the prominence of this disease in their own countries, Americans and Europeans will feel a special appalled sympathy for Africans and others who will continue to succumb to it even after a cure has been discovered. Perhaps that will encourage a less parochial attitude to medical research in the future: <font size=-1>AIDS</font> has already changed many attitudes. But that hope seems pretty forlorn.

<h2>Explosions</h2>
<p>A huge <b>bomb</b>, carried in a petrol tanker, blew up a housing complex on the King Abdul Aziz air base in Saudi Arabia. Nineteen American servicemen were killed and more than 300 people, mainly Americans, Bangladeshi and Saudis, were wounded. Radical Islamists were suspected.
<p>Leaders of 21 <b>Arab countries</b>, in Cairo to plot their response to Israel's hardline new government, repeated the call of "land for peace". Binyamin Netanyahu accused them of dictating the terms for peace. Warren Christopher flew to the region to limit the damage.</p>
<p>Voting in critical local elections in South Africa's volatile <b>KwaZulu-Natal</b> province passed off relatively peacefully, but turn-out appeared to be low.</p>
<p><b>Burundi</b>, plagued by ethnic violence, asked for help from its neighbours for the first time, at a summit of six African heads of government in Tanzania. They discussed prospects for a regional peacekeeping force if the violence worsened. The <font size=-1>UN</font> High Commissioner for Refugees said it had raised barely a third of the $288m needed to help more than 1m refugees in the region this year.</p>
<p><b>Archbishop Desmond Tutu</b>, irrepressibly jovial campaigner for democracy in South Africa, retired as archbishop of Cape Town after ten years.</p>
<p>Talks in London between the Commonwealth and its suspended member, <b>Nigeria</b>, ended fruitlessly, but Nigeria staved off sanctions by agreeing to more talks.</p>
<h2>Yeltsin poised</h2>
<p>Boris Yeltsin looked well-placed to win re-election as president in a run-off on July 3rd, but <b>ructions within the Kremlin</b> continued to jangle nerves. After a spate of sackings, Mr Yeltsin fired seven top generals, probably at the insistence of his new ally, ex-general Alexander Lebed. But the parties behind fourth-placed Grigory Yavlinsky and a far-right nationalist, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, refused to endorse him.</p>
<p>Britain agreed at a <b>European Union</b> summit in Florence to end its policy of "non-co-operation" in <font size=-1>EU</font> business. The Union agreed to a phased end to the worldwide ban on the sale of British beef and its by-products.</p>
<p>Greece's most durable political leader since the second world war, <b>Andreas Papandreou</b>, died aged 77. He had been prime minister from 1981 to earlier this year, with a break in opposition in 1989-93, and remained leader of the Pan-Hellenic Socialist Party (Pasok), which he founded, until he died. Greece's current prime minister, Costas Simitis, strove to assert his authority at a party congress.</p>
Veronica Guerin, an Irish investigative journalist who persisted in reporting on <b>terrorism and drug gangs </b>despite being shot last year, was murdered in Dublin.</p>
<p>The Organisation for Security and Co-operation in Europe, which is to run elections in <b>Bosnia</b>, said they should be held on September 14th.</p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p><h2>Family life</h2>
<p>House and Senate Democrats unveiled a 21-point <b>"Families First Agenda" </b>tailored to middle-class voters. It aims to protect workers' pensions and offer tax breaks for education costs. The agenda suggested that the budget could be balanced without making deep cuts in Medicare or education, largely by cutting corporate subsidies and closing tax loopholes.</p>
<p>In a new book, "The Choice" , by Bob Woodward, <b>Hillary Clinton</b> was said to have consulted a spiritual adviser who encouraged her to have imaginary conversations with Eleanor Roosevelt and Mahatma Gandhi.</p>
<p>John Deutch, head of the <font size=-1>CIA</font>, announced plans to create a <b>cyberwar centre </b>at the National Security Agency to resist the threat posed by hackers to the government's computers.</p>
<p>The Supreme Court struck down a federal law limiting the money <b>political parties </b>can spend on the general-election campaigns of House and Senate candidates. The justices said it infringed the right to free speech.</p>
<p>Chile signed a free-trade agreement with<b> Mercosur</b>, the customs union between Brazil, Argentina, Uruguay and Paraguay.</p>
<p>Panama's president came clean, admitting that an audit had revealed that a little<b> drug money</b> had got into his party's election fund in 1994.</p>
<h2>Party tricks</h2>
<p>In a rare challenge to the authority of the <b>Indonesian government</b>, members of the opposition Democratic Party demonstrated in the streets of Jakarta. The government had upset the party by engineering a split which forced out Megawati Sukarnoputri as party leader. President Suharto is said to fear the growing support for Megawati, the daughter of Indonesia's first leader.</p>
<p>The new prime minister of <b>Bangladesh</b>, Sheikh Hasina, promised that her government would continue the previous administration's policy of privatisation and support for a market economy.</p>
<p>Four people were killed when police opened fire on a demonstration against new taxes in <b>Pakistan's budget</b>.</p>
<p>A stepsister and a son-in-law of <b>Deng Xiaoping </b>were retired from their government jobs, leading to speculation that the influence of China's paramount leader is waning.</p>
<p>China put off a planned visit by the German foreign minister, Klaus Kinkel, after the German parliament criticised <b>China's record</b> in Tibet.</p>

<h2>Private means</h2>
<p><b></B>(See <a href="wtw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>Privatisation revenues around the world dipped in 1995, but the urge to privatise is strengthening again. Top floaters in 1995 were Australia ($9.4 billion), Italy ($7.2 billion) and France ($5.7 billion). Germany this year will raise $16.9 billion, $10 billion of that by selling part of Deutsche Telekom, its telecoms monopoly. Outside the <font size=-1>OECD</font>, Eastern Europe raised $4.5 billion in 1995. Revenues in Latin America, which fell to $2 billion in 1995, are growing again.</p>
<p>One of America's food giants, <b>Nabisco</b>, is cutting 4,200 jobs from its 54,000-strong workforce around the world and taking a $428m pre-tax charge in the second quarter that will knock out most of its profits for the year. But Nabisco reckons the restructuring will save it $50m this year, $160m next and $200m annually after that.</p>
<p>Sweden's <b>Astra</b>, a pharmaceutics firm, fired Lars Bildman, the head of its American subsidiary, after investigating allegations that he had behaved "inappropriately" at company parties and had used company funds for holidays and home renovations. Mr Bildman denies the allegations.</p>
<p>The original $20 billion merger of equals between two of America's Baby Bell telephone companies has been restructured so that <b>Bell Atlantic </b>is now, in effect, buying <b>Nynex</b>. The change is being made to avoid the need for regulatory approval in each of 13 states, and in the District of Columbia, where approval looked slow in coming.</p>
<p><b>America Online</b>'s new president and chief operating officer quit after only four months. William Razzouk said he was reluctant to shift his family from Tennessee to Virginia. Steve Case, chairman and chief executive, takes over for the time being. Meanwhile, he faces an embarrassing investigation into the firm's billing practices. The firm's share price weakened.</p>
<p>Britain's <b>Alan Sugar</b>, a technology entrepreneur, could soon be devoting even more time to his football club, Tottenham Hotspur, if a &#163;234m ($361m) deal being considered by Psion to buy his Amstrad company comes about. Psion reckons Amstrad's digital-telephone unit (minus its tired computer business) would be useful for introducing communications technology into its hand-held computers. Amstrad's shares rose on the news, but Psion's fell.</p>
<p>Managers everywhere trembled as id Software, whose hit computer game,<b> Doom</b>, became 1994's favourite corporate time-waster, released the long-awaited sequel, <b>Quake</b>. The Internet sizzled as Doomaholics raced to download a free version.</p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>An upheaval in France's <b>hypermarkets</b> seemed likely after Auchan launched a FFr16.3 billion ($3.2 billion) takeover bid for a reluctant Docks de France, owners of Mammouth. After the signing of a recent law designed to limit the spread of hypermarkets, further consolidation seems the only way to grow. The combined firm would have sales of some FFr111 billion, still making it only the fifth biggest distribution group in France.</p>
<h2>Acquisitive</h2>
<p>Britain's biggest life-assurance company, <b>Prudential</b>, is planning a global &#163;1.5 billion ($2.3 billion) flotation of its Mercantile &amp; General reinsurance unit. Shedding capital-eating <font size=-1>M&G</font> and concentrating on its core activities of life assurance and retail banking should help to restore Prudential's flagging share price--and give it cash to buy a building society or another life assurer.</p>
<p><b>Morgan Stanley</b> is paying $745m for Van Kampen American Capital and assuming $430m of debt as the American investment bank further expands its asset-management activities. The acquisition will take its total assets under management to $157 billion, consolidating its number two position among Wall Street brokers, behind only Merrill Lynch.</p>
<p>Continuing repercussions from the <b>Sumitomo scandal</b>, in which a dealer ran up $1.8 billion in copper losses over ten years, dragged copper prices to 2.5-year lows on worries that Sumitomo was starting to shed some of its vast stocks of the metal. Sumitomo held its annual general meeting behind closed doors.</p>
<p><b>Banque Nationale de Paris </b>rejected a FFr4.25 billion ($822m) offer from <font size=-1>SBC</font> Warburg to buy its 84% stake in Companie d'Investissements de Paris, a holding company. Warburg was trying to make a point: its offer of FFr205 a share was in response to what it reckoned was the bank's low offer of FFr180 a share for Warburg's 3% holding in <font size=-1>CIP</font>.</p>
<h2>Striving</h2>
<p>(See <a href="wtw2.gif">chart</a>)<br>The Italian lira is testing the 1,000 level against the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark, its best showing in nearly two years. Gains have been strong since the election in April of a new prime minister, Romano Prodi, who wants the lira back in the European exchange-rate mechanism, and a central bank keen to have a strong lira in the fight against inflation.</p>
<p><p>Germany's economics ministry expressed doubts about an <b>upturn in the economy</b> this year when real <font size=-1>GDP</font> contracted by 0.5% in the first quarter after two quarters without any growth. Even so, some indicators were more positive, and inflation in the western half of the country slowed to 1.2% in June on a year-on-year basis.</p>

<h1>Russia's run-off ructions</h1>

<font size=1>MOSCOW</font>
<p>GIVEN the press of events elbowing their way into Russia's presidential election campaign in recent weeks, it would be rash to presume that no more will do so before the second round on July 3rd between Boris Yeltsin and his Communist challenger, Gennady Zyuganov. That said, Mr Yeltsin was looking well set for victory this week. The 15-point margin predicted by the opinion polls was open to doubt: the polls predicted a 12-point lead for Mr Yeltsin in the first round on June 16th, and in the event Mr Yeltsin beat Mr Zyuganov by a mere three points, taking 35% of the vote to Mr Zyuganov's 32%. But it has grown difficult to find anyone outside Mr Zyuganov's camp--indeed, anyone inside it--who genuinely expects Mr Yeltsin to lose.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Alexander Lebed, a former general who finished third in the first round with 15% of the vote, has been performing strongly in his first days as Mr Yeltsin's new security adviser and right-hand man. This week he was purging generals--seven so far--whose common fault was their closeness to the unpopular former defence minister, Pavel Grachev, ousted last week at Mr Lebed's insistence. Mr Lebed's arrival in the Kremlin has given Mr Yeltsin's ticket a fresh appeal to nationalist and law-and-order voters alike. He also published a "national security" blueprint proposing "strict control over foreign economic relations".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Yeltsin seems to have gained, too, from his sacking last week of three Kremlin hardliners caught out in a "dirty tricks" campaign against Anatoly Chubais, Mr Yeltsin's main campaign strategist. Mr Chubais, a liberal ex-minister who masterminded the privatisation of Russian industry, turned the tables by persuading Mr Yeltsin that the miscreants had become a danger to his re-election effort, and had to be sacked. Mr Lebed rallied to Mr Chubais's support. An opinion poll this week found that six out of ten respondents approved of Mr Yeltsin's action.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps the only serious worry left for Mr Yeltsin is that the public may have grown as tired as the candidates have visibly done of the whole election business. If voters stayed at home by the million on polling day, they would risk skewing the outcome towards Mr Zyuganov, whose supporters are reckoned to be more committed than Mr Yeltsin's.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Mr Zyuganov will need all the skewing he can get, to compensate for a campaign fast running out of steam. His main gambit for the second round has been to publish a wish-list of non-communist politicians to whom professedly he would, if elected, offer jobs in government. He has been humiliated horribly in return. Yuri Luzhkov, Moscow's mayor, and others on Mr Zyuganov's list declared themselves appalled by the use of their names.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Zyuganov may well have thrown away his last and best chance of upsetting Mr Yeltsin by failing to capitalise on last week's Kremlin sackings. The three victims were senior figures intimately linked with the president. Alexander Korzhakov was chief of the presidential guard, in charge of 17,000 men. Mikhail Barsukov was head of the federal security service, the main bit of the former <font size=-1>KGB</font>. Oleg Soskovets, a first deputy prime minister, was the third-ranking figure in the government hierarchy after the prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, and Mr Yeltsin himself. In the hands of a skilled propagandist--a commodity the Communist Party used to have in plenty--the whole affair could have been made to reek of slush funds, private armies and treachery. Throw in the sacking of Mr Grachev, and the attempted murder of a Kremlin business crony the previous week, and there was material to hand for a smear-job of Jackson Pollock proportions. Yet Mr Zyuganov made barely an effort. His few contradictory mutterings showed him to be as dazed by the affair as everybody else.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Zyuganov's hesitancy left Mr Yeltsin free to calm the stir--and he seemed to do it rather well. Mr Grachev and Mr Barsukov were reported to be resting this week at their dachas. Mr Korzhakov was thought likely to regain a less exalted position within the Kremlin. Doubtless Mr Soskovets was hoping for something, too. In an interview published on June 26th, Mr Yeltsin said he "owed a lot" to Mr Korzhakov, his bodyguard since 1985, and the two would remain friends.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No less importantly, there have even been hints that Mr Yeltsin has been having second thoughts about Mr Chubais, blaming him for having forced the issue. Mr Yeltsin said this week that he did not plan to give Mr Chubais another job in government after the election--something Mr Chubais had said earlier he did not in any event want. He had resigned as first deputy prime minister in January after Mr Yeltsin made him a scapegoat for the hardships of economic reform.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Yeltsin's equivocation towards Mr Korzhakov and Mr Chubais, champions of the hardline and liberal forces contending for influence in the Kremlin, suggests he has yet to decide what team he will want around him should he win re-election. In choosing it he will have to deal with the tension already visible between Mr Lebed, the new strongman, and Mr Chernomyrdin, the long-standing prime minister--whether by reining in Mr Lebed, when the votes are safely counted, or changing Mr Chernomyrdin. He will need to bring in a reformist--Grigory Yavlinsky, perhaps--at a high level of government if he is to build on the centre-liberal coalition that he has rallied behind his presidential campaign. He will need to pay due homage to the powerful Mr Luzhkov. He will need, too, to plan for his succession, given the precarious nature of his health. If Mr Lebed thinks the deal already done, good luck to him. He will need it, with Mr Korzhakov at his back.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?836002800,iss">Search</a>

<p><b>Education</b></p>
<h1>Selection rules</h1>

<p>"KNOCK, knock. <i>Who's there?</i> Harriet. <i>Harriet who?</i> See, I told you they'd forget." This joke did the rounds in the Labour Party earlier this year as it became clear that the party had suffered little electoral damage from the row which followed the revelation that Harriet Harman, the party's health spokeswoman, was planning to send her son to a selective grammar school. One of the aims of a government white paper on education, published on June 25th, was to try to reopen the split in Labour between those (including Tony Blair, its leader) who want to take a softer line on selection, and those who consider grammar schools the epitome of how British education caters to the better off or more able and fails the vast majority.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Gillian Shephard, the education and employment secretary, accused Labour of "living in the 1970s" in opposing the white paper's proposals to give schools more leeway to select pupils. David Blunkett, her Labour shadow, said she was proposing "selection for the few at the expense of the many". Although there is now a clear difference between the parties on this issue, the white paper falls far short of creating the "grammar school in every town" that John Major, the prime minister, says he wants. And the paper contains other sensible measures (such as giving schools more control over their budgets and encouraging more of them to develop a specialist flavour) which Labour strongly supports.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although Mrs Shephard admits to supporting the abolition of grammar schools in Norfolk when she sat on its county council in the early 1980s, she now argues that giving schools more leeway to choose at least a proportion of their pupils will be a good thing, for two reasons: first, it will be easier for head teachers to build a distinctive ethos for their schools, something which studies suggest makes them better. Second, it will encourage schools to compete for pupils, adding to the pressure on them to improve their performance.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The white paper proposes removing some obstacles to building new grammar schools, but promises no extra money to pay for this. The school-aged population is growing but there are 880,000 surplus school places in England alone, so in many areas the government could not open new schools without facing accusations of wasting taxpayers' money. It may also face embarrassment if a few head teachers use their new-found freedom to select pupils according to their personal prejudices.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another danger for the Conservatives in pushing for more selection is that many middle-class voters currently pay extra for a house in the catchment area of a good school, to make sure their children get in. In several cases, such as one in Surrey in January, plans to introduce selection have been scrapped after local parents protested that it would mean some places going to outsiders who passed the entrance exam.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, such selection by property prices is hard to defend. It would be better, as the white paper allows, for schools to adopt a wide variety of admissions policies, suited to their individual character and to local circumstances. It certainly makes sense, for example, for schools that specialise in technology to give preference to pupils who can demonstrate a flair for the subject. Many technology schools already do this, even using computer games to test pupils' aptitude.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Blair now promises, in spite of grumbles by some "Old Labour" colleagues, that the remaining 163 grammar schools will be left alone unless there is strong parental pressure to change them. A policy paper on schools, "Diversity and excellence", published last year, even hinted that Labour would let specialist schools take into account pupils' aptitude in their chosen specialism. The party should go further and banish its paranoia about selection altogether. There is no need for a wholesale return to the old "11-plus" exam with its two-tier system of grammar schools for those who pass and secondary moderns for the "failures". If Labour wants diversity and excellence, a wider variety of admissions policies would help to achieve both.

<p><b>The defence industry</b></p>
<h1>Buy British?</h1>

<p>IT IS a big moment for Britain's defence companies. The Ministry of Defence is about to award a clutch of contracts, worth some &#163;4 billion. The ministry's decisions on cruise missiles, anti-tank weapons, maritime patrol aircraft and amphibious assault vessels will cast some light on its policy towards the defence industry--a policy which has, for the past year, seemed murky.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That policy was fairly clear from the mid-1980s to the early 1990s: the overriding aim was value for money, the principal means was competitive tendering, and confrontation between defence companies and the ministry was normal. Then Roger Freeman, procurement minister in 1994 and 1995, shifted the stance so that the long-term future of the British defence industry and the need to promote pan-European restructuring counted for more. The Department of Trade and Industry became more involved in decisions, and the National Defence Industrial Council--a gathering of business chiefs and officials, chaired by the secretary of state for defence--was revived.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since James Arbuthnot became procurement minister a year ago, policy has appeared to lurch in all directions. The government bought American Apache attack helicopters, rather than the Franco-German Tiger. But then it decided to join the French and the Germans in developing a new multi-role armoured vehicle, and in creating an agency to manage such multinational projects. Crude nationalism came to the fore in January, when the government bought battlefield ambulances from Rover, although its procurement executive found that Austrian Steyr vehicles were more reliable and better value.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The broad thrust of Mr Arbuthnot's policy is probably similar to that of Mr Freeman, although he expresses it with masterful equivocation. Mr Arbuthnot has continued to involve the Department of Trade and Industry and has given the industrial council some real work to do, such as proposing rules for the new European armaments agency. "Where some see blur in procurement policy, we see pragmatism, which is fine," says a manager at British Aerospace, praising the government's new willingness to discuss issues with defence companies, and its lack of dogmatism.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His company feels chirpy: understandably so, given that it has a good chance of winning two big contracts. Seven firms are competing to supply the <font size=-1>RAF</font> with a cruise missile that its bombers will be able to launch several hundred miles from a target. The Hughes Air Hawk and the McDonnell Douglas Grand Slam are strong American contenders for this &#163;650m contract, while Taurus, from Germany's Daimler-Benz, is a low-cost option. But the favourite is Stormshadow from British Aerospace and France's Matra--if only because, if chosen, the French government would unblock a merger between the missile businesses of these two firms.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The two front-runners in the &#163;700m competition for anti-tank missiles, <font size=-1>GEC</font> and Hunting Engineering, are both British. And <font size=-1>GEC</font> is certain to win a &#163;600m contract for two amphibious vessels, through its newly acquired <font size=-1>VSEL</font> subsidiary. <font size=-1>GEC</font> would also supply the electronics for Lockheed Martin's Orion <font size=-1>2000</font>, a propeller-driven contender for the maritime patrol aircraft. However, British Aerospace, which is offering to refurbish old Nimrod jets with Boeing electronics, is expected to win that &#163;2 billion contract.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is likely that British firms will fare well in these competitions, and American firms poorly. That would not merely confirm the ministry's "pragmatic" policy and the proximity of a general election. It would also send a firm message to the Americans: if you want the British market to remain as open as it has been, lower your own protectionist barriers. American firms have had $6 billion of British armaments orders in the past 18 months, but the Pentagon has bought nothing of substance from Britain.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However these competitions go, British firms will continue to call for the government to do more to encourage European companies to restructure. Dick Evans, British Aerospace's chief executive, has asked the government to help reshape the industry through its procurement decisions, and to hold fewer competitive tenders.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Mr Arbuthnot maintains that "restructuring in Europe has to be driven by companies. It is up to them to seek the rationalisation that makes the best commercial sense." He frets that the absence of large cross-border mergers--and so of rationalisation--means that European industry is becoming uncompetitive. As he inelegantly puts it, "The companies have got to pull their finger out," adding, "but we can't say that this or that merger should go ahead."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some industrialists find that view disingenuous, given that the ministry buys 80% of what British defence firms make. While the industry and the government blame each other for the lack of pan-European restructuring, American defence firms are becoming more competitive by merging and cutting spare capacity--a task made easier by the fact that they have only one government to deal with.

<h1>Trading up</h1>


LABOUR reckons that changes to trade data due over the next few months are an "outrageous" attempt by the Tories to fiddle the numbers before a general election, "to create an illusion of success." At first glance, this claim seems fair. Figures out on June 27th showed that Britain had a trade deficit with countries outside the <font size=-1>EU</font> of &#163;800m in May, and of &#163;1.3 billion with the whole world in April (see <a href="br1.gif">chart</a>). With the changes in place, these numbers could be halved. They will, however, paint a truer picture of Britain's trade performance.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now, the headline trade figures refer only to "visible" trade--in manufactured goods and raw materials. As our chart shows, Britain has had a "visible" trade deficit in most years since 1970 (and, indeed, in most of the previous century and a half). But Britain's overall trading position during this time has been much healthier, thanks to "invisibles". These include trade in services, international transfers of money, and income from overseas assets. They have been in surplus in every year since 1970 (and, indeed, since the Napoleonic Wars), except 1990. As a result, Britain's current account (its net financial position with the rest of the world) was nowhere near as much in the red as the visible trade data suggested.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By the end of this year, the government will release a new measure, "trade in goods and services", combining visible trade and around 30% of invisibles. The term invisibles will be killed off. The new data will better reflect the current-account position. Although in deficit, this has shrunk in recent years to around 1% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>, less than in the United States and the same as in Germany. In the 1980s, the deficit caused alarm, though not in the government, by soaring to 4% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Michael Saunders, an economist at Salomon Brothers, an investment bank, points out that in the past three years British exports have climbed faster in response to rises in global demand than they did in previous decades. The responsiveness of imports to rising British domestic demand was unchanged.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This improved export competitiveness failed to show up in the current-account data because the British economy grew faster than did the economies of most of Britain's main trading partners. As growth in these economies picks up to British levels, exports to them should rise rapidly. In 1997, reckons Mr Saunders, the current account could be in the black for the first time since 1985.

<p><b>Public spending</b></p>
<h1>Initiative test</h1>

<p>LAUNCHED as a way to lure private money into public projects in 1992, the "Private Finance Initiative" (<font size=-1>PFI</font>) is proving a struggle for the government. Cheerful forecasts of the value of projects "about to be signed" have turned out to be hugely optimistic. Ask private-sector firms about the <font size=-1>PFI</font>, and if they have tried bidding under it they will usually complain. On June 26th the government mounted a fierce defence of the initiative against criticisms by an all-party committee of backbench <font size=-1>MP</font>s who worry that it might make the public sector's accounts more opaque than ever. A minister insisted that "the <font size=-1>PFI</font> is here to stay". As Labour is even keener than the Tories to get the private sector to pay for its ambitious plans, that is probably true. Whether it is desirable is another matter.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Certainly, the <font size=-1>PFI</font> does now seem to be gathering pace. The value of projects currently agreed exceeds &#163;5 billion. Contracts to design, build and operate prisons, roads and public buildings have been signed recently. The government believes it has finally laid to rest concerns about who will pick up the tab for hospitals built under the <font size=-1>PFI</font> if an <font size=-1>NHS</font> trust goes bankrupt. The answer is: the government will. Hospital deals are "imminent".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The initiative is also being seen, for the first time, as a serious money-making opportunity by big investors. This is reflected in the recent appointment of Alastair Ross Goobey to chair the Private Finance Panel, a Treasury-sponsored body established to promote <font size=-1>PFI</font> projects. Considered a safe pair of hands, Mr Ross Goobey runs Hermes, which manages the enormous pension-fund assets of <font size=-1>BT</font> and the Post Office. In January, Hermes established the &#163;50m Innisfree <font size=-1>PFI</font> Fund, with <font size=-1>AMP</font>, an Australian insurer. Since then, similar funds have been launched by <font size=-1>CIBC</font>, a Canadian bank, and, on June 24th, by Charterhouse, a London investment bank.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;According to David Metter, chief executive of the Innisfree fund, one of the biggest problems with the <font size=-1>PFI</font> so far is that the main bidders for projects have been construction firms, which are used to being paid for projects as they go along and thus do not need, or have, much capital. As a result, they have been reluctant to take on equity-type risk from the government, and contracts have tended to resemble hire-purchase deals with contractors competing primarily on construction costs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The new funds will provide the missing equity, which should ideally account for around 10% of the private finance invested in public projects, says Mr Metter. This would enable the private-sector to take on large amounts of the "volume risk" now mostly borne by the government--for instance, on how many cars will use a privately financed road. But if this is to happen, says Mr Metter, the government must become willing to structure the payments on <font size=-1>PFI</font> contracts to suit equity rather than debt, particularly by allowing "equity-style" (ie, big) profits when things go well.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The more <font size=-1>PFI</font> projects are undertaken, the greater the need for them to be effectively measured in the public sector's accounts. One of the biggest attractions of the <font size=-1>PFI</font> to politicians is that it allows projects to be bought now and paid for later. Traditionally they would have been paid for now and so added to current government spending and to the public-sector borrowing requirement (<font size=-1>PSBR</font>)--the measure that the financial markets regard as the best guide to whether the government is spending prudently. The Treasury argues that the <font size=-1>PFI</font> allows only projects that save money compared with using traditional public finance, and that involve a significant transfer of risk from the government to the public sector. <font size=-1>PSBR</font>-evading deals, in which the government in effect leases an asset from the private sector but continues to bear all the risk, are not allowed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The trouble is, as the House of Commons Treasury Committee pointed out in April, the public sector's accounts shed little light on whether the Treasury is sticking by its claims. On June 25th the Treasury responded by promising to include measures of additional spending commitments resulting from the <font size=-1>PFI</font> in its future three-year forecasts (though the main impact of many projects will be felt much further into the future).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the long term, it is possible that these worries will be eased by the planned adoption of "resource accounting" . This will create a public-sector balance sheet and thus (potentially) reduce the significance of the <font size=-1>PSBR</font> as financial markets will instead focus on overall changes in the government's assets and liabilities. As yet, however, it is far from certain that resource accounting will adequately reflect <font size=-1>PFI</font> commitments and so prevent politicians using the initiative to deceive voters about the true state of government finances. Suspicion of the <font size=-1>PFI</font> as a potential politicians' fiddle is still justified.

<p><b>Software</b></p>
<h1>The rabbit and the pick-up truck</h1>
<p><b>Once, it looked as though the Internet was Netscape's territory. Astonishingly, Microsoft has now caught up with its upstart competitor</b></p>

<p>LAST December, Bill Gates, Microsoft's boss, called analysts and journalists to his headquarters in Redmond, Washington, to confess the errors of his ways. The world's biggest software company had almost missed the most important event in the computer industry since the birth of the <font size=-1>PC</font>: the rise of the Internet. While Microsoft had snoozed, an upstart called Netscape Communications had created a massive new market in Internet-navigating "browser" software (see <a href="wb1.gif">chart</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Microsoft, Mr Gates insisted, could learn these new wired ways just as quickly as any young software pretender. This looked unlikely. After all, 15 years before, the computing industry's giants had said exactly the same thing about the <font size=-1>PC</font>--and then proceeded to fail miserably. Just as companies such as <font size=-1>IBM</font> had once been fixated by mainframe computers, so Microsoft seemed to be fixated on the <font size=-1>PC</font>. In a business as remorselessly Darwinian as this, it seemed only fitting that Microsoft should give way to a new breed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Netscape was set up in 1994 by Marc Andreessen, a 24-year-old with Gatesian qualities, and Jim Clark, a veteran of the computer industry. In a mere two years, it has distributed 38m copies of its browser, Navigator, making it the most successful software launch in computing history. Until recently, analysts reckoned Netscape had perhaps a year's lead over its competition--a long time in a market where cycles are said to be measured in "dog years", seven for one.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now, only six months later, Microsoft may have proved its point. On June 21st Microsoft released an arcane snippet of software that adds the ability to run a must-have Internet computer language called Java to Microsoft's own browser, Internet Explorer. With every company in the industry spewing out new Internet software once a week, this would not normally count for much. But the Java release is significant.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With Java, Microsoft's Internet Explorer now matches Netscape's Navigator virtually feature for feature. Navigator can do a few things (mostly those used only by the most demanding users) Explorer cannot; but the reverse is true, too. The important thing is that, from the average consumer's point of view, there is no longer any significant difference between the two. Just six months after Mr Gates's call to arms, Microsoft has caught up with Netscape's flagship product.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is more to the war between these two than the browser battle. Netscape still retains a lead over Microsoft in some other sorts of Internet software, particularly "servers" that run the big computers that store information for the Internet's World Wide Web. But the browser sits at the heart of Netscape's empire.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Netscape made its name by giving away Navigator, with the hope that its popularity would help it to sell lots of server software, which can make the most of the browser's features. The give-away strategy worked better than anyone dared hope (within months it had around 85% of the market), but sales of server software lagged. So Netscape changed tack: it now charges $50 for its browser, and browser sales make up 60% of its revenues.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now, that $50 is the principal difference between the browsers because Microsoft's Explorer is free; Microsoft is shipping it with most new <font size=-1>PC</font>s. Moreover, the two main commercial on-line services--America Online (see <a href="wb2.html">page</a>) and CompuServe--are preparing to distribute Explorer as their main browser. In recent months Microsoft's market share has crept from almost nothing to more than 7%, according to Dataquest, a consultancy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, Microsoft does not need to take much of the browser market from Netscape to do it harm. Netscape maintains its grip on the market by endlessly introducing innovations, which then become industry standards. Last year, for example, Netscape introduced a much-needed way to create tables of information on the Web. Because most users had Netscape browsers, owners of Web sites could be confident that, if they added tables, most readers would be able to read them. John Robb of Forrester Research, a Cambridge, Massachusetts consultancy, reckons that Web-site owners would be less co-operative if Microsoft were to gain more than about 20% of the market.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That prospect will become more likely as Microsoft incorporates browser functions into the next generation of its operating systems in the coming year or so. Mr Gates's ultimate aim is to eliminate the stand-alone browser market altogether--just as he has in effect destroyed the market for other once-independent programs, from utilities to simple fax software, that are now part of his operating system.

<p><b>Splat?
</b><br>
All this counts as a sizeable achievement for Mr Gates (who gushes about his Internet project as "the most fun six-month period I've had ever since the start of Microsoft"). Last year, many in the industry greeted his Internet promises with a sceptical "put up or shut up" . Microsoft has now emphatically put up. The next move is therefore Netscape's.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The smaller firm is not defenceless. Given a choice between similar products, many Netscape users will stay with what they know. Netscape's products tend to run on a greater variety of computers and operating systems, from the Macintosh to <font size=-1>UNIX</font> machines, than do Microsoft's, which tend to favour its own Windows 95 (although that comes with more than 70% of new computers). And there are still a few techie features, including a way for other companies to make their software work with Netscape's browser, that Microsoft has not yet matched.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Netscape will bolster these defences by releasing new software and standards later this year that will make Internet video, audio and other multimedia faster and more universal. And the next versions of its browser will come loaded with everything from an Internet telephone to collaboration software. But there are now some signs that users are rebelling against the rush of change--much of it only half thought through--in Internet software. About half of Netscape users are still using the first version of its browser, having declined to take either of the two subsequent versions.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Jim Barksdale, Netscape's homespun chief executive, likens his company's position to a rabbit, about to be run down by a speeding pick-up truck. Just when it is about it be squashed, it leaps over the nearest hedge instead. Netscape is indeed more nimble than Microsoft; but the truck has drawn much closer.

<h1>America Offline</h1>

<p>THE world's largest on-line information service, America Online (<font size=-1>AOL</font>), has often proved sceptics wrong. In 1991, when it first challenged CompuServe, then the market leader, it looked a lost cause. Thanks to better software, <font size=-1>AOL</font> overtook CompuServe last year. Then, when the Internet's World Wide Web took off in 1994, analysts reckoned <font size=-1>AOL</font> would be its first victim; instead, <font size=-1>AOL</font> added access to the Web to its offering and its subscriptions grew even faster. Now the critics are gathering again--and this time they could be right.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On June 25th <font size=-1>AOL</font>'s president and chief operating officer, William Razzouk, who had been in the job for just four months, resigned. A few days earlier, in an unconnected development, the Federal Trade Commission announced that it was investigating the company for unfair billing practices. And over the past two months, <font size=-1>AOL</font>'s share price has fallen by more than 40%--principally because <font size=-1>AOL</font> has had to cut its prices in the face of stiffer competition.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>AOL</font>, it now seems, delayed, rather than prevented, its clash with the Web. The Internet has always beaten on-line services, such as <font size=-1>AOL</font>, in terms of the diversity of content available, and on cost. <font size=-1>AOL</font>'s selling point has been that it is easy to use (its software is simple and it provides users with technical support and so on). Now Internet providers (which include the likes of <font size=-1>AT&T</font>, America's biggest telephone company) are starting to offer help lines; and Internet software is becoming ever simpler.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The result is that, in the United States, <font size=-1>AOL</font> is still growing phenomenally fast (and faster than direct rivals such as CompuServe), but slower than in its heyday (see <a href="wb2.gif">chart</a>). All but 185,000 of <font size=-1>AOL</font>'s 6m or so subscribers are in America. <font size=-1>AOL</font>'s quarterly growth rate in the United States peaked in the first quarter of 1995 at around 46%; for the same period this year it was 15.5%. Although <font size=-1>AOL</font> more than doubled its subscriber numbers to 4.5m in 1995, the Internet itself grew just as fast over the same period. Forrester Research, a consultancy in Cambridge, Massachusetts, predicts that <font size=-1>AOL</font> will reach 9m American subscribers in 1998--and then decline.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>AOL</font> claims that it is taking a brief rest from its frantic hunt for subscribers so that it can concentrate on launching an improved version of the service later this year. But it admits that the time when it could expect to double its total number of subscribers every years is over.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even if <font size=-1>AOL</font> has peaked, its decline will not be precipitous. <font size=-1>GNN</font>, its Internet-only service, will smoothe the ride. So will <font size=-1>AOL</font>'s foreign operations--it now has joint ventures in France, Germany and Britain, and will be launching in Japan this year. But potential users in these countries will have access to easy-to-use Internet software that was unavailable to their predecessors in the United States, so <font size=-1>AOL</font> is unlikely to see similar growth.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So far, when established companies, including Microsoft, have discovered that they are in competition with the Internet, they have either adapted their strategy, or lost.

<h1>Hope</h1>

<p><b>A new class of drugs has brought the possibility that AIDS may now be a treatable disease</b></p>

<p>BATTER hard enough at something and you may just break through. That is what many of the world's <font size=-1>AIDS</font> researchers now believe they have done. After spending billions of dollars and marching up numerous blind alleys, they have developed a treatment that appears, on the basis of preliminary trials, to be able to put patients into remission. This means that their bodies can keep the human immunodeficiency virus (<font size=-1>HIV</font>), the agent that causes the disease, at such low levels that it appears to do no harm.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unlike existing medicines for <font size=-1>AIDS</font>, the new treatment does not merely postpone death, it restores vitality. It may even, according to a few of its strongest partisans, be able to clear <font size=-1>HIV</font> completely out of a person's system, thus effecting a cure. It is known as triple-drug therapy and it relies on mixing the therapeutic advantages of older medicines, such as <font size=-1>AZT</font>, with those of new ones--called protease inhibitors--that attack a different part of the viral life-cycle.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The immune system, the organ assaulted by <font size=-1>HIV</font>, is one of the most complicated in the body. Unlike most organs, it is not confined to a single place--the infections it has to deal with can, after all, develop anywhere. Its cells (known as lymphocytes) grow and mature in bone marrow, and in a gland known as the thymus. They then spend their time commuting via the bloodstream between various depots, such as the lymph nodes, that are scattered around the body. This ubiquity makes the immune system easy to overlook. But it is a big organ. Its cells, collectively, weigh as much as the brain or the liver, and represent an enormous physiological investment.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such a huge mass of tissue is bound to attract parasites. Viruses, such as <font size=-1>HIV</font>, are the largest class of parasite around. Being little more than gift-wrapped genes, they are incapable of reproducing themselves without a serious amount of help. The help is provided (involuntarily) by cells in the body of the creature that the virus has invaded.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Viruses are usually specialists, and <font size=-1>HIV</font> specialises in a type of lymphocyte known as a helper <font size=-1>T</font>-cell. The role of helper <font size=-1>T</font>-cells is to encourage the front line of the body's defence system, such as the cells that make antibodies and the cells that help control bacterial and fungal infections, to respond. Take these defences away and the immune system collapses. Infectious diseases that the body would normally shrug off become lethal, and the patient has <font size=-1>AIDS</font>.
</p><p><b>The nine genes from hell</b>
<br>Viruses are tiny, which is one reason that they need so much help reproducing. They are composed of but a few hundred molecules. Most viruses are made of <font size=-1>DNA</font> (their genes) and protein. <font size=-1>HIV</font>, however, belongs to a rareish class known as the retroviruses. Instead of <font size=-1>DNA</font>, the genes of a retrovirus are made of its chemical cousin, <font size=-1>RNA</font>. <font size=-1>HIV</font>'s <font size=-1>RNA</font> carries nine genes--each the blueprint for one or more of the types of protein needed to make new viruses. These proteins are the chemicals that do the donkey work of getting the virus into a cell and then persuading that cell to manufacture new proteins (and new <font size=-1>RNA</font>) using the genetic blueprints on the old <font size=-1>RNA</font>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Anti-viral drugs, such as those in the newly developed cocktails, are designed to throw spanners into the reproductive works. The idea is to upset the viral production line while doing as little damage as possible to the patient. The more spanners that are thrown, the more successful the exercise is likely to be.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The old spanners, drugs such as <font size=-1>AZT</font>, delay death, but often not for long. They interfere with the defining peculiarity of retroviruses--which is that, in order to get a host cell to pay attention to them, they must copy their <font size=-1>RNA</font> into <font size=-1>DNA</font> (the usual currency in which genes are stored) and then smuggle it into the host cell's nucleus, where it can hide among the host genes and manipulate the cell's operations. Stop this "reverse transcription" (of <font size=-1>RNA</font> into <font size=-1>DNA</font>), and you stop the virus.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The new drugs, by contrast, clobber the virus after this, at the point where it sticks its nose out of its host's nucleus and gets the cell's machinery to start churning out new viral proteins. Yet both sorts of drug share the same underlying concept--they jam the function of a crucial enzyme. <font size=-1>AZT</font> and its kin work by jamming reverse transcriptase. This protein converts the <font size=-1>RNA</font> into <font size=-1>DNA</font> in preparation for its integration into the cell's nucleus by a second enzyme, integrase. The new drugs block the activity of <font size=-1>HIV</font> protease, a further enzyme which is needed to take the products of two of the largest viral genes (known as <i>gag</i> and <i>pol</i>) and break them up into useful proteins. The fragments this protease carves from the raw material that <i>gag</i> and <i>pol</i> provide include reverse transcriptase, integrase, and protease itself, as well as several of the proteins that form the "body" of the virus. No protease, then, means no infectious virus.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Blocking the action of <font size=-1>HIV</font>'s protease (and, indeed, of its reverse transcriptase) is done with geometry. All enzymes possess an active site within the folds of their atoms. This is where the chemical reaction that they assist (which usually involves either joining two things together, or breaking one thing apart) takes place. The active site is exquisitely tailored to accommodate the molecule or molecules that it is designed to operate on. An analogy often used is that of a lock that will accept only the correctly shaped key. But most locks will also accept a key that is not quite the right shape. Until, that is, the key is turned. Then they jam.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Protease blockers (like reverse transcriptase inhibitors) are the wrong-shaped keys. The three that have already received the blessing of America's Food and Drug Administration are saquinavir, which is produced under the trade name "Invirase", by Hoffman-La Roche; ritonavir ("Norvir"), manufactured by Abbott Laboratories; and indinavir ("Crixivan"), made by Merck. And at least four other compounds are currently undergoing tests.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The more potent of these protease blockers--ritonavir and indinavir--are about 100 times as effective at wrecking <font size=-1>HIV</font>'s reproduction as is <font size=-1>AZT</font>. This, however, is still not enough. The real trick is to combine them with reverse-transcriptase blockers.
</p><p><b>Darwinian molecules</b></b>
<br>The conceptual breakthrough that led to this idea was published early in 1995, by David Ho, of the Aaron Diamond <font size=-1>AIDS</font> Research Centre in New York, and George Shaw, of the University of Alabama at Birmingham, in a pair of papers that revolutionised people's views of <font size=-1>AIDS</font>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One of the puzzles of the disease was the long period that can elapse between someone's picking up the virus and their going on to develop the symptoms of the disease. The prevailing idea had been that, after an initial burst of activity, <font size=-1>HIV</font> became dormant. It hid somewhere in the body, often for years, and then, for some unknown reason, broke out. For this reason, <font size=-1>AZT</font> and its cousins (all of which have unpleasant side-effects) were reserved for use when symptoms actually appeared--which was part of the reason that they proved ineffective.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dr Ho and Dr Shaw demonstrated that this theory was wrong. By applying existing protease inhibitors, they showed that the virus continues to multiply throughout the latent period, but is kept in check by the immune system. This blocking task is enormous. As many as 10 billion virus particles may be generated in a carrier's body each day. This means that almost every conceivable mutation of the virus's nine genes is likely to occur roughly once a day. As the virus multiplies, these mutants undergo intense natural selection in their conflict with the host's immune system. Eventually, a strain arises that can beat it. The host's <font size=-1>T</font>-cells are killed faster than they can regenerate. And he develops <font size=-1>AIDS</font>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Enzyme-blocking drugs add an extra layer of defence. They compel the virus to find, through natural selection, some form that can beat the drug as well as the immune system. But the principle is the same. Sooner or later an enzyme will emerge that is the right shape to do its job, but the wrong shape for the drug to fit in and jam. The virus (or, at least, the strain of it carrying this modified enzyme) is now resistant to the drug.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Confronted with three drugs, working in two completely different ways, however, natural selection cannot cope. Most viruses evolve by one mutation at a time--it is not easy for them to exchange genes, as many living organisms do, by having any form of sex. To beat the multi-drug therapies, several beneficial (to the virus) mutations need to be present at the same time. Coincidences are possible; therapies that can be overcome by two or three simultaneous mutations might still be beaten. But the triple-drug therapies now on offer require somewhere between six and nine beneficial mutations to occur at the same time if they are to be beaten--a risk against which the odds are long, even when the body is producing 10 billion virus particles a day.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, the added beauty of triple-drug therapy is that the body very rapidly stops producing virus particles at this rate. Protease blockers, even when they are administered alone, can reduce the rate at which the virus is multiplying by as much as a hundred-fold. This rapidly lengthens the odds of parallel, beneficial, mutations arising. The rarer the virus, the less the chance of such a combination of mutations arising by chance.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And the rarer the virus, the longer the patient will live. Indeed, the best predictor of how long someone who has been infected with <font size=-1>HIV</font> will survive seems to be the amount of virus in his blood-stream. This can be measured, approximately, by counting the number of copies of viral <font size=-1>RNA</font> per millilitre of blood using a test such as the polymerase chain reaction (<font size=-1>PCR</font>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That virus levels are linked to lifespan may seem obvious, but until recently it was not. Doctors used to arrive at a patient's prognosis by counting his <font size=-1>T</font>-cells, on the not unreasonable assumption that it is a lack of <font size=-1>T</font>-cells that causes <font size=-1>AIDS</font>. But a long-term study published in March, by John Mellors and his team at the University of Pittsburgh, suggests that examining viral loads can predict lifespan up to ten years into the future, something that <font size=-1>T</font>-cell counts are much less capable of doing. Dr Mellors found that patients with fewer than 5,300 <font size=-1>RNA</font> strands per millilitre of blood in 1985 had a 38% chance of dying within a decade. Those with more than 37,000 per millilitre were exactly twice as likely to succumb. So measures that bring down the viral load might be expected to have a good chance of prolonging life.
</p><p><b>Three's company</b></b>
<br>This is just what triple-drug therapy does. The focused triple-drug trials that have been reported so far have been carried out on relatively small numbers of subjects (the drug companies' original trials of their protease blockers, though carried out on larger groups, did not concentrate on triple therapies). But the results are still impressive.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Roy Gulick, of New York University, supervised a study of 97 people who are being treated with indinavir, <font size=-1>AZT</font> and <font size=-1>3TC</font> (another reverse-transcriptase blocker). Although only the first six months' worth of data have been analysed (a full year's worth of figures will be released in July at the International Conference on <font size=-1>AIDS</font> in Vancouver), this work has already caused astonishment amongst <font size=-1>AIDS</font> researchers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many of the participants had advanced <font size=-1>AIDS</font>. Their <font size=-1>RNA</font> counts were over 40,000 copies per millilitre and their <font size=-1>T</font>-cell counts were falling. The treatment (which amounted to 20 pills a day) reduced the virus level in the bloodstream of 90% of them to a point where it could not be counted by <font size=-1>PCR</font>. Perhaps more important than that, the patients in this trial have become visibly better. They are putting on weight and shaking off the opportunistic diseases that batten on to sufferers from <font size=-1>AIDS</font> and eventually kill them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dr Ho and Martin Markowitz (also at the Aaron Diamond Centre) are conducting a triple-therapy trial in people at the other end of the <font size=-1>HIV</font> spectrum--those newly infected with the virus. So far, they have enrolled 18 people in their study--the first joined up ten months ago. These people take about three months to become clear of the virus when treated with indinavir or ritonavir along with <font size=-1>AZT</font> and <font size=-1>3TC</font>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Larger triple-drug trials are now in progress. The <font size=-1>AIDS</font> Clinical Trial Group, a government research programme based in Washington, <font size=-1>DC</font>, is supervising one that involves 1,750 people. And Hoffman-La Roche and Abbott are extending the idea of multiple-therapies by combining their two protease inhibitors in one of them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The drugs, of course, are not perfect. One of the main obstacles is that they are very expensive. They can take as many as 16 chemical steps to manufacture. Partly as a result, a year's course of triple-drug therapy is reckoned to cost something like $10,000-12,000. At this price it will be of precious little use to more than 90% of those people infected with the virus--the ones who live in poor countries.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are also questions over what is known as the "bioavailability" of one of the drugs--saquinavir. It is one thing for something to work in a test tube; quite another for it to be able to move from the stomach to infected <font size=-1>T</font>-cells, and still be active. Much of Merck's research effort was directed towards pulling off this trick. One of the reasons for Hoffman-La Roche's collaboration with Abbott is that saquinavir's activity is massively boosted in the presence of ritonavir. And a third caveat is that although the ability of the drugs to clear away the virus and restore everyday health is impressive, the actual increase in patients' <font size=-1>T</font>-cell counts is not, so far, that much better than that achieved with reverse-transcriptase inhibitors alone.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor is it clear whether a patient can ever stop taking the drugs and be pronounced properly better. Despite the billions that have been spent on studying it, many aspects of <font size=-1>AIDS</font> are still mysterious. <font size=-1>HIV</font> is able to effect its entry into <font size=-1>T</font>-cells because those lymphocytes, and no others, have a protein lock (known as <font size=-1>CD4</font>) that can be picked by yet another viral protein--gp120. But a few non-lymphocytes also sport <font size=-1>CD4</font>. Macrophages--which assist the immune system by eating bacteria--sometimes carry it. So do some brain cells. And macrophages and <font size=-1>T</font>-cells can make their way into the brain. This is a place where many drugs cannot follow them, due to a phenomenon known as the blood-brain barrier that serves to cushion the body's most vital organ from rude physiological shocks.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The brain, therefore, may serve as a reservoir of last resort for the virus. (Indeed, several researchers believe that the dementia suffered by some <font size=-1>AIDS</font> patients is nothing to do with the collapse of their immune systems, but is a direct effect of the virus on nerve cells). So the test of how well the protease-blocker-based triple-drug therapies can really do will come when some of those who appear to be free of the virus are taken off the drugs. Dr Ho and Dr Markowitz plan to offer this possibility to their patients when they have been on the treatment for a year (that is, within the next couple of months for the earliest recruits), provided that a detailed scrutiny of their lymph nodes shows those to be as virus-free as their blood is.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dr Ho and Dr Markowitz are optimistic. But their current subjects are people who were infected with the virus only recently, and their optimism extends only as far as those who start treatment within three months of acquiring their unwelcome viral passengers. Even that, though, would be a powerful sign. To suggest that <font size=-1>HIV</font> in any shape or form could be cleared from anyone would be a great leap forward. It is not a cure, not quite yet. But, for the first time since 1981, when a few inquisitive doctors noticed the outbreak of a strange and rare cancer in gay American men, there is hope.

<h1>The key to immunity?</h1>

<p>TO DO its damage, <font size=-1>HIV</font> must first get into the lymphocytes it damages. An important detail of how it does so has been clarified by a series of discoveries published over the past fortnight. These results also hint at the way in which the bodies of the lucky few who seem unable to catch <font size=-1>AIDS</font> are able to keep the virus out--in other words how the immune system might, itself, be able to remain immune from the attentions of <font size=-1>HIV</font>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It has been known for ten years that one molecular lock which <font size=-1>HIV</font> must open to get into <font size=-1>T</font>-cells is a protein called <font size=-1>CD4</font>. Having this protein distinguishes so-called "helper" <font size=-1>T</font>-cells, which act as cheer-leaders for other parts of the immune system, from "killer" <font size=-1>T</font>-cells, which destroy cells that are infected with viruses or bacteria (the equivalent protein in killer cells is called <font size=-1>CD8</font>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>CD4</font> is a form of molecular Velcro. It allows helper cells to attach themselves to other cells of the immune system in order to pass on their messages of encouragement. Unfortunately, it also allows <font size=-1>HIV</font> particles to enter helper cells themselves. It has also been known for some time, though, that <font size=-1>CD4</font> is not enough for <font size=-1>HIV</font> to gain access to a cell. At least one other lock must be turned.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One of these extra locks now appears to have been found. Three groups of researchers have published papers describing it over the past fortnight--Tatjana Drajic's team at Rockefeller University in New York, HongKui Deng's at New York University, and Philip Murphy's group at the National Institutes of Health, in Bethesda, Maryland. The new molecular lock rejoices in the name of <font size=-1>CC-CKR-5</font>. What is exciting is not merely its discovery, but its link with a group of messenger molecules known as chemokines. These are secreted by cells of the immune system in order to attract each other prior to the exchange of other chemical information.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Last year a group at the University of Maryland, led by Robert Gallo, found that three of the chemokines now shown to be involved with <font size=-1>CC-CKR-5</font> could suppress the activity of <font size=-1>HIV</font> in cell cultures. And in April of this year, William Paxton, also at Rockefeller University, found elevated levels of these chemokines in a group of homosexual men who are still <font size=-1>HIV</font> negative despite a history of risky sexual activity. The suggestion--for it is as yet no more than that--is that by binding to the <font size=-1>CC-CKR-5</font> receptor, these chemokines make it unavailable to the virus. With this second lock jammed, it cannot find its way into the <font size=-1>T</font>-cell and the lucky possessor of the extra chemokines will remain <font size=-1>HIV</font>-free.

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<p align=center><img src="http://www.economist.com/econlogosmall.gif" width=78 height=39  alt="The Economist"></p>

<h1><center>The mirage of peace</center></h1>

THERE is a strange fact about attitudes to the <font size=-1>IRA</font> in Britain, Ireland, Northern Ireland and elsewhere. Since February 9th, when terrorists brought to an end their 17-month ceasefire with a massive bomb in London's docklands, the <font size=-1>IRA</font> has placed five further bombs in Britain's cities. One went off, killing the terrorist who was carrying it. One produced only a small explosion. But two failed to explode, one of them a massive bomb designed to destroy Hammersmith Bridge in London. During this time, while the <font size=-1>IRA</font> was pursuing its brutal campaign on Britain's mainland, something called a "peace process" was supposedly under way, in which it was hoped that the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s political wing, Sinn Fein, would take part. Only when the fifth bomb went off on June 15th, and destroyed the centre of Manchester, did the hard truth finally sink home. Peace has gone. Welcome back to war.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This does not mean an end to efforts to achieve a political settlement in Northern Ireland. Indeed, such efforts should be redoubled. What the bomb should bring is an end to attempts to include the terrorists in that settlement. The bombers have confirmed, with clarity and determination, their contempt for democracy, their refusal to compromise. In a way, that makes things easier: the <font size=-1>IRA</font> has shown that negotiating with it makes no sense.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That must also apply to Sinn Fein. The immediate response by John Major and John Bruton, the British and Irish prime ministers, looked straightforward. They called yet again on Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein's leader, to choose between backing the bombers or repudiating them forever. This week he refused to repudiate them, which means that he remains the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s ally. As long as he sticks to that position, there must be no dealings with Sinn Fein. For to maintain official contacts, as the Irish government has done, and the British government has not yet ruled out, is to imply that a third course is open to discussion. It must not be.
<br>
<br>
On the fringes, not at the centre
Anyone who doubts the power of the Manchester bomb to destroy Northern Ireland's politics should ask themselves: what was its purpose? Beyond the general motive of pressuring Britain to give in, no one has come up with one, least of all Irish republicans. For the bomb came at the end of a week which saw the beginning of the multi-party talks which Sinn Fein has demanded for so long. Sinn Fein was excluded from those talks, but only because the <font size=-1>IRA</font> had not declared another ceasefire. Many hoped that such a declaration was only a matter of time; events seemed to be moving Sinn Fein's way.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The party had scored its highest vote ever in the May elections, held in preparation for the all-party talks. The British and Irish governments had stood by their insistence--in the face of threats of a walk-out by leading unionists--that George Mitchell, a former American senator whom nationalists trust, serve as chairman of the negotiations. The vexed issue of the handing in of terrorist weapons had been sidelined to a subcommittee. The American government, and Irish America, backed the talks. The Irish government was fully involved. But, for the <font size=-1>IRA</font> bombers, none of this mattered.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are two theories about what is going on in the republican movement. One is that the intertwined leaderships of Sinn Fein and the <font size=-1>IRA</font> never meant to abandon violence, but always planned to pursue a twin-track approach of bombing and negotiation. But if true, this strategy has failed--or so it would appear. The alliances with other Irish nationalists and with Dublin which Mr Adams so carefully nurtured are in shreds. Mr Adams's brilliant courting of Irish America has led, with this bomb, to bitter feelings of betrayal. Even republicans in Northern Ireland, most of whom seem as keen on peace as anyone, are bewildered and demoralised.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second, and more plausible, theory is that the republican movement is deeply divided between diehard militarists and those who support Mr Adams's peace efforts. For such a division there is plenty of evidence (see <a href="br1.html">page</a>). Indeed, it would be astonishing if there were no division at all.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But for Britain and Ireland, the policy should be the same whichever theory is correct. If a split occurs, and Mr Adams or others choose to repudiate violence in an unambiguous way, then fine: contact with them can then be resumed. If no split occurs, then at least everyone will know where everyone else stands. The fatal mistake--and it will be literally so for some--will be to try to induce a split by maintaining contact or by offering new concessions. For that will place the <font size=-1>IRA</font> just where it wants to be: in the centre of things, taken seriously, rather than on the fringes, isolated. Only former terrorists can be involved in democratic politics; not current ones, promising, one day, to give up their violence.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Either way, the advantage must be seized to isolate the bombers. In the past, the <font size=-1>IRA</font> has been able to sustain its campaign only because of a deep-rooted sense of republican grievance, and fear. Now, things can be different. There is a forum--the multi-party talks--in which the remaining grievances can, and should be, dealt with. A settlement, between everyone except the terrorists, must be the goal.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If war spreads back from Britain into Ulster, republicans will surely know that the <font size=-1>IRA</font> led them away from a peace process which Sinn Fein had proudly claimed as its own, and away from a negotiating table at which sat all the other parties to the conflict. If their streets are again patrolled by soldiers, and if they themselves become the targets for loyalist terrorists, it must be made plain to all concerned that it was the <font size=-1>IRA</font> which brought the danger back into republicans' lives. And for what? To restart a battle for Irish unification which their own leaders have said they cannot win, and which the rest of Ireland, north and south, does not want. And republicans must know one more thing: that it was not the British who destroyed Gerry Adams as a credible political leader, but the <font size=-1>IRA</font>. Knowing all this, will they really be able to justify to themselves more years of bloodshed?<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?835398000,iss">Search</a>

<h2>Yeltsin's battle</h2>
<p>President Yeltsin pipped his main rival, the Communists' Gennady Zyuganov, by 35% to 32% of the votes cast in the first round of <b>Russia's presidential election</b>. But confusion broke out after Alexander Lebed, an ex-general who came third with 15%, threw in his lot with Mr Yeltsin. Rumblings from Kremlin hardliners led to the sacking, among others, of Alexander Korzhakov, Mr Yeltsin's chief bodyguard, and talk of an attempted coup.<p>
An <b>IRA bomb </b>devastated the centre of Manchester, injuring more than 200 people and causing damage estimated at up to &#163;250m ($390m). The bomb dashed hopes that the <font size=-1>IRA</font> would call a second ceasefire to get Sinn Fein, its political wing, into multi-party talks about Northern Ireland's future.<p>
The European Commission issued a proposal for phasing out the European Union's ban on the export of <b>British beef</b>. Britain indicated it would accept it, and agreed to cull a further 25,000-67,000 cattle. Thus the scene seemed set for a deal at the <font size=-1>EU</font>'s weekend summit in Florence. Tory backbenchers, however, may object.<p>
In <b>Germany's biggest post-1945 demonstration</b>, 350,000 trade unionists turned out in Bonn to protest against austerity measures. The government allowed a small pay rise for public-sector workers after demanding a freeze and will delay a planned rise in the retirement age for women.<p>
Turkey's Islamist Welfare Party voted to reject a parliamentary corruption investigation of <b>Tansu Ciller</b>, leader of the True Path Party. The vote helps the two parties to form a government.<p>
Greece abandoned plans to cut defence spending. The defence minister said military spending would rise faster than economic growth over the next five years to counter <b>Turkish claims</b> to islands in the Aegean.<p>
<b>Latvia</b>'s strongly pro-western reformist president, Guntis Ulmanis, was re-elected by parliament to a second term.

<h2>Awash</h2>
<p>After 14 months of hearings, the final report of the Senate <b>Whitewater </b>committee claimed that Bill Clinton, while governor of Arkansas, had given "inappropriate assistance" to an Arkansas bond dealer. It also concluded that Hillary Clinton had probably played a role in limiting the investigation into the suicide of Vince Foster, a White House aide, in order to prevent potentially embarrassing documents coming to light.<p>
The gap between Mr Clinton and his Republican rival, <b>Bob Dole</b>, narrowed to six points according to a <i>Time</i>/<font size=-1>CNN</font> poll. Mr Clinton, however, retained a commanding lead in California.<p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
The White House said it would put a civil servant in charge of <b>security clearances</b> to avoid a recurrence of the alleged misuse of <font size=-1>FBI</font> files.<p>
Theodore Kaczynski was charged in California with four of the <b>Unabomber</b> mail-bomb attacks, two of which resulted in deaths. Pete Wilson, the governor of California, urged the federal government to seek the death penalty for him.<p>
Right-wing bandits in northern <b>Nicaragua</b> kidnapped a large party of election officials.

<h2>Trading terms</h2>
<p><b>India</b>'s new finance minister, P. Chidambaram, upset left-wing supporters of the new coalition government by announcing plans to cut public spending and streamline state-controlled firms. Separately, India said it will not sign the <b>Comprehensive Test-Ban Treaty</b>, currently under negotiation in Geneva, in its present form.<p>
A leader of Myanmar's ruling junta, Lieutenant-General Khin Nyunt, called on teachers and students to "annihilate" the <b>political opposition </b>for urging foreign investors and tourists to stay away. His target was assumed to be Aung San Suu Kyi.<p>
A leaked report from America's Defence Department said that ten to 15 <b>Americans taken prisoner </b>in the war with North Korea (1950-53) may still be held. But the department said there was no "conclusive proof" that the men were alive.<p>
The Malaysian High Court ruled that a $5.5 billion dam being built in <b>Sarawak </b>was illegal because local people had not been consulted. The government refused to order work on the dam to be stopped, claiming that the ruling was a technicality that "can be rectified".

<h2>Israel's hard line</h2>
<p>Binyamin Netanyahu's new <b>Israeli government</b> was sworn in, with difficulty. Trying to please his allies, he had to backtrack to avoid a revolt from his own party, the Likud. He called for negotiations with the Arabs, with no preconditions--then set Israeli preconditions that make peace harder: no Palestinian state, continued Israeli sovereignty over Golan, and no talks on Jerusalem.<p>
Boutros Boutros-Ghali said he would seek a second term as secretary-general of the <b>United Nations</b>. The Clinton administration made it clear that it would oppose him.<p>
Amnesty International's 1996 report condemned western exporters for the growing trade in <b>instruments of torture</b>.<p>
Talks between <b>Burundi</b>'s political parties began after it was reported that some 70 Hutus had been killed by soldiers. The army claimed it had killed 50 terrorists.<p>
A ship with 400 Liberians on board reappeared at<b> Monrovia</b> after drifting off the West African coast for three weeks.<p>

<h2>Growth factor</h2>
<p>(See <a href="wtw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>Japan's economy took off in the first quarter at the fastest pace for 23 years, producing year-on-year growth of 5.7% and an even more spectacular 12.7% annualised growth rate. The yen strengthened against the dollar, as did prospects of an early interest-rate rise. But much of the spurt in growth came from a one-off &#165;14 trillion ($138 billion) government stimulus. Stronger consumer spending helped to reduce Japan's <b>trade surplus </b>for the 18th month in a row, to a level 60% lower in May than it had been a year earlier.<p>
Signs of <b>growth in Germany </b>remain sparse, said a Bundesbank report. Hans Tietmeyer, head of the Bundesbank, said that with low inflation likely to continue "for some time", there should be no need to raise German interest rates "in the foreseeable future".<p>
The traditional ritual of a last-minute deal averted $2 billion-worth of American tariffs on Chinese goods, after the two countries reached agreement in their row over <b>intellectual property rights</b>. China's pledge of a crackdown on counterfeiting of <font size=-1>CD</font>s, <font size=-1>CD</font>-<font size=-1>ROM</font>s and laser discs seems a little more concrete than previous promises.<p>
Neil Kinnock, the <font size=-1>EU</font>'s transport commissioner, won his battle for the European Commission to negotiate an <b>open-skies pact </b>with America on behalf of <font size=-1>EU</font> members. <font size=-1>EU</font> transport ministers granted permission for negotiations to be opened, but for now only on such peripheral issues as computer-reservation systems. The more important matter of routes will remain covered by bilateral treaties between America and individual member countries.

<h2>Copper bottoms</h2>
<p>The London Metal Exchange (and copper) recovered some of its equilibrium in the wake of the <b>Sumitomo scandal</b>, in which Yasuo Hamanaka ran up estimated losses of $1.8 billion in unauthorised copper dealing, mainly through the <font size=-1>LME</font>, over ten years, while working for the world's largest copper trader. Authorities in Britain, Japan and America all began investigations. Once again, Japan was criticised for poor risk management and weak oversight by regulators. Sumitomo scrapped a planned share buyback and set aside over $1 billion to help cover losses.

<h2>Grounded</h2>
<p><p>
The Federal Aviation Administration suspended operations at <b>ValuJet</b>, one of whose aircraft crashed last month in Florida with the loss of all 110 people on board. ValuJet's share price plunged 40%. No sooner had the <font size=-1>FAA</font> acted than the Clinton administration, citing the watchdog's "lax" oversight of the no-frills airline, ordered a shake-up at the <font size=-1>FAA</font> and forced its top safety official into early retirement.<p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
Employees of Italy's state-owned airline, <b>Alitalia</b>, accepted a restructuring plan to cut costs in exchange for a 20% stake in the airline. Alitalia, which has lost money for seven years running, may now get more capital from the state.<p>
<b>Lufthansa</b> gave a warning that business was bad, news taken to mean that Germany's flagship airline is heading for a big loss in the first six months of the year.<p>
The seldom-happy alliance between China and South Korea that was meant to build a <b>regional Asian jet </b>broke down irretrievably.<p>
Strikes hit <b>South Korea</b>'s motor industry. Pay disputes brought production to a halt at Kia Motors, the country's second-largest car maker, and at Asia Motors, a lorry maker. Hyundai Motor shut down some production lines because of a strike at a parts maker, Mando.

<h2>Chopped</h2>
<p>The French government said that a plan by <b>Moulinex </b>to lay off 2,600 of its 11,500 workers is "unacceptable" . The French electrical appliances company, which plans to close plants and move some production to Mexico, also disclosed its biggest-ever net loss, of FFr702m ($142m) in the year to end-March, on sales of FFr7.8 billion. Moulinex shares jumped 21% in one day.<p>
A British brewing and catering group, <b>Compass</b>, won its fight for control of <b>Eurest France</b>, the third-largest contract caterer in France, a prime market. It is paying a reluctant Sodexho, France's largest contract caterer, FFr590m ($114m) to buy out its 33.34% stake, plus FFr2.8m to Epargne D&eacute;veloppement for a 0.16% stake.<p>
The shareholders of France's <b>Chargeurs </b>agreed to split the conglomerate into Path&eacute;, devoted to media and communications, and Chargeurs International, devoted to textiles. The companies will start trading on the Paris bourse on June 24th.<p>
The chief executive of <b>CLT</b>, a big Luxembourg-based media group, resigned. Michel Delloye's abrupt departure came on the eve of <font size=-1>CLT</font>'s planned merger with the television arm of Bertelsmann, a German rival.<p>
<b>Sony</b>, Japan's leading consumer-electronics company, entered America's personal-computer market with its first two models, the fruits of a recently formed alliance with Intel, a chip maker.<p>
Acquisitions and strong demand sent profits at <b>British Steel</b> soaring by 90% to a record &#163;1.1 billion ($1.7 billion) in the year to end-March, with sales rising 47% to &#163;7.1 billion. The full-year dividend rose by a third, but, with steel prices and demand now dropping sharply in Europe, the company was gloomier about the outlook for the current year.<p>
Malaysia's state-owned oil and gas company, <b>Petronas</b>, is buying 30% of South Africa's largest oil refiner, <b>Engen</b>, for 1.9 billion rand ($436m).<p>

<p>THE tiny town of Luckenbach, in the Texas hill country, has little to recommend it but a song ("Let's go to Luckenbach, Texas") and an annual picnic held by Willie Nelson, the state's grizzled country-music star, every Fourth of July. This year, the picnic has a solemn purpose. Profits from it will go to local farmers who have been unable to make a living since the rains failed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Texas, and all across the south-west, rainfall this year is as much as 70-85% below normal. When the rare rains come, they pummel the cracked earth and withered crops with storms of wind and hail. The death of a young woman on June 4th was a small sign of the suffering. Like three other Mexican women who had died of thirst before her, she had tried to slip into Texas across the baking ranch-lands that guard the American side of the Rio Grande. A border patrol found her body under a shrivelled tree on a desolate stretch of a path nicknamed, because it is used by illegal immigrants, the "Ho Chi Minh Trail". In a normal year, streams and watering holes along the trail help the migrants. This year, there was no water to be found.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Rick Perry, the Texas commissioner of agriculture, is a rancher with an aversion to hyperbole. He calls the drought the worst natural disaster to hit Texas this century. Already, he says, it is worse than the drought of 1956, once considered the definitive Texas dry spell. It was not unexpected; its approach had been watched for the past three years, as it crept up from north-east Mexico. But this is the first year it has affected the whole of Texas (see <a href="am1.gif">map</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Agriculture remains a pillar of the Texas economy. A fifth of the state's jobs are tied to food and fibre production. Income from agriculture came to $14 billion in 1995, with an estimated $46 billion in indirect sales (such as sales of farm equipment and the takings of small-town stores). Losses in 1996 have been catastrophic. Mr Perry commissioned Texas <font size=-1>A&M</font> University to provide an estimate: it found that the state will lose at least $6.5 billion indirectly from the drought this year. The biggest losers will be cotton, cattle and cereal crops.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Across central and west Texas, water holes and wells have dried up and the state's natural limestone aquifers are desperately low. In west Texas the drought has brought fears that the land will turn to desert. The Monahans field of sand dunes in southern New Mexico, among others, is predicted to billow eastward into Texas. The big cities are worried. Houston and Dallas report their lowest rainfalls since the second world war, San Antonio its lowest since records began in 1885.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the High Plains, which stretch north from Lubbock into the Oklahoma panhandle, rains swept in belatedly from the Rockies in the past few weeks, although farmers there now wish they had stayed away. This flat sandy reach of land is the largest cotton-producing region in the country. This year, the crop is ruined. The rain was followed by hailstones an inch in diameter, and the damage to the cotton was "the same as me dropping a 300-pound rock on your head," according to one grower. As if this were not enough, hot winds came from the New Mexico deserts, soaking up moisture and blowing along sand which shredded the cotton on the stalk.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For many years now, farmers in the High Plains have adopted "sandfighting" methods. These are based on rough-tilling, which involves ploughing the land so deep that the resulting ridges act as barriers to stop the topsoil blowing away. As a result, the dustbowl conditions that destroyed farming in much of Texas and Oklahoma six decades ago will not be repeated. Still, the cost will be crippling. The Texas <font size=-1>A&M</font> study estimates that $704m-worth of cotton will be lost this year, and that the direct economic impact of the drought statewide will be more than $2.4 billion.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Cotton may be the biggest loser, but Mr Perry is just as worried for the cattlemen. Ranchers, he says, have taken "a silver bullet in the heart." At Crabapple Crossing Ranch, near Llano in central Texas, one forlorn kingfisher haunts a creek that is now a trough of yellow mud less than a foot wide, and cattle scrape at withered grass. Ranchers must buy feed from as far away as Michigan. Feed prices, especially for beef cattle, have risen so steeply that not a cow in Texas can pay its way. The result is panic selling. The Texas and Southwest Cattle Raisers' Association has reported a 40-50% drop in livestock prices in 1996. Many farmers had $400 loans out on cattle that fetched only $200. Some frustrated ranchers, having liquidated their entire herds, will not be re-entering the market for at least 18 months.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The drought could not have come at a worse time for Texas cattle-ranchers. Mexican ranchers, themselves ravaged by drought, flooded Texan markets with cheap beef in 1995, which pushed down prices even before the drought took them lower. Cattle ranching--dairy and beef--is worth $4.6 billion to the Texas economy. The Texas <font size=-1>A&M</font> study says the drought will cut at least $838m directly and $1.55 billion indirectly off the value of the state's herds.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In south Texas, the water supply is close to failing. Reservoirs fed by the Rio Grande watershed are at a quarter of their normal levels, and things are made worse by agreements that require the Rio Grande's water to be shared between Texas (57%) and Mexico (43%). Cameron County--the southernmost in Texas, on the Gulf of Mexico--is in its third year of drought: reservoirs there are running so low that farmers fear there will be no water for irrigating next year's crops. Even if there is, the salinity of the irrigated water means that farmers still need substantial rainfall to cleanse the soil and bring in a harvest.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The tropical appearance of Brownsville and Harlingen, the county's main towns, is misleading, say local farmers. In 1995 Cameron County faced a collapse of its agriculture when the cotton crop failed, bringing in only a sixth of its predicted yield. The Woodlum cotton gin in San Benito, near Harlingen, expected 12,000 bales of cotton in 1995 but received only 577; a similar shortfall this year will put it out of business.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The drought puts Texas bankers in a quandary. They can choose either to foreclose on farming clients and take a probable 70% loss on sales of farm equipment, or refinance farmers in the hope of a good harvest in 1997. Both Mr Perry and the governor of Texas, George W. Bush, have urged the banks to be flexible in their autumn refinancing of drought-battered farmers. So far, the banks have shown willing. For his part, Mr Perry is pressing the Agriculture Department in Washington to show more generosity in federal crop-insurance programmes.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The end of the "Great Drought" in 1957 brought a spree of dam-building across Texas. This was meant to ensure that the state could see out future droughts. Mr Perry is pressing for a similar response to this year's drought--and with good reason. Since 1957, the population of Texas has grown from 9m to 17m; it is predicted to rise to 31m by 2020. And agriculture has diversified in more water-greedy directions. Rice farmers, for instance, use more water, relative to production, than any other sort of Texas farming. Their ten-year water rights are up for renegotiation in 1997, and will be affected by the drought.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Industrial demands have added to the strain. The largest water-users in central Texas are micro-processor plants. The Motorola plant in Austin consumes 11% of the city's water supply, 4.5m gallons a day. New reservoirs are almost certain to be built, and water conservation laws will be tightened; meanwhile, Mr Bush is using the drought to try to change Texans' water-using habits "literally one drop at a time" . It is hard work; Texas is now so urban, and the cities are so oblivious of the hardship in the countryside, that Mr Perry says one of the toughest parts of his job is just to get the message across.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Will rain come to the rescue? No, say most long-range weather forecasts. The consensus seems to be that the drought will ease next year before getting worse in 1998 and 1999. Studies link the drought to a sunspot cycle not due to end until the millennium. All this is bad news for Texas agriculture. Without a bumper harvest, refinancing will saddle many farmers with more debt that they can handle. And so sure are Texans that the drought will go on that one Austin car dealer is offering free cars to customers if it rains on the morning of the Luckenbach picnic.

<h1>A message from the IRA</h1>


<font size=1>BELFAST</font><p><b>The huge bomb which destroyed the heart of Manchester has also exposed deep divisions among Irish republicans</b></p>

THE people of Manchester have little need to ponder the meaning of the <font size=-1>IRA</font> bomb which exploded on June 15th. A vibrant city centre is in ruins, traders despair, dozens of people still suffer from pain and shock. Among more than 200 other victims, one 42-year-old woman has had seven hours of surgery in the first of a series of operations which will be required to salvage her shredded face.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But in the rest of Britain and especially in Ireland, north and south, the bomb has been greeted not just by despair, but by angry questions. What is the <font size=-1>IRA</font> up to? Have all those who have supported the so-called peace process simply been duped? Do Irish republicans want peace, or war? Americans who have backed the peace process were equally puzzled and appalled. Angry denunciations of the bomb came not just from Bill Clinton, but also from Irish-American leaders such as Senator Edward Kennedy, who had pressed Mr Clinton to get involved in the Northern Ireland issue.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The bomb seemed designed to wreck the very multi-party talks which Sinn Fein, the political wing of the <font size=-1>IRA</font>, had been demanding for so long. Indeed, the <font size=-1>IRA</font> itself had claimed that it tore up its first ceasefire, and exploded a bomb in London's Docklands because the British had refused to set a date for such talks. After years of constant negotiations between the British and Irish governments, and the personal intervention of Mr Clinton, those talks at last got under way--five days before the Manchester bomb.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The talks began acrimoniously, and Sinn Fein had been excluded. But the acrimony was predictable. And Sinn Fein was excluded only because the <font size=-1>IRA</font> had refused to declare a second ceasefire. The British and Irish governments had made huge efforts to come up with a framework for talks which would make them acceptable to nationalists, and especially to Sinn Fein. The decommissioning of terrorist weapons had been delegated to a subcommittee, so that unionists could not use the issue to torpedo talks even before they began. George Mitchell, a former American senator and close associate of Mr Clinton, whom nationalists trust, had been appointed as the talks' chairman.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There had been no bombs since April. Hopes had been rising that, eventually, a ceasefire declaration would let Sinn Fein into the talks. There was much talk of a <i>de facto</i> ceasefire. Gerry Adams and Martin McGuinness, Sinn Fein's two most prominent leaders, continued to declare that peace, and a negotiated political settlement, were their goals.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And then the <font size=-1>IRA</font> exploded its bomb in Manchester, the biggest it has ever planted in England. Carnage was averted only by a hurried evacuation of thousands of Saturday morning shoppers. Miraculously, no one was killed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whatever the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s rationale for the bomb, signs of deep division within republican ranks are obvious. On June 7th an <font size=-1>IRA</font> gang shot dead Jerry McCabe, an Irish police detective, during a botched robbery in Adare in the Irish Republic. The killing shocked Ireland. Some 20,000 people, including the president and prime minister, attended Mr McCabe's funeral. For a week the <font size=-1>IRA</font> adamantly denied that any of its men had been involved. Mr Adams publicly poured scorn on those who suggested otherwise. Then, a mere half-hour before the Manchester bomb went off, the <font size=-1>IRA</font> issued a statement saying that its men had killed Mr McCabe, but that the action was "not sanctioned". For a movement which has always prided itself on its discipline, and which desperately fears splits, this was ominous.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More significantly, Sinn Fein had campaigned vigorously in May's special elections on an explicit platform of peace. "Vote for peace, vote Sinn Fein" had been its slogan. During the campaign, Mr Adams said that Sinn Fein would be willing to agree to the Mitchell principles, a commitment to exclusively peaceful methods, if other parties did so too. Of course, Mr Adams may have simply been lying, but what was the point of doing that if he knew that another bomb was only two weeks away? Sinn Fein officials frankly admit that the party's increased vote was the result of its calls for peace, and that the first <font size=-1>IRA</font> ceasefire was the most popular thing that republican leaders have ever done.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Republican supporters, even activists and former <font size=-1>IRA</font> prisoners, are as bewildered and gloomy as anyone else. Many express frustration at the slow pace of the peace process; most distrust British intentions. But few deny that the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s bombs have damaged the standing of Mr Adams and Mr McGuinness, or that the two men have lost control of the <font size=-1>IRA</font>. "I think the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s in charge of the agenda now and I don't know what that means for the Sinn Fein leadership," says one ex-prisoner.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, in the days after the Manchester bombing, Mr Adams looked like a high-wire walker struggling ever more frantically to keep his footing. He said that he wished that the bomb had not "happened" but, as with his earlier verbal convolutions over the killing of Mr McCabe, he refused to condemn it, or the <font size=-1>IRA</font>, outright. Pressed by journalists to explain the relationship between Sinn Fein and the <font size=-1>IRA</font>, he was reduced to repeating, like a mantra, the sentence: "I have told you, we are not the <font size=-1>IRA</font> and the <font size=-1>IRA</font> is not Sinn Fein."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In fact, no one is any longer interested in such polite fictions. The leaderships of the <font size=-1>IRA</font> and Sinn Fein have been entwined for years, and still are. The Irish government put questions to Mr Adams. Had he gone to the <font size=-1>IRA</font> and asked for a ceasefire, and if not, why not? Did his party continue to support the "armed struggle" of the <font size=-1>IRA</font>? In attempting to answer both questions, Mr Adams virtually admitted that there was a deep division among republicans. "I want to see an end to armed struggle. We [Sinn Fein] are not involved in it and we do not advocate it."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the House of Commons John Major also stopped short of slamming the door irrevocably in Sinn Fein's face, instead inviting it to repudiate the bombers once and for all: "The time has come for Sinn Fein to make up its mind. Either it is going to be a democratic organisation, taking part in democratic politics, or it is going to stay side by side as the reverse coin of the <font size=-1>IRA</font>."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In fact, what both governments were demanding was a formal and convincing split between Sinn Fein and the <font size=-1>IRA</font>, with the kind of absolute condemnations of the <font size=-1>IRA</font> which everyone could believe. Splits of that kind are familiar in the history of Irish republicanism. Mr Adams and Mr McGuinness seized the leadership of the movement after the last split among republicans in the 1970s. Another split now makes sense. Sinn Fein's leaders have spent years building support for the <font size=-1>IRA</font> ceasefire, and trying to lead republicans into multi-party talks. They have declared that the <font size=-1>IRA</font> cannot drive the British out of Northern Ireland, and that only a negotiated political settlement can resolve the conflict. They claim authorship of the "peace process". They have successfully courted support in America, Ireland and Britain for it. But, it is now obvious, they cannot deliver all the hardliners in the <font size=-1>IRA</font>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A split may make sense, and yet few republicans seem to think it will happen. "They will walk away from Sinn Fein before they repudiate the <font size=-1>IRA</font>," is one typical comment. If what <font size=-1>IRA</font> hardliners are trying to do is to keep Sinn Fein out of talks indefinitely, and so halt what they see as a slide towards political accommodation, they seem about to get their way.

<p><b>Divorce</b></p>
<h1>A house divided</h1>

<p>IN AN attempt to please everyone, the last-minute amendments to the divorce reform bill resulted in legislation that managed to satisfy almost no one. But considering the wide range of opinion on this most intimate of issues, from staunch traditionalist to the marriage-is-oppression set, this muddled law may be a fair reflection of British values.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Family Law Bill, as it is euphemistically known, does two somewhat contradictory things. First, it asserts the value of marriage as a social institution. Second, it makes dissolving a marriage less ugly by removing the basis of fault.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Neither of these principles was changed in the months-long and often unseemly squabbling over the bill. The amendments that did pass are ornamental. One established that the waiting period between filing for divorce and dissolution would be no more than 18 months (instead of a year) for couples with children or in contested cases. Another nudged the government to take action on the division of pensions--which it was doing anyway. A third requires the government to pay for marriage counselling for couples who want it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Its effect will be to make a couple divorcing in 1998, when the bill comes into force, wait longer and jump through more hoops than they would now. On the other hand, they will not be asked to lie or cheat, and their children's interests are better protected: no divorce will be granted until the couple have settled their children's future and agreed on the division of assets. The government will pay for mediation rather than legal advice if qualifying couples decide on that course, again in the hope that divorce can be a kinder, gentler agony.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the moment, the median delay between filing for divorce and dissolution is less than seven months; for eight out of ten couples, the process takes less than a year. The new law requires every couple to wait at least a year, and those with children up to 18 months. This interval is to be used to give reconciliation a go, to simmer down, and to arrange financial and family affairs in a civil manner. Lord Mackay would like salvageable marriages to be rescued during this period, an idealistic but not wholly unrealistic hope. A study of divorced British couples found that both partners wished they had stayed married in 10% of cases. American researchers have consistently found that a third of divorced people think they have made a mistake.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The chief objection to the bill was that the removal of fault makes ending a marriage too easy. But the stigma of fault seems to be weak. Currently three-quarters of the 158,000 divorces in England and Wales each year are based on allegations of adultery or unreasonable behaviour. Couples often make up nasty tales about a spouse to speed up the process, rather than having to wait during a two-year separation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Critics also pointed to the American experience. The extension of no-fault in the 1970s has not made divorce less contentious. As David Blankenhorn of the Institute of American Values in New York notes, one increasingly common tactic is to allege horrible, unprovable things: "Whoever first says child abuse gets custody."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But America's no-fault divorce was also a no-responsibility divorce: one partner could walk and the other would have to give chase in order to settle family affairs. The Family Law Bill avoids that mistake by requiring couples to put their affairs in order before they divorce. In an ideal world, a better bill would have emerged from a less sanctimonious Commons debate--but in an ideal world, all marriages would be happy ones. This bill could have turned out a great deal worse.

<h1>A song for Europe</h1>


<p>THE Euro 96 soccer tournament is doing much for English self-esteem but nothing for British national harmony. Before the first ball was kicked, a row broke out over the <font size=-1>BBC</font>'s choice of "Ode to Joy" as the theme tune for its coverage of the contest. After all, noted horrified critics, this was composed by Ludwig von Beethoven, a (wait for it) German. Never mind that German television coverage has been introduced with a song by Oasis, a fashionable Mancunian rock group, called "Don't Look Back in Anger" (a reference, perhaps, to England's defeat of West Germany in the 1966 World Cup final). <font size=-1>ITV</font> opted for the sublime but baffling "Jerusalem", a hymn about a Middle Eastern Jew visiting England.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The fans seem equally confused. Towards the end of England's 4-1 thrashing of the Netherlands on June 18th, the jubilant Wembley crowd sang "Rule Britannia"--hardly appropriate, given that one of the British nations, Scotland, was at that moment being eliminated from the tournament, and another, Wales, had failed even to reach this month's finals. Days earlier, when England played Scotland, "God Save the Queen", the national anthem of the United Kingdom, was played for the English team, to booing by Scottish fans; the Jocks were allowed to sing their own "national anthem", "Flower of Scotland", a sentimental folk song. The <font size=-1>BBC</font>'s radio commentator, Northern Irish, disapproved--a unionist, presumably.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In some ways, England's monopolisation of "God Save the Queen", and Scottish hostility to it, are understandable. The song was written during the uprising by Catholic Scots in 1745, to rekindle support for George <font size=-1>II</font> after his army was defeated at Prestonpans. It included this verse: "Lord grant that Marshal Wade, May bring the mighty aid, victory bring. May he sedition hush, and like a torrent rush, rebellious Scots to crush, God save..." But any bekilted fans upset by these words should note that the reference is to rebellious Scots, not the entire race. England and Scotland, remember, had been joined as a single state under the Act of Union of 1702. And the offending words have long been swapped for well-meaning nonsense about all nations forming "one family, the wide world over".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No, all British soccer teams should use "God Save the Queen", or none. If Scotland wants its own song, England should have one as well. Perhaps the Eurosceptical "There'll always be an England" would best fit the current mood. On the other hand, there is a song that neatly encompasses both the players and their more zealous supporters: "Mad dogs and Englishmen".

<p><b>Legal aid</b></p>
<h1>Overturning the trough</h1>


<p>MOST politicians desperately want to be loved. Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, appears to be an exception. Fresh from the all-party battering he received on the divorce bill, he is poised to take on the legal profession.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The nation's appetite for justice at the state's expense, like the demand for free health care, has proved to be insatiable. This year the legal-aid budget is expected to exceed &#163;1.5 billion, a five-fold increase in a decade, making it the fastest-growing area of public expenditure (see <a href="br1.gif">chart</a>). As a first step towards introducing a way to limit expenditure, the government is publishing a white paper on June 25th. It heralds the most radical shake-up of legal aid since it was introduced half a century ago.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The nub of the problem is that, aside from plaintiffs or defendants themselves, the people who benefit from legal aid are the same as those who largely determine whether it should be granted: lawyers. The result is supplier-induced demand. The legal-aid budget has been kept from exploding only by excluding more and more people from the scheme. Less than half the population is now eligible, compared with 70% a decade ago. Only the poorest 10% get all their legal bills paid.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"What I am trying to achieve is a method of control," says Lord Mackay. His plan is for a system of block contracts under which the Legal Aid Board, which dispenses the cash, will negotiate with solicitors to take on a specified number of cases.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By replacing an open-ended scheme in which lawyers decide which cases should be fought with a cash-limited system in which ministers determine priorities, the government will deprive the lawyers of influence over the size of the budget. All sorts of changes should follow from that. The incentive to spin out weak cases long after they should have been abandoned will disappear. Costs will be much more tightly monitored. The merits of cases will, it is presumed, be more closely examined.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The other flaw in the current system which the white paper addresses is imbalance of risk. Anybody involved in a legal action against a legally aided plaintiff or defendant is in an unenviable position. Not only is he fighting a litigant backed by unlimited resources but, even if he wins, he will not normally be able to recover his costs. Lord Mackay says he is determined to restore some equality of risk.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The white paper will thus recommend allowing courts to direct that legally aided plaintiffs should pay a share of the costs of a case, depending on their resources. Even if an applicant has no income or realisable assets, the white paper is expected to suggest that he or she pay a nominal amount--say &#163;20-30--before being granted legal aid.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Critics say that the block-grant system may mean that some worthy cases will be rejected because of budget constraints. And, by shifting the burden of risk, these proposals might deter poor people from bringing good cases for fear of having cost orders made against them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The private sector might offer a solution to this problem. The Lord Chancellor believes that if legal costs were made more predictable, then commercial insurers would be prepared to underwrite the risks of losing a case. Officials in the Lord Chancellor's department are studying a scheme which offers &#163;18,000-worth of cover for a &#163;300 premium.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lawyers are bitterly opposed to these changes. The Law Society, which represents solicitors, claims that the block-contract system will be complex and costly to administer. The Bar Council, which represents barristers, says that cash limits will be impossible to impose fairly and will lead to injustice. Their criticisms would carry more weight if those who made them did not have a direct financial interest in preserving the old system.

<h1>Sold short</h1>

PREDICTIONS of stronger economic growth over the next 18 months rely on a big rise in consumer spending as tax cuts and windfall gains from building-society shares make people better off. The figures for retail sales in May, published on June 19th, therefore came as a blow (see <a href="br2.gif">chart</a>). A survey by the British Retail Consortium, a trade group, had suggested that the growth in that month's sales would be the strongest for two years. Instead, sales were lower in volume terms than in April. Are hopes of consumer-led growth misplaced?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Retail sales have been disappointing all year. The annual growth rate, which picked up from next to nothing last September to around 2% in December, has failed to accelerate further. It is now lower than in 1993 and 1994.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet the grounds for expecting higher consumption seem strong. Spending power is rising: the gap between average earnings growth and the growth of taxes plus prices, negative at the end of last year, now exceeds three percentage points, its widest for three years. True, much of this extra cash could be saved, but the savings ratio, which measures the proportion of income saved, is already quite high, suggesting that there is scope for more spending. Also, April saw record monthly consumer-credit growth, to an annual rate of more than 14%, and the consumer-confidence index is now at its highest since 1988.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Headline retail sales may simply be a poor guide to consumer sentiment. A better one is sales of household goods, which includes expensive items such as washing machines which people tend to buy only when they feel flush. As our chart shows, these grew by 9.8% in the year to May, and are on a rising trend. Moreover, retail sales account for only part of consumer spending. Total consumption grew by 0.8% in the first quarter of this year, the highest quarterly figure since 1993. Since retail sales rose by only 0.4%, other sorts of spending must have risen by over 1%.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Prospects for a pick-up in Britain's overall economic growth still seem fair, therefore. But would the country's currently depressed manufacturers feel the benefit? Geoffrey Dicks, an economist at NatWest Markets, a stockbroking firm, is sceptical. He calculates that in the past year domestic demand for manufactured goods rose by 4%--yet manufacturing output grew by only 0.8%. In this period imports of finished manufactured goods soared by 12.7%. Consumers are spending again, but British manufacturers are not making what they want to buy.

<p><b>Trade unions</b></p>
<h1>Past is future</h1>

<p>FIRST there was New Labour; now there is New Unionism, an initiative launched on June 18th by the Trades Union Congress (<font size=-1>TUC</font>) to try to reverse the decline in union membership, which has fallen to 6.75m from 12m in 1979. But while New Labour is keen to dump the baggage of history, New Unionism harks back to the 1880s, when trade unionism spread like wildfire through the British workforce.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At that time, New Unionism was the name given to a movement which transformed unions from the preserves of a few craftsmen to the representatives of a mass of workers in the rapidly growing industrial towns and cities. Now the unions are in a similar situation. In many of their strongholds, employment is shrinking, as it was for the 19th-century craftsmen. And just as the unions had to fight their way into the expanding factories of Victorian Britain, they now find themselves largely shut out of many growing businesses, from computing to fast food.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The 19th-century union leaders realised that in order to have clout with bosses, they had to get most of their workers to join up. That meant putting most of their effort into recruitment. But over the years, unions have spent increasing amounts of time and money on servicing their existing members, less on winning new ones. This has helped them to defend their traditional strongholds, but has stopped them from making inroads into new workplaces.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;American unions, whose memberships have also fallen sharply, have already realised that they need to put more muscle into organising non-union workplaces. Few unions on either side of the Atlantic give details of how much they spend on this (mostly because they do not know), but one exception is America's Oil, Chemical and Atomic Workers' Union. In 1944 it spent 48% of its income on recruitment, but by the early 1990s this had fallen to a mere 2%. Realising that something had to be done, the union raised this proportion to 12% in 1995. The <font size=-1>TUC</font> says the figure in Britain is probably well under 10%.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The trouble is that the number of people leaving unions is as big a problem as the lack of people joining. If less effort were put into satisfying existing members, even more would leave. The solution is to get unpaid shop stewards to do more of the work now done by paid officials--from negotiating pay to representing workers in disciplinary hearings. But union officials are bound to resist a switch from these familiar tasks to the more stressful job of fighting for new members in new industries where most of the workers are indifferent and all of the bosses are hostile.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Faced with similar conditions, the original New Unionists in the 1880s often had to go to great lengths, holding secret meetings whenever and wherever they could reach potential recruits. Sonia McKay of the Labour Research Department (a union-funded research body) says unions will have to revive this spirit of adventure if they want to reverse their decline. She points to a recent example of union officials holding a gathering in a bank at midnight because this was the only time they could reach the cleaners they were trying to recruit.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unions are having to look to history for ways to restore their fortunes because Labour is no longer promising to ride to their rescue if elected. A new policy document on employment rights, to be published by Labour on June 22nd, promises unions a right to recognition but little else. Almost all of the restrictions imposed on unions since 1979 will stay. Perhaps the unions will be tempted to wind down their political funds and ask their members to support a drive for new members instead of a drive for a new government.

<p><b>Hollywood</b></p>
<h1>Mini Mouse</h1>

<p>HOLLYWOOD is having a wonderful summer. "Summer Cum Laude" is how <i>Variety</i>, a waggish trade paper, described it. Two films, Paramount's "Mission: Impossible" and Warner Brothers' "Twister", have together taken $330m in barely a month. The first five months of the year look likely to bring in almost $2.2 billion at the American box office, 18% more than the same period last year, which was itself a record.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why, then, has Walt Disney, widely seen as a Hollywood pace-setter, chosen this moment to announce that it will halve its output of films? Joe Roth, the studio's chairman, plans to produce about 20 films a year from now on, compared with the 35 it is releasing this year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The answer is, in part, that Disney is reversing the policy it has followed under Michael Eisner since 1984 of ramping up its output of live-action films. The aim of the policy was partly to build up a library--the growth of themed television channels and of video shops has produced a lucrative demand for old films--and partly to cover the overheads of Disney's huge distribution engine, which would otherwise handle only one or two animated pictures a year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Disney has specialised in making cheapish "family" films, using fading stars or, better still, children and animals. The policy brought Disney a few hits, such as "Pretty Woman" (which starred the then-pass&eacute; Richard Gere), "Honey, I Shrunk the Kids" and "Three Men and a Baby". But, according to <font size=-1>CS</font> First Boston, an investment bank, Disney's live-action films averaged a dingy $35m in American box-office receipts between 1984 and 1994. Many recent offerings, made with irredeemable stars and creakingly low budgets, have vanished: not into valuable library stocks, but into oblivion.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By contrast, eight of America's all-time top-selling home videos are Disney animated films. "The Hunchback of Notre Dame", this summer's Disney cartoon offering, cost perhaps $75m to make. The market will judge it a failure, says David Londoner of Schroder Wertheim, an investment bank in New York, if it takes only $500m over the next three years, including the inevitable spin-offs of music sales and other memorabilia. Not surprisingly, whereas the animation business makes annual profits--of well over $1 billion--live-action films do not. Jeffrey Logsdon, an entertainment analyst at Seidler in Los Angeles, thinks it probably broke even in the year to the end of September 1995. Mr Londoner thinks it lost money.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now it seems that Disney has decided to make fewer, but more expensive, live-action films. Mr Roth is keen to give each film broader appeal, and especially to drum up interest abroad, where Hollywood now makes more than half its box-office takings. The template may be "The Rock" , a loud, violent, mass-market film that has cost a reported $60m to make ($15m for its star, Sean Connery, alone) and took more than $37m in its first week.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some other studios--Paramount and probably Warner--are retrenching too. But others are still increasing their output. A classic conflict between the interests of one (to make more films) and the interests of all (to make fewer)? Not so, says David Davis of Houlihan Lokey Howard &amp; Zukin, an investment bank in Los Angeles. He calculates that a studio needs to release about a dozen films a year to have an acceptable spread of risk. Once the number of releases rises above that, it becomes harder to nurture and market each film. Those drawbacks outweigh the savings in overheads.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So downsizing makes sense for all the big studios. A vast number of mainstream films have been released in the past 18 months. The complex business of timing a launch has thus become ever more difficult. Conventional wisdom says that a film must be an American box-office hit if it is to succeed in foreign markets or at the video store; but that Americans go to the cinema <i>en masse</i> only in early summer and at Christmas. As Harold Vogel, an analyst with Cowen in New York, points out, vast confections that may have cost $100m or more to create have one brief weekend--or at best 72 hours--in which to be judged successes or failures.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite the good summer in America, and expanding foreign markets, the economics of the film business is harsh. The cost of making and distributing a big film has risen inexorably, with the sharpest rise coming in the past couple of years (see <a href="wb1.gif">chart</a>). The need to be noticed in the crowd forces studios to spend massively on advertising, or on established stars, or both.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The effect, the analysts agree, is alarming. Margins, even bolstered by video revenues and television sales, are frail. Mr Vogel says that the domestic box-office revenues of the top 20 films are no bigger in real terms than they were in the early 1980s. Mr Londoner thinks film-company profits may fall by almost a third this year, admittedly from a peak reached last year. Worse may lie ahead if the economy turns down or if the plethora of digital-television stations coaxes people to stay at home and watch films cheaply on the small screen, not expensively on the big one.

<h1>Not so mobile</h1>
<p>
THE selling point of a mobile telephone is that you can take it with you. But not too far, at least in Europe. Several of Europe's network operators doctor the handsets that they sell subscribers so that they are virtually useless if the subscriber switches network.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The operators subsidise as much as two-thirds of the price of handsets to encourage subscribers to sign up. If subscribers take the telephones to another network before they have paid back the subsidy, the network loses. But doctoring the handset locks subscribers into the first network they sign up for: few throw away a perfectly good digital handset (worth $500 or more, even if they paid considerably less for it) simply to get cheaper calls with another operator.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A case of monopolistic abuse? The European Commission is now investigating one particular scheme, known as subscriber identification module locking. Customers with <font size=-1>SIM</font>-locked telephones who want to change operators either have to buy a new (and often almost identical) handset or pay a hefty fee, sometimes as high as $220, to have their telephones unlocked. Earlier this month, Karel Van Miert, the European competition commissioner, wrote to every mobile-phone operator and manufacturer in the <font size=-1>EU</font>, warning them that <font size=-1>SIM</font>-locking was anti-competitive.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Operators who sell <font size=-1>SIM</font>-locked phones, such as Britain's Orange Personal Communications, argue that they do so for security reasons. A handset will work only with its <font size=-1>SIM</font> card; and that card will work only with its original network, so thieves will not be able to take stolen handsets elsewhere. True, but there are less drastic ways to deal with this. The <font size=-1>GSM</font> specifications, which cover most digital networks, allocate a unique number to each handset; if operators were to share a list of stolen-handset numbers, thieves would be equally hamstrung.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Only a few of Europe's 33 digital phone operators use <font size=-1>SIM</font>-locking. Most others that subsidise handsets use fixed-term contracts to earn back their investment. However, Britain's Office of Fair Trading has already warned British suppliers to stop the practice. Phone users may yet roam free.</td></tr></table>

<p><b>The Internet</b></p>
<h1>Re-engineering peer review</h1>

<font size=1>HELSINGOR</font><p><b>The Internet was developed by scientists for scientists, but many now fear that its anarchic style could endanger the quality of research. The threat is an opportunity in disguise</b></p>

<p>SOME may question the purpose of the Organisation for Economic Co-operation and Development, but it certainly knows how to throw a good conference. Its latest bash--"The Global Research Village" has just been held near Helsingor (better known to Shakespeare lovers as Elsinore) in Denmark. The topic was how the Internet might help science. This might be thought ironic, as the thing was largely created by scientists in the first place. But international organisations have to justify their existence somehow, and even scientists are not above a little prompting on how best to use their toys. Those who have done well under the old system are sometimes as suspicious of new machines as any Luddites.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In general, there was wide agreement about the benefits of the Internet for the exchange of scientific information. But there was also concern about what it might do to the quality of that information. In particular, the experts attending the conference were near-unanimous in dismissing electronic challenges to the time-honoured tradition of peer review for scientific publications. They should not have been.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Peer review is what happens when a hopeful scientist submits an article to a distinguished journal. After several months (that is if things go fast), he receives a couple of anonymous reviews from scientific "peers"--experts in his field, chosen by the journal's editor. If the reviews are laudatory, all is well. If not, the rejected author may either revise his manuscript or, if he feels the criticism is unwarranted, take the chance of sending his work to a less exalted publication.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As Stevan Harnad of the University of Southampton points out, the system works in the sense that, in the end, almost everything gets published. Somewhere in the hierarchy of journals ranging from the renowned, such as <i>Nature</i>, to the utterly obscure, it will find a niche. It is then up to the reader to assess the quality of a piece. The quality of the publication will help him do that. But the cost of the service is high, not just in terms of paper and printing (on some estimates, electronic journals will reduce publishing costs by 70%), but also because the author assigns his copyright to the journal in order to reach his audience, in what Dr Harnad terms the scientists' Faustian bargain.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many scientists grumble about the peer-review system. Much of the discontent is the sour grapes of rejected authors. But even believers in the system recognise its weaknesses. It can be frustratingly slow, it is not immune to abuse by powerful or unscrupulous scientists, and it has a history of remarkable failures, where great discoveries have been rejected by incredulous or uncomprehending peers, or where fraudulent results have won the endorsement of eminent scientists.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Internet has the potential to shake up the established order for the better in three respects. The most humdrum is that, by forcing paper publishers to go electronic, it is bound to speed up peer review (though lackadaisical reviewers will still be a problem).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A more ambitious goal of Internet enthusiasts is to legitimise preprints--unofficial versions of manuscripts that circulate while waiting for peer reviewers' deliberations. Paper preprints are already a common currency of scientific research, and in fast-moving fields hot preprints can be more sought after than stale publications. Paul Ginsparg of the Los Alamos e-Print Archive in New Mexico and his colleagues have developed the Los Alamos Physics Information Service in which 70 preprints a day are put into the archive. This represents about half the current output in physics worldwide, and the database is "visited" by over 40,000 physicists a day. The venture is so successful that so-called mirrors of this database are being established at websites around the world to avoid traffic congestion on the Internet.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But preprint archives are just the tip of the iceberg. The real excitement lies in the possibility of experimenting with alternatives to conventional peer reviewing. Instead of one or two reviewers, simple software would allow any interested scientist to comment on a preprint. In a model originally suggested by Dr Ginsparg, the comments would be appended to the article for subsequent readers to view. The author could delete comments he finds unhelpful or inappropriate, but he would be advised to be selective--an article with no comments is obviously one that has attracted either no attention, or awful reviews.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;An even simpler version of such "open peer commentary" could consist of readers assigning stars, as in a Michelin restaurant guide, to articles. The possibilities are endless. For the moment, though, even pioneers such as Dr Ginsparg are hesitating to take the plunge, at least until the concept of preprint archives is more firmly established. In any case, open commentary is unlikely to occur by fiat. It will, rather, evolve gradually in specialised sub-fields, in response to demand and to the incessant tug of technology.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Critics of open commentary see all sorts of problems ahead. The chief worry is that high-quality work will be drowned in a flood of dubious data and poor prose. In fact, peer review already lets a lot of this through. And although the Internet provides even easier access for the great unwashed of science, it also promises more powerful means of filtering the information they produce. The real challenge is more likely to lie in legal questions of intellectual property and patents. International patent law requires that inventions be kept secret until a patent is filed. Paper preprints, however, are generally exempted from this stricture because they are distributed in such limited numbers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>OECD</font> could help here by setting a high priority on sorting out the legal aspects of Internet publication, although international agreements in this area will take years to forge. In the meantime, politicians can take the initiative in more direct ways. In Helsingor, Denmark's minister of research and information technology, Frank Jensen, announced plans to give scientists cheap access to a high-speed optical fibre network funded by his ministry if, in exchange, they agreed to publish their preprints and articles on the Internet. It would be a modest step towards greater scientific openness, but even this will probably irritate many researchers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That is a shame. The opportunity to experiment with electronic peer review ought to be seized with relish. Experiments, after all, are the essence of science. Peer review is not itself a product of the scientific method (what is the statistical significance of two reviewers?), so there is every reason to believe that it can be improved upon. The Internet provides a wonderful opportunity for such experiments. If scientists do not try, and politicians do not encourage them, no one will ever be much the wiser.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?835398000,iss">Search</a>

<html><head><title>The only man for Russia</title></head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<p align=center><img src="http://www.economist.com/econlogosmall.gif" width=78 height=39  alt="The Economist"></p>

<h1><center>The only man for Russia</center></h1>

THE alternatives are clear. Of the two men leading the race to become Russia's next president, one can fairly claim that he would try to give his country a modern, prosperous and democratic future. The other offers the near-certainty of a return to the surly, squalid isolation of the past. That is not to say that Boris Yeltsin is perfect, or that Gennady Zyuganov is Stalin warmed up. The chances are, however, that Russia under Mr Yeltsin would turn the right corner, and stay there; whereas Russia under his Communist rival would turn its back on reform, at least for a while, and perhaps embrace once again many grim aspects of its Soviet past.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is often said that the market is now too well established in Russia even for Communists to replace it with central planning; that the main reforms already enacted are irreversible; and that Russia's Communists, like those elsewhere in Eastern Europe, will in time, willy-nilly, have to become social democrats. Alas, each of these assertions is based more on hope than on certainty. It is far from sure that a President Zyuganov would be persuaded by the <font size=-1>IMF</font> and Russia's other creditors to junk almost every main promise in his manifesto: price and exchange controls, wage and pension increases, protectionism and subsidies to clapped-out industries. If these were to be abandoned, they would be much more likely to go after the inevitable collapse of the rouble, a drying up of investment, hyperinflation and a further impoverishment of the Russian people.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Zyuganov evinces no faith in democracy. He has failed to reassure the many Russians who do not wish to go back to the old days yet are understandably confused by the buffeting they have received in the past five years. Instead he has pandered to those with a xenophobic or anti-Semitic streak. His strongest appeal is to Russia's core of diehard disgruntlement.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Office sometimes changes politicians. Nonetheless, it is plain that Mr Zyuganov is, at bottom, much more like a Soviet Communist than a modern democrat. Like other members of his party, he is virtually unrepentant about Soviet communism's obscene past. He frequently praises Stalin, shrugging off the tyrant's crimes when not denying them altogether. As president, he would find it hard to act upon his party's dangerous insistence that the Soviet Union still legally exists. Even so, Russia's relations both with its former dominions and with the West would be bound to worsen.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Yeltsin is far from being a presidential paragon. His five years in office have provided roller-coaster excitement, sometimes making him a hero of democracy (bravely defying the back-to-Brezhnev coup-makers of 1991), at other times letting him display the worst tendencies of tsarist authoritarianism. He has overseen the wiping out of private savings (in 1992), the shelling of a rebellious parliament (in autumn 1993), the crash of the rouble (a year later) and a crassly bloody attempt (in winter 1994) to prevent Chechnya's secession. Most Russians feel, rightly or wrongly, less well off than five years ago. Still more are horrified by the upsurge of crime and the blatant new disparities of wealth.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Reformers have been appalled at the president's inconstancy. On occasion, in order to match the jingoism of his rivals, he has been quite ready to give his foreign policy an anti-western tilt. More worryingly, he has chosen, when under pressure, to surround himself with roughnecks and fixers, many of them reeking of the crony capitalism and racketeering that have so disfigured the new order. He has had two heart attacks. He sometimes appears drunk. This newspaper, 18 months ago, declared him "the wrong man" for the job.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet nobody on the ballot this Sunday would do it better. That reflects partly upon the quality of the candidates, but partly also on Mr Yeltsin, who, despite his record of mistakes, also has some notable successes to his name. Indeed, taken in the round, his achievements far outweigh his shortcomings.
</p><p><b>The bright side</b>
<br>He did not do it alone, but Boris Yeltsin helped destroy an evil empire. He has established private property as a foundation of personal liberty. Though it is vastly biased in his favour at this electoral moment, he has freed the press. Millions of Russians, once cooped up in a huge cage, now travel the world. Criminal and civil codes of justice have been enacted, a constitutional court is finding its feet. Above all, an elected Duma has settled down to the business of making laws and checking the powers of a strong executive president. A stockmarket and securities and exchange commission are functioning. Some 40m Russians own shares. The private sector contributes more than 70% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>. Nearly 1m small businesses have sprung up. Queues have gone.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even if Mr Yeltsin wins, though, the battle will not be over. His campaign has been run by reformers, not his bad-hat cronies. But a second-term Mr Yeltsin might well be tempted to relax in the flush of victory. He might soon face an economic and political crisis. The essential task of bringing interest rates down and closing the budget deficit could, probably should, destroy hundreds of dodgy new banks. The choice of a new prime minister (who would at least temporarily succeed the president, should he die in office) will prompt a fierce tussle with a still predominantly hostile Duma. It will be a relentless struggle to ram through essential reforms--of the tax and legal systems, and in agriculture, to name but a few.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even harder will be the job of creating a sense of civic decency among a people whose morals have been warped by 74 years of Communist horror. Russians are not congenitally unsuited to democracy (see <a href="sf1.html">pages</a>). But it is hardly surprising that Mr Yeltsin, in five years, has failed to infect them with liberal values: he is not unequivocally committed to them himself. That may be a task for his successor. It is certainly not one that Mr Zyuganov would tackle. Elections are seldom make-or-break affairs. This one just might be. A Zyuganov victory would be a disaster for Russia. A Yeltsin victory might, by contrast, secure the future of reform. Demography is on its side: the young are much keener on the changes than the old, so four years hence the Communists' electoral chances may be much slimmer. For all his faults, Russia should let Mr Yeltsin continue what he has started.

<h2>In and out</h2>
<p><b>Bob Dole</b>, the Republican presidential candidate, retired from the Senate after 35 years in Congress and 11 years as Republican leader of the Senate. Senator Trent Lott of Mississippi was elected as the new majority leader.<p>
President Clinton apologised for obtaining the <b>confidential FBI files </b>on hundreds of Republicans. Hearings were nevertheless scheduled in Congress, and the Whitewater independent counsel began an investigation.<p>
A federal court declared that a new law restricting "<b>indecency</b>" on the Internet infringed the constitutional right of free speech.<p>
Visiting Canada, Mexico's President Ernesto Zedillo roundly condemned the United States' <b>Helms-Burton law</b> against trade with Cuba, and was roundly applauded by Parliament. The two countries are co-ordinating tactics.<p>
Also visiting, France's prime minister, Alain Jupp&eacute;, told would-be secessionist <b>Quebeckers</b> that they could always count on "the mother country" whatever choices they might make--but carefully did not advise what that should be.<p>
The lower house of <b>Colombia's</b> Congress voted in favour of President Ernesto Samper. As expected; his party controls it.

<h2>A beef thaw</h2>
<p>The rhetoric of <b>Europe's beef war</b> remained heated, but there were signs of compromise. Britain presented a new plan for lifting the <font size=-1>EU</font>'s ban on exports of British beef and eased its own ban on <font size=-1>EU</font> decisions. Jacques Santer, president of the European Commission, predicted that the dispute would be settled before the <font size=-1>EU</font>'s summit in Florence on June 21st-22nd.<p>
Talks on the future of <b>Northern Ireland </b>got off to an inauspicious start in Belfast. The <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s refusal to declare a ceasefire meant that its political wing, Sinn Fein, was excluded. And unionist parties objected to the appointment by the British and Irish governments of George Mitchell, a former American senator, as chairman of the talks.<p>
Negotiators seeking to end the 18-month war in <b>Chechnya </b>agreed that Russian troops would withdraw from the rebel province in August and that Chechen fighters would disarm.<p>
President Yeltsin approached <b>Russia's presidential election </b>on June 16th as firm favourite. A second run-off will be held if no candidate wins more than half the votes on Sunday. An explosion in the Moscow metro, apparently caused by a bomb, killed four people. The mayor of Moscow, Yuri Luzhkov, who is running for re-election on Sunday, blamed extremist political groups for that and two other incidents.<p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
Germany's Christian Democrats, senior partners in the ruling coalition, agreed to liberalise the country's notoriously restrictive <b>shopping hours</b>. The cabinet agreed to changes in <b>unemployment benefits </b>to save DM17 billion ($11 billion) by 2000.<p>
<b>Spain</b> introduced measures to boost growth and make its economy more flexible. They include land reform and more competition in energy and telecoms. A package of business-friendly tax cuts is expected to reduce government revenues by Pta200 billion ($1.55 billion) this year.<p>
Necmettin Erbakan, leader of <b>Turkey</b>'s Islamist Welfare Party, began talks on forming a new government after the collapse of the centre-right coalition. Tansu Ciller said her True Path Party, one of the two parties in the failed coalition, would consider an alliance with Welfare.

<h2>Arabs take stock</h2>
<p>Responding to Israel's election of Binyamin Netanyahu, Egypt invited all Arab League countries--bar Iraq--to a <b>Cairo summit</b>, starting on June 21st. In occupied southern Lebanon, Hizbullah guerrillas killed five soldiers in an Israeli patrol. Israel hit back with artillery fire, and threatened worse. Inside Israel, unidentified terrorists murdered an Israeli couple.<p>
Iran's government offered to send a delegation to look into charges that it backs an armed plot in <b>Bahrain</b>. Bahrain's government gave it a flea in the ear, and announced the arrest of the alleged (Bahraini) mastermind of the affair.<p>
<b>Nigeria</b> softened its legal rules. People detained under one decree of the military regime will be able to seek release through the courts. And army officers will no longer sit on "disturbances" tribunals like the one that convicted Ken Saro-Wiwa; tribunal verdicts will also be subject to appeal.

<h2>Testing</h2>
<p>A ship owned by Greenpeace, an environmental group, anchored off Shanghai in protest at <b>China's nuclear tests</b>. The ship was boarded by Chinese officials and later left.<p>
In a campaign called Strike Hard, China <b>executed 66 people </b>convicted of murder, rape, drug dealing and other crimes.<p>
A report by India's Central Bureau of Investigation alleged that Narasimha Rao, leader of the Congress party and until recently prime minister, had been involved in <b>vote buying</b>. Mr Rao has denied the allegation.<p>
In an exchange of letters the prime ministers of <b>India and Pakistan </b>proposed peace talks to "stabilise" the subcontinent. The last such talks were in 1994.<p>
In a general election deemed by foreign observers to be mostly peaceful and fair, <b>Bangladeshis</b> turned out in record numbers. Sheikh Hasina's Awami League seemed to have won most seats, but not enough to govern on its own.<p>

<h2>Up in the air</h2>
<p>(See <a href="wtw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>British Airways struck a deal with <b>American Airlines</b> to form the world's most formidable air alliance. A code-sharing deal will give both companies access to huge new markets, with cost savings even greater than those gained from <font size=-1>BA</font>'s link with troubled <font size=-1>US</font>Air. The deal depends on America granting it antitrust immunity. This, in turn, depends on Britain agreeing to an "open skies" policy that would allow American carriers freer access to London's main airport, Heathrow, and "beyond rights" , the freedom to pick up passengers and take them to third countries.<p>
News Corp, the media group headed by Rupert Murdoch, is to spend $300m-400m over the next two years setting up a 100-channel <b>satellite-TV business</b> in Japan to be called <font size=-1>J</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font>.<p>
The new Portuguese government's ambitious privatisation plans were rewarded when demand for shares in the second stage of <b>Portugal Telecom</b>'s privatisation far outweighed supply. The government sold 22% of its holding, raising 150 billion escudos ($947m) and leaving it with a 51% stake.<p>
The British government's prospectus for the privatisation of <b>British Energy</b>, which runs eight modern nuclear reactors, was rather more cautious. Somewhere between &#163;2 billion ($3.1 billion) and &#163;2.4 billion will be raised. This is at the low end of market expectations.<p>
<b>Gazprom</b>, Russia's gas monopoly, bought 30% of <font size=-1>NTV</font>, the country's main commercial television station. It will share control of <font size=-1>NTV</font> with Most, a private banking and property group.<p>
Daewoo, a South Korean conglomerate, said that it was ready to buy <b>Thomson </b>Multimedia, which is for sale as part of a privatisation by the French government. The defence arm of Thomson could be bought by France's Lagard&egrave;re Groupe, which is bidding against Alcatel Alsthom, a French firm willing to take control of Thomson in its entirety.<p>
Britain's Boots is to become sole owner of loss-making <b>Do It All</b>. WH Smith pulled out of the joint venture, handing over its 50% stake to Boots for a nominal &#163;1 and agreeing to inject &#163;50m ($77m) into the do-it-yourself chain over four years. WH Smith also announced a shake-up of its flagging retail chain, which includes Waterstone's, a bookseller, and Virgin Our Price, a music business. The group is to write off &#163;285m ($435m) and shed 400 jobs.<p>
<b>Levi-Strauss</b>, a clothing firm, is to pay bonuses of a year's extra pay to all its 37,000 employees in 2002--provided cash-flow targets are met, as the firm expects.<p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
The head of China's central bank said it plans to make <b>the yuan</b> convertible in time for the annual <font size=-1>IMF</font> meeting in Hong Kong next year, which China, after the July 1997 handover, will host.<p>
America took its trade complaint about Japan's paper and film market to the <b>World Trade Organisation</b>, and dropped its threat of bilateral sanctions.

<h2>Banque ruptured</h2>
<p>(See <a href="wtw2.gif">chart</a>)<br> Only a year after its second bail-out, <b>Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais</b> is apparently going back to the French government in search of more cash. The state-owned bank, which produced a token profit in 1995 but shows every sign of sinking into loss again this year, says the burden of its restructuring costs is too much. The government, which has twice bailed out the stricken bank, to the tune of FFr21.4 billion ($4.1 billion) in all, claims there will be no more state aid.<p>
As <b>Orange County</b>, California, emerged from bankruptcy 18 months after running up losses of $1.6 billion in bad investments, it marked the occasion with five lawsuits worth $1.5 billion against some of its advisers. They include Standard &amp; Poor's credit-rating agency and a broker, Morgan Stanley. The county is already suing another broker, Merrill Lynch, and its former accountants, <font size=-1>KPMG</font> Peat Marwick, for $5 billion.<p>
<b>National Westminster</b>, one of Britain's big clearing banks, is paying Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan $590m for Greenwich Capital Holdings, a leading American broker and bond trader, to fill a gap in NatWest Markets, the bank's burgeoning investment-banking operation.<p>
Singapore's Commercial Affairs Department said that it would not bring charges against two of <b>Barings</b>' main employees in Asia at the time of the bank's collapse.<p>
<b>Takashimaya</b>, a smart Japanese retailer, fired its president after the firm was caught paying off gangsters who threatened to disrupt shareholder meetings.<p>
An appeal court upheld the 1992 conviction of <b>Carlo De Benedetti</b>, head of Olivetti, for his involvement in the 1982 collapse of Banco Ambrosiano, of which he was briefly deputy chairman in 1981, but reduced his prison term by nearly two years to 4.5 years. He plans to appeal to Italy's supreme court, a process that could take several more years.<p>
The <b>London Stock Exchange</b> appointed a new chief executive, five months after sacking Michael Lawrence. Gavin Casey, a senior executive at Merrill Lynch, will oversee the final stages of the modernisation of the exchange's trading and share-settlement systems.<p>

<h1>Is Russia different?</h1>
<p><b>Yes, Russia is different. No, this does not mean that democracy and free markets are bound to fail there</b></p>


<p>"RUSSIA is a special world...a special type of civilisation." It is "hostile in its soul to the West" because of the West's "extreme individualism, militant soullessness, religious indifference [and] adherence to mass culture."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These remarks obviously tell you a lot about the writer: Gennady Zyuganov, the leader of Russia's Communist Party. Do they also tell you anything useful about Russia? Is it "a special type of civilisation"? And does that mean--as some say--that it can never be a democracy or a free market? (See <a href="sf1.gif">table</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the face of it, the standing of Boris Yeltsin in the opinion polls before the election provides an optimistic answer. He is the candidate of liberal reform and his popularity suggests Russians are willing to follow him as he moves his country closer to the West. Optimists could even make out a case for their view of Russia if he were to lose: voters, after all, might well reject a president who has presided over a rise in crime, a collapse in living standards and massive human-rights abuses in Chechnya. Similar rejections have occurred in every formerly-communist East-European country. If it happened in Russia, it would not necessarily mean Russians had turned against the whole idea of liberal reform.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such arguments cut no ice with pessimists. To them, Mr Yeltsin's popularity stems from his manipulation of the levers of power, from his willingness to adopt his opponents' nationalist agenda and even from the traditional Russian respect for the man in the Kremlin. Some would go further: the stubborn popularity of the Communists, they say, reflects something deep-seated about the Russian character. As Thomas Masaryk, the first president of Czechoslovakia (and a Russian scholar) put it: "The Russians are very revolutionary. They are not very democratic." Eventually, this will lead them to reject the political and economic arrangements of the West--and this might happen even if Mr Yeltsin were to win. So which view of Russia is right?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One piece of evidence that Mr Zyuganov is justified in what he says is that so many--perhaps most--Russians agree with him. And if they think Russia is different, then that is part of what makes it so."We do not belong to any of the great families of mankind, neither to the East nor to the West" wrote Petr Chaadaev, one of the earliest "Westernisers" (those who thought Russia should modernise by learning from the West). Nikolai Mikhailovsky, who translated John Stuart Mill and Karl Marx into Russian, also thought that "Russia can lay down a new historical path from that taken by Europe."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And these were Westernisers. How much more nationalist have been the "Slavophiles", who, like Mr Zyuganov, thought Russia could learn useful lessons only from its own history. The founder of Slavophilism, Alexei Khomyakov, called Russia "God's instrument". Dostoevsky thought that "Our great Russia will speak its new word, a word never heard before by the world." In 1992 the head of parliament, Ruslan Khasbulatov, wrote that "While [Peter the Great] imposed elements of European culture in Russia...the spiritual and cultural fabric of the people remained untouched. As a result, we have Russia, which is neither Europe nor Asia but a very special, very peculiar part of the world."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The peculiarity lies not only in Russian opinion but also in (as Communists like to say) "the objective facts of history". "There was no Renaissance among us" lamented an early-20th-century philosopher, Nikolai Berdyaev. "We never had feudalism, the more's the pity" said Alexander Pushkin, Russia's national poet. And Russia was never part of the Roman empire.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the fact that Russians believe themselves to be different and have some historical justification for their belief does not get you very far. Every country thinks it is distinctive. An eminent political scientist, for example, has just published a book called "American Exceptionalism"*<font size=1>1</font>. And every country's history backs up its belief.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The question is what do you conclude from this. Do you say, with Mr Zyuganov, that the "western" rules of economics and liberal democracy will be rejected in Russia? Or do you say, with Henry Ford, that "history is bunk" and, as Dmitri Likhachev, a respected intellectual, puts it, "there is no such thing as the Russian soul; we can create whatever future we want."?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Those who think Russia is so different that it cannot change make three claims. First, they say, Russia is naturally collectivist, so the market economy will not work there. Second, they say it is inherently autocratic, so democracy will fail. And third, that it is inherently anti-western, which means that not only will it reject "western" ideas about markets and democracy but it will either run an anti-western foreign policy or perhaps sink into the isolation of its cultural peculiarities. Take these in turn.
</p><p><b>All for one?</b>
<br>It is true that collectivism has been extremely strong in Russian history. After the abolition of serfdom in 1867, serfs did not own their land; they held it in common. It is also true that communism entrenched the collectivist tradition. Uniquely, Russia was transformed from peasant farming to an industrial economy under communist rule. And, compared with other countries, an extra Russian generation lived under communism: no Russian remembers the Tsarist stage of capitalism.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What is more doubtful is whether the collectivist-communist tradition means Russians are bad at private enterprise. As a general rule, claims that markets will fail anywhere because they are "western" ought to treated with extreme scepticism. Not only do they work fine in Japan--a country far less western than Russia--but evidence from all countries suggests that cultural factors are little use as guides to economic behaviour. The reason is that they are so varied and complicated that they contain features which both help and hinder growth. So it was in East Asia where Confucianism was once taken to inhibit business.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And so it is in Russia. Collectivism hindered private enterprise. But under the Tsars, life in the towns was always more individualistic than in the countryside. Factories were privately owned and in 1880-1917 Russia enjoyed a boom comparable to that of 1870s America or China today. Even under the Communists, much then happened to erode the collectivist spirit. In 1939, as Stalin's crash-course industrialisation began, two-thirds of the population lived on the land, a share comparable to Morocco's. Now, three-quarters of Russians live in cities (a higher proportion than in Italy) and 98% of the population can read and write (a rate higher than in Britain). Town life and education do not necessarily destroy collectivism but they do undermine it for, in Russia, the collective tradition was rooted in the illiterate countryside.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Russians are not hostile to private enterprise. A study carried out before the reforms found that Russian attitudes to economic incentives and "fair prices" were roughly the same as those of Americans*<font size=1>2</font>. Since then, markets have taken root and anecdotal evidence suggests Russians are just as keen at profit-seeking as anyone else. True, there is a popular association of business with crime--as in all post-communist countries. But, as elsewhere, Russians want more equitable income distribution rather than the complete reversal of market reforms. Obviously, growth and macroeconomic stability are far from guaranteed in Russia. But it does seem that cultural factors--especially collectivism--are unlikely to explain Russia's economic failures.
</p><p><b>Or one over all?</b>
<br>When the debate turns to politics, claims about Russian distinctiveness subtly change. Instead of stressing the collectivist tradition that everyone be consulted--something which should, on the face of it, help democracy--those who argue that Russia is different emphasise the country's autocratic tradition. This appears to support their view that Russia cannot have democracy--at least not yet.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Clearly, until 1991, Russia had neither an elected government nor a democratic opposition (the opponents to Tsarism were mostly revolutionaries). But this in itself is not proof that Russia is stuck with autocracy. This century, Germany, Spain, Austria and Italy have all abandoned authoritarian forms of government, some as extreme as Russia's. And, whatever one thinks of the result, the Russian government has unquestionably changed. President and parliament are elected (the presidential election will be the eighth nation-wide poll in seven years). There is freedom of assembly and a free-ish press. Russia has been transformed from the most centralised state in Europe to a decentralised federation, with roughly half of public spending going through local governments.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of course, if Russian politics can change once, it can change back. And it might do that because the Russians do not seem committed to democracy: 23% of electors voted for Vladimir Zhirinovsky in 1993; now, only half of Russians think they need a democratic system and a mere 19% think they actually have one.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But even supposing such attitudes persist--and they may be products of fatigue and confusion at the outset of democracy--there remains doubt as to whether they matter as much as one might assume. For surprising as it may seem, democracies can stumble along with a remarkable cargo of confusion and apathy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A study of two American towns (Ann Arbor, Michigan, and Tallahassee, Florida) tested the assumption that for a democracy to work well, you need full commitment to democratic principles and agreement on what these mean in practice. It found the assumption wanting. Almost everyone agreed with the propositions that "Democracy is the best form of government" and that "Public officials should be chosen by majority vote." But most people also thought that "If a communist were legally elected mayor of this city, the people should not allow him to take office." And "In a city referendum deciding on tax-supported undertakings, only taxpayers should be allowed to vote." Supporting democracy, it turns out, is one thing; understanding what democratic behaviour is, is another. Yet no one thinks democracy does not exist in Ann Arbor or Tallahassee--or in America generally. The conclusion is that democracies do not seem to require consistent support from all the people, all the time.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So, though Russians are even less supportive of democracy than Americans, this may not matter as much as it might appear. Only a relatively modest amount of popular support is really necessary--and Russia has that: millions demonstrated for free elections in the late 1980s; scores of political parties have sprung up (43 asked to be registered for December's parliamentary election); and the turn-out at elections has remained reasonably high (50%-70%) considering there have been so many of them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Clearly, Russian democracy is not stable. Clearly, it will not end up looking the same as the democratic systems of other countries: it may not be organised around two big parties; it may well be corrupt; it is likely to be highly personalised. But it will be a democracy, of sorts, for the evidence from other countries suggests that democracy is so simple the Russians can do it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The third claim--that Russians are innately anti-western--has two aspects to it:<p>
<font size=-1><li></font>Geography. "We are consumed with geography" writes Vyacheslav Ivanov, a literary critic, "and we have no real history." Vast size is not unique to Russia. America, Canada and Australia are continent-sized countries thinly populated by people of European descent. But Russia is larger than any of them and its sheer extent matters. It means that Russia is likely to maintain the huge army (over 1m men) that has grown up to defend Russia's empty spaces. It also provides the country with a range of non-western foreign-policy concerns. Sharing borders with China and North Korea, and sharing the same part of the world as Iran, Russia will always have more "eastern" foreign-policy worries than any European country. An expansionist China would be a concern for Germany or France; for Russia it would be a real military threat. Geography, then, gives Russia a unique set of interests--and these interests could indeed produce conflicts with either West or East.
<p><font size=-1><li></font>
The Russian soul. This article has argued that Russians are less inimical to democracy and free markets than they sometimes appear. Nevertheless, a last possibility has to be considered: that they are unstable in their views, prepared to swing behind one populist or another and likely to be unreliable both in domestic policy and international conduct. This is especially worrying at a time when democracy is in its infancy and many foreign-policy interests are relatively unfamiliar (since Russia has not existed within its current borders before).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In stressing the difference between Russia and the West, the Slavophiles argued that the West was synonymous with rationality, scientific enquiry and self interest. These, they claimed, were inimical to the Russian character. As Dostoevsky put it: "It is indeed possible, and sometimes positively imperative (in my view) to act directly contrary to one's own best interest. One's own free and unfettered volition, one's own caprice... that is one's best and greatest good."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is, by western standards, an extraordinary belief. How is one to judge its importance? Certainly, the non-western, irrational strain has been strong in Russia. But, as with Slavophilism, it was stronger among a literary-cum-philosophical elite than among the population at large. And whether Russia's general cultural beliefs and norms make Russia anti-western remains highly debatable: its religious traditions are Judaeo-Christian; its artistic ones European (consider Russia's contribution to those European forms, the novel, the opera, the ballet and drama). Certainly, too, many Russians feel ambivalent about the West and object to what they see as outsiders "meddling" in their own affairs. But these feelings are stronger among the old than the young and so--for good or ill--are on the wane.
</p><p><b>Nationalists ashamed</b>
<br>Above all, Russian nationalism seems, like Slavophilism, to be more an elite concern than a grass-roots one. Many politicians claim to be highly nationalistic. Virtually all promise to make Russia a great power. Yet when asked to list the problems facing their country, ordinary Russians put other concerns top: crime, inflation, Chechnya. Surprisingly, the evidence of opinion polls does not show nationalism surging back. According to polls conducted in 1991-95*<font size=1>3</font>, less than one-third of young people see military service as a "duty and honour"; just 10% regarded "fidelity to national traditions" as "the main influence on matters of faith and morals". The pollsters concluded that "People shun identification with this country and this nation."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such nihilistic attitudes may be a temporary reaction to the immense problems of reform. Sooner or later, Russians will start rebuilding their sense of nationhood. But, if these polls are right, they are likely to do so not on the rejected features of the old Russia--collectivism, autocracy and irrationality--but on the qualities they now say they respect most: civil rights; freedom of conscience; freedom of expression. These are attributes not of a messianic, peculiar state, but of what Russian reformers have long claimed to be their ideal: a normal country--whatever that means.

<h1>Yeltsin out in front</h1>

<font size=1>MOSCOW</font><p><b>But nothing is certain in, or after, Russia's presidential election
</B><p>IF THERE are Russians to whom Boris Yeltsin has not promised a handout or subsidy in the course of his re-election campaign, they should stake their claims fast: the first round of voting takes place on Sunday. Moreover, the Central Bank has already lost its patience.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Last week Mr Yeltsin ordered the bank to find an unbudgeted $1 billion to help cover a government deficit widened materially by his own efforts. This week a miffed bank official responded by disclosing that reserves had fallen from $16 billion to $12.5 billion since April--the cost of propping up the rouble as it sagged under the weight of money being printed to cover Mr Yeltsin's campaign promises. The price of government securities has slumped.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The next fortnight could thus be a turbulent one for Russia's financial markets if all that money threatens to have been spent in vain, and Mr Yeltsin emerges from the first round with less than a commanding lead--or no lead at all--over his main rival, Gennady Zyuganov, the Communist candidate. It could also be a turbulent fortnight for Russia generally if an explosion in a Moscow metro train on June 11th, which left four dead and 12 injured, presaged an eruption of violence in what had been a generally peaceful campaign.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But for all the Central Bank's grimaces, the price of re-electing Mr Yeltsin "remains a great deal cheaper than the alternative", insists a member of the president's campaign staff--reasonably enough. For Mr Zyuganov has proposed a programme that would drag Russia back towards a planned economy and ruin its financial markets. Fear of its effects has been one of Mr Yeltsin's main campaign weapons.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another of his advantages has been his freedom to exploit shamelessly the powers of incumbency. His bogus but popular union treaty with Belarus in April and his peace negotiations with Chechen rebels have been masterpieces of political illusion. State-run television has given him adulatory coverage. Regional bigwigs have rallied to his cause.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The combination seems to have been effective. The latest poll conducted between June 5th and 10th by the All-Russia Centre for Public Opinion found 36% of voters backing Mr Yeltsin, putting him 12 points ahead of Mr Zyuganov. In January a poll by the same firm had shown Mr Zyuganov besting Mr Yeltsin by 20% to 8%. All nine other candidates lag far behind the two leaders.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dizzied by his ascent, Mr Yeltsin was predicting rashly this week that he would win a knock-out victory on Sunday--taking more than half the vote, and so obviating a run-off. His advisers, less cocksure, are planning for a run-off against Mr Zyuganov in a manner revealing of the Kremlin style. This week Sergei Filatov, head of Mr Yeltsin's re-election staff, said the second round might take place on Wednesday, July 3rd, and not, as hitherto expected, on Sunday, July 7th. (The law says a second round may be held up to 15 days after the result of the first round is declared.) To have the vote on a Wednesday, specially declared a holiday, should raise the turnout: if the run-off were held on a weekend, many Yeltsinites might head for their dachas rather than the polls.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Though most Russians may have come to expect a Yeltsin victory, few can have a clear view of what would follow in policy terms. Some may think the populist, free-spending Yeltsin of 1996 is here to stay. A forward-looking few want to see the return of the resolute, reforming Yeltsin of 1991-92. Others fear that the panicky, Chechnya-bashing Yeltsin of 1994-95 still lurks in the shadows. Probably, the president himself does not know how he would conduct himself. He might not even see his term out: at 65 he has already outlived the average Russian male of his generation by eight years. After two heart attacks in the past year, one priority for the re-elected president would have to be time off for by-pass surgery.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If Mr Yeltsin did opt for an energetic, all-systems-go second term, he would find plenty to occupy him. Among Russia's more urgent needs are a new tax code, a war on organised crime, a wholesale restructuring of government, a reappraisal of foreign-policy, a lasting peace deal in Chechnya, a reform of collectivised farming and a modernisation of the army. All this would demand a return of the brave Yeltsin of five years ago, willing to appoint strong ministers and give them their heads.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Alternatively, Mr Yeltsin might prove a spent force whose re-election campaign had been an end in itself. At best he might continue with the lax, avuncular populism that had proved a voter-pleaser this year. At worst infirmity might leave him an absentee leader, his powers captured by the clique around him. Neither need spell disaster in the short-term: a re-election of Mr Yeltsin would alone be enough to encourage investment and get Russia's economy moving. But a spendthrift or directionless government would mean Russia's hopes of real recovery would sink beneath the weight of unreformed institutions and dud industries.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Should Mr Yeltsin win, he might signal his intentions by choosing a new prime minister (see <a href="eu1.gif">table</a>). Russia's constitution obliges a "newly elected president" to seek the consent of the lower house of parliament, the Duma, for his nominee; if the Duma rejects three nominees, the president can dissolve it. Were Mr Yeltsin planning a quiet second term, he would probably seek a compromise candidate acceptable to the Communist-dominated Duma. But if he planned a gung-ho second term, he might court confrontation, hoping that a dissolution and a fresh general election would give him a more liberal Duma with which to work. Some argue for the existence of a third possibility: that Mr Yeltsin might dispute that he was a "newly elected president" , hang on to his current prime minister, Viktor Chernomyrdin, and so snub the Duma squarely.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such calculations presume that Russia's democracy has grown strong enough to take power-politics between president and Duma in its stride. Probably it has, even though this election is the first for the presidency of a fully sovereign Russia. But Tuesday's terrorist bomb represented someone's version of dissent; and Mr Zyuganov has done democracy no favours by threatening that millions of Communist voters might take to the streets if they felt victory had been denied them by ballot-box fraud. The final doubt hangs over the willingness of Mr Yeltsin and his clique to relinquish power peacefully within the 30 days prescribed by law if the vote goes against them. With luck, it will not be tested.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?834793200,iss">Search</a>

<p><b>Education</b></p>
<h1>The unskilled nation</h1>

<p>SIR HUMPHREY APPLEBY, the slippery civil servant in the <font size=-1>BBC</font>'s political comedy series "Yes, Minister", would have called it "courageous"--ie, foolhardy. After 17 years in office, and a matter of months before an election, the government has published a detailed study admitting that education and skill levels in Britain are below those in Germany, France, America and Singapore. Unsurprisingly, Labour said it was a damning indictment of the government's record. Gillian Shephard, the education and employment secretary, hopes that voters will give the government credit for its honesty and will recall that, until recently, Labour opposed many of the government's school reforms. She has also announced a package of further reforms in response to the study's findings.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The study, published on June 13th as part of the annual white paper on competitiveness, compared the qualifications held by the British population with those in the four other countries, chosen as key "economic competitors". This "skills audit" found that only 45% of British adults have qualifications that are at least the equivalent of <font size=-1>GCSE</font> grade "<font size=-1>C</font>" in maths, English and one other subject (see <a href="br1.gif">chart</a>), worse than all the other countries. The figure for Germany is 70%. Multinational firms were asked to compare their workers in each country. Confirming the findings of other recent studies, they reported that the British came bottom of the class at sums.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, America and Singapore did little better than Britain overall, even though their record of economic growth has been more impressive than Germany's in recent times. Germany's strong showing in part reflects its obsession with paper qualifications: some apprentices in Britain and elsewhere do not get a certificate when they complete their training, whereas their German counterparts almost always do.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When the multinational employers were asked about the actual skill levels of workers, as opposed to their paper qualifications, Germany's lead was not so strong, although British workers still lagged behind in a range of industries, from food to electronics. Comparisons of young people entering the labour market, as opposed to the population as a whole, suggest that Britain is improving its record on education and training, though not as rapidly as France. And Britain is second only to America in the proportion of the population with university-level qualifications.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even so, the findings of the skills audit add to the pressure that Mrs Shephard is under from some of her colleagues to regain the initiative after recent speeches by Tony Blair, Labour's leader, outlining bold plans for improving education and training. The day before the skills audit was published, Mrs Shephard announced a range of further reforms, including a drastic shake-up of teacher training. The universities and colleges which provide the initial training for teachers will, for the first time, have to follow a curriculum laid down by the government. Trainee teachers will spend less time on such things as psychology and "gender studies" and more time on practical teaching techniques--especially on how to teach children to read.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Those who run teacher-training courses are bound to squeal that the government is encroaching on their traditional academic freedom. But there may be less resistance than the government was expecting: the <font size=-1>NASUWT</font>, the second-largest teaching union, actually welcomed the proposals. Mrs Shephard's other plans, which include giving schools targets for improving their exam results, giving them greater powers to deal with disruptive pupils, and encouraging more schools to specialise in technology, are also unlikely to be too controversial. Labour has similar policies.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The government certainly deserves credit for being open about Britain's relatively poor educational performance, and its determination to do something about it. But, even if voters are impressed by this refreshing show of honesty, it seems unlikely to be enough on its own to restore the government's political fortunes. So it is a good job that Labour is promising to pursue much the same reforms with equal vigour.

<h1>Making it</h1>


"I DO not believe it is possible for Britain to trade its way into the future primarily as a service-dominated economy...A robust manufacturing base is a crucial element in a modern competitive economy." Thus, Tony Blair, the Labour leader, on June 11th, stating what is now conventional wisdom among British politicians after a brief period during the 1980s when the Tories bravely rose above it. Yet, whatever a future Labour government might do to boost manufacturing (and judging from Mr Blair's speech, it will not be much), manufacturing's share of Britain's <font size=-1>GDP</font> is likely to fall steadily, as it has since 1960 (see <a href="br2.gif">chart</a>). The fact is that Britain, contrary to Mr Blair's belief, already has a service-dominated economy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why British politicians so love manufacturing is hard to explain. Perhaps they recall that, when Britain was primarily a maker of things, it was also a global power. Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, shares the obsession. He justified last week's interest-rate cut by pointing to the lacklustre performance of manufacturing--output fell by 0.3% between March and April, and was barely up on a year earlier. He played down evidence of rising consumer confidence and spending, much of it in the service sector, which dwarfs manufacturing. Unemployment fell by 14,800 in May, to its lowest for five years, suggesting that the economy had no need of a rate cut.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Manufacturing dominates the political debate about Britain's economic performance. Mr Blair, for instance, accused British manufacturers of under-investing. Michael Heseltine, the deputy prime minister, countered by publishing a paper, "The <font size=-1>UK</font>'s Investment Performance: Fact and Fallacy". This claimed that British manufacturers' ratio of investment to output matched that of German and American firms, and disputed the view that British manufacturing plant and machinery is older than that of other industrial countries.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Blair quoted, approvingly, Adair Turner, the director-general of the Confederation of British Industry: "Despite the vitally important relative improvements in manufacturing over the last 12 to 15 years, <font size=-1>UK</font> productivity is still lagging behind major competitors." He took this to mean that the <font size=-1>CBI</font> thinks Britain is only halfway through a manufacturing recovery, and still has far to go.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Mr Blair missed the main point of the speech by Mr Turner from which the quote was lifted, which is that manufacturing is unlikely to be the main source of economic gains in the future. The big opportunity, and challenge for government, lies in improving the efficiency of the non-traded sectors of the economy, many of which are services. Mr Turner thinks Britain has done well in these sectors of late--compared with continental Europe, if not America--but that much remains undone. Some fresh thinking on this from Labour and the Tories, and less nostalgia for Britain's manufacturing past, would be welcome.

<p><b>Oxbridge</b></p>

<h1>A question of degree</h1>

<p>"WHY can't a woman be more like a man?" mused Henry Higgins in "My Fair Lady". At Oxford and Cambridge, many women rather wish they were. In 1995, about 17% of Oxford's male undergraduates came away with a first-class degree. Only 10% of the university's women managed this distinction. At Cambridge (where Oxonians might suspect that the marking is rather laxer) 23% of men took firsts, compared with 12% of women. So nettled has Oxford become at the gender gap that it recently decided to finance an official inquiry to study the issue.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At several of Britain's other elite universities men do slightly better than women. At Imperial College, London, for example, 21.5% of men got firsts last year, compared with 17.4% of women, and at the London School of Economics, the numbers were 8.6% and 6.5% respectively. But women at Exeter and London's University College were just as likely as men to win firsts; at Durham, Edinburgh and Essex they were not far behind and at London's Kings College women were actually more likely to win firsts than men.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Against this background, Oxbridge looks peculiar. And the gap is growing: in 1970 11.3% of Cambridge men took first-class honours as opposed to 9.4% of women. Oxford recorded similar figures.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What has changed, then, is not that the women have got worse, but that the men have got better faster. There are many plausible theories to explain the gap, but all fail to explain why it has grown over the years. Except one: that the growing inequality of the results is a side-effect of policies intended to make the universities more inclusive. In the past few decades, both Oxford and Cambridge have attempted to increase the enrolment of women and take a larger proportion of all their pupils from state rather than public (ie, private) schools.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Gerald McCrum, a retired Oxford engineering professor who is researching the gender gap, thinks that part of men's improved performance since 1970 may be the lopping off of the "weak tail" from the independent schools. For example, Christ Church was once known as the cream of Oxford--"rich, thick and full of clots". Candidates for a "gentleman's third" are now much rarer, as men who once would have got in by virtue of their breeding or the income of their fathers have been weeded out in favour of smart fellows from state schools--the likeliest group, male or female, to win a first. A second squeeze on candidates for a "gentleman's third" is that the percentage of men has dropped at Oxbridge from about 75% in 1970 to 60% today; the smaller pool may yield a larger proportion of first-class intellects.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At Cambridge, men from state and independent schools do about the same, suggesting that the admissions process there now works fairly efficiently in choosing them. At Oxford, state-school educated men do a bit better.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, the selection process does not seem to work as well for women, with those from independent schools doing significantly better than those from state schools, though still worse than the men. "The independent girls really are far better than the state girls at Oxford," Mr McCrum concludes. "Since the introduction of comprehensives, women from state schools have gone off the boil academically." The implication is that a higher proportion of private-school women might yield more firsts--a touchy class issue that neither university is eager to broach.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Researchers in both universities are looking at other theories as well:
<font size=-1><li></font><b>Patterns of intelligence:</b> There are two related hypotheses. One is that men mature later intellectually. This would explain why men do conspicuously better than women at Oxford and Cambridge, but not so on the <font size=-1>GCSE</font>s or <font size=-1>A</font>-levels. (Girls do better at <font size=-1>GCSE</font>s and about the same at <font size=-1>A</font>-levels). But if this were the case, one would expect it to be universally true, not just at Oxbridge.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The other is that while men may mature later, they are also more likely to reach the greatest intellectual heights. Men dominate the top and bottom of the intelligence scale, while women cluster in the middle. There is much evidence to this effect: the ranks of Nobel prize winners, and village idiots, are mostly male. This is persuasive, but it does not explain why women with the same <font size=-1>A</font>-levels are less likely to excel than men--or why the gap is increasing.
<font size=-1><li></font><b>Course selection:</b> Men do a better job of choosing a course of study in which they are likely to excel. At Cambridge in 1995, of the 15 honours exams men were most likely to take they scored below the male average (23.5% firsts) in four; of the 15 exams women were most likely to take they scored below the female average (12.6% firsts) in eight.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Men are also more likely to take their degree in the sciences, which traditionally award more firsts (and thirds). At Cambridge in 1995, for example, in electrical and information sciences 28 men (30% of the total number of men taking the exam) and no women won firsts. In the natural sciences, 314 men (27%) and 139 women (19.6%) took firsts, and in computers, 61 men (26.9%) and two of 19 women who completed the course came out tops.
<font size=-1><li></font><b>The examination system: </b>Both universities retain a traditional marking system in which students take exams at the end of the second and third years (Cambridge) or in the third year only (Oxford). One theory is that the nature of this system may favour the male turn of mind, by rewarding intellectual daring over careful synthesis. "Men tend to have more of a journalistic style, taking a polemic stab at a theory. That goes down well with examiners," says Ruth Deetch, principal of Oxford's St Ann's College, who has been looking at the problem.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Because the gender gap is so much larger at Oxbridge than elsewhere, it has become a particularly sore point. Gillian Sutherland, vice principal of Newnham College at Cambridge, wants the universities to do a detailed study of assessment, teaching methods and women's results. After a good five years, she thinks they may have a better idea of what to do. Or maybe not. Students have a way of confounding expectations. In 1993, Cambridge women were one-seventh as likely to win a first as men on Part I of the History Tripos. A year later, they evened the score. And a year after that, they slipped back again. Nobody knows why.

<p><b>Taxes</b></p>
<h1>Eco-nomics</h1>


<p>GREEN taxes have a seductive appeal. To environmentalists, they represent a way of cutting pollution and meeting environmental targets. To fiscal reformers, they offer a source of untapped tax revenues. To politicians of all stripes, they suggest a means of avoiding raising the most painful tax of all, the income tax. But any businessman will tell you there is no such thing as a free lunch--or a painless tax.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The search for that elusive meal nevertheless continues. The latest advocate of green taxes is the Institute for Public Policy Research (<font size=-1>IPPR</font>), a left-of-centre think-tank. It claims in a report to be published on June 17th that a shift from national-insurance taxes to those directed against waste and pollution would not only curb pollution but create thousands of new jobs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>IPPR</font>'s package of green taxes is designed to raise &#163;21 billion a year by 2005, which is expected to be equivalent to 3% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>. It would include: a commercial and industrial energy tax; a real annual rise in existing fuel duties of 8% over the decade rather than the 5% promised by the government; a waste-disposal tax on landfill sites; a levy on quarrying; and a tax on car parking at work. These taxes, according to the report's authors, Stephen Tindale and Gerald Holtham, would cut carbon emissions in Britain by 10% and waste disposal by 16% over a decade. An accompanying study by Cambridge Econometrics, a research firm, suggests that, if the resulting revenues were used to cut employers' national-insurance contributions, more than 700,000 new jobs would be created by 2005.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This sounds too good to be true. And, unfortunately, it probably is. Economists are divided on whether a switch from employment to green taxes would result in large numbers of new jobs. Some believe that the change would raise wages rather than employment, primarily because green taxes might increase living costs and reduce the returns on capital investment. In particular, Stephen Smith, deputy director of the Institute for Fiscal Studies, says that he is not convinced that there would be large economic gains from green taxes because of their adverse impact on energy-intensive industries.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some countries have already found this to be true. Five European countries--Denmark, Finland, the Netherlands, Norway and Sweden--have introduced carbon taxes on which rates of duty vary according to the carbon content or "dirtiness" of the fuel. But Sweden has had to modify its proposals because of the greater-than-expected effect on energy-intensive industries such as steel<b>.
</b><br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The politics of greenery also has pitfalls. A storm of protest forced the British government to backtrack on its proposal to raise the rate of <font size=-1>VAT</font> on domestic fuel to 17.5% in November 1994. Similarly, plans by Germany's Green Party for an energy tax on fossil fuels and electricity rising by 7% a year over a decade have provoked opposition from both industrialists and taxpayers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All this suggests that it would be unwise to pitch the economic claims for green taxes too high. At the same time, it would be simply wrong to suppose that taxes cannot be used to promote environmental change. Both Britain and Germany have successfully encouraged the use of unleaded petrol by taxing it more lightly than the leaded variety. In Britain the proportion of unleaded petrol rose from a negligible share of petrol sales in 1986 to well over half today. Similarly, Sweden's lower tax on low-sulphur fuels has led to the almost universal adoption of cleaner diesel fuel.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As Britain's chancellor, Kenneth Clarke, noted when introducing Britain's landfill levy in November 1994, "in some cases taxes can actually do some good by discouraging harmful or wasteful activity." At present, Britain raises less than a tenth of its revenues from "green" taxes (and most of that from tax on petrol). The case for making polluters pay more makes good sense, even if the gains are likely to be more environmental than "economic".

<h1>It's only a game</h1>
<p><b>Managers have much to learn from game theory--provided they use it to clarify their thinking, not as a substitute for business experience</b></p>

<p>FOR old-fashioned managers, business was a branch of warfare--a way of "capturing markets" and "making a killing". Today, however, the language is all about working with suppliers, building alliances, and thriving on trust and loyalty. Management theorists like to point out that there is such a thing as "win-win", and that business feuds can end up hurting both parties.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But this can be taken too far. Microsoft's success has helped Intel, but it has been hell for Apple Computer. Instead, business needs a new way of thinking that makes room for collaboration as well as competition, for mutual benefits as well as trade-offs. Enter game theory.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Stripped to its essentials, game theory is a tool for understanding how decisions affect each other. Until the theory came along, economists assumed that firms could ignore the effects of their behaviour on the actions of rivals, which was fine when competition was perfect or a monopolist held sway, but was otherwise misleading. Game theorists argue that firms can learn from game players: no card player plans his strategy without thinking about how other players are planning theirs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Economists have long used game theory to illuminate practical problems, such as what to do about global warming or about fetuses with Down's syndrome. Now business people have started to wake up to the theory's possibilities. McKinsey, a consultancy, is setting up a practice in game theory. Firms as diverse as Xerox, an office-equipment maker, Bear Stearns, an investment bank, and PepsiCo, a soft-drinks giant, are all interested. They will no doubt seize on "Co-opetition" (Doubleday, $24.95), because it is written by two of the leading names in the field, Adam Brandenburger, of Harvard Business School, and Barry Nalebuff, of the Yale School of Management. It also helps by using readable case studies rather than complex mathematics.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The main practical use of game theory, say the authors, is to help a firm decide when to compete and when to co-operate. Broadly speaking, the time to co-operate is when you are increasing the size of the pie, and the time to compete is when you are dividing it up. The authors also argue that, to get a full picture of their business, managers need to think about a new category of firms, "complementers", which lead your customers to value your products more highly than if they had only your product. Hot-dog makers and Colman's mustard are complementers: buy one and you are more likely to buy the other. So are Intel and Microsoft.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The most important thing to know about a game is who the players are. A small change in the number of players can have unexpected consequences. The Holland Sweetener Company, a Dutch-Japanese joint venture, discovered this to its cost in the late 1980s when it tried to break NutraSweet's monopoly of the American artificial-sweetener market. NutraSweet managed to keep the predator out, but only after Coca-Cola and Pepsi used the threat of competition to force NutraSweet to lower its prices.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When competition between two players benefits third parties in this way, there is scope for the beneficiary to split its gains. Holland Sweetener in effect gave up its share of the gains that it had helped Coke and Pepsi to win. BellSouth, a telephone company, was wiser: it insisted on being paid to play. The firm said that it would bid against Craig McCaw for control of <font size=-1>LIN</font> Broadcasting Corporation only if <font size=-1>LIN</font> paid it $54m for entering the fray and a further $15m in expenses if it lost the bid.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One way for a player to do well in a game is to make itself indispensable. Nintendo built its video-games business in the late 1980s by restricting software developers to making five games each, keeping retailers on short rations, and doing much of the development in-house. Nobody else had any bargaining power. By contrast, <font size=-1>IBM</font> stored up trouble for itself in personal computers by allowing Microsoft and Intel to establish a lock on the two most valuable bits of the business.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A second technique is to tempt lots of competing players into the game--for instance by increasing the prize. That is what American Express did in 1994 when it organised a coalition with other big companies to purchase health care. The potential contract was so large that a host of health-care providers got into a bidding war. A third technique is to make intelligent use of a resource which is worth more to your customer than to you. In 1993 <font size=-1>TWA</font> lifted itself off the bottom of the airline league by tearing out several rows of seats that were usually empty because the carrier was so unpopular, giving passengers more leg-room--and making the airline popular once more.
<p><b>When to stop playing
</b><br>Game theory seems a fine way to analyse decisions retrospectively. But is it much help in the heat of battle? The track record of grand ideas imported from other disciplines, notably chaos theory, is not impressive. However, the game theorists have already notched up some significant practical successes. The Federal Communications Commission used the theory to help design its $7 billion auction of radio spectrum for mobile phones--and hundreds of mobile-phone companies also used the theory to formulate their bids.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But, as Peter Scott-Morgan, a consultant with Arthur D. Little, points out, game theorists are worryingly silent about the links between a company's strategy and its internal capabilities. Today's most successful managers craft their strategies on the basis of knowledge of their own companies, and devote at least as much thought to the question of how blueprints will be translated into practice. At their worst, game theorists represent a throwback to the days of such whizz-kids as Robert McNamara, chairman of Ford in 1960 and later defence secretary, who thought that rigorous analytical skills were the key to success.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet nothing can ever substitute for deep first-hand knowledge and experience. So, however sophisticated the games that managers play may be, they will still need to get their hands dirty.

<h1>The software scavenger</h1><p><b>Charles Wang built a massive software empire by snapping up sickly rivals. It is a nobler calling than he seems to think</b><p>THE oceans have crabs. The land has beetles and grubs. The software industry has Charles Wang. All survive at least in part by consuming the dead and dying. In the 20 years since Mr Wang started his firm, Computer Associates, it has bought more than 60 companies and products (most of them fading at the time). With each new meal he has carefully digested the good bits--usually an odd mixture of customers and technology--and spat out the rest--often many of the staff. The result: 
<font size=-1>CA</font> has grown to more than $3 billion in annual revenues, becoming the world's third-biggest software company, behind only Microsoft and Oracle (see <a href="wb1.gif">chart</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most people would be happy with such an achievement, but Mr Wang (pronounced "Wong") wants to be more than the software industry's vulture. <font size=-1>CA</font>, he is quick to point out, has developed lots of its own software--mostly arcane stuff for mainframes and other industrial-strength systems (which explains why so few from outside that world know the firm). Mr Wang considers himself more of a technologist than a turnaround artist. These days he is even casting himself as something of a management guru, promoting both his 1994 book, "Techno Vision" (McGraw-Hill), a homespun guide to managing information technology, and a <font size=-1>CA</font>-sponsored boot camp for techno-illiterate bosses.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is only recently that Mr Wang has had the luxury of such reinvention. The second son of Chinese immigrants escaping communism, he grew up in the gritty borough of Queens, New York, and was only an average student at a local university. He stumbled into software (it seemed to have the most help-wanted ads at the time), and started his own firm in 1976 to market a program sold by a small Swiss company. Five years later he took his firm public, and within months had made his first acquisition, buying a firm nearly three times <font size=-1>CA</font>'s size. Over the next six years, Mr Wang snapped up 16 companies, mostly small fry that happened to have a technology Mr Wang wanted.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the way, <font size=-1>CA</font> has developed its own technology, notably a core "architecture" that can weave together the products of companies it buys. But most of its revenue growth has come from acquisitions: <font size=-1>CA</font> has spent some $4 billion buying other firms over the past 15 years, adding nearly that much to its revenues in fees from the acquired firms' customers, who are worried about being left orphaned.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Wang's speciality is wringing profit out of a tired old technology franchise. The most recent example is Legent, one of <font size=-1>CA</font>'s competitors in managing networks of mainframes and smaller computers, which Mr Wang bought for $1.8 billion last year. Existing Legent customers, who depended on the software to run their businesses, were encouraged to sign new "maintenance" contracts with <font size=-1>CA</font>, which often locked them into other <font size=-1>CA</font> products. For Legent's employees, however, the takeover seems to have turned into an enormous exercise in downsizing. By one count, less than 20% of Legent's 2,000 workers are still with the group.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Wang admits that he can be a ruthless cost cutter, but argues that he is a humane one. Within days of the acquisition, he met Legent's employees and told them where they stood. (Other firms, he says, would have dithered to avoid bad press.) The main victims of his purges tend to be administrators, marketers and others who fall under what he calls overhead: "I don't need two legal departments and two accounting departments." Among those who survive, Mr Wang seems to inspire considerable loyalty, thanks to relatively high pay and such perks as free breakfast (in the early years, Mr Wang would push around a trolley of bagels and doughnuts himself), fitness centres and child care. That said, he rejects the free-wheeling anarchy of most software companies: he has even imposed e-mail curfews for much of the day to cut unproductive electronic chatter.
</p><p><b>Smart shopping</b></b>
<br>In an industry full of self-styled technology visionaries, Mr Wang's modus operandi has attracted scorn. Larry Ellison, the boss of Oracle, has called him a "bottom feeder". <font size=-1>CA</font> has also irritated customers with its strong-arm tactics, which include some of the most aggressive enforcement of licensing conditions in the industry, plenty of lawsuits, and even software "time bombs" that can shut down the operation of an awkward or cussed customer (a tactic that so outraged customers in Virginia that they got the state to ban it).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mention such things to Mr Wang, and he will reply, first, that rumours of customer discontent are spread by self-interested consultancies (adding that he has made talking to one of them a firing offence), and, second, that <font size=-1>CA</font> is a kinder, gentler firm today. This may be true; but, rather than worrying about his role, Mr Wang would do better to revel in it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most other industries have companies that pick at the carcasses of those who fall behind. Such firms not only tidy up; they also keep other beasts on their toes and protect customers. For all its T-shirted bravado, the software industry produces more losers than winners. As one competing software executive puts it, with a sort of grudging admiration, "every ecosystem needs a scavenger" . It may not be a pretty job, but somebody has to do it. Not many do so as successfully as Mr Wang.

<h1>Mr Greenspan's path to glory</h1>

<font size=-1>WASHINGTON, DC</font><p><b>As chairman of America's Federal Reserve Board, Alan Greenspan has earned a formidable reputation as a wise central banker. That reputation is about to be put to the test again</b></p>

<p>"ALAN, to pay tribute to you as the central banker of the year would seem to be an understatement. Central banker of the decade would be more appropriate." Thus Hans Tietmeyer, boss of Germany's Bundesbank and no monetary lightweight himself, when Mr Greenspan was recently named "Policymaker of the year" by <i>International Economy</i> magazine.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The praise is well-deserved. In his eight years at the helm of the Fed, Mr Greenspan has been an exemplary manager of America's monetary policy. Thanks largely to his <i>"</i>pre-emptive strike<i>"</i> in early 1994, when interest rates were raised early to stop any resurgence of inflation, the American economy is enjoying one of its longest cyclical recoveries, and with continuing low inflation. The widely cited "misery index"--the sum of the country's unemployment and inflation rates--has fallen to one of its lowest recent levels (see <a href="fn1.gif">chart</a>). But as Mr Greenspan prepares for his third term as the Fed's chairman, he faces some formidable challenges.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Steering the right course on interest rates is particularly tricky at the moment, not least because the American economy is proving surprisingly resilient. On June 7th the bond market tumbled on news that the number of new non-farm jobs being created (a widely quoted indicator of the state of the economy) was a robust 348,000 in May. Many economists are now forecasting that <font size=-1>GDP</font> will rise at an annual rate of 3-4% in the second quarter of 1996--well above the rate of a little more than 2.5% that the Fed thinks can be sustained without fuelling inflation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This suggests that interest rates need to rise. But pushing for tighter monetary policy now, with a presidential election only a few months away, will take a lot of political courage. Any rise is bound to infuriate President Clinton, who recently made one of his rare pronouncements on monetary policy: on the day that the latest jobs figures were released, he said that he saw no need to raise interest rates right away.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To complicate matters, the Senate has yet to confirm Mr Greenspan's own reappointment for a third term of office. His renomination (as well as confirmation of the appointment of Alice Rivlin, who is due to become vice-chairman of the Fed, and Laurence Meyer, who has been put forward as a new governor) has been held up by Senator Tom Harkin, a Democrat, who thinks that the Fed's monetary policy has been far too tight and wants a debate on the issue. Until the Senate has reconfirmed him, Mr Greenspan will be loth to antagonise Mr Harkin and others who think that the economy can grow safely at a faster clip. So staging the same pre-emptive strike against inflation that he did two years ago is going to be difficult.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although monetary policy is undoubtedly the biggest headache for Mr Greenspan, it is not the only one. The Federal Reserve is facing fresh challenges on other fronts. Banking supervision is one. This week, Jim Leach, chairman of the House banking committee, at last admitted defeat and dropped his attempt to push through legislation to repeal the Glass-Steagall act, which separates America's commercial banking and securities industries.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This setback means that the onus will now be on the Fed to continue to relax the regulations by administrative fiat instead. It has already hinted that it is willing to do this by, say, gradually increasing the percentage of revenues that banks are allowed to earn from securities trading and underwriting. But this is likely to earn the Fed the ire of the very same lobbies (notably the powerful independent insurance agents, who want to restrict banks' insurance powers) that helped to scupper Glass-Steagall reform.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A series of other embarrassing incidents this year also suggest that Mr Greenspan may face a managerial challenge at the Fed. In January, for example, Henry Gonzalez, the former Democratic chairman of the House banking committee and a long-time critic of the Federal Reserve, claimed to have uncovered "serious problems" in the Fed's air transport of cancelled cheques. He alleged that the Federal Reserve Bank of Boston (one of the 12 regional reserve banks in America, and the bank responsible for flying cheques around the country) had failed to use competitive bidding when hiring freight companies.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then in April, the General Accounting Office (<font size=-1>GAO</font>), a congressional watchdog, issued a draft report that complained of a dramatic increase in administrative costs at the central bank. In early June Mr Gonzalez struck again. This time he reported that the Los Angeles branch of the Federal Reserve Bank of San Francisco had been supplying incorrect figures in its weekly currency-handling reports. Los Angeles, which has the biggest cash-counting facility in the Federal Reserve system, seemed to have made errors worth a total of $178m (though they netted out to a "shortage" of $55m). While separate daily accounts were correct and no money actually went missing, the case has raised questions about the quality of the Los Angeles branch's management.
</p><p><b>On the defensive</b></b>
<br>The Federal Reserve dismisses this mishap as trivial. In response to the <font size=-1>GAO</font> report, Mr Greenspan claimed that his organisation was "extraordinarily well-run". Certainly, by the standards of other central banks, the Federal Reserve system is both open and accountable. In general, the regional reserve banks also seem to be efficient money-handling factories.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But America's central-bank system nevertheless needs restructuring. Its present form reflects the political and economic realities of 1913, when it was first set up. The 12 regional Feds operate as private institutions, overseen by the publicly appointed officials of the Federal Reserve Board in Washington. Their location bears little resemblance to the distribution of economic power in America today. The north-east has too many banks (Boston, New York, Philadelphia, even Cleveland). Missouri is worse still: it has two of the 12 regional banks, reflecting a 1913 deal to secure a crucial Missouri senator's approval for the act. Meanwhile California has only one, to deal with the whole of the west. Redistributing the banks would surely make sense.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Regional Fed bosses are neither elected nor publicly appointed: they are chosen by private citizens who sit on the boards of their banks, subject to the approval of the Fed's governors. Yet they have considerable power. Individual presidents can and do express opinions freely on a wide range of issues. For instance, Thomas Hoenig, president of the Kansas City Fed, is well-known for advocating a radical redesign of banking regulation, at least for some large banks--a view shared by few of his colleagues.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The regional governors also play a powerful policy role. The president of the New York Fed and four other regional bosses (in rotation) sit with the seven governors of the Federal Reserve Board on the Federal Open-Market Committee (<font size=-1>FOMC</font>), which is the body that sets monetary policy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This apparently unaccountable power worries some congressmen. Mr Gonzalez, for instance, thinks that the regional presidents should be appointed by the president. Senator Paul Sarbanes and Representative Lee Hamilton, both Democrats, want to end the regional presidents' right to vote on monetary policy. One undesirable consequence of this, however, is that it might make the Fed softer on inflation, since regional presidents tend to be the more hawkish members of the <font size=-1>FOMC</font>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In any case, there is little enthusiasm for dramatic reform. The view that prevails at the Fed and among most congressmen seems to be: "If it ain't broke, don't fix it." Mr Greenspan's fine record on monetary policy makes that seem plausible. But, assuming that he is granted a third term, Mr Greenspan could make his mark on the Fed indelible by undertaking the structural reorganisation that is long overdue.

<h1><center>Crime and punishment</center></h1>

IN MANY countries around the world, policy towards crime is turning harsher. The reason is not hard to see. Popular fear of crime, and especially of violent crime, has grown in recent years (faster in many places than crime itself). Politicians are responding to demands that something, preferably something bold, be done about it. In itself, this is nothing new: periodic shifts in attitudes to crime and to policy on crime are familiar enough. But the extent of the current shift, reflecting the scale of the perceived problem, seems greater than before.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is striking, for instance, that so many left-of-centre politicians have fallen into line. They might once have cautioned against "brutal" and "ill-considered" punitive measures (as they would have called them). Now, many favour "get-tough" policies with a zeal at least equal to that of right-wingers. In America, a Democratic president has supported "three strikes" laws, now adopted in many states and for federal cases, which impose mandatory sentences of 25 years to life on criminals convicted of a third felony. In Britain, where the Tories have proposed a less drastic form of mandatory sentencing for violent criminals, and claim with great fervour that "prison works", Labour has responded with cautious quibbles rather than outright hostility--and this week unveiled a proposal (echoing another American initiative) to introduce curfews for children. Just now, left-of-centre politicians regard it as political suicide to seem "soft on crime".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This makes it harder than ever to conduct an intelligent debate on crime and punishment. The traditional quarrel between the two rival camps--"liberals" emphasising rehabilitation, the social roots of crime and the rights of the accused, and "conservatives" emphasising deterrence, retribution and the rights of victims--never shed much light, it is true. But even an uncomprehending exchange of views is better than no exchange of views. Instead of debate, there is a growing, unexamined consensus among politicians that the popular demand for greater severity, for sending more people to prison for longer, must be appeased. Yet the evidence (see <a href="sf1.html">page</a>) suggests that such an approach will fail, may even make matters worse--and all at great expense.
</p><p><b>Too much and too little</b>
<br>Taken at face value, America's experience seems to suggest otherwise. It is sometimes claimed that a trend towards much sterner sentencing in the United States has gone hand in hand with falling crime. Many sorts of crime have indeed declined in America of late, but much the likeliest cause is changes in the country's demographic make-up. Young men commit disproportionately many crimes; when their numbers dip in relation to the population at large, as they have, crime dips too. (A new surge of young males is on its way.) Those who cite America in praise of tougher sentencing ought to reflect instead on the fact that their model now imprisons seven times more people, in relation to its population, than do European countries, on average; and that it nonetheless suffers a very much higher rate of violent crime, notably murder, than any comparably prosperous nation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These distinctively American phenomena--incarceration and lethal violence--have much to do with two other ways in which America is unusual: drugs and guns. This fact suggests some altogether different remedies. One is to decriminalise drugs, a policy long advocated by <i>The Economist</i>. The best argument for such a policy is that it would make America (and other countries) safer, by denying many of its violent criminals their main incentive to harm others. On this, to be sure, voters will take some convincing: the case, though sound, is by no means obvious. But the other clear candidate for change--sweeping reform of America's gun laws--is something most voters already appear to want. Unfortunately, their political leaders seem unable to deliver it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even if crime in America could be made in these ways to resemble crime in other countries, the idea that currently guides many governments, not just America's, would remain to be addressed. That is, does prison work?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nobody would expect the crime rate to drop if the prisons were emptied: in that sense, at any rate, prison does work. But it does not follow that a policy of more incarceration, indiscriminately applied, makes sense. The extraordinary cost of keeping somebody locked up is clear; the corresponding benefits, at the margin, are less so. There is no persuasive evidence that greater imprisonment acts as a significant deterrent to would-be criminals. For most crimes, rates of detection are so low that the risk of facing punishment, mild or severe, may seem too small to worry about. As for rehabilitation, rates of recidivism vary according to the prison regime, but in no case lend support to the view that prison makes good citizens; often, a harder, better connected and more professional law-breaker emerges than the one who went in.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These points suggest that society should be extremely reluctant to lock people up. At the same time, however, "liberals" are wrong to ignore, as they nearly always do, another reason for incarceration: that, as somebody once put it, a criminal in jail cannot rape your sister. It may be that protection, more than any crude desire for revenge, is why popular opinion generally favours getting tough. And in this, popular opinion is surely right: protecting society is a better reason to deny somebody his liberty than the prospect of deterrence, rehabilitation or, for that matter, retribution.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This suggests a different direction for penal policy, one that needs to be carefully contrasted with "three strikes" in its various guises. Because prison costs a fortune, deters not very well, and may build a more effective sort of criminal, let it be a last resort: aim to send fewer (in America, vastly fewer) people to jail in the first place. Explore other--cheaper, more effective--possibilities first. Try special courts for drug offenders (if you balk at decriminalisation); use fines, confiscation of property, electronic tagging, community service, and so on. At the same time, however, be willing to impose longer sentences (in Britain's case, much longer) on some persistent, and especially on violent, offenders who have shown that they will remain a threat to others. The principal rationale for imprisonment in such a regime is public safety: this justifies avoiding short (and counter-productive) spells of imprisonment for many offenders as readily as it justifies longer sentences for the smaller number of dangerous ones.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It hardly needs saying that, to have much hope of succeeding, a comprehensive anti-crime policy must go far beyond ideas about criminal justice. Punishment of whatever sort counts for less in the end than whether jobs are available for young men who might otherwise turn to crime, whether schools have equipped them with the skills they will need to make a legitimate living, and so on. But imprisonment, and how to use it, does matter. It must be made to work better.

<h2>Reformers stumble</h2>
<p><p>
A bad week for reformers in ex-communist countries. In a general election in the <b>Czech Republic</b>, the coalition headed by Vaclav Klaus unexpectedly lost its majority. In <b>Russia</b>, St Petersburg's reforming mayor, Anatoli Sobchak, lost to his former deputy, Vladimir Yakovlev. And <b>Bulgaria's</b> President Zhelyu Zhelev, a veteran reformer, failed to secure nomination in Eastern Europe's first American-style primary.<p>
Members of <b>NATO</b> agreed on ways to allow European countries to conduct military operations without American participation. At a meeting in Berlin, Russia acknowledged that <font size=-1>NATO</font> would expand eastward.<p>
Russia made the <b>rouble</b> fully convertible for foreign-trade transactions, offering foreign investors a more attractive home for their money.<p>
In Istanbul, delegates at a <font size=-1>UN</font> conference on <b>cities </b>were divided on environmental concerns, women's rights and the obligation of states to provide housing.<p>
European finance ministers added Germany to the blacklist of countries whose public-sector deficits in 1995 breached the <b>Maastricht criteria</b> for economic and monetary union. Over Germany's objections, they removed Denmark from the list even though its debt is still higher than the Maastricht ceiling.<p>
In a ceremony witnessed by the defence chiefs of America and Russia, <b>Ukraine</b> ceased to be a nuclear power as the last of its 1,900 strategic warheads was sent to Russia for destruction.<p>
Mesut Yilmaz, the <b>Turkish</b> prime minister, resigned ending a three-month-old conservative coalition. He will remain caretaker until a new government is formed.<p>
Britain, claiming a turning-point in its policy of <b>non-co-operation</b> with the European Union to be imminent, chose not to veto an <font size=-1>EU</font> agreement with Slovenia.

<h2>Netanyahu rules</h2>
<p><p>
<b>Binyamin Netanyahu </b>set about coalition-building after Israel's election. In a conciliatory victory speech he called for peace at home and with the Arabs. Arab leaders, not greatly comforted, held a series of meetings in search of a common response. Yasser Arafat said his people would "soon" declare a Palestinian state. In Gaza, an Israeli soldier shot dead an unarmed Arab. A policeman did the same in Jerusalem.<p>
<b>Bahrain's</b> rulers promised a speck more democracy. The next day they claimed to have uncovered an Iranian-sponsored plot against them.<p>
<b>Kudirat</b> <b>Abiola</b>, wife of the jailed winner of the 1993 Nigerian election, Moshood Abiola, was shot dead in her car in Lagos.<p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
President Eduardo dos Santos of <b>Angola</b> sacked his government and the governor of the central bank.

<h2>Children's crusade</h2>
<p><p>
About 200,000 children and their parents marched in Washington to draw attention to the needs of <b>children</b>. Conservatives called it the last stand for big government.<p>
In separate speeches, President Bill Clinton and his Republican rival, Bob Dole, both endorsed the idea of nightly <b>curfews for teenagers</b> to reduce violent crime.<p>
The <font size=-1>FBI</font> reported that Hillary Clinton's fingerprints had been found on legal billing records sought in connection with the <b>Whitewater</b> investigation. The papers, which had been missing, turned up mysteriously in the White House last August.<p>
Trade partners hit back at the United States' first efforts to use its <b>Helms-Burton law</b> against firms active in Cuba. Canada, one of whose companies got a threatening letter last week, called it "unacceptable". Mexico (ditto) sent a stiff diplomatic note. Defying heavy arm-twisting, the Organisation of American States passed a resolution denouncing the law. EU and American officials began formal talks at the World Trade Organisation.<p>
<b>Colombia</b>'s Congress began debating the case of President Ernesto Samper. The United States, which had criticised a committee vote in his favour, was accused of threatening trade sanctions if the full Congress voted the same way.<p>
<b>Peru</b> signed a letter of intent with the <font size=-1>IMF</font>. An American economist, Rudiger Dornbusch, said that <b>Brazil</b> risks a Mexican-style meltdown. Markets twitched. Most Brazil-watchers did not.

<h2>Death mines</h2>
<p><p>
In China's third major <b>mining disaster </b>in two weeks, 66 people were killed and 162 were missing when landslides buried mine-shafts in Yunnan province. Earlier, nearly 80 people had died in disasters in Hunan and Gansu provinces. Mining accidents kill up to 10,000 people a year, according to the government.<p>
India's liberal <b>economic policies </b>seemed likely to continue with the appointment of a reformer, P. Chidambaram, as finance minister in the new government.<p>
Tung Chee-hwa, who is tipped to become governor of <b>Hong Kong </b>when it is returned to China in mid-1997, resigned from a senior position with the government of the British colony to avoid "conflict of interest" .<p>
Japan and South Korea were chosen as joint hosts of football's <b>World Cup </b>in 2002.<p>

<h2>Downward</h2>
<p> <p>
The European Space Agency saw $500m-worth of uninsured spacecraft and scientific satellites come down in flames when <b>Ariane</b> <b>5</b> had to be blown up 40 seconds after taking off on its maiden flight from French Guiana. The disaster, apparently caused by faulty computer software sending the rocket off course, sets back the agency's plans to dominate the competitive market for commercial space transport, worth $3 billion a year.<p>
<b>Boeing</b> pulled out of a partnership with <b>McDonnell Douglas</b> to build a new American space shuttle. <font size=-1>NASA</font> will award a $900m contract for a prototype next month.<p>
German banks devised a plan to save <b>Kl&ouml;ckner-Humboldt-Deutz</b> from bankruptcy. The stumbling engineering firm will receive more than DM650m ($425m) in cash and forgiven loans, most of it from Deutsche Bank, which owns 48% of <font size=-1>KHD</font>. The survival of the firm still depends, however, on whether two Saudi Arabian companies will forgo DM300m that <font size=-1>KHD</font> owes them in penalties for late completion of work.<p>
The French government will build <b>Paris's third airport</b> at Beauvilliers, near Chartres.<p>
Consternation reigned at <b>Lucas</b>, a British car-parts maker, and <b>Varity</b>, which dominates the American market for anti-lock brakes, when their plan to merge and form a company with revenues of about $6.7 billion was threatened by talk of a hostile takeover bid. Five days after they announced their intentions, <b>BBA Group</b>, a British engineering firm, said it was considering buying Lucas.

<h2>Fair play and foul</h2>
<p><p>
The boss of <b>South Korea</b>'s chief securities watchdog and the head of the finance ministry's treasury division, which oversees the stockmarket, were arrested. They are accused of taking bribes to help firms jump the queue for listing shares.<p>
(See <a href="wtw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>Transparency International, an organisation devoted to stamping out <b>corrupt business practices</b>, gathered the results of ten international surveys into a league table ranking countries by the amount of bribery, embezzlement and skullduggery involved in doing business in them. New Zealand and the Scandinavian countries came out cleanest, Nigeria the worst. Britain, Germany, America and France all made it into the top 20 for honesty.<p>
Donald Johnston, formerly a Canadian cabinet minister, took over as secretary-general of the <b>Organisation for</b> <b>Economic Co-operation and Development</b> and declared that promoting free trade would be his top priority.<p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
The American economy continued to give encouraging signals of growth ahead. The <font size=-1>US</font> index of <b>leading indicators</b> went up 0.3% in April, the third month running it has risen. Together with figures from the Commerce Department showing more new construction, this led analysts to speculate that the Federal Reserve will raise short-term interest rates next month.<p>
Kenneth Clarke, Britain's chancellor of the exchequer, <b>unexpectedly</b> cut interest rates by a quarter of one percentage point.

<h2>Bankrolling</h2>
<p><p>
Russia's president, Boris Yeltsin, ordered the <b>central bank</b> to give the government 5 trillion roubles ($1 billion) to help cover a budget shortfall. The central bank said it would fight the order.<p>
<b>Rabobank</b>, the Netherlands' largest co-operative bank, agreed to take control of Robecam, the main asset-management arm of Robeco, a leading Dutch financial group. The deal, for an initial 50% stake, is worth over 500m guilders ($292m).<p>
Bankers argued over how much to pay their hot-shot employees. The chairman of Barclays Bank said they should earn less and leave more for shareholders, but <b>Deutsche Morgan Grenfell</b> continued to poach people from its rivals<b>. </b>Its latest coup was to carry off 44 Latin American specialists from the much-raided Dutch investment bank, <b>ING Barings</b>.<p>
Barclays Bank appointed Bill Harrison, a mergers-and-acquisitions expert, as head of BZW, its investment-banking arm.

<h2>Crossed</h2>
<p><p>
The plan of three European media groups, BSkyB, Canal+ and Bertelsmann, to stitch up <b>digital television</b> in Germany unravelled. In any case, the European Commission takes a stern view of pay-<font size=-1>TV</font> deals. Karel Van Miert, the competition commissioner, said that recent deals between satellite and cable television companies would be unacceptable if they led to monopolies.<p>
<b>Deutsche Telekom</b> announced that its net profits in 1995 were DM5.3 billion ($3.7 billion), 47% higher than the previous year. This augurs well for its partial privatisation in November. Uncertainty remains, however, over regulations that will govern competition with other firms.<p>
(See <a href="wtw2.gif">chart</a>)<br>Eager to fight its way further into the American personal-computer market, <font size=-1>NEC</font>, a Japanese electronics giant, said it would merge its international <font size=-1>PC</font> business with that of <b>Packard Bell</b>, in which it has a controlling interest. The new company will command a share of 15% in America's consumer <font size=-1>PC</font> market.<p></p>

<h1>Violent and irrational--and that's just the policy</h1>

<p><b>Recent falls in America's crime rate have led policy-makers round the world to look admiringly at the country's get-tough policies. They should not. American criminal-justice policy is misconceived and dangerous</b></p>


<p>REMEMBER serial killers? A few years ago, these twisted creatures haunted not just the American imagination but, it seemed, America's real streets and parks: an official of the Justice Department was widely reported as saying that 4,000 of America's annual 24,000-or-so murders were attributable to serial killers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;America loves its myths--and that was pretty much what the "wave of serial killings" turned out to be: 4,000 people are not victims of serial murderers; 4,000 murders remain unsolved each year. According to cool-headed academic research, maybe 50 people a year are victims of serial murderers; the figure has been stable for 20 years.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Serial murderers obviously form a bizarre and special category of criminal. People might well believe extraordinary things about them. But about crime in general, surely ordinary folk have a better understanding--don't they? Well, consider two widely-held beliefs:
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"America has experienced a crime wave in the past 20 years." No. According to the National Crime Victimisation Survey, violent crime fell in the first half of the 1980s, rose in the second half, and has been falling in the 1990s. Over the past two decades, it has fallen slightly. Non-violent property crimes (theft, larceny and burglary) have followed similar patterns. So has murder: its peak was in 1980 (see <a href="sf1.gif">chart</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"America is more criminal than other countries." Again, no. According to an International Crime Survey, carried out by the Ministry of Justice in the Netherlands in 1992, America is not obviously more criminal than anywhere else. You are more likely to be burgled in Australia or New Zealand. You are more likely to be robbed with violence in Spain; you are more likely to be robbed without violence in Spain, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. You are more likely to be raped or indecently assaulted in Canada, Australia or western Germany. And so on.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;American misconceptions raise two questions. First, why are Americans so afraid of crime? (As according to Gallup polls, they are: in recent years Americans have put crime either first or second in their list of problems facing the country; in Britain, crime limps along between second and sixth in people's priorities.) Second, why should Americans be so punitive in their attitude to criminals? (As they also seem to be: when asked by the International Crime Survey what should happen to a young burglar who has committed more than one offence, 53% of Americans reckoned he should go to prison, compared with 37% of English and Welsh, 22% of Italians, and 13% of Germans and French.)
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One possible explanation is that Americans are irrational in their attitudes to crime. But that cannot be right: crime imposes huge costs on the country and has helped turn parts of American inner cities into nightmares of violence. Given that, it is hardly surprising that Americans should fear the spread of crime. But it remains surprising that American public attitudes should be so different from those in other countries which also have dangerous inner cities. No, there seems to be something else feeding Americans' fear and loathing of criminals. More probably, two things: the violence of American crime, and its irrationality. And it is with these that America's real crime-policy problems begin.

</p><p><b>Murder as public choice</b>
<br>America tops the developed-country crime league only in one category: murder. While you are more likely to be burgled in Sydney than in Los Angeles, you are 20 times more likely to be murdered in Los Angeles than you are in Sydney.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;American crime is not only more violent; it is also irrational in its violence. Think about a person held up at gunpoint who fails to co-operate with a robber. "Since both the risk of apprehension and the potential punishment escalate when the victim is killed, "says Franklin Zimring, a criminologist at the University of California, Berkeley, "the rational robber would be well advised to meet flight or refusal by avoiding conflict and seeking another victim." Yet Americans commonly get killed in these circumstances, and it is the irrationality of such violence that terrifies.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is nothing odd or surprising in the observation that America is more violent than other countries, that Americans are more afraid of crime, and they are therefore more punitive. But the problem with America's criminal-justice policy lies in that sequence of thought. By eliding violence and crime, Americans fail to identify the problem that sets them apart from the rest of the rich world, which is violence, rather than crime generally. Americans are right to think they have a special problem of violence. They are wrong to think their country is being overwhelmed by crime of every sort. Yet because many people do think that, they are throwing their weight behind indiscriminate policies which, at huge cost, bludgeon crime as a whole but fail to tackle the problem of violence.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;America now imprisons seven times as many people (proportionately) as does the average European country, largely as a result of get-tough-on-crime laws. These are the laws other countries are now studying with admiration.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;First came mandatory sentencing laws, requiring courts to impose minimum sentences on offenders for particular crimes. Michigan, for instance, has a mandatory life sentence for an offender caught with 650 grams of cocaine. A federal law condemns anybody convicted of possession of more than five grams of crack to a minimum of five years in prison.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then came "three-strike laws", supported by Bill Clinton and adopted by 20-odd states and the federal government. These impose a mandatory life sentence on anybody convicted of a third felony. The seriousness of the felony, and therefore the impact of the law, varies from state to state. In California, in the most celebrated case, a man who stole a pizza as his third felony got life. His case was extreme, but not unique: another man got life after stealing three steaks.
</p><p><b>Three steaks and you're out</b>
<br>Now, the fashion is for "truth-in-sentencing". Such laws require the criminal to spend most of his sentence (usually 85%) in prison, rather than making him eligible for parole after, say, four to six years of a ten-year sentence. There is much to be said for a system that does not leave the public feeling cheated about what sentences actually amount to. But, by imposing the 85% average on all offenders, "truth in sentencing" makes it impossible to discriminate between people who seem genuinely remorseful and might be let out early and the more dangerous types who should serve the whole of their sentence.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since the early 1970s, when the first tough-sentencing laws were introduced, the prison population has risen from 200,000 to 1.1m. If that increase were made up mostly of the violent people that have engendered America's crime panic, that could be counted as a blow against violent crime. But it is not: the biggest increase is in non-violent drug offenders.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Between 1980 and now, the proportion of those sentenced to prison for non-violent property crimes has remained about the same (two-fifths). The number of those sentenced for drugs has soared (from one-tenth to over one-third). The share sentenced for violent crimes has fallen from half to under one-third.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And so what, you might ask? Non-violent crime still matters. Even if America's crime panic is related to violence, it is right and proper that the system should be seeking to minimise all crime. The prison population is going up. The crime figures are going down. Let 'em rot. As the right says: "Prison works."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Or does it? That depends on what you mean by "works". To many people, prison can strongly influence the trend in the crime rate: putting a lot of people in prison, they believe, can achieve a long-term reversal of rising crime. This must be doubtful. Yes, crime is falling now. But it also fell in the early 1980s, rose in the late 1980s and fell again in the early 1990s. The prison population rose through the whole period.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If there is any single explanation for these changes, it would seem to lie in demographics. Young men commit by far and away the largest number of crimes, so when there are more of them around, proportionately, the crime rate goes up. That was what happened in the 1960s, the period of the big, sustained post-war rise in the crime rate. Demography also tells you that there will be more young men around in ten years' time to commit more crimes.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But demographics cannot be the only explanation. If it were, crime would have fallen in the second half of the 1980s, when there were fewer teenagers. In fact, it rose.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why? The answer is probably drugs. What seems to have happened is that the appearance of crack in late 1985 shook up the drugs-distribution business. The number of dealers increased, kids with no capital got into the business and gangs competed murderously for market share.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This theory would account for the decline in homicides in the 1990s. Crack consumption seems to be falling--possibly just because drugs go in and out of fashion, possibly because teenagers have seen how bad the stuff is. And the market has matured as well as declined. Policemen and researchers say territories have been carved out, boundaries set. With competition less rife, murders have declined.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The significance of all this is that it loosens the connection between the rise in the prison population and the fall in the crime rate. Crime might have fallen anyway. A combination of demographic and social explanations, rather than changes in the prison population, seems to account for much of the changing pattern of crime.
</p><p><b>Vox populi, vox dei, vox dementiae</b>
<br>That said, there might still be a justification for putting more people in prison: if by doing so you lowered the overall level of crime by taking criminals out of circulation. Indeed, if a small number of young men commit a disproportionately large number of crimes, then locking up this particular group might depress crime a lot.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Liberal criminologists sometimes appear to doubt this. "It seems," says John DiIulio, the right-wing's favourite thinker on crime, "that you need a <font size=-1>P</font>h<font size=-1>D </font>in criminology to doubt the proposition that putting criminals in prison will keep down crime." Of course, the proposition is self-evidently true. If you banged up for life anyone who had ever committed a crime, however trivial, crime would plummet. But the question is: is this sensible, even if it does work?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To many ordinary Americans, it is and politicians are happy to oblige the voters by promising to get ever tougher on crime. But what is the evidence about whether prison is an effective way of reducing crime?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Looking across the states' different crime rates and imprisonment rates, there is no correlation between the two. True, you would not necessarily expect one: states are different and tough-sentencing laws might be a reaction to a high crime rate as much as a way of bringing it down. But more sophisticated analyses confirm there is no link. Mr Zimring took the adult and juvenile crime rates in California and studied what happened over the period when tough laws were being introduced for adults, but not for juveniles. No relationship is detectable: for most crimes, offences committed by juveniles either fell or rose significantly less than did those committed by adults.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And, just as there is no convincing argument that prison effectively reduces the level of crime, nor does there seem to be a convincing cost-benefit argument in favour of prison. The problem lies in costing crime. One often-used estimate, which monetises intangibles like pain and suffering, calculates the annual costs of crime at $450 billion. This makes prison look a bargain: its annual bill is $35 billion, while the criminal-justice system, including police and courts, costs $100 billion. But if you calculate the costs of crime on the basis of physical damage--hospital bills or the cost of replacing stolen goods--the figure comes out at a mere $18 billion a year. The moral is that, while the cost of crime must be high, no one has any real idea what it is.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What you can say is that, out of the range of options for dealing with criminals, prison is among the most expensive. One currently popular alternative is the "drugs court". Under this system, people charged with possession or small dealing may opt to go through a drugs-treatment programme rather than stand trial. Treatment costs $3,500-15,000 a year, depending on whether it is residential or not; prison costs $22,000. There is also some evidence that these courts are better than prisons at discouraging reoffending, though, since they are relatively new, the evidence is not conclusive.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of course, get-tough policies raise questions other than that of efficacy. One is moral. Is it right to lock somebody up for life for stealing a pizza? Another is racial (see <a href="sf2.html">page</a>). These concerns have not, it seems, made much of an impact on public opinion. According to Mr DiIulio, "Americans have lost interest in the Anglo-Saxon, innocent-until-proven-guilty model of justice. They want to get the bad guys."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet even by this measure, the get-tough policies are misfiring. Around 100,000 people go to prison for the 6m-odd violent crimes committed a year. The system is not getting the bad guys. What it is getting is a great many drug-taking, drug-dealing, small-time thieves. Conservatives argue that most people in prison are either violent or repeat offenders. True, but many of the repeat offenders are addicts financing their habit through drug dealing or burglary. Nobody suggests that they are unfortunates for whom one should merely be sorry; but it is not clear that sending a crack-user to prison for five years is a rational solution to America's violent-crime problem.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;America is awash with academics, judges, commissioners and policemen who know and study crime. The Justice Department's research arm, the National Institute of Justice, spent $53m last year on research of a higher standard, and in a larger quantity, than goes on anywhere else in the world.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Almost all of this stuff doubts the efficacy of what is going on in criminal justice, and fears for the consequences. Almost all the professionals agree that America's problem is violence, and that the way to reduce violence is to restrict access to guns. And on this--though the point is rarely noticed--the public agrees: 62%, according to a recent Gallup poll, favour stricter gun control.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet none of it makes much difference to public policy. The administration promotes a three-strike policy even though it knows that the main effect of three-strike laws is to bung up the prison system with people long past crime-committing age.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;American crime policy seems to have become an area where the arguments--admittedly often complex and finely balanced--take second place to the lobbying power of special-interest groups. The effectiveness of one, the National Rifle Association, has been well-documented. A less familiar one is the prison-building lobby.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Prisons have been likened to the defence industry as a government subsidy to the white working class. For areas hit by the end of the cold war, and by the ups and downs of agriculture, prisons provide attractively recession-proof employment. As the flier for the American Jail Association last year said, "Jails are BIG BUSINESS." Towns compete to get them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The prison guards' union has also become a powerful voice. According to a study of campaign contributions in California in 1991-92, the local version, the California Correctional Peace Officers' Association, was the second-largest donor in the state. It spends around $1m on political contributions for the governorship and the legislature in each electoral cycle.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But more important than the lobbying, and more worrying, is the failure of public debate on prison, its costs, and the alternatives. According to Bobby Scott, a Democratic congressman opposed to tough-sentencing laws, "When you call for more incarceration, you do not have to explain yourself; when you argue for effective alternatives, you do. And in politics, when you start explaining, you've lost." If that is true--and it sounds painfully accurate--something has gone badly wrong not just with American crime policy, but with America's capacity for reasoned public debate.

<h1>One-third and rising</h1>
<p>BLACKS are more likely to commit crimes than are whites. Around 45% of those arrested for serious crimes are black. But they are also more harshly treated. Numberless studies have shown that the criminal-justice system is not colour blind. There are more unfounded arrests of blacks. Blacks pay on average twice as much bail as whites. They are more likely to be jailed before trial and get heavier sentences for the same crime.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since the "war on drugs", the bias seems to have got worse. Blacks make up 12% of the American population, and, according to government surveys, 13% of those who say they have used drugs in the past month. But they account for 35% of arrests for drug possession, 55% of convictions and 74% of prison sentences.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Partly, that is because drug laws implicitly target blacks. Crack is a drug favoured by blacks. The mandatory federal penalty for possessing five grams of crack (a couple of days' supply for an addict) is five years in jail. Cocaine is principally a white person's drug. To get the same sentence a cocaine user has to have half a kilo in his possession.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The implementation of anti-drug laws also affects blacks disproportionately. Partly that is because the police raid black areas, not nice white suburbs, but that is not the full explanation. A study of sentencing in the 1980s, which divided blacks between "underclass" and "non-underclass", concluded that the biggest increase in the prison population was among "non-underclass" blacks convicted for drug offences.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The figures on blacks in the criminal-justice system are shocking. According to the Sentencing Project, a Washington-based penal-reform group, one-third of 20-29-year-old black men are on probation, on parole or in prison. As the prison population rises, that share will increase yet further. Think about that.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;People who have been in prison have a slim chance of regular employment on release. Their families are therefore poorer than others. Their children are fatherless while they are inside. Prison becomes the norm; "normal" life abnormal. America is on a dangerous course.

<p><b>Inward investment</b></p>
<h1>Bribing for Britain</h1>

<font size=1>EDINBURGH</font>
<p>MINISTERS like nothing better than to announce that a big foreign firm is to invest millions in building a new factory, especially if it is going to create jobs. Such news is trumpeted as further evidence of Britain's competitiveness compared with mainland Europe.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Inward investment comes at a price, however, and the Treasury is baulking at the subsidies being doled out to foreign investors. If Britain's flexible labour market and friendly corporate-tax regime increasingly makes it the preferred location for American and East Asian firms looking to invest in Europe (as ministers claim), the subsidies ought to get smaller. However, there is no sign of that happening; and the Treasury is concerned that the regional development agencies are breaching its limits on how much subsidy they are allowed to offer.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Treasury reckons that the problem is caused by regional development agencies, especially those for Scotland and Wales, bending the subsidy rules to outbid each other. Officials also suspect that foreign companies play the agencies off against each other to extract bigger dollops of money.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;William Waldegrave, the treasury chief secretary, thinks that this auction is getting out of hand and should be stopped. He has written to Michael Forsyth, the Scottish secretary, and William Hague, the Welsh secretary, suggesting that the effort to attract inward investment should be centrally controlled through the Invest in Britain Bureau under the scrutiny of the Department of Trade and Industry (<font size=-1>DTI</font>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Neither Mr Forsyth nor Mr Hague are taken by this idea. They know that any Treasury move to clip the wings of their agencies, Locate in Scotland and the Welsh Development Agency (<font size=-1>WDA</font>), would lose them votes.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the argument cannot be brushed aside, because at the moment an unusually large number of foreign firms are considering sites in Britain for big job-creating investments. One, <font size=-1>LG</font> of Korea (formerly Lucky Goldstar), plans to spend around &#163;1.4 billion on an electronics factory employing up to 4,000 people.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The firm is not expected to announce its choice of site until August but rumour has it that, after vigorous lobbying by Mr Hague and a <font size=-1>WDA</font> offer of &#163;150m of aid, the company now favours Newport in Wales. Such a package would mean a price to taxpayers of &#163;37,500 for each job created, well above the &#163;20,000 per job limit which agencies are supposed to observe.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>WDA</font> says these reports are wide of the mark, but rival agencies which have been trying to lure <font size=-1>LG</font> reckon that the <font size=-1>WDA</font> has offered at least &#163;26,000 per job. That would still be above the ceiling, although the <font size=-1>WDA</font> could argue it represents about the same cost per job as the &#163;80m package given in 1994 to another Korean electronics firm, Samsung, to build a factory employing 3,000 in north-east England.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Samsung settled on the north-east only after Michael Heseltine, then president of the Board of Trade, agreed to up the <font size=-1>DTI</font>'s contribution to the deal to &#163;58m. This allowed the Northern Development Company to outbid a rival deal which it feared Samsung was about to accept from Locate in Scotland for a site in Lanarkshire.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Inter-agency rivalry like this is commonplace. While Scottish Office minister George Kynoch was in Taiwan last year to rubber-stamp a deal which brought Chunghwa Picture Tubes and 3,300 jobs to Lanarkshire, for instance, his Welsh counterparts were still faxing offers to the company. To the Treasury, this looks like a collection of bellboys tripping over each other to grab a guest's luggage, and then tipping the customer for the pleasure of carting it to his room.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Barry Hartop, chief executive of the <font size=-1>WDA</font>, says this view is mistaken. Subsidy grants are tightly controlled by treasury and European rules and, he argues, are a good deal for the taxpayer--the average cost per job works out at &#163;15,000, equal to the annual cost of keeping an unemployed person on welfare benefits.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He and his counterparts at Locate in Scotland are more worried about the increasing subsidies being offered by other European governments to foreign companies. One Scottish official says that the Irish government is prepared to offer up to three times more than he could. These differences matter--a survey of potential inward investors by Coopers and Lybrand, an accountancy firm, found that subsidies were the third most important factor in decisions about where to build new factories.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Arguments like these may help Mr Forsyth and Mr Hague to block Mr Waldegrave's proposal. But he has another, political, point up his sleeve--that inward investment is going not where unemployment is worst, but to those parts of Britain with the best-equipped development agencies. Of the &#163;276m offered in regional selective assistance by the government in 1995, half went to Scotland and Wales. As the Tories have only ten seats in Scotland, and six in Wales, Mr Waldegrave may calculate that the government has more to gain if more of the money, and of the jobs, were to go to the English regions.

<h1>Ken's short cut?</h1>


BRITISH interest rates were reduced from 6% to 5.75% on June 6th, causing as much surprise as it is possible for so tiny a cut to do (see <a href="br1.gif">chart</a>). The decision came the day after the monthly monetary meeting between Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Eddie George, the governor of the Bank of England. "It is hard to think of a City of London economist who anticipated a rate cut this month," says Geoffrey Dicks, an economist at NatWest Markets, a stockbroker.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is likely that Mr Clarke made the cut against the advice of Mr George. Last month the Bank made it clear that it regarded this year's previous rate cuts as "insurance" against a short-term decline in the economy, and that if there were no deterioration it would soon become more concerned about the risk of too-rapid growth rather than too slow. Economic data published since suggest that although manufacturing output remains sluggish, consumption is growing fast and will produce strong growth over the next couple of years. Conclusion: there is no need for this month's extra "insurance" against a slowdown.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Clarke probably pointed to sterling's sharp rise since early May, which has hurt exporters, and to the Treasury's panel of independent economic advisers' controversial claim, published just before the cut, that <font size=-1>GDP</font> might grow faster, by over 3% annually for five years, without risking higher inflation. He has said repeatedly that he would raise interest rates again should that be in the best interests of the economy. Putting up rates before a general election goes against all conventional political wisdom. By cutting this week, Mr Clarke has increased the likelihood that he will have to do it, probably soon.

<p><b>Airports</b></p>
<h1>Time to split</h1>


<p>SINCE the British Airports Authority (<font size=-1>BAA</font>) was privatised in 1987, its shareholders have enjoyed a wonderful ride (see <a href="br2.gif">chart</a>). This heady stockmarket performance reflects the fact that <font size=-1>BAA</font>'s dividends have grown at more than 10% a year, five times the post-war stockmarket average. Shareholders have already recouped nearly two-thirds of their original investment in dividends alone. Not bad for a low-risk regulated firm which faces virtually no competition to its lucrative ownership of Heathrow, Gatwick and Stansted, the three biggest airports around London.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whether <font size=-1>BAA</font>'s excessively cosy regulatory regime should continue unchanged is now under consideration by the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (<font size=-1>MMC</font>). The <font size=-1>MMC</font> is due to deliver its judgment on the airport authority's future on June 10th, as part of a regular five-year review. The commission's proposals will be submitted to the Civil Aviation Authority with which it shares the task of regulating <font size=-1>BAA</font>. In its last review the <font size=-1>MMC</font> swept aside in a single paragraph the case for breaking up the company. This time the case for doing so, made by airlines and consumer interests, will be more difficult to dismiss.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Regulation by price control has, for a start, proved ineffective. <font size=-1>BAA</font>'s rate of return on capital of more than 10% is a third more than the limit set in the 1991 review. <font size=-1>BAA</font> claims the higher-than-expected return is due to lower-than-expected construction costs and higher productivity. But there will always be such excuses to hand. The ability of regulated monopolies to pull the wool over regulators' eyes on cost issues is almost infinite.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The system of price regulation, under which <font size=-1>BAA</font> has to keep its charges 4% below the rate of inflation, has brought some particularly perverse results. The larger the profits it earns from its unregulated businesses such as shop rentals, the more it has to reduce its regulated fees to airlines. The ludicrous result has been that airport charges at Heathrow, already grossly congested, are among the lowest in the world. Airport charges at Heathrow average about &#163;5 a passenger, a third of those at the privately-owned Luton airport which is struggling for custom.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Price incentives working the wrong way around have helped to starve Stansted, and to a lesser extent Gatwick, of passengers, while further overloading Heathrow. Sir Christopher Chataway, the former chairman of the Civil Aviation Authority, has admitted that <font size=-1>BAA</font>'s current price-control regime could one day result in airlines actually being paid to land at Heathrow.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The best way to end this nonsense is to introduce competition. The House of Commons Transport Select Committee, in a report published last month, recommended that the ownership of Heathrow should be separated from that of Gatwick and Stansted. That makes good sense. There is no reason why the three airports should be controlled by a single operator.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Splitting up <font size=-1>BAA</font> would hardly produce perfect competition. There are many constraints on running an airport, not least geography and transport links. Some subsidy for Gatwick and Stansted, or an excess profits levy on Heathrow, might be needed to make competition viable. But some sort of rivalry between operators could bring real benefits, just as the government hopes it will in the privatised rail network. In the same spirit the <font size=-1>MMC</font> should insist that <font size=-1>BAA</font>'s proposed Terminal 5 at Heathrow, if it ever wins planning permission, be put out to competitive tender.

<p><b>Encryption</b></p>
<h1>Silence of the bugs</h1>


<p>SPARE a thought for America's professional snoops. For decades the <font size=-1>FBI</font> and others have counted the telephone wiretap among their favourite weapons against crime, as countless mafiosi can (and did) testify. Now, software in a computer or digital telephone can scramble a message so effectively that no law-enforcement agency can read it. For years, the government has fought back by restricting the use of encryption, to the fury of privacy advocates on the Internet, where rampant eavesdropping makes encryption essential. Now a bit of silicon and a stack of paper have apparently ended the battle: the cops lost.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The bit of silicon is actually two chips that can encrypt data transmissions so that they are in effect uncrackable. Had the chips been developed in the United States, the government would have classified them as "munitions" and banned their export. But they were developed in Japan, by <font size=-1>NTT</font>, the telephone giant, and the Japanese subsidiary of <font size=-1>RSA</font>, an American encryption company, which revealed their existence early this week. They can therefore be used around the world, and even imported into the United States. There seems nothing the American government can do about it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As if that were not bad enough, America's restrictive encryption policy took another hit last week when a report, commissioned by Congress and compiled by the prestigious National Research Council (<font size=-1>NRC</font>), concluded that the policy had hurt Americans far more than it had helped them. For the past few years, the White House has been offering a purported compromise: give the government (or a mutually trusted third party) a key to read your encrypted e-mail, and you can scramble it all you like. The problem with this so-called "key escrow" proposal was that it smacked to many of Big Brotherism. The computer industry rejected it out of hand, and fell back instead on weaker encryption that was not regulated, even though this can be cracked over a weekend with a home <font size=-1>PC</font>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Up to now, the government's response to cries for better encryption for all has been to fall back on its responsibility to protect the citizenry. The <font size=-1>NRC</font> panel rejected this, together with the "if only you knew what we know" argument the government has usually trotted out. Composed of former security officials and encryption experts, this panel did know what the government knows, and was still not convinced.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now the <font size=-1>NTT</font> chips seem to sweep away the whole debate. <font size=-1>NTT</font> has already sold the chips in 15 countries, and they should soon be incorporated in products. Stewart Baker, the former general counsel of America's National Security Agency, concedes that the chips have probably killed encryption controls in America, but argues that the battle will continue to run in Europe, where countries such as France limit their use. For the rest of the world, these bits of silicon may indeed make it harder for police to protect citizens. But they will also make it easier for citizens to protect themselves.

<p><b>The Internet</b></p>
<h1>Names writ in water</h1>

<p>WANT to buy shares in the United Nations High Commission for Refugees? Just click on "www.unhcr.org" on the World Wide Web, and you will be offered stock options in the Refugee Republic Corporation, incorporated (it says) in Nevada to demonstrate that "refugees are essentially unrealised capital", but in no way related to the worthy international organisation known everywhere as <font size=-1>UNHCR</font>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Refugees are just the latest cybervictims of the confusion caused by the rules for allocating "domain names" on the Internet, those on-line signatures that are the Internet's equivalent of telephone numbers. The principle is mainly first come, first served. The imaginative and nimble have registered lots of famous corporate names before their sleepy owners realised what was happening.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For most of the past year the squabbles over domain names have been a sideshow--irritating mainly for large American companies. But the spread of Internet use outside the United States is converting a national mess into a global one. Part of the problem is that, although each country has its own trademark law, companies based outside the United States increasingly want to register their names without the <i>d&eacute;class&eacute;</i> addition of a national tag.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Users outside the United States generally tag their names with country codes--commercial users in Australia, for instance, are ".com.au". Thus tagged, their trademarks are protected by national law. But because the United States dreamt up the Internet, most of its users grandly carry no country code: if they are businesses, their names end simply with ".com". At least 7% of all those that register under the aristocratic banner of ".com" are non-Americans, and the proportion is rising.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The trouble is, when they register, non-Americans frequently find what many American firms have already discovered: a nimble amateur has beaten them to it. For instance, Rolex Watches of Switzerland has only recently discovered that Janice Ard of Colorado owns "rolex.com".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To discourage speculators, Network Solutions Incorporated (<font size=-1>NSI</font>), which registers domain names in the United States, decided last year to impose a $50 fee (to the huge irritation of Internet boffins, who complain that it is earning more than $12m a year for allocating an international resource). It also allows the owner of a registered trademark to complain if its name has been grabbed by somebody else. Amateur name-grabbers, threatened with a court case, can usually be bribed to relinquish a valuable name.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But some important names--such as <font size=-1>UNHCR</font>--are not registered as trademarks. Moreover, the complexities of trademark law are overwhelming the unworldly academics who keep the Internet afloat.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The cross-border implications of such arguments are now starting to appear. Roadrunner Computer Systems, a small Internet-service company in New Mexico, registered "roadrunner.com". But Warner Brothers, which has a cartoon character called the Road Runner, also laid claim to the name for a while.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The most interesting aspect of the case was that Roadrunner had registered its trademark in Tunisia--in 48 hours, for a mere $1,100. Under <font size=-1>NSI</font> policy, that gives it a right to the domain name. In fact, Roadrunner registered only after it ran into Warner Brothers' wrath. But many similar cases will end up in American courts as companies around the world with identical names vie for space in the narrow confines of the ".com" domain. The arguments will grow political: to the dismay of Taipei, the official Chinese news agency has craftily registered "Taiwan.com".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, just as non-American companies have belatedly discovered that their trade names had been registered as domain names in the United States, so American companies are just beginning to realise the need to register their domain names in other countries, if they want to avoid confusion. While Yahoo!, one of the Internet's most widely used guides, owns yahoo.com, an unrelated British company called Yahoo Research Development has already bagged yahoo.co.uk. Given that Yahoo! has no trading presence in Britain, there is not much that the company can do.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What is the answer? Some Internet engineers argue that the creation of more international domains, on the lines of .com, would allow several companies with the same name to register it. Suppose a new ".bus" domain were created, one company could be, say, yahoo.com and another yahoo.bus.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But what if Yahoo! felt the need to register itself under both domains? An alternative proposal, put forward by (among others) Robert Shaw, an official at the International Telecommunication Union, would be to bring the United States into line with the rest of the world by insisting that ".us" is attached to all American domain names. The trademark rows would continue, but at least each country would deal with its own.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But that would not end the difficulties of Yahoo! or Rolex either. If they wanted exclusive global use of their name, they would still need to register around the world. All that would be clearer is the country the company was based in. Only a global trademark registration system would offer a real answer-- and that is nowhere in sight.

<h1>Call me</h1>

<font size=1>GENEVA</font><p>IF YOU want people to buy from you over the telephone, why should your customer pay the cost of the call? That simple logic has made freephone numbers big business in the service-conscious United States, where they account for 100m calls a day and more than 40% of the traffic on <font size=-1>AT&T</font>'s vast network. But in other parts of the world, they have been less successful: only 10% of the world's 9m freephone numbers are held outside North America.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now this may change. The International Telecommunication Union (<font size=-1>ITU</font>), which represents the world's telephone industry, has approved a new standard for global freephone numbers. Up to now, freephone services could be offered only nationally. As a result, anybody travelling with a telephone credit card spends hours fumbling in draughty telephone boxes for the correct number to dial out from that particular country. From next February, callers will need to dial only the international exit code and then 800 and eight more digits.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Companies will have to register the numbers they want with the <font size=-1>ITU</font> from October, and they will be shared out more or less on a first come, first served basis. Any number already in use will get preference, though most national freephone numbers have only seven digits. Settling for eight will allow a theoretical 100m: America's seven digits have allowed only 10m, and are now exhausted.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Foolishly, the <font size=-1>ITU</font> decided not to auction popular numbers: combinations of eights are prized as lucky in Asia, and combinations that spell words on a dial (such as 1-800 FLOWERS) are valuable in the United States--although in Europe only about one-third of handsets have letters as well as numerals, and they are differently configured.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One effect of global freephone numbers may be to add to the downward pressure on international call charges: it will help callback companies, which allow subscribers to route a call through a low-tariff country, if subscribers can be offered a single global number to call. Another effect may be to boost cross-border electronic shopping. In 1994, guesses <font size=-1>AT&T</font>, some $100 billion of commerce was done over freephone numbers in the United States alone, a vastly larger amount than either television shopping or Internet commerce accounts for. Many companies include their (American) freephone number on their Internet site; some even allow customers to click on the number and be routed straight through to an operator. Now such companies will be able to sell to the world by giving their global number.

<h1>The passion of the newly converted</h1>
<p><b>John Petrillo once sent AT&T down the wrong on-line path. Perhaps that is why he can now see the right one so clearly</b></p>

AT THE PC Forum, an annual gathering of the biggest names in the computer and communications industries, sartorial details are telling. Last year, Bert Roberts, the boss of <font size=-1>MCI</font>, one of America's biggest telephone companies, made the <i>faux pas</i> of wearing a suit and tie. This year he came to the podium a reformed man, with a collarless shirt under his blazer. Ray Smith, head of Bell Atlantic, another big telephone company, pointedly left his jacket on his chair. Both were trumped by John Petrillo, who heads the new-media side of the biggest telephone company of all, <font size=-1>AT&T</font>: "I didn't even pack a jacket to worry about," he smirked.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This geek <i>savoir faire</i> has been learnt the hard way. Mr Petrillo, like most telecoms bosses, originally dismissed the Internet as a boffin's distraction from the information superhighway that the telephone companies planned to build--and control. At <font size=-1>AT&T</font>, Mr Petrillo set up a range of proprietary networks, such as Network Notes (which allowed companies to communicate with each other via their internal Lotus Notes networks) and PersonaLink (a network for people with handheld "personal digital assistants"). <font size=-1>AT&T</font> also paid $50m for a fledgling proprietary network called Interchange. When Mr Petrillo did think of the Internet it was, he now admits, only as "a different kind of e-mail system".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In retrospect, <font size=-1>AT&T</font>'s main gains from dabbling in proprietary data networks were the people it hired to run them. They came from computer companies--including Microsoft, Sun Microsystems, <font size=-1>IBM</font> and Lotus--and they pestered Mr Petrillo until he eventually came to agree with them that the future lay with the Internet, not with <font size=-1>AT&T</font>'s proprietary services. Late last year, he started to move those services on to the Internet: customers using Lotus Notes in different offices can still use an <font size=-1>AT&T</font> computer as an intermediary, but they can now reach it through the Internet rather than <font size=-1>AT&T</font>'s own lines. More radically, in February <font size=-1>AT&T</font> introduced WorldNet, its own Internet access service for individual consumers, offering it free to all users in the United States for a year. After just three months, WorldNet already has more than 150,000 users, making it America's third-largest stand-alone Internet provider (see <a href="wb1.gif">chart</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To bet on the Internet was undoubtedly wise, but hardly visionary. Plenty of other companies, from Microsoft to General Electric, had already abandoned proprietary data networks for the open Internet; since <font size=-1>AT&T</font> launched its Internet service, other telephone companies have done the same. But Mr Petrillo has now begun to wonder whether open networks might be the future direction for the traditional telephone business, too.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The case for this view has been fortified by the bill which Congress passed earlier this year to open America's telephone markets to competition. The effect will be to force the local monopoly telephone companies to separate, or "unbundle", services from infrastructure. Instead, they must now lease their lines at fair prices to all comers, and ensure that other firms can connect with their network switches and software. (Most European telephone companies will face similar obligations from the start of 1998.)
</p><p><b>Parallel revolution</b>
<br>Most people see telecoms liberalisation and the growth of the Internet as two separate developments. Mr Petrillo sees them as two sides of the same coin. Because liberalisation requires interconnection, it will eliminate most of the advantages of proprietary networks and software.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The effect will be to drive telecommunications towards an Internet model. Just as anybody can offer any service across the Internet, so in time any company will be able to offer any service--whether it be customer identification, voice-mail or the software for a network computer--across a telephone network, whether or not it owns part of it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Last autumn, this reasoning contributed to <font size=-1>AT&T</font>'s decision to split itself up, spinning off its services, equipment and computer businesses into separate companies. Mr Petrillo claims no credit for this--indeed, financial arguments played as large a role as strategic ones--but his star has risen since the "trivestiture". He is now the company's vice president for strategy, and oversees its on-line activities and <font size=-1>AT&T</font>'s part of the old Bell Labs. Responding to more than 100 e-mail messages a day at work and surfing the Web with his two sons from a fast connection at home, a newly wired Mr Petrillo is now <font size=-1>AT&T</font>'s chief internal evangelist for open networking.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Where might this vision lead? Today, <font size=-1>AT&T</font>, like most telephone companies, carries calls mostly over its own network. But the Internet can carry calls, too. They do not sound great yet, but in principle the Internet's technology should be able to transmit voice as clearly as the telephone network and far more cheaply, in part because it uses capacity much more efficiently, allowing many transmissions to share one line rather than devoting it to a single call. Most telephone firms either see Internet telephony as a terrifying threat or dismiss it as a technical curiosity, decades away from widespread use. Not Mr Petrillo. He recently hired David Nagel, Apple Computer's research chief, to run <font size=-1>AT&T</font> Labs, and told him to focus on developing Internet telephones.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One day, <font size=-1>AT&T</font>'s customers may have a choice: to put their traffic across the Internet inexpensively, or across the old <font size=-1>AT&T</font> network at a premium rate to reflect guaranteed top quality. Whether that traffic consists of telephone calls or e-mail, <font size=-1>AT&T</font> will still benefit. Mr Petrillo is, in effect, betting that <font size=-1>AT&T</font>'s telephone skills will make it an equally skilled Internet company. He reckons that, while the Internet may reduce revenues per call, volume will rise even more. Anyway, he admits, "It's not a question of if, but when, and there are real advantages in being first." If <font size=-1>AT&T</font> does not grab the chance, someone else certainly will.

<p><b>Internet stocks</b></p>
<h1>Cyber-casino</h1>
<p>WALL STREET regulars were already perplexed by the mania over Internet stocks: shares of firms with almost no track record, being bought by investors with no experience, at prices that appear to make no sense. But the announcement last week that Wired Ventures<i>, </i>which publishes <i>Wired</i>, a breathless but popular high-tech magazine, plans to go public at an Internet-style price was too much. The analysts may not know how to value mysterious things like digital cash; but they do know that no three-year-old monthly is worth $450m (Wired's prospectus estimate). Is this a sign that Net stocks have lost touch with reality?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps. But although the sceptics may be right about Wired's value, the reasons that they give are the wrong ones. In the real world, this is indeed just a magazine; but on the Internet it is potentially a great deal more. And by understanding why, investors can glimpse the factors that are driving the roller-coaster performance of Internet shares in general (see <a href="fn1.gif">chart</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Because much of Wired's value is tied to the success of <i>Hot-Wired</i>, its on-line subsidiary, it might be treated as a sort of on-line service, not unlike America Online, which trades at price-earnings multiples five times those of traditional publishing firms. On that basis, Wired's future revenues would depend largely on the size of the Internet itself, which has been doubling about once a year for as long as anybody can remember.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The potential for massive rewards, therefore, clearly exists. But to determine just how massive requires investors to solve a difficult problem. Even if they are willing to try their luck at guessing how fast the Internet will grow, they must also try to figure out how much of that increased traffic will translate into revenues. "Will people want to shop on-line?" , for example, is a $100 billion unanswerable question. Even in biotechnology, where company valuations are notoriously unreliable, the potential demand for a given drug is reasonably easy to guess: just count up the sick people.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So what should investors do? One approach is simply to give up trying to value Net stocks altogether. But this does not eliminate the need to decide: one can either buy the shares or not. Serious investors, therefore, must force themselves to make some assumptions, even if they turn out to be unrealistic.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One way to make those guesses more intelligently is to distinguish between different categories of Internet firms. They fall into three broad types: infrastructure, software and services, and media.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Internet infrastructure seems like a relatively sure bet. Whatever direction Internet commerce takes, the one thing that is certain is that it will all have to pass through the wires, computers and routing equipment of the network itself. The companies that make this hardware, led by firms such as Cisco Systems and Sun Microsystems, are therefore relatively sound investments. But they are also the least likely to stumble across an extraordinarily rich seam of hypergrowth: Morgan Stanley, an investment bank, reckons that revenues in the sector will rise by 30-40% a year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Software and services are trickier. This sector includes Netscape, firms that provide financial services and so forth, and is bound to be a good market overall (50-60% annual growth, by Morgan Stanley's reckoning). But the usual difficulties in picking winning software technologies and companies are compounded by the speed at which the market is changing. A seemingly insurmountable technology lead can vanish overnight, bringing down an analyst's rosy valuation model with it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Finally, there is media. The problem here lies in picking firms with sustainable advantages. Firms such as Wired that publish their own content risk losing the loyalty of the fickle Web surfer in a sea of competing sites. And those that earn money compiling other firms' information can be imitated easily (witness the profusion of search, indexing and news services).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many Net-stock investors care little for these niceties. They simply see a huge new market opening and want a piece of it. Those who bought early and held on have made a bundle so far. Thirteen of the 15 firms in our chart are trading above the price at which their shares were initially sold to the public.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps this is a bubble, bound to burst when Internet stocks lose favour. But there is one reassuring sign: like normal stocks, they tend to rise on good news and fall on bad. Even if the price is wrong, therefore, at least it is always moving in the right direction. What more could investors ask?<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?834188400,iss">Search</a>

<p><b>Speaker recognition</b></p>
<h1>Who goes there?</h1>

<p>THE policeman motions you out of the car. "Have you had any alcohol?" he asks. "No," you respond. Sceptical, he sniffs the air. "I'm sorry, I'll have to test you. Please speak into this microphone."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This vision of a possible future is held by Kathleen Cummings at the Georgia Institute of Technology, in Atlanta. She is trying to elicit patterns from drunken speech that a computer could recognise. In related work, Renetta Tull and Janet Rutledge at Northwestern University, in Evanston, Illinois, are looking at what having a cold does to your voiceprint. These efforts are also parts of a greater goal: to put together the implements a computer needs to tell one person's voice from another's.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Speech recognition is already commonplace. Dictation software for personal computers learns how just one particular dictator says each word. Telephone systems, increasingly used to lighten the load on operators, can understand (almost) any caller, but only a few words. To expand the vocabularies of such systems involves working out what all human voices, in their riot of diversity, have in common. Speaker recognition, by contrast, means picking out the voiceprint--the things that make each voice unique. But it also entails recognising the voice of a person, even with a bunged-up nose or whisky-sodden consonants.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A voice is born in the vocal cords. It is then modified and articulated in the vocal tract--the throat, mouth and lips--before it finally emerges. A computer, to recognise a voice, must convert the sound into mathematical formulae. There are several ways to do this, each highlighting different aspects of the voice. First is the raw sound: the waveform. This can be turned into a spectrum, which shows how much sound of every frequency (pitch) the voice contains. Further numerical fiddling converts the spectrum into a "cepstrum", which magnifies the low-frequency parts of the spectrum. The researchers' strategy is to relate bits of these voice patterns to the body parts that made them. By finding which bits of a voiceprint come from the nasal cavity, for instance, they hope to be able to detect a blocked nose.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Drunkenness most obviously affects articulation: speech becomes slurred. But explaining "slurred" to a computer is not simple. It requires a mathematical description of what slurring does to, for instance, consonants. That means teaching the computer what a consonant is, again using equations. So, instead, Dr Cummings examined the first stage of speech, looking at the waveform from the glottis--the slit between the vocal cords.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To unpack this waveform, Dr Cummings passed a speech recording backwards through a series of filters that mimic the vocal tract, returning it as closely as possible to the pristine glottal sound. She then analysed it and found that, unsurprisingly, a drunk person not only walks more shakily, but has unsteadier vocal cords too. This makes a more reliable computer test of intoxicated speech: you can enunciate deliberately when drunk, but just try to control your glottis.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ms Tull and Dr Rutledge, meanwhile, began by looking at how a cold affects the cepstrum. They put snuffly and normal voice recordings through another filter--one that simulates how the human hearing system processes sound. Cepstrums from healthy and unhealthy voices turned out to possess differences that a computer could easily measure.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One of their next aims is to look at the spectrum. Sounds resonate differently in each part of the vocal tract, each adding characteristic patterns known as "formants" to the spectrum. The nasal cavity, for instance, produces certain low-frequency sounds. If your nose is blocked and these sounds are absent, your voice's spectrum will have smaller (or no) nasal formants. A cold could also alter the glottal waveform: mucus lying on the vocal cords makes them vibrate more slowly.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dr Cummings accepts that her work may not deal breathalysers the death-blow. But she and her fellow researchers hope, ultimately, to track down parts of the voiceprint that do not get affected by drink or the sniffles, or by other things like stress. These would probably correspond to unalterable features of a speaker, like mouth size. His voice patterns for such features could be singular enough for a computer to pick out. Alternatively, if there were a distinctive pattern in all people with colds, the computer might be taught to spot it and to filter it out before trying to recognise the voice--or at least to know that the speaker could not be reliably identified. It is just possible that, one day, you will ring up the automatic telephone banking service to be told, "Sorry, you have not been recognised. Please blow your nose and try again."

<p align=center><img src="http://www.economist.com/econlogosmall.gif" width=78 height=39  alt="The Economist"></p>

<h1><center>Democrats at NATO's door</center></h1>

FOR more than 40 years after its foundation in 1950, while its military sinews kept the Russians at bay, <font size=-1>NATO</font> had little need to change. But in the past couple of years its 16 governments have come to realise that their alliance does not have much of a future unless it reforms: the loss of its enemy has meant the loss of its purpose. As it happens, <font size=-1>NATO</font> has plenty of other tasks to perform, ranging from peacekeeping to the provision of security among the new democracies of Central and Eastern Europe. It has already stepped into a peacekeeping role in Bosnia. The next big event is enlargement. Next year the alliance will pick a group of prospective new members, which, all being well, will be admitted in about 2000. But already doubts are setting in. Though many of these doubts are reasonable, it would be disastrous if the alliance were to go back on its word.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the moment that is not likely, but perhaps only because the question is not being openly discussed. One of the main arguments against enlargement is that it would annoy Russia, or at least some Russians, by bringing their historic enemy well nigh to their front door. It is recognised by everyone in <font size=-1>NATO</font>, whether for or against enlargement, that this is not the moment to conduct a public debate on the subject: Boris Yeltsin is fighting for re-election as president of Russia against nationalists and communists who want to restore Russia's "greatness" and regard <font size=-1>NATO</font> as nothing but a threat.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So when <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s foreign ministers meet in Berlin next week the formal order of business will not be enlargement but the approval of a plan for combined joint task-forces--flexible outfits to run missions that do not concern territorial defence, such as peacekeeping. And they will launch a review of the integrated military structure, <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s cumbersome hierarchy of 46 headquarters. These, and the other issues facing the alliance, are discussed on <a href="sf1.html">page</a>. But the biggest and most controversial matter that <font size=-1>NATO</font> has to settle is which countries to take in, and when.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The arguments against enlargement are not trivial. The main one concerns the effect on Russia, whose evolution towards democracy, prosperity and stability should be a central objective of all <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s members. This will remain true even after the Russian election this summer, and whether or not Mr Yeltsin (two heart attacks already) is returned to power. For the foreseeable future Russia will remain a fragile political entity, torn between Slavophiles and westernisers, liberalism and nationalism, market economics and state intervention. It is not fanciful to imagine it, or even part of it, falling under the sway of a nationalist leader who might seek to shore up his support by xenophobic adventurism. Since Russia contains tens of thousands of nuclear warheads, and chemical and biological weapons to match, the West has a powerful interest in ensuring that they are kept under responsible control. Needlessly feeding Russian paranoia is not something to be done lightly.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Needlessly? A second argument against enlargement is that none of the applicants to <font size=-1>NATO</font> is actually under threat from any other country. Their interest in membership is clear: it would give them security guarantees and the benefits of belonging to an exclusive western club. But they can take advantage of <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s Partnership for Peace programme, which has already given 27 countries a kind of associate membership and the chance to take part in <font size=-1>NATO</font> ventures like the Bosnian peace-implementation force. On the face of it, membership of the European Union, with all the advantages that would bring, looks more valuable than membership of the Atlantic alliance.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then there is the effect on <font size=-1>NATO</font> itself. Many American politicians want enlargement--not least because their voters have roots in Eastern Europe. The Germans are even keener. Looking east, they fret about economic and political turmoil, mass migration, environmental disaster and even war. On the other hand, some members of the alliance worry about the costs of enlargement, the difficulties of integrating new armies into the alliance, the plausibility of the defence guarantees that would have to be given and the possibility that a new line would be drawn in Europe between those that had full membership and those that did not. In other words, enlargement might weaken <font size=-1>NATO</font>, not strengthen it.

</p><p><b>Enlarge or die</b>
<br>None of these arguments should be ignored. None, however, is weighty enough to rule out membership for those countries that qualify--probably, in the first round, Poland, Hungary and the Czech Republic. They all have good reason to fear the possibility of renewed Russian aggression. They all deserve the West's help in supporting their democracy-building endeavours. That does not mean the Russians' fears must be ignored: <font size=-1>NATO</font> can and should do what it reasonably can to reassure them, and the presence of the Russian foreign minister in Berlin next week will show that this need not be impossible. But neither Russia nor anyone else should be allowed to veto any of <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s plans. If that were to happen, the alliance would lose all credibility.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That, however, is not the main reason for saying yes to new applicants. The main reason is that, if <font size=-1>NATO</font> is resolutely tied to its existing membership, it can hardly fulfil the new roles that the ending of the cold war has thrust upon it. Looking backwards, it will wither and die in irrelevance.

<h2>Israel turns right</h2>
<p>With the votes of soldiers and others still to be counted, Binyamin Netanyahu was 0.7% ahead of Shimon Peres in the prime-ministerial <b>election in Israel</b>. If his lead holds, he will face a parliament in which the small parties have done particularly well, leaving both Labour and Likud nine or ten seats down.<p>
Algeria's Armed Islamic Group reported that it had "executed" seven <b>French Trappist monks </b>kidnapped in March.<p>
Lebanon's prime minister, Rafik Hariri, accused <b>Hizbullah </b>of trying to weaken the state. The militant Islamist group accused the prime minister of making Lebanon his personal property.<p>
The international tribunal set up to punish those guilty of the <b>Rwandan genocide</b> in 1994 opened its first trials, in Arusha, Tanzania.

<h2>A boost for Yeltsin</h2>
<p>Russia's president, Boris Yeltsin, and the new leader of rebel <b>Chechnya</b>, Zelimkhan Yandarbiev, agreed that a ceasefire should start on June 1st. Without a peace deal in Chechnya, Mr Yeltsin has said, he would fail in his bid to be re-elected president.<p>
The president of<b> Ukraine</b>, Leonid Kuchma, sacked his prime minister, Evhen Marchuk, who had competed with him for influence. The new prime minister, Pavlo Lazarenko, a Kuchma loyalist, is thought to be less keen on economic reform.<p>
Foreign observers say that ballot-box stuffing and intimidation of voters cast doubt on the validity of the first round of <b>Albania's parliamentary elections</b>, which the ruling Democratic Party claims to have won. Police beat demonstrators protesting against the election results.<p>
Britain's strategy of <b>disrupting European Union business</b> until the <font size=-1>EU</font> eases the ban on beef exports got under way when its diplomats blocked 13 <font size=-1>EU</font> measures, including the launch of trade talks with Mexico. The European Commission deplored this behaviour but nonetheless offered farmers in Britain and other countries 650m ecus ($796m) of extra aid.<p>
<b>Public-sector workers in Germany</b> rejected a government offer of a 0.5% pay rise in the first year of a 20-month package. The dispute has gone to arbitration, which requires a suspension of the widespread warning strikes that hit Germany in May.<p>
Savings on civil-service pay are a big part of the government's plan to slash spending next year.<p>
In <b>Turkey </b>Tansu Ciller has backed a censure motion against her coalition partner, the prime minister, Mesut Yilmaz. Tabled by the Islamist Welfare Party, the motion is expected to bring down the government next week.<p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
The centre-right coalition in <b>Cyprus </b>held on to power after parliamentary elections, although Akel, the communist party, raised its share of the vote. The results are a boost for President Glafkos Clerides, who is expected to stand for re-election in 1998. Ex-President George Vassiliou and his wife, Androulla, were elected to parliament under the banner of the Free Democrats, a party he founded.<p>
<h2>Whitewater grafting</h2><p>
A Little Rock jury returned verdicts of guilty against two defendants in a <b>Whitewater</b> case. The jury convicted Jim Guy Tucker, governor of Arkansas, and Jim and Susan McDougal, two former business associates of President Clinton's, of conspiracy and fraud. The verdicts came despite Mr Clinton's testimony for the defence. Mr Tucker resigned. Mr Clinton tried to dissociate himself from the affair, but Republicans renewed their offensive against the president's character.<p>
The House of Representatives voted to raise the federal <b>minimum wage</b> by 90 cents an hour, to $5.15. In doing so it rejected an attempt by the speaker, Newt Gingrich, and the majority leader, Dick Armey, to add a small-business exemption. The bill will now go to the Senate.<p>
A landslip for <b>Canada's left</b>: in British Columbia's provincial elections, the New Democratic Party squeaked back into power, by 39 seats to 33 Liberals and three others.<p>
<b>Venezuela's government </b>all but abolished price controls on basic foods. Meanwhile, public employees went on a one-day strike, claiming $320m in unpaid bonuses.<p>
In <b>Colombia</b>, Congress began a debate on President Ernesto Samper's alleged role in the drug-money affair. A committee has already voted in his favour; the lower house is expected to do the same.<p>
Another new leaderThe <b>Indian government </b>of Atal Behari Vajpayee resigned after 13 days in office when it became clear that his Hindu-nationalist party would not gain a vote of confidence in Parliament. The new government is a coalition of centrist and leftist parties with Deve Gowda as prime minister. It is expected to survive with the support of Congress, the former ruling party.<p>
The Myanmar opposition leader, <b>Aung San Suu Kyi</b>, held a three-day party congress, the first since she was released from house arrest. Many delegates to the congress were arrested on the orders of the ruling military junta.<p>
Proposals for changes in the Philippine constitution from the ruling coalition aroused speculation that President <b>Fidel Ramos </b>may seek a second term of office in 1998. At present the constitution limits him to a single six-year term.<p>

<h2>Power struggle</h2>
<p><p>
(See <a href="wtw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>There was more jostling between British utilities. Scottish Power offered &#163;1.56 billion ($2.36 billion) for control of <b>Southern Water</b>, valuing the south of England utility at 975 pence a share. Southern Electric countered with a $1.6 billion agreed takeover. The share price of Southern Water soared.<p>
A cloud darkened the future of one of Germany's biggest but ailing engineering companies. <b>Kl&ouml;ckner-Humboldt-Deutz</b> had been hoping to return to profit next year, but said its survival was threatened by its discovery of long-hidden losses of up to DM650m ($420m) at its Humboldt Wedag subsidiary. <font size=-1>KHD</font> filed criminal charges against several of the unit's board members. <font size=-1>KHD</font>'s largest shareholder, with a 48% stake, is <b>Deutsche Bank</b>. The news overshadowed the bank's 32% jump in net profit for the first four months.<p>
The French government approved a bill to transform <b>France T&eacute;l&eacute;com</b> from an arm of the state into a company, in preparation for partial privatisation in 1997.

<h2>Debt effect</h2>
<p>Japan's 20 biggest banks wrote off &#165;10.3 trillion ($95 billion) of <b>bad loans</b> and turned in net losses of &#165;3.2 billion. Only four managed to stay in the black. Meanwhile the government is stepping up its campaign to have the banks contribute more to the scheme to liquidate seven near-bankrupt <i>jusen</i> mortgage firms.<p>
Unsettled times continue at <b>Moody's</b>. The president of the powerful American credit-rating agency had departed just ahead of news that the Justice Department was investigating the company's practice of giving bond issuers unsolicited ratings. Now two more senior managers have left as part of an internal reorganisation.<p>
Two Swiss organisations published competing "competitiveness" reports. The Institute for Management Development put America top, whereas the world economic forum ranked it fourth, after Singapore, Hong Kong and New Zealand. The reports also differed over Japan (13th on the forum's index, 4th on <font size=-1>IMD</font>'s) and Germany (22nd versus 10th).<p>
Shareholders grumbled at the annual general meeting of <b>Daimler-Benz</b>, after a financial year in which Germany's leading industrial company recorded the largest loss in the country's corporate history, sacked thousands, suspended its dividend for the first time in 45 years--and, adding insult to injury in the eyes of some--gave its executives a bonus of DM600,000 ($388,000) each for "the great burden they bore".<p>
<p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
Germany's <b>Commerzbank</b>, which received a demand for DM500m ($323m) in back taxes only days after details of its tax dispute were published in <i>Der Spiegel</i>, said it will sue the tax authorities for leaking information to the magazine. Commerzbank says it is outraged less by the demand (though it contests the amount) than by the way it was disclosed.<p>
(See <a href="wtw2.gif">chart</a>)<br>The <b>Russian stockmarket </b>rose after a ceasefire agreement with the Chechens gave investors further cause to believe that Boris Yeltsin will be returned to power in next month's presidential election. The tiny, and therefore still turbulent, <i>Moscow Times</i> index has nearly doubled from a record low in March.

<h2>Warning shots</h2>
<p>The United States told three companies they could face sanctions for investing in confiscated property in <b>Cuba</b>. Under controversial new laws, Sherritt International, a Canadian mining and energy firm, <font size=-1>STET</font>, Italy's telecoms giant, and Grupo Domos, a Mexican conglomerate, could find that top employees and their families, and shareholders are denied visas to the United States.<p>
Rather than cut the excise duty on foreign liquor, the Japanese finance ministry plans to raise the tax on locally distilled <i>shochu</i> by up to sixfold. This is to counter criticism by the World Trade Organisation of <b>discriminatory taxation</b> of imported spirits.<p>
All five of Japan's top <b>car makers</b> reported pre-tax profits for the year ending in March--Nissan's first in two years and Mazda's first in three years. Mitsubishi had record sales for the second straight year. All five are projecting operating profits for the first time in five years. Honda expects a pre-tax profit this year of &#165;90 billion and Toyota a whopping &#165;500 billion, its biggest in six years.<p>
America's <b>General Motors</b> picked a site in Eastern Thailand for a $500m plant that will make 100,000 cars a year, mainly for export to the regional market. The Philippines was on <font size=-1>GM</font>'s shortlist, but the company said the Thai car industry was more developed.<p>
A decision by a court of appeal in New Orleans to throw out a class-action lawsuit in which millions of smokers set out to sue <b>America's tobacco industry</b>, upset the anti-smoking lobby. The court would not commit "the fate of an entire industry or, indeed, the fate of a class of millions, to a single jury" .<p>
The economies of <b>Belgium, Portugal and Greece</b>, with large shadow economies, could be a fifth larger than they appear, says Eurostat, the <font size=-1>EU</font>'s statistical outfit, which is trying to harmonise the union's statistics.<p>

<h1>A new kind of alliance?</h1>
<p><b>In Berlin on June 3rd-4th, NATO foreign ministers will endorse a shake-up of the alliance's military structure. This is but a prelude to bigger changes</b></p>

<p>THE North Atlantic Treaty Organisation has had a good year. The success of its implementation force (Ifor) in Bosnia has made it feel useful. The French have rejoined some of the <font size=-1>NATO</font> bodies they quit 30 years ago. The ignominy of having a secretary-general struggling to shake off allegations of corruption has been forgotten since Spain's Javier Solana replaced Belgium's Willy Claes in December. So has the row over whether <font size=-1>NATO</font> should enforce the arms embargo on former Yugoslavia, which poisoned transatlantic relations two years ago. And now the organisation's 16 nations have agreed, just in time for the Berlin meeting, to create "combined joint task-forces" (<font size=-1>CJTF</font>s), a new means of projecting power beyond the alliance's territory. 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>NATO</font>'s robust health is particularly striking for an organisation that had seemed, at the end of the cold war, to be in danger of becoming redundant. The threat that had held <font size=-1>NATO</font> together, of a Soviet invasion, had all but disappeared. The United States was slashing its troop numbers in Europe, from 300,000 in the late 1980s to 100,000 today. And the Europeans were toying with the idea of a "European defence identity"--perhaps based on the Western European Union (<font size=-1>WEU</font>), a defence pact of ten <font size=-1>EU</font> countries--that might have undermined the transatlantic alliance.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet five years on from the collapse of the Soviet Union, few mainstream politicians in Europe or North America are now questioning <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s utility. It used to be said that the purpose of <font size=-1>NATO</font> was to keep the Russians out, the Americans in and the Germans down. In some ways, at least, it still has to perform those three tasks. The West cannot be certain that Russia will never again pose a military threat; <font size=-1>NATO</font> helps to keep the United States engaged in Europe; and many Germans (and their neighbours) still want reassurance that Germany's foreign and defence policy will remain firmly embedded in multinational institutions.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But <font size=-1>NATO</font> has also acquired two newer functions. One is to put out fires. In Bosnia <font size=-1>NATO</font> has shown, by unleashing a massive aerial bombardment and then deploying peacekeepers, that it is the only international organisation which can stop a war. This is why, in Berlin, <font size=-1>NATO</font> ministers will approve <font size=-1>CJTF</font>s. Traditionally, the alliance's military organisation has been based on article five of the North Atlantic Treaty, which commits signatories to defend each other from attack. They agree in time of war to put their forces under an "integrated military structure", a hierarchy of multinational headquarters that report, in Europe, to "Saceur" (the Supreme Allied Commander Europe, always an American).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since this structure was designed to block Soviet armies on the plains of Germany, it is little use for <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s new role. Hence the need for <font size=-1>CJTF</font>s, ad hoc headquarters to run peacekeeping operations or other out-of-area interventions. Each headquarters will be based on elements of the integrated structure, modified to reflect the nationalities of the troops involved. They will answer either to <font size=-1>NATO</font> or, if American troops do not take part, to the <font size=-1>WEU</font>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These task-forces are a significant innovation for <font size=-1>NATO</font>. They will become its normal means of running a mission that does not involve territorial defence. And they will help to foster a European identity within the alliance, by enabling the <font size=-1>WEU</font> to embark on real, if modest, military enterprises. A <font size=-1>WEU</font>-led task-force would need to borrow military equipment from <font size=-1>NATO</font>. The Americans have decently said that, in normal circumstances, they will not prevent <font size=-1>NATO</font> from lending its "assets"--many of which are really American--to its little brother.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Having approved these task-forces, <font size=-1>NATO</font> foreign ministers will launch a study on how to overhaul the entire military structure. The French say that, if they like the result, they will rejoin it. But that is not the only reason for changing the structure. Most of the allies agree that the existing one, designed for the cold war, is top heavy, too expensive and insufficiently mobile.
</p><p><b>Partnership material</b>
<br>The second new task for <font size=-1>NATO</font> is to help make the East European states stable and secure, granting membership to some and strengthening ties with others. At the Berlin meeting, in addition to ministers from the 16 <font size=-1>NATO</font> countries, there will be 27 ministers, mostly East European, from <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s "Partnership for Peace" (see <a href="sf1.gif">table</a>). Faced with the strong desire of East European states for security guarantees, the alliance said in 1994 that it would, in principle, admit new members, and that in the meantime European countries that were not in <font size=-1>NATO</font> could become Partners for Peace. This scheme offers a kind of associate membership to those keen to join but too impatient to wait; and a consolation prize to countries that will never be full members.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The partnership has, surprisingly, turned out to be better than a mere talking-shop. Several partners have taken part in <font size=-1>NATO</font> exercises. Some have opened representations at <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s Brussels headquarters; a few have even submitted details of their forces to a <font size=-1>NATO</font> planning review. Some have agreed to an "individual partnership programme" that is tailor-made to their needs and expectations. The Poles, Hungarians and Czechs are treating the partnership as a school for membership and subscribing to everything on offer; central Asian partners are rather less active.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Russia, too, has become a partner and, after much foot-dragging, agreed to an individual partnership programme. <font size=-1>NATO</font> has tried to woo the Russians by offering, beyond the partnership, an as yet undefined "special relationship". But neither the Russians nor western governments appear to have thought much about the specifics of what this might entail.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The alliance's attempts to renew itself to meet these new tasks have been aided by its experience in Bosnia. There had been no agreement on the theory of <font size=-1>CJTF</font>s, for instance, by the time that Ifor deployed in December 1995; yet it was, in effect, just such a task-force. The Bosnian headquarters was based on the integrated structure's Rapid Reaction Corps, with French officers added to reflect France's involvement. Nor had the Russians worked out their special relationship with <font size=-1>NATO</font> before Ifor; but they still sent a brigade to Bosnia and a general to work beside Saceur. The Czech and Polish contributions to Ifor also put the Partnership for Peace into practice.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the success (at least for the time being) of Ifor should not make <font size=-1>NATO</font> complacent. The alliance cannot remain a valuable organisation unless it embraces further, far-reaching reforms.
</p><p><b>Five tasks for a new NATO</b>
<br>Its first challenge is to find some way of making the French fully paid-up members. Only two European countries, France and Britain, can easily project as many as 10,000 troops out-of-area (Germany's constitution prevents it from being the third); so long as one of them remains semi-detached, the alliance is visibly weakened. France's condition for rejoining the military structure, that a European identity within <font size=-1>NATO</font> be made more pronounced, should not be too hard to satisfy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The French have proposed that some staff in <font size=-1>NATO</font> headquarters should have an extra responsibility as Europeans: in the event of a <font size=-1>WEU</font>-led mission, these officers would detach themselves and reassemble as a European command. The French argue that, although the Europeans would have to spend time together on exercises in order to be effective, this scheme would neither rival nor copy <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s existing organisation. Some Americans have their doubts. The British, however, are supportive, and have even suggested that the deputy Saceur, traditionally a European, should, when the Europeans embark on a <font size=-1>WEU</font> mission, be that organisation's supreme commander.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>NATO</font>'s second challenge is to carry the reform of its military structure beyond <font size=-1>CJTF</font>s, and not only in ways that highlight its European character. Like many a downsizing multinational company, <font size=-1>NATO</font> would benefit from fewer levels of command, slimmed-down headquarters and greater flexibility. In order to defend future members in Eastern Europe, <font size=-1>NATO</font> will need more mobile forces and an improved ability to sustain them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some have suggested scrapping the integrated structure altogether. Charles Kupchan, of the Council on Foreign Relations in Washington, <font size=-1>DC</font>, wants <font size=-1>NATO</font> to be more of a political and less of a military club, so that the Russians will not be upset by its expansion. But the fact that future missions are more likely to involve task-forces than territorial defence does not make the integrated structure useless. A task-force which was a loose coalition of national forces that had never trained together would be ineffective. One reason for Ifor's success is that it has been built around the integrated structure--and run by officers who know how to work as a team.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another lesson from Ifor is that the European members of <font size=-1>NATO</font> depend on the Americans for such essentials as transport planes, communications systems, attack helicopters and satellites that look and listen. Since few European countries are prepared to spend much more on defence, it is crucial for them to find ways of strengthening America's commitment to the alliance. This is <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s third challenge. These days few of America's main security worries are centred on Europe. They concern such nightmares as Iran making nuclear weapons, Iraq building new missiles to fire at Israel, or attacks on Taiwan or South Korea. European leaders seldom have the breadth of vision that would make them willing to help tackle such distant menaces.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Robert Blackwill, who once advised President Bush, has proposed a pact between <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s European members and America. The Europeans would share the burden of dealing with global threats that might affect their security, particularly in the Middle East, and would enhance their ability to project power in such places. In return the Americans would support European efforts to stabilise their continent, for instance by supplying peacekeepers on request. Mr Blackwill wants new institutions to manage this pact, yet few governments would want another formal commitment. Some kind of understanding along these lines, however, might give the alliance a stronger common purpose.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The alliance's fourth, and perhaps biggest challenge, is to plan and implement its own enlargement. <font size=-1>NATO</font> currently intends to hold a special summit early next year, to pick the first batch of new members--almost certainly Poland, the Czech Republic and Hungary. Negotiations for their entry may take up much of 1997. Assuming that <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s existing members ratify the necessary treaty changes, this first group should formally join in about 2000.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But it remains far from certain that <font size=-1>NATO</font> will open its doors, if only because opponents of enlargement have come up with some strong arguments. For a start, the Russians see <font size=-1>NATO</font> as a hostile coalition bent on surrounding them. If <font size=-1>NATO</font> expanded, the Russians might carry out their threat to renege on arms-control agreements, while Russia's nationalists would be strengthened at the expense of its liberals.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In any case, say opponents of enlargement, it could not make East European states secure for the simple reason that Russia is virtually no threat to the countries most likely to join <font size=-1>NATO</font>. The countries which may have genuine cause to fear Russia--the Baltic, Caucasian and Central Asian republics, and Ukraine--have almost no chance of joining. If the Poles want to belong to a western club, let them join the European Union instead.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A larger alliance would also, these opponents maintain, be a less efficient one, since all <font size=-1>NATO</font> decisions have to be unanimous. They cite the example of the sclerotic Organisation for Co-operation and Security in Europe, which has 52 member countries. Enlargement would also cost money, even if, as is likely, <font size=-1>NATO</font> chose to defend new members by rapid deployment, rather than forward stationing of troops. The alliance would have to pay for base modernisation, training, new equipment and communications systems. Rand, a Californian think-tank, reckons that the cost to <font size=-1>NATO</font> of admitting Poland, Hungary, the Czech Republic and Slovakia could be $42 billion, spread over ten years.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Extending the article five security guarantee eastwards might also, some say, dilute it. Suppose that Ukraine attacked the Slovaks just after they had joined <font size=-1>NATO</font>: would Americans really be ready to die for Bratislava? Would the alliance be prepared to use nuclear weapons to defend Romania from the Russians? It is because those questions are hard to answer that the American Senate, for all its avowed enthusiasm for <font size=-1>NATO</font> enlargement, may balk at ratifying it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And where should enlargement end? There is a tacit understanding among <font size=-1>NATO</font> governments that it should not encroach on to the territory of the former Soviet Union. That still means that 12 East European countries, four neutral <font size=-1>EU</font> members, Cyprus and Malta could all be candidates. But if Europe is split into two gigantic security blocks, <font size=-1>NATO</font> and the former Soviet Union, would not the dividing line be ludicrously arbitrary? Why should the Romanians--and ultimately, in theory, even the Serbs--have a security guarantee, but not the Estonians?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A partial answer, says the pro-enlargement school, is to make the difference between active involvement in Partnership for Peace and full <font size=-1>NATO</font> membership minimal. A partner that trained with <font size=-1>NATO</font>, participated in its task-forces and joined the planning process would have the essentials of membership, bar article five. Ultimately, they say, the benefits of enlargement are so great that it is just too bad if some countries are, somewhat arbitrarily, left out.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One clear benefit would be to reinforce the security of East Europeans. Even if Poland is pretty safe from Russian aggression, taking the Poles into <font size=-1>NATO</font> would help to bind them, culturally, into a democratic, transatlantic club. The enlargers also claim that <font size=-1>NATO</font> can improve the behaviour of potentially awkward neighbours: Greece and Turkey might have exchanged shells rather than sharp words if their belonging to the same military club had not made the prospect ridiculous. If <font size=-1>NATO</font> stuck at 16 members, or let in only the Poles, Czechs and Hungarians, some disappointed states might even drift towards Russia.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Robert Zoellick, another senior figure in the Bush adminstration, believes that enlargement would help to counteract the ugly nationalisms of Eastern Europe. "<font size=-1>NATO</font>, like the <font size=-1>EU</font>, represents an integrationist model of relations among states," he says. Such organisations seek to promote stability through "adherence to the common norms of an international civil society", rather than through realpolitik and the balance of power. Mr Zoellick hopes that Russia will learn to see <font size=-1>NATO</font> enlargement not from the perspective of a "19th century" power that laments its inability to dominate weak neighbours, but as a welcome opportunity to have strong, westernising economies next door.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Russians are not there yet. And they continue to predict dire consequences if <font size=-1>NATO</font> enlargement goes ahead. That gives <font size=-1>NATO</font> one more reason to do it: if it were seen to bow to Russian bluster, its credibility would suffer. The Russians might even be encouraged to table new demands.
</p><p><b>Hugging the bear</b>
<br>This is the fifth big challenge for <font size=-1>NATO</font>: to work out a new relationship with Russia, beyond the Partnership for Peace. There has been loose talk of treaties and charters. For all their hostility to <font size=-1>NATO</font> expansion, the Russians remain eager to be included in discussions on European security. That has led some to suggest that the alliance should offer the Russians as much consultation as possible, while still stopping short of any formal role in decision-making.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Christoph Bertram, a German writer, has proposed a new <font size=-1>NATO</font>-Russia forum, with a joint committee of ambassadors and a common council of defence and foreign ministers. The two sides could swap information on defence planning and peacekeeping in a military committee. They could deal with nuclear proliferation and the dismantling of nuclear weapons in a nuclear planning group. And they could discuss defence exports and industrial co-operation in an arms-control group.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such a forum would doubtless generate plenty of hot air. But it might have a value in drawing the Russian elite into a regular dialogue with <font size=-1>NATO</font>, so that each side better understood the other. Mr Bertram believes that the forum could make it easier to resolve diplomatic wrangles, such as the revision of the Conventional Forces in Europe treaty. The Russians may not, for the time being, be interested. Yet they have it in their power to determine the nature of a future <font size=-1>NATO</font>. The better they behave and the more they co-operate and share information, the less anti-Russian <font size=-1>NATO</font> will be.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even if the alliance manages to surmount all these challenges, it will have changed enormously. It will be less coherent and disciplined than it was in the past. Philip Gordon, of the International Institute for Strategic Studies in London, predicts that "the <font size=-1>NATO</font> of the future will be less about protecting its members from an all-out assault, and more about consulting like-minded nations that sometimes have similar interests and values to protect around the world." Yet even if Mr Gordon is right, Bosnia has shown that <font size=-1>NATO</font> is far from redundant. It is a useful constraint on nasty and unpredictable international behaviour, whether of its own members, or of other powers. As such, it makes everyone feel safer--which is not, in today's world, a negligible achievement.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?833583600,iss">Search</a>

<p><b>Spectrum allocation</b></p>
<h1>Trouble in the air</h1>

<p>AIR is money, as the Americans have discovered. Over the past couple of years, their federal government has made around $20 billion from auctioning bits of the radio spectrum to the highest bidder. Now the British government is planning a white paper on how to sell off the airwaves.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is a relief to the Radiocommunications Agency (<font size=-1>RA</font>), the body in charge of dispensing frequency slots, which for a decade has been trying to introduce a rational way of allocating the airwaves. Two developments have helped push the government in that direction. Digital technology allows the spectrum to be used far more efficiently than does analogue technology; at the same time, demand for frequencies from new wireless uses is booming.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the moment, spectrum is mainly handed out on the basis of first come, first served. This leads to inequity and inefficiency. People who want to run private mobile radio systems (truck radios, say, or taxi-pagers or courier radios) have to jostle for small slivers of the ether. Cellular telephones are suffering from congestion.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Great swathes of spectrum, meanwhile, are occupied by users who are paying virtually nothing for it. Some dog-in-the-mangers are enormous: <font size=-1>BT</font>, Britain's telecoms giant, and <font size=-1>NTL</font>, which transmits television programmes across the country, both use microwave links between transmitters. If they had to pay a market price for the large amount of spectrum this needs, they might well use cable links instead.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;An American-style auction would be the best solution, but such radicalism has run into big obstacles in the industry ministry. Ministers fret that big, rich companies might outbid smaller ones simply in order to keep out competitors. They also fear that existing users, such as taxi companies and lorry drivers, will grumble noisily at having to pay more. An even bigger obstacle is the resistance of other countries in the European Union to spectrum auctions, which make it easier for new entrants to offer telephone and broadcasting services. The likely outcome is a British fudge: part-auction, part-sale at a price set to reflect the spectrum's value.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In theory, the government would like to treat public and private spectrum-users equally. But the Ministry of Defence sits on about 30% of the most congested bands: it is not keen to make room for commerce. The three emergency services pose special problems: they are on different frequencies, which means that they cannot talk to one another. Other users have to be kept well clear of them to avoid interference. They have been offered a new part of the spectrum to launch a digital service, but do not want to give up their scattered analogue bands.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A further complication is television: at present, the four (soon to be five) terrestrial channels are gluttonous users of spectrum. One of the main reasons the government wants to launch digital terrestrial television is to free up space for more lucrative uses. But the government has resisted setting a date to shut down analogue transmission. A research paper for the <font size=-1>RA</font>, intended to be published with the spectrum white paper, suggests an alternative scheme: subsidise the price of digital sets to speed up the transition and allow the spectrum to be rapidly re-allocated. Now that sounds dangerously radical.

<h1>Masters of the cartoon universe</h1>

WHO wants old-fashioned two-dimensional cartoons when they can have flashy 3-<font size=-1>D</font> computer graphics? Ruth McCall, joint managing director of Cambridge Animation Systems (<font size=-1>CAS</font>), is tired of people asking this. In fact, 2-<font size=-1>D</font> cartoons, which have entertained the masses since Mickey Mouse's 1928 debut in "Steamboat Willie", are booming. Disney is raking in mega-bucks from new features such as "Pocahontas", and there is a huge and growing demand for cartoons to fill the schedules of new children's channels on satellite and cable television. However snazzy 3-<font size=-1>D</font> graphics become, 2-<font size=-1>D</font> cartoons will live on. As Ms McCall says: "Painting did not die out just because sculpture was invented."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unlike most high-tech firms, <font size=-1>CAS</font> did not start with a scientific breakthrough and then seek markets for it. Ms McCall and her two co-founders, all working in the computer-graphics industry, saw that few firms were making animation software, and set up <font size=-1>CAS</font> to invent a product to sell to them. Five years on, they have 72 staff and hope to reach break-even in the year to June, on sales of around &#163;5m.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To get this far, they have had to convince animators, a stubborn lot, that computers really can do the laborious work with ink and paint that has traditionally been farmed out to a small army of artists. In most cartoons, a chief animator sketches the key frames for each scene, leaving others to draw the "fill-in" frames and paint the backgrounds. To save money, the studios usually export this work to low-wage countries like China. But often the work sent back is not up to scratch, and has to be re-done. This is where <font size=-1>CAS</font> saw its opportunity.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The firm spent two years perfecting a piece of software that could turn a set of key frames into a finished cartoon, in which every frame looked as though it had been drawn by the original artist. Now it is the world leader in its market, and has signed up two of Hollywood's leading cartoon studios: Warner Brothers and DreamWorks. Industry sources say <font size=-1>CAS</font> is close to a deal with Walt Disney, which will buy its product to run alongside the 2-<font size=-1>D</font> animation software it has developed in-house.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is hard to estimate the potential market for <font size=-1>CAS</font>'s product: animation studios are secretive about their costs, and about what they would be prepared to pay for new technology. There is also a fast-growing market for computer games, in which the share that 2-<font size=-1>D</font> animation will get is anybody's guess.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The biggest competitive threat to <font size=-1>CAS</font> is a rival product called Toonz, from Microsoft, the world's largest software maker. So far Microsoft has let <font size=-1>CAS</font> grab the best customers, apparently having decided that, compared with spreadsheets and word-processor programs, the market for 2-<font size=-1>D</font> animation is too puny. But this market is growing, and if Microsoft wants a piece of the action, its pockets are deep enough for it to choose between trying to wipe out <font size=-1>CAS</font>, doing a licensing deal with it or, of course, buying the firm.

<p><b>Poverty</b></p>
<h1>Keeping up appearances</h1>


<p>ONE of the mothers interviewed in a new book on poverty, to be published on June 4th by the Joseph Rowntree Foundation, tells how she bought a cheap cola in a supermarket, then decanted it into a Coke bottle, so that her children's friends would not know they could not afford the real thing. This, as the book shows, is the stuff of poverty. The poor have to be ingenious and organised to keep their heads above water. If they are to pay the bills, feed a family and keep up appearances, they have to manage their resources better than the well-off.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some 14m people--a quarter of the population--live on less than half average earnings. Most of them are in households run by women: three out of ten low-income households are lone parents or widows, and among the six out of ten who are couples, the man tends to hand over management of the budget to the woman.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"Life on a Low Income" confirms some of the common impressions of poverty--the boredom, the shame, the isolation--but it does not bear out the widespread suspicion that the poor are feckless. Its study of 74 poor families showed that two-thirds of them were careful with money, with most of them writing down and costing a budget for the week. Some people allocated money for different purposes, putting cash in envelopes or jars. Others kept records of their spending, but did not plan in advance. A third neither planned nor recorded.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Food is the biggest item in their budget and the one offering most scope for resourcefulness. Women from poor families say they prefer to shop without their partner or children, because they tend to spend more in company. They avoid supermarkets in favour of street markets, and tend to shop at the end of the day, because stalls and shops then sell off fruit, vegetables and bread cheap. The less badly-off households surveyed tended to do a weekly shop, but the poorest ones shopped daily--partly because they were often short of cash, but also because of the danger that family members would eat more than the budget could bear if there was food around.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of the 74 families, 32 were keeping their heads above water, 20 seemed to be drowning, and the rest were somewhere in- between. For those who were sinking, taking out a loan was not a sensible option. High-street lenders would not look at them. Loan sharks would gobble them up. One such was charging the equivalent of a 353% annual interest rate on a 20-week loan.

<h1>The baby trap</h1>
<p>AT THE centre of the debate about poverty, the underclass and all that is the single mother. If single mothers were not so poor, the cycle of deprivation would be broken.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But single motherhood has very different consequences for a woman's prospects in different countries. A Joseph Rowntree Foundation companion study to the one above shows that single mothers in Britain have a lower chance of getting into employment, and thus out of poverty, than do those in most of the rest of the developed world (see <a href="br1.gif"> chart</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The disincentive to working does not lie in low pay, nor in the tax system. The after-tax income of a British single working mother is relatively high compared with other countries. Net disposable income for a single mother on income support is 65% of the same woman on half average earnings. In other words, she is quite a bit better off working.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If it were not for the cost of childcare, that is. Many other developed countries' governments provide childcare, or assistance with it, allowing single mothers to work. Not so Britain, where the cost of childcare greatly adds to the cost of working. Once the income-replacement figure is adjusted to include the cost of childcare, it rises to 178%, so a single mother is a great deal better off staying at home than working. In France, where childcare is free, the figure is 71%.

<p><b>Crime</b></p>
<h1>Crackdown</h1>

<font size=1>NEW YORK</font>
<p>NOBODY ever lost an election by underestimating the enthusiasm of the public for cracking down on crime. Accordingly, Michael Howard, the home secretary, is putting it about that the government is planning to import the techniques that reduced crime by 27% in New York between 1993 and 1995. Jack Straw, the shadow home secretary, is not critical, but miffed: he says he thought of it first.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The idea behind the policing strategy that was adopted by William Bratton, New York's former police commissioner, comes from James Q. Wilson, an academic at the University of California. His "broken windows" theory maintains that small bits of disorder lead to larger crimes. A building with a broken window signals to potential criminals that the authorities are not bothering to keep order, so they are more likely to attempt a burglary. Hence policemen were told to arrest people for minor infringements as well as for serious crimes.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the same time, Mr Bratton revolutionised management. Crime figures used to take two months to emerge from the precincts. Now they take four days. Headquarters thus knows quickly what is going on. At regular meetings, precinct commanders are hauled up before their colleagues and held to account by their superiors.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The high-profile Mr Bratton has gone, but his methods remain. Not everybody, however, is convinced. There is some doubt, for instance, about how closely the figures reflect reality. Vinne Bavaro, a cop in the Midtown South precinct, says of Mr Bratton: "He knew how to play the numbers game." Caroline Nicholl, a British chief superintendent from Milton Keynes who is on a Harkness Fellowship studying American policing, says that she has seen precinct commanders manipulating their statistics.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ms Nicholl is also worried about the contrast between the style of policing in New York and Britain. The first is aggressive, the second aims to build up trust. "New York policing," says Ms Nicholl, "sets up perverse incentives. For instance, if a precinct commander builds up a relationship with a community, then the reported crime figures are bound to go up." Crime might not have gone up, policing might have improved, but the precinct commander would get stick.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another worry is that, while New York-style policing may reduce crime, it may create other problems. One of the techniques adopted under Mr Bratton, for instance, is "doing a vertical"--going through a tower block in a deprived area, arresting everybody who does not live there, and taking them down to the police station for questioning. This discourages people from carrying guns casually, and it helps the police gather information about drug dealers. But it also means harassing young (mostly black) people who may be minding their own business. It was this style of policing that led to the riots in Brixton in London in 1981, and which was condemned by Lord Scarman's report on the incidents.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is also some doubt about whether new policing techniques have really been responsible for the falling crime figures. Crime has dropped as sharply in other cities--Kansas City and Houston, for instance--which have not adopted New York's policing practices. Criminologists tend to attribute the drop in crime to a decline in the use of crack--whose introduction in the mid-1980s was generally thought to be responsible for the rise in violence in the second half of the decade--and to a fall in the proportion of young men in the population. But since crack use is barely affected by policy, and the number of young people not at all, such explanations are not popular with policymakers.

<p><b>Casinos</b></p>
<h1>Game over</h1>

<p>CONSIDER the following set of proposals for the deregulation of a major British industry. Its product will be legal in Oxford, but not in Cambridge. It will be legal to buy it with a debit card, but not to buy it with a credit card. It may be sold to those who want to buy it so long as they decide to do so at least 24 hours before they want it; but sell it on the day, and you will be breaking the law. Do not, however, think of helping your customers to apply for it by advertising in local newspapers. This will be illegal, though it will be perfectly legal to advertise it in the Yellow Pages.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;You would think that only a minister with mad-cow disease could come up with such a mess. But in fact these proposals for the deregulation of Britain's casinos have been produced by a Home Office minister, Timothy Kirkhope, who is an enthusiast for deregulation. Unbelievably, it took his department six years since the matter was first considered, and nearly two years since a promise of change from the home secretary, to the end of the consultation period on the detailed proposals on May 31st. An early general election would leave the proposals stranded.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why has it taken so long to produce such a dog's dinner? The answers would make a case study in bad government. First, ministers kept changing--three in 15 months, one of whom, Nicholas Baker, was not keen on the whole business. Second, ministers were told that if they deregulated more thoroughly, they might need to introduce a new law, instead of acting under the powers vested in them by existing deregulation law. New legislation would introduce further delays.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Third, the Home Office ran into obstruction from the Treasury over the number of towns that could be allowed extra casinos. More towns, the Treasury said, would mean more gaming inspectors which would add to public spending. In vain did the industry argue that it would also mean more revenue for the Treasury, much of it from tourists, amounting to many times the cost of the inspectors. Eventually a compromise was reached. Gaming would be permitted in 13 more areas on top of the 53 where it was already legal. They include Oxford, but not Cambridge. The casino industry would rather have half a loaf than no loaf at all, so the plans will probably go through.

<h1>Fidelity's fallen star</h1>

<font size=1>NEW YORK AND LONDON</font><p><b>The surprise departure of Jeffrey Vinik, the manager of America's biggest mutual fund, is a warning to other financial wizards--and their employers</b></p>

<p>IT IS easy to see why they are often portrayed as demi-gods. They can move billions of dollars at will. They are fabulously rich. At times, they seem to hold the fate of financial markets in their hands. So it is no surprise that investors such as George Soros and Warren Buffett have been hyped by the media. Or that fund-management companies make strenuous efforts to lionise the managers who perform well.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The contribution of such stars is one of the issues raised by the fall of Jeffrey Vinik, who on May 23rd resigned as captain of the $56 billion Magellan Fund, America's largest mutual fund and the flagship of Fidelity, the country's biggest fund-management group, which has over 200 funds and some $400 billion under management. Mr Vinik is leaving, he says, to start a fund-management firm of his own.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Magellan's former boss had not had an easy passage recently. Last year he was accused of misusing Magellan's muscle in the stockmarket. Several widely reported lawsuits were launched by shareholders in Micron Technology, a computer company, alleging that the fund manager had quietly sold shares in Micron even as he was publicly talking favourably about the company's prospects. Mr Vinik and Fidelity vigorously denied any wrongdoing. However, it was not this incident that led to his downfall. Rather, it was an ill-timed bet.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the start of this year, worried by the sharp rise in American share prices in 1995, Mr Vinik reduced Magellan's equity holdings to around 65% of its assets and invested the rest in bonds and cash. Because the stockmarket continued to boom, the fund's returns have trailed behind those of the <font size=-1>S&P</font> 500 index, the industry's benchmark. That, it seems, was unacceptable.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other mutual-fund firms may choose to ignore Mr Vinik's troubles. When a tide of cash is crashing into your coffers, there is little time to contemplate the fate of rivals. During the past 15 years, as the top chart on the next page shows, the amount of new cash pouring into long-term mutual funds (ie, equity and bond funds) has remained impressive, reaching a net $123 billion or so last year. In the first four months of this year, such funds got another $108 billion, or about four times as much as in the same period in 1995. In April alone, some $26 billion poured into equity funds, the second biggest monthly inflow ever.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This flow of money has enabled many fund-management groups to prosper by means of a simple strategy: market successful funds (and managers) as hard as possible and keep starting up new ones. In the past two years alone, over 1,100 new funds have been added (see <a href="fn1.gif"> chart</a>). But when this heady pace slows, perhaps with the onset of a bear market, the morals of the Vinik story may become clear.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One such moral is that, in an overcrowded industry, fund-management firms are becoming increasingly accountable to their investors, and the freedom of their managers to manage funds in their own way is becoming correspondingly narrower. In recent years an entire sub-industry has arisen to rate the performance of various funds against their "peers" . The reports of firms such as Morningstar, which award coveted stars to the most successful funds, are zealously followed by investors seeking the best home for their money.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This has been a boon to the marketing departments of funds with managers who achieve star status for a time. But, by raising expectations so high, the emphasis on performance also makes any subsequent disappointment all the greater when managers underperform.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although Mr Vinik's fall from grace provides a dramatic example of a long-term record that was not stellar enough to help him over a short-term blip in performance, it is not an isolated case. Paul Wick, the manager of a successful technology fund for <font size=-1>J&W</font> Seligman, a New York firm, became a sought-after guru when his fund performed spectacularly in 1994 and early 1995. After sagging technology shares dragged the fund down by nearly a fifth late last year, Mr Wick was no longer widely quoted--only to resurface recently as his fund's performance improved.
</p><p><b>Under the microscope</b>
<br>The growing scrutiny by outsiders such as Morningstar has put new pressure on managers to conform strictly to investment guidelines. In attacking Mr Vinik for moving the Magellan fund so decisively away from equities, some investors seem to be taking the view that there can never be a case for more prudent investment in bonds and cash. The demand for disclosure is also narrowing the autonomy of fund managers. In March Piper Jaffray, a fund manager, was censured by the National Association of Securities Dealers and fined $1.25m after it was found that a supposedly staid bond fund marketed by the firm between 1991 and mid-1994 was in fact investing in highly risky mortgage bonds.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other regulators have entered this disclosure debate. To help investors, the Securities and Exchange Commission (<font size=-1>SEC</font>), America's stockmarket watchdog, has floated the idea of simple, two-page mutual-fund risk prospectuses designed to lay out clearly the goals and policies of each fund. Eight fund managers are currently testing such prospectuses alongside the more complicated traditional offering.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition, as Mr Vinik's clash with Micron Technology shows, star managers have to be especially careful about what they say in public. Indeed, the Micron affair prompted Fidelity to ban all of its managers from discussing shares in individual firms, and has also prompted the <font size=-1>SEC</font> to begin a broad review of fund managers' trading patterns.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All these trends point in the same direction. It is becoming increasingly hard for individual managers, even the stars, to run their funds with the freedom that they have come to expect. This is not, however, a message that the industry seems willing to hear. Fidelity responded to Mr Vinik's resignation by reshuffling six of its fund managers and appointing one of them, Robert Stansky, to manage Magellan. No sooner was he anointed than the first articles picking over his investment style appeared in the press. No sign here of a retreat from the cult of personality.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Arguably, in the case of a fund as big as Magellan, the attention paid to the man at the top is justified. But many on Wall Street reckon that the fund is now too big for its own good. Outperforming the market is inherently tricky for a fund whose sheer size makes it difficult for it to move money without signalling its strategy to its competitors. It is also questionable whether a single person, however gifted, can handle such a large responsibility.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Just think: if, in addition to some cash, Magellan holds positions in, say, 100 different firms, then each holding could be worth as much as $500m. Yet most fund managers struggle to follow more than 50 firms at once. Unusually, Peter Lynch, a successful former manager of Magellan when the fund was much smaller, is supposed to have held shares in more than 1,000 different firms, buying into every company in the industry sectors he favoured.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps that is a clue as to what Fidelity should do with Magellan. Why not turn it into an index fund--that is, one which seeks merely to mimic the market's overall performance? That way the fund's 4m investors could be mathematically certain that it would not underperform, and Mr Stansky could avoid becoming another Icarus. Whether investors would put up with the loss of their demi-gods, and their divine performance, is another matter.

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<p align=center><img src="http://www.economist.com/econlogosmall.gif" width=78 height=39  alt="The Economist"></p>
<h1><center>The mystery of growth</center></h1>

<p>WHEN people in the rich North pause these days to think about the economic prospects of the poor South, they do so usually with a mounting sense of dread. As barriers to trade among nations fall, as capital flows ever faster around the globe, as the digital revolution spreads technological opportunity far and wide, how can workers in today's advanced economies hope to compete with the teeming low-wage masses of the third world? For years the North wrung its hands about poverty in the developing countries, and asked what could be done to relieve those countries' misery. Now, for the most part, the North no longer feels guilty about its wealth, or anxious to see the South do better: rather, it feels anxious about its wealth, and would prefer on the whole (but off the record) that the South stayed poor.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So far as economic policy in the industrialised world is concerned, the first thing to be said about such thinking is that it is deeply misconceived. The lessons of experience, and all we know about economic principles, teach that when poor countries grow richer, it is not at rich countries' expense. This view, together with some necessary qualifications, has often been advanced in this newspaper, and doubtless will be again. But, for the current purpose, consider instead the sheer oddity of the alarmists' case as viewed from most of the developing world.

</p><p><b>Through the looking glass</b>
<br>To a farmer in India, or Mexico, or Nigeria, the prospect of global economic power seems not exactly imminent--distant, even. Over the past 20 years, incomes in India have grown only a little faster than incomes in the seven biggest economies: the gap has narrowed, but at a snail's pace. Incomes in Mexico grew more slowly than in the <font size=-1>G</font>7 countries: in relative terms, Mexico's people are poorer than they were a generation ago. In Nigeria the same is true in absolute terms: incomes there have fallen by a quarter since the mid-1970s.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of course, the North's anxieties about competition from the third world are driven mainly by countries such as China, where output per head has risen prodigiously over the past 20 years, and by South Korea and the other East Asian tigers. But it is easy to forget just how exceptional these cases are. The fact is, most of the world continues to be blighted by poverty and economic backwardness. Where things are improving, it is often too slowly. In many places, things are getting worse.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The question is, why? On the face of it, this is indeed a puzzle--because the alarmists surely have a point. The economic opportunities available to today's developing countries are indeed unprecedented. Paradoxically, the gap between the richest countries and the poorest--wider now than at any time in history--is itself a measure of that. The enormous wealth of the world's rich countries is due to nothing more than advanced technology and accumulated capital. Yet both of these, it seems, are available to all.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Technology is more readily transferable across borders than ever before. Indeed, much of the innovation of the past 20 years has been directed, implicitly or explicitly, at the very task of shrinking distance. Progress in transport, telecommunications and computers has made it easier for poor countries to take part in the global economy. And it is often a feature of the newest technologies that they are easier for poor countries to adopt than the techniques they are replacing (compare satellite telephony with wire-based systems).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Technology has to be paid for, but this too should be less of a problem than it was. The global capital market is a fact, as well as a clich&eacute;. Governments and investors in poor countries now have ready access to it on commercial terms. In short, there is nothing about being poor, as such, that denies a country access to either capital or technology.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What then is the problem? One plausible answer is skills. What use is modern technology if a poor country's workers cannot read the instructions on a bag of fertiliser? Studies of the East Asian tigers agree that heavy investments in education paid off handsomely. Yet it is important not to press even this explanation too far. Remember that skills, too, can be bought and sold across borders. If lack of skills were the only thing holding poor countries back from spectacular growth, then the returns to possessing skills in such countries would be staggeringly high. Foreigners with skills would migrate to poor countries, in a flood rather than the present trickle. And far fewer educated citizens of India, Mexico and Nigeria would be found working in London or Washington, <font size=-1>DC</font>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This point is of broader relevance. The recent debate about Asia's growth "miracle" has made popular the view that, to grow, countries need merely to invest: in equipment, in roads, in human capital (ie, in skills). This is misleading: there is no "merely" about it. True, East Asia accumulated lots of capital; given that, its growth was unsurprising. But one also needs to ask, under what conditions will the right sort of investment, and plenty of it, happen? The simplest answer is, under conditions that grant the investor--a firm buying a new machine, a family sending its children to school--an adequate return. In much of the third world, such conditions are absent, and that is why poor countries stay poor.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Establishing those conditions is the task of economic policy. The past ten years have witnessed a resurgence of academic interest in growth, a subject oddly neglected hitherto. The thrust of the newest work, which has a refreshingly empirical flavour, is indeed that policy is what matters above all (see <a href="sf1.html">page</a>). Many studies now show that "market-friendly" policies work best: secure property rights; reliable enforcement of contracts; a liberal trade regime; low taxes and public spending; a welcome for foreign investors. Economists argue about how much weight to attach to one factor or another, but most have come to agree with this broad proposition: the key to growth is granting producers and consumers the economic freedom to face and respond to incentives.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The system that most conspicuously failed to provide this freedom was communist central planning. Its disappearance promises to raise incomes greatly over the coming years. China, which began granting farmers greater freedom in the 1970s, and which has since done the same for many industries (notably in its special enterprise zones), is already reaping huge gains. To maintain this progress, it will need to liberalise more, but its first steps have been pretty encouraging. The tigers' rapid growth, based again on an enlarged role for incentives and market forces, is equally impressive.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is no reason whatever why other poor countries should not aspire to the remarkable progress witnessed in East Asia. Indeed, the process may have started. Many developing countries--Mexico and India among them--have lately begun to liberalise their economic policies. As a result, their prospects are improving. They need to do more, and set their sights still higher. It is in everybody's interests that the North's alarmists should be more than merely worried; how much better if they were positively terrified.

<h2>Going mad</h2>
<p>Britain said it would <b>sabotage the work of the European Union</b> until the <font size=-1>EU</font> eases its ban on the export of British beef. It started by refusing to sign an <font size=-1>EU</font> bankruptcy convention. Leaders of other European countries denounced the decision as blackmail. Their fury did not stop the European Commission from again recommending that farm ministers lift the ban on exports of beef tallow, gelatin and semen.<p>
About 240,000 public-sector workers in Germany staged more <b>warning strikes</b> to protest against the government's plan to cut the budget deficit by freezing their wages, but the two sides were negotiating. Germany's economy contracted for the second consecutive quarter, putting it in recession by some definitions.<p>
Romano Prodi took office as prime minister in Italy's <b>first left-leaning government</b> in half a century. He pledged to discourage secessionist sentiment in the north by decentralising the state and to prepare Italy for the introduction of Europe's single currency in 1999.<p>
Radovan Karadzic, the <b>Bosnian Serb leader</b> wanted for war crimes, ceded some of his duties to deputies, but he appears to have lost little power. The Bosnian Serb parliament has broken the promise it made to western diplomats to push him aside. The vice-president, who assumed responsibility for foreign relations, and the new prime minister are considered as hardline as Mr Karadzic.<p>
Russia and Britain expelled four of each other's diplomats and declared an end to their <b>spying row</b>. It began when Russia accused Britain of buying secrets from a Russian civil servant.<p>
<p>
(See <a href="wtw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>
The European Union's <b>foreign population</b> was 3.3% of its 369m total in 1993. Turks were the largest group of non-<font size=-1>EU</font> nationals, making up 14.7% of the total. They are followed by citizens of ex-Yugoslavia, at 7.9%, and by Moroccans, who made up 6.2%. Some 400,000 Americans lived in the <font size=-1>EU</font>, half of them in Britain and Germany.

<h2>Business as usual</h2>
<p>As expected, President Clinton said he would renew China's <b>most-favoured-nation</b> status in its trade with the United States (Congress permitting). China complained that the need to renew <font size=-1>MFN</font> each year disrupted trade and political relations.<p>
China ratified the <font size=-1>UN</font> <b>Law of the Sea </b>convention and promptly announced new claims to contested parts of the South China Sea around the Paracel Islands, alarming some of its neighbours. Further claims, including those to the Spratly Islands, will be announced "at another time".<p>
Myanmar's military rulers detained around 200 <b>democracy activists</b> who were planning to attend a meeting this weekend at the home of the country's opposition leader, Aung San Suu Kyi.<p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
The president of <b>Bangladesh</b>, Abdur Rahman Biswas, sacked several senior officers, including the head of the army. All were placed under house arrest. The presidential palace is being protected against a threatened rebellion by troops loyal to the ousted officers. A general election is due to be held in the country on June 12th.

<h2>Welfare as weapon</h2>
<p>President Clinton endorsed a radical Wisconsin plan to abolish the main federal welfare programme, Aid to Families with Dependent Children. His main purpose was to pre-empt a big speech on welfare by the rejuvenated and <b>repackaged Bob Dole</b>, who had travelled to the mid-west to deliver it. Mr Dole was duly pre-empted.<p>
The Supreme Court struck down as irrational a Colorado law that barred cities from enacting statutes to <b>protect homosexuals</b>.<p>
Voters bark, but Latin America's <b>privatisation </b>caravan moves on. Brazil sold 55% of Rio de Janeiro's power company for $2.2 billion. Peru signed a deal with Mobil and Shell to exploit its huge Camisea gas field.<p>
<b>Mexico</b>'s Zapatist peasant rebels threatened to renew violence. <font size=-1>PAN</font>, the right-wing party, agreed to rejoin talks on democratic reform.<p>
In <b>Ecuador</b>'s presidential election, right-of-centre Jaime Nebot won a first-round lead, but by less than expected. In the <b>Dominican Republic</b>, leftist Jose Francisco Pe&ntilde;a Gomez led with 46% of the votes. But the right still hopes to unite and defeat him in the second round.

<h2>Iraqi oil is back</h2>
<p><b>Iraq and the United Nations</b> reached a deal at last. It allows Iraq to sell $2 billion-worth of oil over an initial six-month period. Two-thirds of the money will go on food and medicine for Iraqi civilians, including Kurds, one-third on Gulf war reparations and <font size=-1>UN</font> expenses. The <font size=-1>UN</font> will supervise the sale of oil and the purchase and distribution of food.<p>
Shimon Peres, Israel's prime minister, facing a tight election on May 29th, accused <b>Iran of plotting terrorism</b> to spoil his chances. Warren Christopher, America's secretary of state, agreed, and called on European countries to join the American trade boycott. Iran said it was the Americans who were fomenting tension.<p>
A <b>Tanzanian ferry</b> capsized on Lake Victoria, drowning several hundred people.<p>
Troops mutinied in the <b>Central African Republic</b>. French soldiers based there--and more specially flown in--protected foreigners and actively opposed the mutineers.<p>
<b>Zambia</b>'s parliament passed a bill raising technical hurdles to bar Kenneth Kaunda, voted out of the presidency in 1991, from standing again this year.<p>

<h2>Spat over Cuba</h2>
<p>At the Paris summit of the 27 rich countries in the <font size=-1>OECD</font>, Sir Leon Brittan, the European Union's trade commissioner, said America's <b>unilateral actions</b> on trade had set back global economic liberation. He called the new Helms-Burton act, which allows legal action against foreign companies investing in Cuba, "extra-territorial and expropriatory". And <b>Russia</b>, unexpectedly, asked to join the <font size=-1>OECD</font>.<p>
<b>Russia's Central Bank </b>said it was taking over the running of Unikombank, a Moscow commercial bank with assets of $1.8 billion and some 250,000 depositors. A Unikombank official admitted to a "management crisis" but gave no details. Much of Russia's banking industry is considered fragile.<p>
<b>Japan's trade surplus</b> contracted sharply, and unexpectedly, in April to its lowest monthly level in 13 years. It narrowed by 66% to &#165;321 billion ($3 billion). Meanwhile, Japan's big <b>trading companies</b> strengthened their profits.<p>
Jeff Vinik resigned as the manager of <b>Fidelity Investments'</b> Magellan Fund, the largest mutual fund in the world. He had been criticised recently because of the fund's poor performance. Fidelity said he was not forced to go. He plans to start his own investment company.<p>
Renato Della Valle, an Italian entrepreneur, sold his 23.4% stake in<b> Telepiu</b>, an Italian pay-<font size=-1>TV</font> station, to <b>Kirch</b> for 250 billion lire ($160m). The secretive German media firm is an ally of Fininvest, an Italian company under investigation for having given Mr Della Valle the money to buy the stake in Telepiu.

<h2>Bionic</h2>
<p><p>
(See <a href="wtw2.gif">chart</a>)<br>Shares in <b>British Biotech</b>, a firm that has yet to produce a single product, soared. Its market capitalisation of around &#163;150m ($265m) at its flotation in 1992 reached close to &#163;2 billion after trials of marimastat, a cancer treatment, proved promising.<p>
<b>Goldman Sachs</b>, one of Wall Street's most profitable investment banks and its last big private partnership, said it will become a limited-liability partnership from November 30th.<p>
<b>Bankers Trust</b>, an American investment bank that had made its derivatives business too fancy for some tastes, took further steps to bolster its customer relationships. It lured Paul Volcker, a former Fed chairman, on to its board, and purchased Wolfensohn &amp; Co, a merger firm founded by the present president of the World Bank.<p>
Less than two weeks into his new job as <b>Swiss Bank Corporation</b>'s chief executive, Marcel Ospel announced the final stages of a restructuring. Switzerland's third-largest bank will be split into four, the big change being the formation of two new divisions, one for private banking, the other for its huge fund-management business.<p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
As the Securities and Exchange Commission opened its case against <b>Joseph Jett</b>, a former bond trader at Kidder, Peabody accused of covering up vast trading losses, his former supervisor, Melvin Mullin, offered to pay $25,000 to settle <font size=-1>SEC</font> charges that he failed to supervise Mr Jett adequately. Mr Mullin agreed to be suspended for three months from the securities business.

<h2>Scratching a living</h2>
<p>America's Supreme Court reversed the notorious $2m award made against <b>BMW</b> for selling a doctor a car with retouched paintwork. An Alabaman court had awarded him $4,000 in compensation--and $4m in punitive damages (later halved by the state supreme court).<p>
A turnaround at its Brooks Brothers subsidiary helped pre-tax profits at <b>Marks and Spencer</b>, Britain's leading retailer, rise to &#163;965.8m ($1.5 billion) in the year to end-March, from &#163;924m a year earlier. <font size=-1>M&S</font> says Brooks is America's fastest-growing men's retailer. Its operating profits leapt by 81% to &#163;10.7m after a &#163;2.5m first-half loss.<p>
<b>McDonald's</b> and <b>Walt Disney</b> announced a global alliance, sharing exclusive marketing rights for everything from films to food, to run for ten years from January 1997.

<h2>Transported</h2>
<p><b>British Airways</b> soared past Singapore Airlines to become the world's most profitable airline, with record pre-tax profits of &#163;585m ($916m) in the year to end-March, nearly 30% up on the previous year.<p>
A possible strategic alliance between <font size=-1>BA</font> and American Airlines will happen only if the British government at last relents and agrees to an <b>open skies </b>agreement with the American government (that is, better access to Heathrow). Such a deal has just been forged with the German government, allowing Lufthansa and United to form a link; other European deals are nearing completion.<p>
<b>Japan's car makers</b> are expanding in China. Toyota won permission for a joint venture with Tianjin Auto to make 150,000 engines a year. They will be used in Charade cars which Tianjin already makes under licence from Daihatsu, a Toyota affiliate. Toyota hopes to open a new car plant in China. Suzuki is considering a direct stake in Changan Auto, with which it already has a joint venture.<p>
(See <a href="wtw3.gif">chart</a>)<br><b>ValuJet</b> halved its 320 flights to allow governmental safety checks after one of the low-cost carrier's aircraft crashed in the Everglades killing all 110 people on board.<p>

<h1><left>Cheap, dumb and connected</left></h1>

<p><left><b>Even so, "network computers" are not yet ready to change the world</b></left></p>


IF YOU know one thing about the history of the computer industry you know that in the 1980s the personal computer toppled the mainframe, making life miserable for <font size=-1>IBM</font> and turning Microsoft into one of the world's richest companies. On May 20th a collection of computer and software companies, led by Oracle, announced what they claim to be an equally revolutionary change. They have developed a common standard for simple machines that could do the job of a <font size=-1>PC</font> for a fraction of the price. These "network computers" will get their brainpower not from their own chips and software--which are cheap compared with those in a <font size=-1>PC</font>--but from the Internet and other networks to which they will be wired.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The companies involved say that there is a vast market for these slimmed-down computers. It includes hundreds of millions of households that cannot now afford a <font size=-1>PC</font> and the many offices where <font size=-1>PC</font>s are proving even more expensive than the mainframes they replaced. That may be true--some day. But for today, the numbers do not quite add up.

</p><p><b>The digital Achilles heel</b>
<br>In principle, the idea of network computers is sound enough. What a stand-alone <font size=-1>PC</font> can do, a networked one can often do better, simply because by linking up with many other computers it has more of everything--information, processing power and people--at its disposal. The rise of the Internet has taken that idea from offices to the world at large (see our survey of the <a href="http://www.economist.com/surveys/software/">software industry</a>). Now anyone dialling in from home has as much information and computing power within reach as the biggest companies. Cheap network computers, perhaps as part of a video-game or a small box beside a television, could spread such benefits from today's relatively few <font size=-1>PC</font> owners to the masses.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Just as long, that is, as the masses do not mind interminable delays. The problem with network computers is that they are no better than the networks they are connected to. In the home this usually means the telephone line, which is fine for voice but excruciatingly slow for data. To really shine, network computers need fast, digital connections, of the sort found in many offices but in hardly any homes.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Here's the rub: the people who would benefit most from cheap Internet terminals are the very people who would need the most expensive new networks to make them work well. It would cost billions to connect only those homes that already have cable-<font size=-1>TV</font> lines to high-speed data networks. Upgrading the telephone networks to do the same might cost even more. Better communications networks will come one way or another, but until the economic case for them becomes stronger, the day most homes have a fast digital connection is a decade or more away.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many offices, on the other hand, already possess fast data networks. There, the case for network computers is focused more on the desktop itself. Advocates of network computing point to the high cost of <font size=-1>PC</font>s: by some estimates as much as $10,000 a year for each user, mostly for support and training. Surely, they argue, by giving each user a cheap, low-maintenance machine, with all the software stored and maintained centrally, much of that could be saved. Perhaps. But most of the saving from such a solution would come from switching to new "intranet" software, not network-computer hardware; the lump of metal and plastic on the desktop accounts for less than 20% of total computing costs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What the Oracle camp overlooks is that the <font size=-1>PC</font>s on most office desks are practically network computers already. Most are wired to some network, and with the right software they can work just like Oracle's whizzy black box. In a few years it will be clearer whether specialised network computers really do offer any other advantages. It would be unwise, until then, to take Oracle's revolutionary manifesto too seriously.

<h1>The poor and the rich</h1>

<p><b>In recent years, researchers have moved closer to answering the most important question in economics: why are some countries richer than others?</b></p>


<p>UNDERSTANDING growth is surely the most urgent task in economics. Across the world, poverty remains the single greatest cause of misery; and the surest remedy for poverty is economic growth. It is true that growth can create problems of its own (congestion and pollution, for instance), which may preoccupy many people in rich countries. But such ills pale in comparison with the harm caused by the economic backwardness of poor countries--that is, of the larger part of the world. The cost of this backwardness, measured in wasted lives and needless suffering, is truly vast.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To its shame, economics neglected the study of growth for many years. Theorists and empirical researchers alike chose to concentrate on other fields, notably on macroeconomic policy. Until the 1980s, with a few exceptions, the best brains in economics preferred not to focus on the most vital issue of all. But over the past ten years or so, this has changed. Stars such as Robert Lucas of the University of Chicago, who last year won the Nobel prize in economics, have started to concentrate on growth. As he says of the subject, "the consequences for human welfare...are simply staggering. Once one starts to think about them, it is hard to think of anything else."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Early economists certainly thought about them. Adam Smith's classic 1776 book was, after all, called an "Inquiry into the Nature and Causes of the Wealth of Nations". Many building-blocks for understanding growth derive from him. Smith reckoned that the engine of growth was to be found in the division of labour, in the accumulation of capital and in technological progress. He emphasised the importance of a stable legal framework, within which the invisible hand of the market could function, and he explained how an open trading system would allow poorer countries to catch up with richer ones. In the early 19th century, David Ricardo formalised another concept crucial for understanding growth--the notion of diminishing returns. He showed how additional investment in land tended to yield an ever lower return, implying that growth would eventually come to a halt--though trade could stave this off for a while.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The foundations of modern growth theory were laid in the 1950s by Robert Solow and Trevor Swan. Their models describe an economy of perfect competition, whose output grows in response to larger inputs of capital (ie, physical assets of all kinds) and labour. This economy obeys the law of diminishing returns: each new bit of capital (given a fixed labour supply) yields a slightly lower return than the one before.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Together, these assumptions give the neoclassical growth model, as it is called, two crucial implications. First, as the stock of capital expands, growth slows, and eventually halts: to keep growing, the economy must benefit from continual infusions of technological progress. Yet this is a force that the model itself makes no attempt to explain: in the jargon, technological progress is, in the neoclassical theory, "exogenous" (ie, it arises outside the model). The second implication is that poorer countries should grow faster than rich ones. The reason is diminishing returns: since poor countries start with less capital, they should reap higher returns from each slice of new investment.
</p><p><b>Theory into practice</b>
<br>Do these theoretical implications accord with the real world? The short answer is no. The left-hand (see <a href="sf1.gif">chart</a>) chart on the next page shows average growth rates since 1870 of 16 rich countries for which good long-term data exist. Growth has indeed slowed since 1970. Even so, modern growth rates are well above their earlier long-run average. This appears to contradict the first implication, that growth will slow over time. It may be that an acceleration of technological progress accounts for this, but this should hardly console a neoclassical theorist, because it would mean that the main driving force of growth lies beyond the scope of growth theory .
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What about the second implication--are poor countries catching up? The right-hand chart overleaf plots, for 118 countries, growth rates between 1960 and 1985 against their initial 1960 level of <font size=-1>GDP</font> per person. If poor countries were catching up, the plots on the chart should follow a downward-sloping pattern: countries that were poorer in 1960 should have higher growth rates. They do not. Indeed, if there is any discernible pattern in the mass of dots, it is the opposite: poorer countries have tended to grow more slowly.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Having arrived at neoclassical growth theory, however, economics by and large forgot about the subject. It had a model that was theoretically plausible, but did not seem to fit the facts. How best to proceed was unclear. Then, after a pause of 30 years, along came "new growth theory".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This new school has questioned, among other things, the law of diminishing returns in the neoclassical model. If each extra bit of capital does not, in fact, yield a lower return than its predecessor, growth can continue indefinitely, even without technological progress. A seminal paper was published in 1986 by Paul Romer (see <a href="#foot">references</a>). It showed that if you broaden the idea of capital to include human capital (that is, the knowledge and skills embodied in the workforce), the law of diminishing returns may not apply. Suppose, for example, that a firm which invests in a new piece of equipment also learns how to use it more efficiently. Or suppose it becomes more innovative as a by-product of accumulating capital. In either case, there can be increasing, not decreasing, returns to investment.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In this and other ways, new growth theorists can explain how growth might persist in the absence of technological progress. But, they have gone on to ask, why assume away such progress? A second strand of new growth theory seeks to put technological progress explicitly into the model (making it "endogenous", in the jargon). This has obliged theorists to ask questions about innovation. Why, for instance, do companies invest in research and development? How do the innovations of one company affect the rest of the economy?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A further divergence from the neoclassical view follows. As a general rule, a firm will not bother to innovate unless it thinks it can steal a march on the competition and, for a while at least, earn higher profits. But this account is inconsistent with the neoclassical model's simplifying assumption of perfect competition, which rules out any "abnormal" profits. So the new growth theorists drop that assumption and suppose instead that competition is imperfect. Attention then shifts to the conditions under which firms will innovate most productively: how much protection should intellectual-property law give to an innovator, for instance? In this way, and not before time, technological progress has begun to occupy a central place in economists' thinking about growth.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the latest resurgence of interest in growth theory, however, the original neoclassical approach has enjoyed something of a revival. Some economists are questioning whether the "new" theories really add much. For instance, the new theory emphasises human capital; arguably, this merely calls for a more subtle measure of labour than the ones used by early neoclassical theorists. More generally, it is argued that if factors of production (capital and labour) are properly measured and quality-adjusted, the neoclassical approach yields everything of value in the new theory, without its distracting bells and whistles. So it often proves in economics: the mainstream first takes affront at new ideas, then reluctantly draws on them, and eventually claims to have thought of them first.
</p><p><b>The missing link</b></b>
<br>To non-economists, however, both approaches seem curiously lacking in one crucial respect. Whereas in popular debate about growth, government policy is usually the main issue, in both neoclassical and new growth theory discussion of policy takes place largely off-stage. To the extent that government policy affects investment, for instance, either could trace out the effects on growth--but the connection between policy and growth is tenuous and indirect. Each approach may take a strong view about the role of diminishing returns, but both remain frustratingly uncommitted about the role of government.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;An upsurge of empirical work on growth is helping to fill this hole--and, as a by-product, shedding further light on the relative merits of the new and neoclassical theories. The nuts and bolts of this work are huge statistical analyses. Vast sets of data now exist, containing information for more than 100 countries between 1960 and 1990 on growth rates, inflation rates, fertility rates, school enrolment, government spending, estimates of how good the rule of law is, and so on. Great effort has been devoted to analysing these numbers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One key finding is "conditional convergence", a term coined by Robert Barro, a pioneer of the new empirical growth studies. His research has found that if one holds constant such factors as a country's fertility rate, its human capital (proxied by various measures of educational attainment) and its government policies (proxied by the share of current government spending in <font size=-1>GDP</font>), poorer countries tend to grow faster than richer ones. So the basic insight of the neoclassical growth model is, in fact, correct. But since, in reality, other factors are not constant (countries do not have the same level of human capital or the same government policies), absolute convergence does not hold.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whether this is a depressing result for poor countries depends on what determines the "conditional" nature of the catch-up process. Are slow-growing countries held back by government policies that can be changed easily and quickly? Or are more fundamental forces at work?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most empirical evidence points to the primacy of government choices. Countries that have pursued broadly free-market policies--in particular, trade liberalisation and the maintenance of secure property rights--have raised their growth rates. In a recent paper, Jeffrey Sachs and Andrew Warner divided a sample of 111 countries into "open" and "closed". The "open" economies showed strikingly faster growth and convergence than the "closed" ones. Smaller government also helps. Robert Barro, among others, has found that higher government spending tends to be associated with slower growth.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Human capital--education and skills--has also been found to matter. Various statistical analyses have shown that countries with lots of human capital relative to their physical capital are likely to grow faster than those with less. Many economists argue that this was a factor in East Asia's success: in the early 1960s the Asian tigers had relatively well-educated workforces and low levels of physical capital.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A more difficult issue is the importance of savings and investment. One implication of the neoclassical theory is that higher investment should mean faster growth (at least for a while). The empirical studies suggest that high investment is indeed associated with fast growth. But they also show that investment is not enough by itself. In fact the causality may run in the opposite direction: higher growth may, in a virtuous circle, encourage higher saving and investment. This makes sense: communist countries, for instance, had extraordinarily high investment but, burdened with bad policies in other respects, they failed to turn this into high growth.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The number-crunching continues; new growth-influencing variables keep being added to the list. High inflation is bad for growth; political stability counts; the results on democracy are mixed; and so on. The emerging conclusion is that the poorest countries can indeed catch up, and that their chances of doing so are maximised by policies that give a greater role to competition and incentives, at home and abroad.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But surely, you might think, this hides a contradiction? The new growth theory suggests that correct government policies can permanently raise growth rates. Empirical cross-country analysis, however, seems to show that less government is better--a conclusion that appeals to many neoclassical theorists. This tension is especially pronounced for the East Asian tigers. Advocates of free markets point to East Asia's trade liberalisation in the 1960s, and its history of low government spending, as keys to the Asian miracle. Interventionists point to subsidies and other policies designed to promote investment.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Reflecting the present spirit of rapprochement between the growth models, it is now widely argued that this contradiction is more apparent than real. Work by Alwyn Young, popularised by Paul Krugman, has shown that much of the Asian tigers' success can be explained by the neoclassical model. It resulted from a rapid accumulation of capital (through high investment) and labour (through population growth and increased labour-force participation). On this view, there is nothing particularly miraculous about Asian growth: it is an example of "catch-up". Equally, however, the outlines of East Asian success fit the new growth model. Endogenous growth theory says that government policy to increase human capital or foster the right kinds of investment in physical capital can permanently raise economic growth.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The question is which aspect of East Asian policies was more important--which, up to a point, is the same as asking which growth model works best. Although debate continues, the evidence is less strong that micro-level encouragement of particular kinds of investment was crucial in Asia. Some economists dissent from that judgment, but they are a minority. Most agree that broader policies of encouraging education, opening the economy to foreign technologies, promoting trade and keeping taxes low mattered more.
</p><p><b>One more heave</b></b>
<br>There is no doubt that the neoclassical model of the 1950s, subsequently enhanced, together with the theories pioneered by Mr Romer, have greatly advanced economists' understanding of growth. Yet the earlier doubt remains. Both models, in their purest versions, treat the role of government only indirectly. The new empirical work on conditional convergence has set out to put this right. The fact remains that in the earlier theoretical debate between the neoclassical and the new schools, the question that matters most--what should governments do to promote growth?--was often forgotten.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A new paper by Mancur Olson makes this point in an intriguing way. The starting-point for today's empirical work is a striking fact: the world's fastest-growing economies are a small subgroup of exceptional performers among the poor countries. Viewed in the earlier theoretical perspective, this is actually rather awkward. Mr Romer's theories would lead you to expect that the richest economies would be the fastest growers: they are not. The basic neoclassical theory suggests that the poorest countries, on the whole, should do better than the richest: they do not. Neither approach, taken at face value, explains the most striking fact about growth in the world today.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Olson argues that the simplest versions of both theories miss a crucial point. Both assume that, given the resources and technology at their disposal, countries are doing as well as they can. Despite their differences, both are theories about how changes in available resources affect output--that is, both implicitly assume that, if resources do not change, output cannot either. But suppose that poor countries simply waste lots of resources. Then the best way for them to achieve spectacular growth is not to set about accumulating more of the right kind of resources--but to waste less of those they already have.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Marshalling the evidence, Mr Olson shows that slow-growing poor countries are indeed hopelessly failing to make good use of their resources. Take labour, for instance. If poor countries were using labour as well as they could, large emigrations of labour from poor to rich countries (from Haiti to the United States, for instance) ought to raise the productivity of workers left behind (because each worker now has more capital, land and other resources to work with). But emigration does not have this effect.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Data on what happens to migrants in their new homes are likewise inconsistent with the two growth theories. Immigrants' incomes rise by far more than access to more capital and other resources would imply. It follows that labour (including its human capital, entrepreneurial spirit, cultural traits and the rest) was being squandered in its country of origin. When workers move, their incomes rise partly because there is more capital to work with--but also by a further large margin, which must represent the wastage incurred before. Mr Olson adduces similar evidence to show that capital and knowledge are being massively squandered in many poor countries.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This offers a rationale for the pattern of growth around the world--a rationale that, consistent with the recent work on conditional convergence, places economic policies and institutions at the very centre. According to this view, it is putting it mildly to say that catch-up is possible: the economic opportunities for poor countries are, as the tigers have shown, phenomenal. The problem is not so much a lack of resources, but an inability to use existing resources well. It is surely uncontroversial to say that this is the right way to judge the performance of communist countries (those exemplars of negative value-added) before 1989. Mr Olson's contention is that most of today's poor countries are making mistakes of an essentially similar kind.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The question still remains: what are the right policies? One must turn again to the empirical evidence. That seems a frustrating answer because, suggestive though recent work on conditional convergence may be, such findings will always be contested. Citizens of the world who sensibly keep an eye on what economists are up to can at least take pleasure in this: the profession has chosen for once to have one of its most vigorous debates about the right subject.

<p><b>Northern Ireland</b></p>
<h1>What election?</h1>

<font size=1>BELFAST</font><p>
YOU would not know that Northern Ireland's election was due on May 30th. Hardly anybody is talking about it. Instead, debate is about what the elections are really about: the all-party talks due to be held on June 10th, and the chances that they will produce anything of substance.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The British government insists that Sinn Fein must satisfy three conditions if it is to take part in the talks. It must stand in the election. It must accept the "Mitchell principles" set out by the International Body on Decommissioning, chaired by George Mitchell, an American senator--essentially, forswearing violence. And it must persuade the <font size=-1>IRA</font> to declare a ceasefire.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sinn Fein fully intends to stand in the election. It is expected to get around 10% of the vote. And this week, Sinn Fein's leader, Gerry Adams, said that his party accepted the "Mitchell principles".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, another ceasefire seems no closer. In a speech at a republican ceremony in Belfast on May 12th, Brian Keenan, a republican hardliner, threatened that "those who don't want peace will get war." Mr Keenan, released from an English jail three years ago, sees decommissioning--getting the <font size=-1>IRA</font> to give up their weapons--as Britain's only aim in talks. He also called Irish ministers "bastards" for putting insufficient pressure on Britain.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Adams says that a ceasefire is in the gift of the <font size=-1>IRA</font>, not Sinn Fein. His growing insistence that he speaks only for Sinn Fein feeds speculation that an open split is imminent among the republicans he has led for almost 20 years.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unionists, meanwhile, fear that the government will not push hard enough to disarm the <font size=-1>IRA</font>. David Trimble, the Ulster Unionist leader, threatens to withhold the support of his party's nine votes in the Commons if the government shows signs of backsliding. John Major has been trying to reassure his Unionist-sympathising backbenchers that decommissioning will indeed be "addressed" at the start of talks. Unionists prefer the word "resolved".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Irish government wants the arms question raised during negotiations, rather than as the first (and therefore probably the last) stage of talks. This was what the Mitchell commission recommended. It recognised that for both the <font size=-1>IRA</font> and Loyalist paramilitaries disarmament before negotiations meant surrender and humiliation. It argued for "modest steps on decommissioning" at the same time as progress towards political compromise. Talks between the Irish and British governments held on May 22nd once again failed to resolve the issue.

<h1>The estate we're in</h1>

THERE are few starker illustrations of the changes in British society after 17 years of Tory rule than the revolution in "social housing"--that is, homes rented by local councils and housing associations.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A report to be issued on May 24th by the Institute for Fiscal Studies, an independent research group, shows that in 1961 a third of British families lived in social homes. Now less than a quarter do, and they are far likelier to be poor than even 20 years ago. Average real incomes of social renters were 20% lower in 1993 than in 1973. In 1979 less than a third of families in social housing came from the poorest 20% of the population, and around a tenth from the richest 20%. The poorest now account for half of social renters, the richest virtually none. Until the mid-1970s, unemployment of male heads-of-household was not much higher in social housing than average (see <a href="br1.gif">chart</a>). By 1992, barely half of male heads-of-household in the social sector had a job, compared with 85% elsewhere.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mostly, this reflects success, not failure. Allowing renters to buy their home took many of the better-off out of social housing, reduced dependency on the state and improved maintenance of the country's housing. Stricter rules on eligibility meant that only the truly needy stood much of a chance of obtaining social housing, which also makes sense.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet there is a drawback to limiting social housing to the poor: it makes it harder for them to become less poor. To cut the subsidies to social renters who are not poor, the government has forced up rents, by 30% in real terms between 1989 and 1993 alone. Those unable to pay can claim means-tested housing benefit, which 60% of social tenants now do. Because means-tested benefits are withdrawn as a claimant's income rises, however, they are a disincentive to the jobless finding work. The <font size=-1>IFS</font> calculates that, because of taxes and withdrawal of benefit, 70% of unemployed men in social housing would increase their net income by less than 40p for every &#163;1 received in income from employment.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One solution is to raise the threshold at which benefit is withdrawn, or to withdraw it more slowly. This would be costly, and claimants would still depend on means-tested benefit. An alternative is to cut social-housing rents. This would benefit not just the unemployed but also those in work, those unfit for work, and the retired--and so would be even costlier. If rents were cut only for people under 60 and not disabled, the price would come down. But presumably that is to think the unthinkable.

<p><b>Politics</b></p>
<h1>Selective cull</h1>


<p>"SHORT of being caught in the act of sodomy, it's virtually impossible for a Tory <font size=-1>MP</font> to be deselected", one ex-cabinet minister said last week. Yet Sir George Gardiner, the <font size=-1>MP</font> for Reigate and no sodomite, may be about to achieve deselection nevertheless. His local party votes on June 28th on whether to unseat him for disloyalty to John Major, following a 15-14 majority against him last week in the local party executive. He is apparently strong in party branches with few members and weak in those with more, which means that his chances are no better than 50:50.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In fact, deselection of Tories is much more common than the conventional wisdom has it. In all, this century, 37 Tories have been dumped by their constituencies. Two, David Ashby and Robert Banks, have already been deselected in this parliament; homophobia played a part in the first case, and constituency neglect in the second. A third, Sir Nicholas Scott, whose problem was that he drank and drove, narrowly avoided the sack.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What makes Sir George's case stand out is what he is threatening to do about it. He says that if he is dropped, he will immediately resign, precipitating a by-election. No previous Tory has done any such thing, though Dick (now Lord) Taverne, did it as a Labour <font size=-1>MP</font> when dropped by his Lincoln party in 1973. (He fought the seat as an independent and won.) It would be an expensive gesture by Sir George, as <font size=-1>MP</font>s who quit voluntarily in mid-parliament forgo the &#163;34,000 in redundancy pay they would get if they held on until the general election.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With the government's overall Commons majority down to one, Sir George presumably hopes that his threat will persuade his opponents to back off. However, it is not as potent as it looks. Even if he quits, the by-election will not have to be held until December--and if the Tories cannot win a seat as safe as Reigate at a by-election come December, Mr Major is anyway doomed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many of his colleagues in parliament are strangely uncharitable towards Sir George. They point out that he describes himself as a "grassroots Conservative"--ie, a supporter of the narrow Thatcherite views presumed to be held by Tory activists. To their ill-concealed glee, it turns out that those very activists don't think much of his carping at John Major.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Party deselection was long feared by Tory and Labour <font size=-1>MP</font>s alike because it allowed party extremists to subvert the voters' choice by defeating moderate <font size=-1>MP</font>s. But in the Labour Party over the last ten years, more left-wingers have been deselected than have moderates. Sir George's case suggests that the same may now apply to <font size=-1>MP</font>s on the wilder fringes of the Tory right.

<h1>Biotech blooms</h1>

CAN British Biotech, a firm that is still several years away from any products, even if things go well, really be worth &#163;2 billion--putting it on a par with such solid profit-makers as Tate &amp; Lyle and WH Smith? This question divided City analysts on May 21st, when the company announced encouraging results from clinical tests on marimastat, a cancer treatment it is developing. The drug will now undergo a final set of trials, and if successful, may go on sale in 1999.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The firm's share price soared to more than &#163;33 on the news, from less than &#163;5 a year ago. It will go much further if marimastat lives up to the expectations of the optimists. They include Anthony Colletta of <font size=-1>ABN</font> Amro Hoare Govett, an investment bank, who says British Biotech is perhaps four years ahead of other firms which are working on similar drugs. The latest tests on marimastat showed that more than half of 232 patients with prostate, bowel and pancreatic cancer showed an improvement, having failed to respond to other treatments. Mr Colletta says there are currently about 5m patients in rich countries with such cancers, and reckons that if marimastat won just 15% of this market its sales could reach &#163;3.5 billion a year, with a profit margin of up to 50%.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The pessimists hear echoes of America's recent biotech boom and bust, when investors stampeded into buying shares in firms which failed to live up to the hype. Steve Plag of <font size=-1>BZW</font>, another investment bank, is among the doubters; he says the optimists underestimate the possibility that marimastat may have long-term side-effects which are more serious than the aching joints reported in the trials carried out so far. It may take years for British Biotech to convince regulators if any new worries over side-effects do arise, allowing its rivals to catch up. There are also many pitfalls in manufacturing and marketing a new drug, and Mr Plag points out that British Biotech has no experience in these areas yet.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So British Biotech could be the most successful high-tech firm of the 1990s, or a spectacular flop--or something in between, if its drugs prove to be effective in only a limited number of cases or face serious competition. The penalty for failing to make the stockmarket's dreams come true would be severe. The lesson for the bosses of Britain's current breed of high-tech companies is that in addition to their scientific and financial skills, there is another vital skill they need--that of managing expectations.

<p><b>Roads</b></p>
<h1>Peering into the shadow</h1>


<p>THROUGHOUT the ages, the lure of the lender has been to "take the waiting out of wanting". But rarely has a borrower been more enthusiastically hooked than the British government. In its adoption of shadow tolling as an apparently painless way to pay for new roads, it has all the fervour of a convert. Since 1994 more than 40 schemes, with a construction cost of more than &#163;1 billion, have been announced. Under the shadow-toll proposals, contractors design, build, finance and operate new roads. The government pays them back according to how many vehicles use the road over the following 30 years.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Earlier this month, the Department of Transport invited businesses to tender for three new shadow-toll roads. Four contracts have already been awarded. The winner of the fifth, a consortium led by <font size=-1>BICC</font> and W.S. Atkins, was announced on May 21st. Many more are in the pipeline.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With the exception of the Channel tunnel rail link, the Department of Transport is by far the biggest user of the government's private finance initiative (<font size=-1>PFI</font>). Shadow tolling seems to offer something for everyone. To free-market enthusiasts it looks like an extension of privatisation. To public-sector adherents it appears as the most promising way to secure much-needed long-term capital investment. For politicians of all persuasions, desperate to escape the shackles of public-expenditure constraints, it offers a way to get off-balance-sheet finance for new roads. And for the numerous consortia of construction companies, banks, and city law firms with an interest in road building, it offers a feast of contracts after a long period of famine.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Is it, however, a good deal for the taxpayer? The Metropolitan Transport Research Unit, an independent consultancy, is to publish a study later this month which claims that it is an expensive form of hire-purchase finance. The study, commissioned by Transport 2000 and other public-transport pressure groups, examines one proposed shadow-toll contract, the <font size=-1>A36</font> Salisbury by-pass, and concludes that it would cost roughly twice as much as it would if it were financed directly by the public sector. The study's author, Keith Buchan, a former local-authority transport planner, says that the cost will be higher by between 84% and 131%, assuming a conservative 12.5-15% rate of return.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Peter Collis, director of the Highways Agency's private-finance division, dismisses such estimates out of hand. "We have achieved very substantial value for money. Significant savings are being achieved," he insists.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is impossible to judge who is right, because the government refuses to say what it is paying for shadow-toll roads, or how the costs compare with a publicly financed road. <i>The Economist</i> has asked the Department of Transport to reveal the details of shadow-toll contracts, but it has so far refused, claiming that the information is commercially confidential and revealing it would prejudice future negotiations. If the department maintains that stance, we shall refer our request for information to William Reid, the Parliamentary Commissioner for Administration, who supervises the government's code of access to official information.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The lack of openness about shadow tolls may suit ministers, but it does nothing to reassure voters, who may justifiably wonder if they are being taken for an expensive ride. The Automobile Association claims that the government's enthusiasm for shadow tolling is driven more by expediency than by a wish to develop an efficient financial structure for new road construction. The National Audit Office, which is currently looking at shadow tolling, will eventually report on the matter.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the meantime, only a stab at the truth can be made. Evidence given to the House of Commons Treasury Select Committee, whose report on the private-finance initiative was published last month, suggests that the transaction costs of shadow tolling are high. Tendering costs are up to five times more expensive than for a publicly financed road, while borrowing costs can be twice as much.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On top of those extra costs there is the contractor's profit. Jonathan Scott, executive director of <font size=-1>SBC</font> Warburg, a merchant bank which is one of the key players in the shadow-tolling business, says that investors in such schemes are looking for a return on their equity investment somewhere in the range of 15-20%.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Against these potential additional costs there are undoubted efficiency gains from using the private-sector. There are large savings to be made, according to John Connally, who is engineering task-force leader for Howard Humphrey, the design engineers for the first shadow-toll contract, the <font size=-1>A1(M)</font> in Cambridgeshire, which was awarded last year. "We are taking the outline design and turning it into detailed design in five rather than 12 months," he says. The Highways Agency says that the crucial advantage of shadow tolling is that it links together design, construction and maintenance in a single contract, allowing builders to achieve long-term savings by building roads to a higher specification.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition to the question of cost, shadow tolling raises other contentious issues. Transport 2000 warns that it will increase traffic, because the companies building the new roads will have a direct incentive to maximise traffic flows. However, the point that more roads will reduce blockages and thus ensure the efficient use of roads is also one of the strongest arguments for the idea.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Transport 2000 is also worried that a rush of private finance into road-building may trample other considerations. Stephen Joseph, its director, thinks that it is one thing for the government to bulldoze an ecological site or compulsorily purchase somebody's house, but quite another for a private company to do so for profit. Whatever the rights and wrongs of his argument, it could have political force when old ladies are turfed out of their houses.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Shadow tolling may well make sense, and road planning is still the preserve of the government, not the private sector. But allaying fears of expensive sweet-heart deals or abuses of government powers will be impossible without much greater transparency. Taxpayers surely have a right to know what long-term commitments are being made on their behalf, and to have some way of judging whether their money is being spent wisely.

<p><b>Netting New York</b></p>
<h1>http://manhattan</h1>

<p>NEW YORK, if you believe New Yorkers, is always on the brink of disaster. Yet the place invariably confounds its doomsayers. Because New York is so expensive to do business in, it has to dump yesterday's industries and embrace tomorrow's more quickly than anywhere else. Among America's big cities, it was first in and first out of shipping, manufacturing and corporate head offices. Now it is shifting fast into electronic publishing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;An area of wired lofts and offices on Manhattan known as Silicon Alley has spread from around the old Flatiron Building on 23rd Street. A survey in April by the New York New Media Association (<font size=-1>NYNMA</font>) and Coopers &amp; Lybrand, a consultancy, found that about 18,000 people in New York city were working full-time for more than 1,100 new media firms, compared with fewer than 17,000 in <font size=-1>TV</font> and radio and 13,000 in newspapers. Most of this growth has come in the past two years.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why New York? Part of the answer is the city's strength in traditional media, or "trad med" as the new digerati (digital literati) call it. It needed nerds tinkering brilliantly in California to create new communication technologies. But it took writers, editors and phrase-makers, all New York specialities, to provide content. While the technologists financed by venture capitalists from California's Menlo Park tinkered happily in Mountain View, Cupertino, Milpitas and other Californian towns, the creative folk headed for New York, America's traditional media hub.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More concretely, when trad-med powerhouses such as Time Warner and Rupert Murdoch's News Corporation began to pour money into new media they did so from their established New York bases, rather than starting afresh on the west coast. But giants like these which have traded their typewriters for mice, and like Dow Jones, which has launched an online edition of the <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, are vastly outnumbered by small start-up companies. And it is these small companies--half of the new media firms in the New York area have a turnover of less than $500,000 a year--that are mainly responsible for the new media boom in New York.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Total New York, which produces a faddish Internet-based listings magazine and a soap opera, and SonicNet, the Web publisher of a music magazine, are the sort of firms that crave loft spaces and industrial design. The result: the heart of Silicon Alley is an area south of the Flatiron Building and encompassing Chelsea, SoHo and Tribeca.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The high concentration of new media companies is now New York's greatest advantage in electronic publishing: it is simply easier to do business with a neighbour than a stranger. This provides the city with an edge over its rivals, notably the technology enclaves of the west coast. In San Francisco such contenders as <i>Wired</i> magazine, the rattle-bearer of new media, cluster in an ill-defined sprawl.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Silicon Alley is much less amorphous. <font size=-1>NYNMA</font> and the Worldwide Web Artists Consortium and the companies themselves have created a new business community. Cybersuds, the <font size=-1>NYNMA</font>'s monthly networking social, where cyberspace artists and directors mix with each other and beer (hence the suds) has served as a catalyst. When Cybersuds began in mid-1994, it attracted a couple of dozen developers, most of whom already knew each other. Today its monthly meetings draw 1,000 artists, designers and programmers to a frenzy of networking and business-card swapping. Some of the new firms are more hip than profitable and, unfortunately, hip won't pay the bills.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;New York's record is not unblemished. Two of the bigger names in the business, News Corporation, whose online service, Delphi, is based in the Flatiron district, and Prodigy have had to lay off workers. Many companies complain that Nynex, the local telephone utility, does a poor job in providing the infrastructure needed for Internet connections. As a result, new media companies have swarmed around points in the city where rival telephone companies provide access to data pipes. A few others have headed for the New York Information Technology Centre at 55 Broad Street.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Next to Wall Street and far south of the heart of Silicon Alley, this building brags that it is the first to be hardwired for the information revolution. It provides every mod con for high-tech tenants: built-in computer networking and high-speed Internet access. It also benefits from big tax breaks provided by the city and state governments. Its landlords, Rudin Management, insist that tenants have a suitable multimedia pedigree. The approach seems to work: some of them have even struck deals in the lift.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?832978800,iss">Search</a>

<p align=center><img src="http://www.economist.com/econlogosmall.gif" width=78 height=39  alt="The Economist"></p>

<h1><center>How Bob Dole should fight</center></h1>

IF YOU believe the opinion polls, America's presidential election is all but over, six months before the voting booths open. To believe that would be foolish, given that voters seem to change their minds even more often than before, and presidential campaigns are strewn with elephant traps. Yet what is extraordinary is that talk that Bill Clinton has already as good as won is coming not from complacent Democrats but from despairing Republicans--the same party that barely two months ago made Bob Dole its candidate-presumptive by an overwhelming margin. Mr Dole's cause is hopeless, they mutter noisily, because, well, so is he. His speeches ramble, his campaigning is dire. The despair may be justified; or it may not be. Let Mr Dole prove his detractors wrong; this week he made a bold effort to do so by resigning from the Senate, his political home of 36 years (see <a href="am1.html">page</a>). Still, prediction is not the business of this article.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That business is the argument that Mr Dole and the Republicans should make in this campaign. The remarkable feature of American politics is the way in which the Republicans--not just, or even mainly, Mr Dole--have given away the policy high-ground which they seized at Congress's mid-term elections in 1994. That victory forced President Clinton to swing to the right, trimming his views on the federal budget and the role of government, and re-positioning himself as a moderating force against congressional zealotry. He bent to the Republican arguments, and even smartened up his foreign policy, albeit for other reasons. Yet now it is conceivable that a landslide re-election for Mr Clinton could also lose the Republicans their control of Congress, opening the way for yet another re-positioning of the Clinton White House, this time back to the interventionist left. That prospect is what makes Mr Dole's task important--win or lose.
</p><p><b>The arguments against Bill Clinton</b>
<br>To Mr Dole, what matters is getting elected. To the wider world, what will matter is what kind of government America will have in the next few years. Which is why the first argument to be made is that it should not have the kind Bill Clinton wanted when he was elected in 1992.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Clinton's instinct is to meddle and intervene in the economy. The saving grace of his first two years was that Congress wouldn't let him. His plan to "kick-start" economic growth was rejected, and notions from his labour secretary, Robert Reich, and others for wider intervention were blocked, chiefly by Robert Rubin, now at the Treasury. America's economy is doing well, a fact that could help Mr Clinton in November, because policy has been guided by Alan Greenspan (a Republican) at the Federal Reserve and Mr Clinton has paid heed to the worldly Mr Rubin. Yet interventionist ideas keep flowing, most recently ways to "encourage" good corporate behaviour. That flow must be dammed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the federal budget, the popular view is not only that Mr Clinton came out the winner of last winter's long impasse but also that he is committed to eliminating the deficit. The truth is that his victory came on tactics rather than strategy: the plan to balance the budget by 2002 was a Republican one. And his commitment to spending cuts is doubtful, especially given his refusal to countenance the ending of welfare's status as an automatic entitlement. Neither party can be relied on to curb spending further, and both dabble with the electoral bribery of tax cuts. But the plan is likelier to unravel under Second-Term Clinton and a Democrat-run Congress, and with it the hope of reviving America's paltry savings rate. It is the importance of the budget for that which needs to be brought out in this campaign, and with it the hard choices required for a leaner government.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most telling, perhaps, are the arguments about foreign affairs. On paper, and once extremists' views about withdrawal from <font size=-1>NATO</font> or the United Nations have been discounted, Republican foreign policies differ little from President Clinton's. It is not hard to list the challenges America faces, and to recommend that they must be dealt with boldly, with leadership, and so on. But in diplomacy style matters almost as much as substance, and it is in this regard that President Clinton's weaknesses emerge most clearly. Take virtually any topic--Bosnia, the Middle East, Northern Ireland, Russia, China, Japan--and in the end the Clinton administration has hit on more or less the right policy. But only after its first idea, or second or third, was wrong.
</p><p><b>The arguments for a different sort of president</b>
<br>This mixture of talk-first-think-later and wavering in the face of domestic lobbies has created a damaging uncertainty about America, in the eyes of friends and foes alike. Uncertainty about where it stands, but also uncertainty about whether it means what it says. To conduct foreign policy in this manner would be wrong at any time. To do so now, with China likely to pose increasing dangers in Asia and Russia liable to be troublesome whoever wins its presidential vote this summer, would be folly, grand scale.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;You might argue, and many surely will, that the Clinton administration has finally learnt how to govern; that this is not the time to bring in another bunch of neophytes. If that proves to be so, then fine. But can that be depended on? Mr Clinton and his team have above all proved creatures of circumstance; if their circumstances change, so might they. That gives Mr Dole his opportunity, as well as making it important that a mediocre president be faced with a credible challenge.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Dole can, and should, stand for a different sort of government. The president was originally meant to be a moderating influence, a person who would take a statesman-like view of the dangers facing the nation rather than getting up to his elbows in day-to-day legislation. Mr Dole's decision to stand for election "without office or authority...a private citizen...just a man," is a welcome sign that he will take this stance, and will make it more plausible that as president he would be a counterbalance to a Republican Congress rather than simply an agent of one.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As the campaign gathers pace, the usual temptations will present themselves: the buying off of domestic lobbies, the making of expansive promises to act here, there and everywhere. Mr Dole does not come with a smarty-pants agenda, and should not seek one, whether in tax-cut pledges or (a looming weakness) bashing Japan over trade. For that is the mode of government, and of the presidency in particular, away from which America should be turning. Against a meddlesome Democratic candidate, the argument Mr Dole must make is that the presidency needs a different, more stable, more dignified sort of occupant. Even Mr Clinton might be convinced. For the point will hold regardless of who wins.

<h2>Dole gets serious</h2>
<p>Bob Dole, the Republican presidential candidate, announced that he was not only giving up his post of majority leader but was <b>retiring from the Senate</b> altogether to concentrate on his campaign against President Bill Clinton.<p>
A <font size=-1>DC</font>-<font size=-1>9</font> <b>aircraft crashed </b>in the Florida Everglades, killing all 110 people on board. Federal officials insisted that low-cost airlines such as ValuJet are safe.<p>
<b>Brazil</b> announced a new human-rights programme. Five days before, the Senate scuppered a bill that would have brought abuses by the armed police to civil, not army, courts.<p>
The <b>Dominican Republic </b>held first-round presidential elections. Its 89-year-old, blind president, Joaquin Balaguer, was barred by law--after 6.5 terms--from standing, and his favoured candidate was expected to come a poor third.

<h2>Conferring</h2>
<p>After talks with some of <b>Algeria</b>'s political leaders, President Zeroual revealed his proposals for reforming the constitution, and rescuing the country from its four-year civil war. These would enforce the separation of religion and politics--presumably outlawing religious parties such as the <font size=-1>FIS</font>--and encourage political pluralism.<p>
Hosni Mubarak of Egypt, King Hussein of Jordan and Yasser Arafat of embryonic Palestine met in Cairo to denounce<b> Israel</b>'s "concepts of expansion, superiority and domination". Israel, meanwhile, tightened control on Palestinian movement: no workers to be allowed in from Gaza until further notice, none into Jerusalem until May 19th.<p>
Amid great pomp, Iran and Turkmenistan inaugurated a 300km (190-mile) railway link between Mashhad and Tedzhen. This plugs a gap in the <b>Silk Road </b>railway route through Central Asia, putting Iran, or so it hopes, at the hub of east-west trade links.<p>
A truce stopped <b>Liberia's civil war</b>--for two days, after which fierce gunfire broke out afresh. Some 2,000 refugees were allowed to land in Ghana, after nine days packed on a cargo vessel. Sierra Leone took 700 from another ship.<p>
<b>South Africa</b> picked itself calmly up from the National Party's May 9th decision to leave the coalition government. The rand strengthened against the dollar; stocks and bonds were uneasy, no more. Municipal voting in troubled KwaZulu-Natal was rescheduled for June 26th.<p>
Ten years after he seized control of <b>Uganda</b> in a coup, Yoweri Museveni was elected, democratically, to a five-year presidential term.

<h2>A new leader, just</h2>

<p>The Hindu-nationalist Bharatiya Janata Party formed <b>India's new government</b>, with Atal Behari Vajpayee as its prime minister. The party and its allies have 194 seats in the new 545-seat hung parliament, but may not muster enough support in a vote of confidence due by May 31st to stay in power. Previous governments in India, which has a large Muslim minority, have been secular in policy.<p><td valign=top width=30%>
Six western and three Indonesian <b>hostages </b>held by a separatist group in the Indonesian province of Irian Jaya were freed by the Indonesian army. Two other Indonesian hostages were found dead.<p>
Hong Kong speeded up the repatriation of <b>boat people </b>to Vietnam after 120 escaped from a detention camp. The British colony aims to deport its remaining 17,500 boat people before the territory is handed over to China next year.<p>
A tornado ripped through northern <b>Bangladesh</b>, killing more than 550 people.

<h2>Tightened belts</h2>
<p>Real <b>growth in the European Union</b> will be a scant 1.5% this year but will rise to 2.4% in 1997, the European Commission predicted. It said that Germany and France would cut their public-sector deficits to 3% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> or less in 1997, allowing them to qualify for Europe's economic and monetary union (<font size=-1>EMU</font>) two years later.<p>
Other <font size=-1>EMU</font> hopefuls readied plans for <b>deficit reductions</b> this year and next. France wants to cut taxes and freeze spending. Italy's outgoing prime minister, Lamberto Dini, wants 12 trillion lire ($7.7 billion) in spending cuts. And Belgium's parliament gave its prime minister, Jean-Luc Dehaene, special powers to push through social-security reforms and BFr25 billion ($791m) of budget savings in 1996.<p>
Postmen and other public-sector workers in Germany staged <b>warning strikes</b> against plans to cut public spending by DM70 billion ($46 billion) next year largely by denying them a pay rise. Germany's 16 states rejected the federal government's proposals for tax reform.<p>
International pressure grew for the extradition of <b>Radovan Karadzic</b>, the hardline Bosnian Serb leader, after he dismissed Rajko Kasagic, the (moderate) Bosnian Serb prime minister.<p>
Bulgaria's government decided to shut down 67 <b>loss-making state companies </b>as part of a programme to cut its debt and restore confidence in its creditworthiness.<p>
Turkey's parliament voted to investigate <b>corruption charges</b> against a former prime minister, Tansu Ciller. Many of the votes came from the Motherland Party, which governs in coalition with Mrs Ciller's True Path Party. Their coalition was further weakened when the constitutional court said a parliamentary vote of confidence in the government was invalid.<p>

<h2>Leaner and meaner</h2>
<p>A <b>trade war</b> edged closer as the United States and China threatened each other with punitive tariffs in a dispute over intellectual-property rights.<p>
(See <a href="wtw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>Two big defence contractors, Lagard&egrave;re Groupe's Matra and British Aerospace, are to merge their <b>missile businesses </b>to create Europe's biggest missile maker. The new company, Matra <font size=-1>BA</font>e Dynamics, could join Daimler-Benz Aerospace and Britain's <font size=-1>GEC</font> in bidding for Thomson-<font size=-1>CSF</font>, the defence-electronics subsidiary of Thomson, soon to be privatised by the French government.<p>
European ministers approved plans designed to enhance <b>Airbus Industrie</b>'s ability to compete with its arch-rival across the Atlantic, <b>Boeing</b>. The Airbus consortium, which shares work between its four partners from France, Germany, Britain and Spain, will cut costs by becoming a single company.<p>
The French government is selling a further chunk of <b>Renault</b>, ending 50 years of state control. The 6% sell-off will raise about FFr2 billion ($380m) and reduce the state's holding in the car maker to 46%, but a full privatisation still seems some way off.<p>
First <b>General Motors</b> filed suit against <b>Volkswagen</b> in an American court, citing fraud. Now, two months on, Volkswagen is demanding DM10 billion ($6.5 billion) from the Detroit giant for defamation. The long-running dispute between the two car makers goes back to 1993, when Jose Ignacio Lopez and several others left <font size=-1>GM</font> to join <font size=-1>VW</font>, allegedly taking industrial secrets with them.

<h2>Crossed lines</h2>
<p>The new head of <b>Apple Computer</b>, Gil Amelio, announced a plan to avoid "a long, slow decline into irrelevancy". The loss-making computer firm will halve the number of models on offer to about 40, cut costs by 15%, license the Macintosh operating system to more computer makers and concentrate more on the Internet.<p>
Arrest warrants were issued for seven senior managers at <b>Fininvest</b>, an Italian media group controlled by Silvio Berlusconi, a former prime minister, for allegedly falsifying accounts in 1989-95.<p>
The government of Abu Dhabi, principal shareholder in the failed <b>Bank of Credit and Commerce International</b>, paid a $1.55 billion settlement to <font size=-1>BCCI</font>'s liquidator.<p>
Two American oil giants, <b>Philips </b>and <b>Conoco</b>, are talking of dumping their gasoline-refining and marketing operations into a joint venture with over $5 billion-worth of assets, a cost-saving measure already adopted by British Petroleum and Mobil. <b>Mobil</b>, meanwhile, at last reached agreement to buy <b>Ampolex</b>, an Australian energy group, after the American oil giant raised its bid to A$1.78 billion ($1.43 billion).<p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
A new startRussia said it would set new trading bands for the <b>rouble</b> with effect from July 1st. The official floor-rate, currently 5,150 roubles to the dollar, is to be lowered to 5,600 roubles, and then progressively to 6,100 roubles by the end of 1996.<p>
One of Britain's big electricity generators, <b>PowerGen</b>, reported pre-tax profits of &#163;687m ($1.08 billion) for 1995 against &#163;545m a year earlier, and said it would buy back 10% of its shares. The sale of PowerGen's 21% stake in Midlands Electricity to America's Avon Energy for &#163;353m will pay for the buyback: Avon is now proceeding with the takeover of Midlands that was barred to PowerGen by the British government.<p>
(See <a href="wtw2.gif">chart</a>)<br>Up to a fifth of shareholders in <b>Montedison</b> want the sprawling Italian food, chemicals and energy giant broken up, and accuse the board of poor corporate governance. But Montedison is 32% owned by Ferfin, in turn owned by Mediobanco, a shadowy merchant bank which would prefer to expand Montedison, not break it up. At least Montedison's share price received a boost.<p>
The drama at <b>Sony Corp</b> may finally have produced a happy ending. Thanks to rising sales of semiconductors and mini-disc players, the Japanese electronic giant reported a group net profit of &#165;54.3 billion ($564m) for 1995, with better to come, reversing 1994's loss of &#165;293.36 billion. That year, its Hollywood-based entertainment group ran up losses of &#165;50 billion and resulted in a &#165;265 billion write-off for the group.

<h2>The big one</h2>
<p><b>Lloyd's of London</b> offered an improved &#163;3.1 billion ($4.7 billion) package to the insurance market's investors (names), cutting by nearly half the average amount names must find to cover their past losses--though some will find themselves worse off. All in all, the package is worth an extra &#163;1.2 billion. And in California, home to a large cluster of names, the threat of litigation has been shelved by a "standstill agreement" , allowing Lloyd's to negotiate further.<p>
The long-running derivatives dispute between <b>Bankers Trust </b>and <b>Procter &amp; Gamble </b>was settled before it went to court when <font size=-1>P&G</font> agreed to pay only $35m of the $195m it owed the bank under two unprofitable swap agreements. The consumer-goods firm had sued the bank for fraud, claiming it had been misled over the risks.<p></p>

<h1>Two are two, and all alone</h1>
<p><b>Neither Bob Dole nor Bill Clinton, it seems, warms the hearts of America's voters. The moment for a third force to stride on the scene? Don't count on it.</b></p>


<p>BACK in the beginning, America hoped it could do without parties. It nonetheless acquired them almost as soon as it was born. One group of men wanted the constitution adopted, the other did not. Result: a Federalist party and an Anti-Federalist party. The Founding Fathers hated this blight on the harmony of their new republic; they thought that party spirit must have entered man's soul, like sin, with Adam's first bite of the apple in the Garden of Eden. Yet parties were indispensable to organise political activity, to select candidates for office, to mobilise voters, and--in a constitutional system that had carefully separated the executive from the legislature--to get legislation passed at all. They were dreadful, but nothing worked without them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The ambivalence persists to this day. Americans are deeply dissatisfied with their two huge parties, the Democrats (born circa 1832) and the Republicans (born 1854). Yet they cannot agree on the reason for their dissatisfaction. Some say the parties are too strong: they hold a duopoly of power, keep interesting contenders out, tie up all political money and pander outrageously to special interests. Others say they are too weak: they stand for nothing at all, try to be all things to all men (and fail), and have fewer and fewer serious members; they are ripe for euthanasia at the hands of either a new third party or a hero of truly independent mind.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In fact, both accusations are true. America's two old parties are dauntingly strong: not so much at the national level, where they are all vapid speeches and patriotic platforms, but powerful indeed at the local level of wards, city halls and congressional districts. Barely a politician can be found at this level who is not a Republican or a Democrat. Bill Weld of Massachusetts, Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin, George Bush Junior of Texas, all the rising governors making a name for themselves, would never dream of going independent; that is the sort of thing dreamy senators do in their retirement. Parties are enabling machines through which men rise to power. Without them, most still get nowhere.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Besides, America's system of single-member congressional districts, elected on a winner-take-all basis, means that there is no point in a multiplicity of parties at local level. Two is quite enough: one For, one Against. If there were any movement for proportional representation in America, the picture would look different. But there is none; the word "Italy", evoking memories of multi-party corruption, is enough to scotch the thought. If special interests want to gain influence and power, they set out to link themselves to one or other of the two big parties. They give it money, butter up its candidates, and hope for the desired result. The local habit persists when men start to think about running the country.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With so much inherent strength, reports of the death of America's two main parties are greatly exaggerated. Both have several times been prematurely killed off.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Democrats were thought unlikely to survive the rise of the Populists in the 1890s; the Republicans seemed likely to collapse with Wall Street after 1929. The fact that the Democrats now seem a rump party of the disadvantaged, and the Republicans sometimes look like an impossibly volcanic combination of gun-owners, militant Christians, businessmen and anti-taxers, should not be taken as indication of imminent demise for either. The Republicans can probably live for many years with the running sore of Pat Buchanan's populism, just as the Democrats lived for years with the nagging segregationists of the South.
</p><p><b>Less ideological...</b></b>
<br>They can do so because the two main parties are like giant umbrellas, covering almost anything. Each now stands for approximately the reverse of the principles it once held. In their beginnings, the Democrats were the party of states' rights and of western pioneers; now they are renowned as the party of big government and urban minorities. The Republicans were radically against slavery and in favour of high tariffs; now they are mostly free-traders, and leave civil rights to the Democrats.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<i>Autres temps, autres moeurs</i>: neither party is remotely embarrassed about these changes. Fluidity in ideology, or even outright lack of it, is not the weakness in America that it would be in Europe. Most Americans dislike ideology in their politics. If they want to make a statement, they join a pressure group, from the Anti-Saloon League to the Sierra Club; and such groups sometimes have more influence on politics than the established parties. Pundits who proclaim that the rise of single-issue politics since the 1980s will spell the death-knell of parties are curiously blind to history. Single-issue groups have always been there, biting at the hide of the major parties. Few grow into parties themselves, because it is hardly worth the effort.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tiny parties espousing vigorous principles certainly exist in America. Those worth mentioning include the Greens, the Libertarians, the Socialists and the Communists. From year to year, they put up candidates for presidential elections, and regularly get around 0.1% of the vote. Meanwhile, the two giants now seem in broad and bland agreement: free enterprise, free (or free-ish) trade, mild internationalism, leaner government, balanced budgets, preservation of all the benefits of vital groups of voters. Comity goes even further: both Democrats and Republicans often represent the same broad interests, draw money from the same groups, and are, of course, dead set against any attempt to reform the electoral system.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Curiously, this is not how many Americans see it. A prime source of dissatisfaction with the parties nowadays is not that they are too alike, but that they are too far apart. They are too "partisan", "too ideological in a silly way", as Bill Kristol, a Republican wise man, puts it. To such Americans, last winter's budget impasse, when the government was partly shut down over the issue of which programmes should be cut and how fast, was the last straw. After the long gridlock of the late 1980s, when a Republican president vetoed the bills of a Democratic Congress, Americans got a Democratic president truculently asserting his manhood against the Republicans.
</p><p><b>...means more flexible</b></b>
<br>In America's experience, things are more likely to get done when approached in a bipartisan--or non-partisan--spirit. Progress comes from co-operation among liberal Republicans (" boll weevils") and conservative Democrats ("gypsy moths"), plus a small number of genuinely bipartisan souls. President Clinton's effort to reform health care failed, in large part, because he failed to forge compromises between the parties. It is notable that after the budget showdown of 1995-96, which displayed partisanship at its worst, the moths and weevils once again crawled out of the woodwork and tried to put centrist alliances together.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Increasingly, Americans seem to be heading for this non-ideological land. For years, the number identifying themselves as either Democratic or Republican has been falling. The young ones, those aged between 18 and 29, seem particularly disenchanted. Even among voters bold enough to register with a party, 30% of Democrats and 26% of Republicans claim to be unhappy with their own organisations.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is also true that the electoral performance of third forces has been improving. Since 1968, three leaders of such movements--George Wallace, a segregationist ex-governor of Alabama, John Anderson, a scholarly ex-Republican from Illinois, and Ross Perot, a pint-sized Texan billionaire--have won more than 6% of the vote in a presidential election. In 1992 Mr Perot, despite a three-month withdrawal from the race and a full rack of alarming phobias, won 19%, the best showing since the 27% won by Teddy Roosevelt and the Bull Moose Party in 1912. Since January, Mr Perot has been priming himself to run again this year; in mid-May, the odds are that he will do so.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Both Mr Anderson and Mr Perot (though decidedly not Mr Wallace) made their pitch to the shifting centre. Yet the centre was, and is, no solid and coherent entity. It is an amalgam of the downsized and the disillusioned--pitchfork Buchananites, libertarian Perotistas and a huge number of people who feel vaguely dissatisfied with life. Some of these would call themselves "independents", but the number answering to that label has barely increased over the past ten years. "Floating voters" would be a better tag. The signs are, in fact, that any party promising change in more than a token fashion (or fielding a startlingly attractive candidate) could capture these folk. That includes the Democrats and the Republicans just as much as any new-fangled force: witness the Republican triumph in the congressional elections of 1994.
</p><p><b>The power of size</b></b>
<br>The big parties keep their grip, and third parties stay feeble, for two chief reasons. The more obvious is that the big parties put up obstacles. Republicans and Democrats control the state legislatures, and state legislatures set the conditions for listing parties or candidates on the local ballot.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Once a party has performed respectably (meaning getting more than 20% of the vote in Kentucky, but 5% in Illinois and a mere 1% in Michigan) in one election, it is usually assured of a place on the ballot at the next one. This is how the Prohibitionists and the Socialist Workers' Party manage to limp from election to election. But a new-minted third party (or a candidate launching a run independent of any party) must go through a gruelling process of gathering signatures in every state in order to appear on the ballot. In Maine, an aspiring candidate must gather 4,000 signatures; in Kentucky, 5,000; in huge California, 147,238.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even when these are painstakingly collected, in shopping malls and outside libraries, state officers from the dominant parties may well find some way to invalidate dozens of them. In 1980, Mr Anderson's effort to get on the ballot as an independent in all 50 states (with equal-access lawsuits along the way) drained away all the money he needed for television commercials. In 1992, the same task cost Mr Perot $14m of the $62m he spent on the election; and now, because he is running at the head of the new Reform Party, he is having to go through the process all over again.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Money, of course, is the next problem. Third parties tend not to emerge in America because they cannot afford it. Unless the third force in question is headed by, or consists of, a billionaire such as Mr Perot, it needs rich private sponsors; and even these are limited by law to contributions of $1,000 or less. The way round that--since there is no limit to what individuals may spend on their own candidacies--is to put the rich sponsor on the ticket. David Koch, a New York millionaire, was put on the Libertarian ticket as vice-presidential candidate in 1980. Not uncoincidentally, that was the year the Libertarians made their best showing. Mr Perot, too, would be subject to campaign-spending limits unless he became the Reform Party's nominee: which is the best reason for supposing that he will either be its nominee or abandon the party and run as an independent.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The question of organisation is a vexed one. Should a man run an insurgent candidacy by himself? Should he form a new party? Should he allow himself to be drafted by an existing small party of roughly similar outlook? Or should he wait for some more general call, perhaps as late as the party convention?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are always in American politics distinguished figures kicking their heels, apparently waiting for this moment. It can be a long tease, on both sides. The present crop includes Bill Bradley, an ex-senator from New Jersey; Lowell Weicker, an Independent ex-governor of Connecticut; Pat Buchanan, who keeps hinting that he may bolt the Republican Party for a more red-blooded group; and everyone's favourite, ex-General Colin Powell, who has lost none of his free-standing charisma by admitting that he is a Republican.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such men may benefit from being part of a party structure: it brings money, organisation, volunteers and the hope of a longer life on local ballots. For their part, third parties are almost bound to fail without a charismatic figure to lead them. The American Independent Party, though it survives, limps without George Wallace and the segregationist fervour that fired it. There would be no Reform Party at all, not even a shadow, without Mr Perot. Men like this grab media attention and get a party treated seriously: an essential complement to--and sometimes a substitute for--hard cash.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But charismatic figures may also insist on going their own way. This can strangle a nascent party in its cradle; or, if the party exists already, it may cause dangerous dislocation to the message. Ralph Nader, a consumer activist chosen in March as the candidate of the Green Party in California, brings instant name recognition (lugubrious face, organic food, hatred of big car companies); but he will not endorse the whole party platform. Mr Buchanan has been touted as the nominee of the <font size=-1>US</font> Taxpayers' Party; but his conservative baggage may prove an embarrassment. In general, minor parties prefer to choose candidates no-one outside their own circle has heard of. This ensures ideological purity, and continuing oblivion.
</p><p><b>The one that nearly made it</b></b>
<br>Third parties would like to blame the Republican-Democratic duopoly for all their woes. But that would not be right. Much of the fragility of third forces comes from the way they are formed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Far more are created from the top down than from the bottom up, out of popular demand. Typically, a party splinters at the top; a man or a faction breaks off over one particular issue, such as tariffs or segregation, and tries to drum up a following. This raises all the problems of personality and free agency already discussed. It is much rarer for new parties to grow out of the grass-roots, however many disaffected people there may be around the place. When this does happen, it is far more likely to produce lasting results. Both the Democrats and the Republicans came into being in more or less this way. So did the third party that came closest to supplanting one of them, the Populist Party of the 1890s.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Populists, struggling farmers and small businessmen from the South and the West, wanted the country to abandon the gold standard and go to silver, or to paper money. The two major parties, comfortably ensconced in power and cosy with big business, offered them no hope. Under their charismatic leader, William Jennings Bryan of Nebraska, the Populists became a crusading force that looked as if it might win the 1896 presidential election.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There was, however, a fatal snag. Bryan was actually a signed-up Democrat; and the Democrats promptly pre-empted the Populists by choosing him as their nominee. Quite soon (and after the Democrats under Bryan had lost the election), the Populists withered away. The Democrats in this case showed a nimbleness that neither they nor the Republicans have ever lost. Big parties do not win elections only by making a dash for the centre; they also marshall their forces to absorb adroitly upstart movements on their flanks. For the Populists, the result was predictable: a radical third force was swallowed up by an ageing body that had money, organisation, contacts--and a better chance of winning.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite these dismal precedents, excited speculation about a third force is still alive in 1996. If America is indeed in the midst of a new information revolution as disruptive as the old industrial one, many people may well feel that the two old parties no longer represent their interests or recognise their worries. A third party that claimed to do so might start to gather strength, though it is more likely to happen in 2000 than in the present campaign.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Besides, in a narrow race, any plausible third candidate can cause disruption. This year, Mr Nader is likely to siphon off votes from Mr Clinton in California, a state the president must win if he is to hold on to office. And Mr Perot, if he runs, can cause discomfort to either side. In 1992, he was generally credited with stealing votes that would otherwise have gone to George Bush. His present supporters, apparently poorer and less well-educated than those of 1992, may steal votes from Bill Clinton.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet few expect Mr Perot to do as well this year as in 1992. He no longer strikes the same chord. A downsizer himself, he is no spokesman for the economically anxious; a social liberal, he is not in tune with voters' worries about the loss of "values" . Worse, he has already suffered the classic fate of third forces: many of his best ideas, such as budget cuts and smaller government, have become the bread and butter of both the big parties.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This happened to the Populists, too; their ideas, among them a graduated income tax and currency reform, were adopted by the big parties years after the Populists had expired. And it happened to the Progressive Party, whose support for equal rights and labour reform both before and after the second world war did much to push the Democrats to the left.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even the most potent third force must often content itself with just that: pricking the conscience of a big party, and pushing it along the way of reform. For most purposes, a pressure group could do as much. But America's two huge old parties, like Mount Everest, invite direct assault just because they are there. The assaults will go on. What third parties fail to realise is that, if the present duopoly were overturned with no change in the electoral system, it would merely result in a new duopoly with different names; and that, if they were to replace either the Democrats or the Republicans, they too would probably become just as bland and complacent as today's big boys.

<h1>Can this caterpillar fly?</h1>

<font size=-1>WASHINGTON, DC</font>
<p>THE metamorphosis was something to behold. With uncharacteristic eloquence, Bob Dole announced on May 15th that he would within a month give up not only his job as majority leader but leave the Senate altogether, his home since 1968. He will become Citizen Bob, devoting his energies to the presidential campaign, leaving Washington behind to "seek the bright light and open spaces of this beautiful country", and promising to overcome the odds "the hard way", as he has before. Friends promptly praised the move as an act of courage, which it is. But it is a courage born of panic.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Having clinched his party's nomination, a presidential candidate is wont to suffer from the onset of "voters' remorse" (as William Schneider, a political analyst, calls it). Do we really want this fellow, the voters groan? Normally, they punish the presumptive nominee in the late primaries. This time, with the primary schedule compressed, the phenomenon struck in a broader way. Remorse about Mr Dole, reflected in the opinion-poll chasm between him and Bill Clinton, swept the nation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With good reason. Stumbling through his speeches, talking of leadership without showing much of it, Mr Dole looked almost an embarrassment of a candidate. His weaknesses were exposed by his Republican rivals in the primaries, but he prevailed because their weaknesses were even worse. Since then, he has been woefully slow in putting together a strategy for November's election. He allowed himself to slip back into his beloved job of majority leader at the expense of concentrating on the world beyond Washington.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Dole's own flaws are not his only troubles. Between now and his official nomination at the party convention in August he is strapped for cash, because of campaign spending limits. His opponent, on the other hand, can hop around the country on Air Force One, basking in presidential publicity. The newly disciplined Mr Clinton relentlessly links Mr Dole to the unpopular Newt Gingrich and the "extreme" Republican Congress.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The president is reinforced by an economy that briefly threatened to stop growing but is instead expanding nicely. <font size=-1>GDP</font> grew at an annual rate of 2.8% in the first quarter of 1996, inflation is low and unemployment is down to 5.4%. Four years ago, according to <font size=-1>CBS</font>/<i>New York Times</i> surveys, only 24% of Americans considered the economy to be in good shape; now 56% do.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All this is translating into a formidable advantage for Mr Clinton in the polls. Since the Gallup Organisation started systematic polling 60 years ago, no incumbent president with an approval rating of at least 50% six months before an election has gone on to lose. Mr Clinton's approval rating stands at 55%. He also has a 20-point lead in the match-up against Mr Dole, according to Gallup. Again, nobody has led by so much in May and managed to lose in November (Michael Dukakis holds the dubious record of frittering away a 16-point May lead over George Bush). In other words, for Mr Dole to overcome Mr Clinton's strong popularity and large lead would be unprecedented.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But not unimaginable. A dozen post-1945 elections are too few to serve as a basis for dependable predictions, especially at a time of unusual electoral volatility. The opinion-poll evidence is tricky to interpret, as some polls show the gap between the candidates to be even bigger (31 points, in a Harris poll) and others show it to be smaller (12 points, in a <i>Time</i>/<font size=-1>CNN</font> poll). Republicans take comfort from the electoral-college map, which brings out the difficulty Mr Clinton faces in winning enough states in a broadly conservative country. The gathering in Washington this week of Republican governors, who run 31 of the 50 states, underlined the point.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Dole relied heavily on the support of these governors to carry the primaries, and they could be a big help in November, too. George W. Bush, the governor of Texas and a close observer of his father's two presidential campaigns, professes to be satisfied with the state of Mr Dole's effort. The strategy is "more fully-fledged than you would know", he says, and is "in the process of being articulated on paper".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bits of the strategy are emerging. At every opportunity and on every issue, Mr Dole will seek to contrast his own presumed conservatism with Mr Clinton's alleged liberalism. The Dole campaign's internal surveys apparently show that, when people are "reminded" of such contrasts, Mr Dole's numbers look far more perky.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Dole's own life story, the rise from Dustbowl and war injury to national power and glory, will be increasingly brought into play. He is famously reticent in talking about his extraordinary physical ordeal.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Once again, last week, he skipped an opportunity to do so, omitting the mention contained in the prepared text of his address at Gallaudet University, a college for the deaf. But his speechwriters persist: in his announcement on Wednesday Mr Dole spoke of the time when "I arose from my hospital bed and was permitted by the grace of God to walk again in the world." And his handlers arrange interviews in which he describes the daily struggles of dressing with his crippled right arm and his preference for food that does not need cutting, such as sandwiches and ice cream.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Candidate Dole is, at last, adjusting his style to the task ahead. <i>USA Today </i>astutely observed that, in a speech last week, Mr Dole used the personal pronoun <i>"</i>I<i>"</i> 59 times and only once indulged in his much-mocked habit of referring to himself as <i>"</i>Bob Dole<i>"</i>. He has reportedly accepted the idea of working with a speech coach and of making greater use of teleprompters. Former speechwriters for Ronald Reagan are helping to sharpen his message. His performance on Wednesday was notable for its loftier tone and smoother delivery.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To be sure, many tactical questions have yet to be settled (whom to pick as running mate, whether to devote serious money to competing in Calfornia, how to handle the nettlesome issue of abortion). But, however painfully, the Dole campaign is taking shape. With the threat of a pitchfork breakaway by Pat Buchanan becoming ever more remote, and now that remorseful Republicans have had the chance to let off steam, it may even be that Mr Dole can count on a more unified party.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The president is, of course, a superb campaigner. By stealing Republican policies and keeping to the middle ground on almost every issue, he makes it hard for the "liberal" label to stick. No sooner does Mr Dole propose a bill banning homosexual marriage, for example, than Mr Clinton makes it clear that he too opposes the idea (though he might not sign a bill banning it).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Still, Mr Dole's spring fortunes have sunk so low that almost any movement is bound to be up. This simple fact leads to talk of the momentum swinging his way. There is still plenty of time for Mr Clinton, the frequent fumbler of 1993-94, to make mistakes, or to face some Whitewater or foreign-policy crisis. Plenty of time, too, for "voters' remorse" to bite into the president's apparently handsome lead, as more and more Americans ask: Do I really want to give this man a second term?

<p><b>Individual shareholders</b></p>
<h1>Unpopular capitalism</h1>


IF YOU see Sid, try to cheer him up. Thousands of Sids, as the government's advertisements called small investors during the campaign to privatise British Gas ten years ago, saw the price of their shares in the firm plunge after the gas industry's regulator announced strict new price controls on May 13th (see <a href="br2.html">page</a>). The announcement was unwelcome news for the government, too: it is currently trying to tempt small investors to buy shares in Railtrack, which owns the rail network. The sale of Railtrack, scheduled for May 20th, is the latest exercise in "popular capitalism"--the attempt to spread share ownership, traditionally the preserve of the wealthy, throughout the land. Once one of the Tories' favourite policies, the effort to build popular capitalism has been less successful than its architects hoped.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;True, the number of people owning shares has risen sharply, thanks to the government's policy of allocating a large slice of privatisation shares to individuals, rather than selling them only to big financial institutions. About 3m people owned shares in 1979; 11m did so in 1991. The total has since fallen back, to 9m. But the advocates of popular capitalism had grander designs than merely to increase the number of shareholders. They believed that wider share ownership would inspire a new enthusiasm for capitalism. People would follow the performance of the firms they owned shares in, relishing the thought that they had a stake in the economy. Oh yes, and these budding new capitalists would probably vote Conservative.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It has proved otherwise. A survey by <font size=-1>MORI</font> in 1992 found that of those who first bought shares during a privatisation, a mere 200,000 (just 2% of all shareholders at that time) went on to buy a share in a non-privatised firm. Many first-time investors quickly sold their privatisation shares (issued at rock-bottom prices to entice individuals to buy) for a nice profit.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Because buyers of privatised shares have not moved on to other shares, their holdings are typically small and narrow. Half of all individual shareholders own shares in only one firm; three-quarters own shares in three firms or less. Only 4% have invested in more than ten firms. And although the number of shareholders has soared, the percentage of British equities owned by individuals has continued to fall, from 66% in 1957 and 38% in 1975, to around 20% (see <a href="br1.gif">chart</a>). Share-ownership is wider, but more thinly spread.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a recent pamphlet, "All Capitalists Now," Proshare, a group which lobbies for wider share ownership, argues that the government could have done a better promotional job by giving away the shares of privatised firms to the entire adult population rather than selling them (the public, after all, already owned the companies). Alternatively, says Proshare, the government could have bundled the shares of several privatised firms together in diversified portfolios run by investment trusts, and then given shares in these trusts to the public. It is not too late for the government to heed such advice, should it choose to: shares in publicly-owned businesses including the Post Office, the <font size=-1>BBC</font>, Channel Four, Forest Enterprise, British Waterways, London Underground, as well as the motorway network, could yet be given away. As well as fostering wider share ownership, such a move could also make privatisation itself more popular.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition, the government could do more to encourage employee share-ownership, which has also grown rapidly thanks to privatisation. Employee share-option schemes still remain typically a perk for senior managers, rather than for all the firm's workforce. Employees who do receive shares or options usually sell their shares or exercise their options at the earliest opportunity, rather than retaining them as long-term investments.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the other hand, argues Proshare, promoting share ownership is not a task for government alone. Many building societies plan to become public companies. They should encourage (Proshare doesn't say how) the millions of savers and borrowers who will receive free shares to hold on to them rather than sell.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The flaw in all this--and the reason why the proportion of shares owned directly by individuals is likely to go on shrinking--is that for most people buying the shares of individual companies is an imprudent way to invest in the stockmarket. Far better to invest with a big institution such as a pension fund, insurer or mutual fund. These have in-house expertise and--more important--are able to reduce risk by holding shares in many different firms.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This fact is widely recognised by the public. Most savers prefer to hold the bulk of their exposure to the stockmarket (if any) in the form of a pension or endowment insurance policy. In the same way, sales of personal equity plans (<font size=-1>PEP</font>s), which allow tax-favoured investment in shares, have soared only since a new rule allowed savers to buy shares in investment companies with diversified portfolios.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What of the broader aim of popular capitalism--to make capitalism popular? This is often seen as no more than a Tory ruse to make cheap privatisation seem respectable (an unnecessary one, by the way, now that Labour loves capitalism). Certainly, financial institutions are sceptical: all the signs are that they regard communicating with their small investors as a waste of time.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This may be unwise. Future governments, Tory or Labour, reluctant to raise taxes on incomes, are increasingly likely to raise taxes on company profits, and to tap the assets held by financial institutions. Those assets are for many people the "stake" in the economy that Tony Blair, Labour's leader, says they so desperately need. If financial institutions can help individuals not merely to "own" this stake, but to understand and take an interest in its value, it would be far more difficult for politicians to do anything that hurts them.

<h1>Don't you just love being in control?</h1>
<p>
BRITAIN is in for another prolonged spat over utility regulation. On May 13th Clare Spottiswoode, the head of Ofgas, the industry regulator, hit British Gas with strict new rules on pricing. She proposed that the prices charged by TransCo, the gas-transportation arm of British Gas, should be cut by 20-28% next April. And she insisted that prices then be cut by 5% a year in real terms until 2002.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After Ms Spottiswoode's announcement, the firm's share price dropped by 12%. Analysts said that dividends might be halved. The company thundered that, under Ofgas's plan, TransCo might have to sack thousands of workers. It is all but certain that British Gas, once again, will ask the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (<font size=-1>MMC</font>) to arbitrate.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Among many points of disagreement, two stand out. First is the question of whether TransCo can be better run. Ofgas plainly thinks there is much room for improvement. The firm claims that the regulator has underestimated its future operating costs by about 25%. Ofgas says that the firm's figures are well-padded.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second issue is more arcane. In principle, TransCo's revenue should allow it to make a reasonable rate of return on its assets. But how much are its assets worth? This already fiddly bit of guesswork is complicated by the fact that British utilities were privatised cheaply: British Gas's shareholders paid only about 40% of the cost of replacing the company's pipelines, buildings and so forth. In calculating the return that shareholders should receive, regulators use a notional figure for assets which allows for this.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In its 1993 report, the <font size=-1>MMC</font> proposed a formula for that notional figure. Up to a point, Ofgas has followed its suggestion by proposing that, in effect, TransCo's pre-1991 assets be valued for regulatory purposes at 60% of their book value; later assets count in full. But it also wants a big change. The <font size=-1>MMC</font> said that the depreciation charge for the older assets should reflect their full book value, because this would reflect the cost of eventual replacement. Too generous, says Ms Spottiswoode. It is better to allow the company a lower depreciation charge now, reflecting what shareholders actually paid, and to present customers with the bill for replacing assets when they are needed--and their price will be better known.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ms Spottiswoode has certainly been harsh--but she has probably been fair, too. No one knows whether her cost estimates or the company's are nearer the mark. In the past, however, utilities have been remarkably good at meeting "impossible" targets. If Ms Spottiswoode's pricing formula proves after all to be a little too tight, it can be loosened in 2002. That is how Britain's regulatory regime is supposed to work.

<p><b>Drugs policy</b></p>
<h1>It didn't work</h1>

<p>ADMITTING an uncomfortable truth is often bad, or at least risky, politics--as the response to the Tories' adventurous new poster campaign suggests. But such admissions are a necessary condition of good policy. The government has therefore done the right thing by facing up to the hard facts of drugs. The second leg of its "Tackling drugs together" strategy to curb the illegal use of drugs was launched on May 14th. It recognises that drug-taking is a mass recreation among the young, and that the scare tactics of the past are not the best way to deal with it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A few days earlier, the Home Office had published the results of research carried out as part of the British Crime Survey (<font size=-1>BCS</font>). Including questions about drugs in this survey is a fairly new idea. The findings are remarkable. Drug-taking among teenagers is so common that half of 16-19-year-old boys say they have taken drugs. That is a higher proportion than say they have played football in the previous three months. The figure for girls is slightly lower. A quarter of boys of that age, and a fifth of the age group altogether, have taken drugs within the past month, which implies that they are regular users (see <a href="br2.gif">chart</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such comprehensive surveying of drug use is recent, so it is difficult to discern a trend. However, in 1982 the <font size=-1>BCS</font> asked about the use of cannabis, and found that only a sixth of men and a tenth of women in their 20s had tried it. The equivalent figures now are two-fifths and a quarter.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of course, there is a danger that some youngsters are telling lies. The <font size=-1>BCS</font> has tried to guard against braggards by including in the questionnaire "Semeron", a non-existent drug. Only one person out of 9,646 respondents claimed to have taken it. The danger of under-reporting remains.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such widespread use is the cause, as well as the consequence, of the failure of the government's "Heroin Screws You Up" campaign of the 1980s. Too many young people know that moderate drug-taking does no perceptible harm.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The government admits that the campaign was a failure and has taken a different tack. The booklet for parents published this week is remarkably honest and sensible. It includes good advice, such as setting an example by not drinking too much; it undermines the old chestnut that smoking marijuana inevitably leads on to harder drugs; it advises against bullying or lecturing. Instead it explicitly rejects the old approach. "Don't try to scare your children with shock horror stories. It doesn't work--and to somebody who uses drugs and has experienced their effects, it will be unbelievable," says the booklet.

<p><b>Health</b></p>
<h1>The threat of salt</h1>


<p>FOR decades the tobacco industry sought to deny the link between smoking and lung cancer. The billions it spent in research to disprove this and the money it lavished on lobbying campaigns denying it were wasted. The money would have been better spent in seeking to reduce the dangers of the product. Processed-food manufacturers may now be in danger of travelling down a similar cul-de-sac in the face of growing evidence of the dangers to health of an excessively salty diet.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;New research published in the British Medical Journal (<font size=-1>BMJ</font>) on May 17th confirms that high levels of salt in western diets are a prime cause of strokes and heart disease among older people. "Intersalt", a study of 10,000 people in 52 countries, confirms the direct link between salt and high blood pressure. At present, salt consumption among adults in Britain averages 9 grammes a day, ten times the basic sodium requirement. The study points out that, because three-quarters of salt in western diets comes from processed food, a significant reduction in salt consumption is possible only if the food industry takes some salt out of its products.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A similar message was voiced just over a year ago by the Committee on the Medical Aspects of Food Policy, an official body advising the government on nutrition. However, after heavy lobbying from the processed-food industry, Kenneth Calman, the chief medical officer, disassociated the government from the committee's recommendation that salt consumption by adults should be cut by a third.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In an editorial, the <font size=-1>BMJ</font> criticises this as a failure of nerve and says that, if ministers are serious about reducing premature deaths from heart disease, they will have to learn to ignore vested interests. In an accompanying article, Graham MacGregor, professor of cardio-vascular medicine at St George's Hospital, accuses the government of having abdicated responsibility for the welfare of its citizens.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Action to reduce salt need not wait on government action. In the 1980s large baking companies were persuaded to cut salt in breads by 12.5%. Heinz and Brooke Bond have also made small reductions in their canned goods. But most processed-food manufacturers are unwilling to act. All 16 food-industry trade associations recently refused to conduct an audit of the salt content of their products requested by a nutrition task force set up by the government in 1994. Even without the imprimatur of government committees, an alliance of scientists and consumers could find such information for themselves, and force food firms to rethink their opposition to using less salt in their products.

<p><b>Devolution</b></p>
<h1>In a tangle</h1>

<font size=1>EDINBURGH</font>

<p>TAXATION will undoubtedly be a difficult issue for Labour at the next election, but devolution may yet prove even trickier. Labour's plans to devolve power to a parliament in Edinburgh, an assembly in Cardiff and regional bodies in England have been long in the making, but the Tories are now making short work of unpicking them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;John Major told the Scottish Tories at their conference in Aberdeen on May 11th that Labour's plans for devolution would celebrate the millennium by breaking up Britain. This is a tiresomely familiar line of attack. Every big constitutional change ever proposed has been heralded as the end of British civilisation. Somehow, British civilisation has survived. (The Tories themselves often praise the "flexibility" of Britain's unwritten constitution--meaning, presumably, the ease with which it can be changed.) Lately, however, there has been more to the government's position than scare-mongering. Ministers have begun probing Labour's plans, much to Tony Blair's discomfiture.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As a result, Labour's leader has been treading cautiously with plans for regional government in England. Last year Jack Straw, the party's home affairs spokesman, published a consultation paper which set out a step-by-step approach. First, indirectly elected assemblies would be set up, manned by councillors from the region's local authorities. Directly elected regional government would follow only after a regional referendum.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This plan will be discussed on May 18th and 19th in Manchester by Labour's national policy forum, where ordinary members thrash out problems privately before policies are publicly adopted at the party's annual conference. In fact, most of the problems so far unearthed by Mr Straw are internal Labour difficulties.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Local authorities in north-east England think that they are ready to set up an elected regional government immediately, and that there is no need for a referendum. Across the Pennines, Graham Stringer, the leader of Labour-controlled Manchester City Council, thinks that a north-west regional government (covering Greater Manchester, Merseyside, Lancashire and Cheshire) would not work. Liverpool and Manchester, he reckons, would continually fight with each other, and both cities would be at odds with the rural counties of Cheshire and Lancashire. If power is to be devolved from Whitehall, it would be better handed over to a Manchester city-state, he says (led by him, presumably).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Because of such widely varying opinions, Mr Straw is sticking to his cautious strategy. This may not please council leaders in north-east England, but Mr Straw is more worried about giving the Tories an opportunity to frighten voters by claiming that devolution will be imposed on them whether they like it or not.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, this still causes trouble for Labour in Scotland. The Scottish Tories have spent their time in government spurning all calls for a Scottish constitutional referendum. Yet in Aberdeen they unashamedly used Labour's proposals for English regional referendums to demand that Labour, if it wins the election, should hold a referendum on Scottish devolution.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This demand may come from an impeachable source, but it seems nonetheless quite sound. Significant changes in the system of government, as opposed to the business of government, ought to be tested against the popular will, rather than being decided upon by <font size=-1>MP</font>s alone. Labour should promise a Scottish referendum--and a Welsh one too.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Blair worries, however, that a referendum would be seen by impatient voters in Scotland and Wales as a delaying tactic, and that it would split the party (especially in Wales, where substantial divisions over devolution remain). His speech to the Welsh Labour conference on May 10th was interpreted (widely but wrongly) as reflecting a wish to introduce proportional representation for elections to a Welsh Assembly. That caused a rumpus among Welsh Labour <font size=-1>MP</font>s, most of whom see nothing wrong with first-past-the-post elections.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One way to deal with these problems might be to promise a ratifying referendum after devolution had taken place, perhaps on the same day as a general election. This would also reduce the risk that a referendum might reject devolution if Labour became unpopular in mid-term for other reasons altogether. The Tories would rightly object to this as presenting voters with a <i>fait accompli</i>. Nevertheless, some voters' worries might be assuaged.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whatever it decides to do, Labour needs to be quick-witted on this matter. The emergence of the Scottish Tories as champions of the people, outlandish as it may seem, is not doomed to fail. According to one recent poll, the Tories' assault on Labour's plans to let a Scottish parliament vary income tax by up to 3p in the pound--the government calls it the "tartan tax"--may be causing some Labour voters to have second thoughts about devolution.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For this reason, Mr Blair has no intention of giving regional government anywhere else in Britain the power to tax. Yet some power to raise revenue is necessary if regional government is not to run into the same problems that local government now complains of: no financial freedom to allocate money to policies chosen by a region's voters at election time. The dilemma seems insoluble, but may not be. One possibility would be to take the "tartan tax" off the agenda and announce instead a review of Britain's system of local taxation. After the ill-fated poll tax and much other political tinkering, the system is creaking at the joints and needs an overhaul.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Devolution could and should be a good idea for Britain. But Labour needs to answer the many legitimate questions being asked by the Tories. Otherwise, the party could find the policy turning into an electoral liability next year, and an albatross around its neck if it wins power.

<p><b>Forensic laboratories</b></p>
<h1>Explosive</h1>

<p>THE last thing the government needed as it attempts to get the Anglo-Irish peace process back on course was another set of miscarriage-of-justice cases, like those of the Birmingham Six and Judith Ward, which cast doubt on the reliability of forensic evidence and on British justice in general. But that is exactly what it now faces. On May 14th Michael Howard, the home secretary, said that equipment at a government forensic-science laboratory had been found to be contaminated with a component of Semtex explosive.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The contaminated machine is in a laboratory run by an offshoot of the defence ministry at Fort Halstead in Kent. This is the only place in mainland Britain where prosecutors send swabs from the bodies and clothing of suspected bombers to be tested for traces of explosives. Convictions in about 12 <font size=-1>IRA</font> bombing cases, going back as far as 1989, may be in doubt.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Human error was to blame for the failure to detect the contamination, and human error can never be ruled out. Yet this fiasco might have been less serious if ministers had acted on recommendations made in 1993 by the Royal Commission on Criminal Justice.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The commission noted improvements in controls at forensic-science laboratories since the uncovering of earlier mistakes, but said, "we nevertheless feel bound to question the absence of external scrutiny and assessment" of the laboratories. It also said that scientists working in them tended "to see themselves as part of the prosecution", and not as impartial seekers of truth. The commission said an advisory council should be set up to inspect the laboratories' quality controls and to impose a strict code of conduct on the scientists. Three years on, the government has yet to act.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even if an advisory council had been set up, the contaminated equipment might not have been spotted any sooner. But such a body could have recommended other changes, and these too might have lessened the blow to confidence in the justice system which this affair has brought about. For instance, the commission said that scientists hired by the defence should be able to witness any tests carried out after the arrest of the suspect, and be able to examine the notebooks and other records of those who carried them out. It said that defence lawyers should be able to have samples re-tested at a different laboratory, and that legal aid should be available to pay for this.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Russell Stockdale of Forensic Access, a forensic-science consultancy which mainly advises defence lawyers, says the Fort Halstead laboratory still restricts the access of scientists such as himself to check the results of its tests. Michael Mansfield, a prominent defence barrister, says that when he has asked the Legal Aid Board to pay for further tests, it objected because it saw no reason to doubt the findings of Fort Halstead. Because of the government's unwillingness to accept even the relatively modest proposals of the royal commission on these matters, defence lawyers have been prevented from questioning the findings of a secretive laboratory whose reliability is now in doubt.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Mansfield claims that the government has failed to take action because it does not see any votes in providing an independent, reliable forensic-science service, open equally to defence and prosecution lawyers alike. Whether or not this is so, there are certainly votes to be lost if, as is now possible, more convictions in high-profile terrorism cases are overturned, and the government can be accused of contributing to this by its complacency.

<p><b>Soothing words</b> &nbsp;
In a gesture to Sinn Fein, John Major said in an article in the <i>Irish Times</i> that the decommissioning of terrorist weapons should be addressed in all-party talks on Northern Ireland's future "without blocking the negotiation".</p>
<p><b>Gun law</b> &nbsp;
Labour called for a complete ban on handguns following the massacre at Dunblane. This would remove up to 200,000 firearms from circulation. The government said it would wait for the findings of Lord Cullen's inquiry into the massacre before announcing any new measures.</p>
<p><b>Safe schools</b> &nbsp;
The government promised to pay for improved security measures in schools, including the installation of closed-circuit television cameras, responding to the recommendations of an inquiry into the fatal stabbing of a London headmaster last year.</p>
<p><b>Big money</b> &nbsp;
Labour dropped its plans to curb the size of jackpots on the National Lottery. Jack Cunningham, the shadow national-heritage secretary, said he now accepted that the huge prizes encouraged people to buy tickets.</p>

<p><b>Softbank</b></p>
<h1>After the party</h1>

<font size=1>TOKYO</font><p><b>Is the success of this acquisitive Japanese firm based on software engineering or financial engineering?</b></p>


<p>JAPANESE investors might be forgiven for getting a little overexcited about Softbank. Its domestic businesses include Japan's biggest computer-software distributor and its leading publisher of <font size=-1>PC</font> magazines. It is the only company on the Tokyo stockmarket to have an Internet interest; and on May 15th it announced a joint venture with Dentsu, a giant ad agency, to develop Internet advertising. Masayoshi Son, its Berkeley-educated founder and president has an outgoing manner which is the antithesis of the dull Japanese <i>sarariman</i>. But is it really worth &#165;1 trillion ($9.5 billion)--160 times last year's earnings?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is no denying Softbank's momentum. Its net profits in the year to March 1996 rose by 210%, to &#165;6.3 billion, an even headier rise than in previous years (see <a href="wb1.gif">chart</a>). By contrast, Nintendo, a games maker that is also worth &#165;1 trillion, made net profits of &#165;56 billion. But then Nintendo is not headed by the "Bill Gates of Japan".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Son's corporate strategy is beguilingly simple: to control as much of the infrastructure of the <font size=-1>PC</font> market--from distribution to publications, information services and associated conferences--as he can. Initially, this vision seemed limited to Japan. Founded in 1981, Softbank concentrated on two domestic markets: publishing and computer-software distribution. Softbank now has 30% of the <font size=-1>PC</font>-magazine market in Japan and about 40% of Japan's software-distribution market.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, ever since its listing on Japan's over-the-counter stockmarket in 1994, the firm has been obsessed with foreign investments. In the past year alone it has spent $3 billion buying American high-tech companies. This year, says the Nomura Research Institute, &#165;18 billion of Softbank's estimated &#165;25 billion in pre-tax profits will come from overseas.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This portfolio includes investments in several American Internet-related companies. Its chief financial officer, Yoshitaka Kitao, is not sure how many, but it is talking to 57 Internet-related companies and is in "serious discussions" with 15 of these. Last month Softbank increased its stake in Yahoo!, which provides a directory for the Internet, from 5% to 37%. Last October, it bought a 12% stake in Nihon Cisco Systems, the Japanese subsidiary of the American firm that leads the booming market in networking equipment. It also has a 30% stake in Unitech, a Californian software supplier that is developing software to offer Internet services in China. And it owns a quarter of the Japanese subsidiary of Novell, the leader in networking software.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, these Internet-related firms are relative minnows compared with Softbank's biggest purchases: Comdex, a giant computer exhibition bought in April last year for $800m, and Ziff-Davis, a publisher of <font size=-1>PC</font> magazines, bought for $2.1 billion in February. Both prices were considered to be generous, yet Softbank's share price has bounded ahead with each purchase.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Softbank pays for its acquisitions with cash. Some of this has come from issuing &#165;69 billion of new shares last November, but a lot has been financed by debt: this has increased from &#165;51 billion to &#165;240 billion over the past year (although &#165;70 billion of this was in convertible bonds). Softbank's interest expenses jumped from &#165;377m in 1994-95 to &#165;3.4 billion in 1995-96. This year analysts expect interest charges of &#165;9 billion.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How does Mr Son manage to do it? His success has a lot to do with the difference between American and Japanese stockmarket valuations. Even in its current slightly battered state, the market in Japan trades at more than twice the average American price-to-earnings ratio; Softbank trades at an even heftier premium. This allows Mr Son to buy an American firm at a generous premium over its American valuation, and still see his own firm's valuation climb by even more, simply because the American profits are now valued by Japanese standards. That, in turn, allows him to raise more cash from his bankers and the capital markets.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another feature of Softbank's acquisition strategy is its aggressive accounting techniques. Each time Mr Son buys a company, almost all the value is in "goodwill" (the difference between the purchase price and the firm's net assets). Softbank depreciates this goodwill over 30 years, some six times the usual depreciation period for Japanese firms. This helps the company's earnings, because the acquisition costs are spread out over three decades, while the profits show up immediately. On the other hand, many of Softbank's American purchases are fickle, people businesses, where the "goodwill" could leave tomorrow.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the West similar acquisition machines have struggled to find the ever-bigger targets needed to sustain their high share prices. One recent example is Britain's Hanson, a conglomerate which is now breaking itself up. However, Hanson was also famous for two other things: buying cheaply and managing its assets extremely well.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If Mr Son has a grand strategy for extracting more value out of his ragbag of assets, it is hard to spot. The only "synergy" seems to be that they have something to do with computers. Indeed, Mr Son makes a point of not changing the management of Softbank's newly acquired overseas companies. The main use of its biggest acquisitions is to send cash home. Last year most of Comdex's net profits were paid to Softbank as dividends; without them, Softbank's pre-tax operating profits last year would have almost halved.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is little room for expansion in Softbank's existing businesses. Although Softbank is bringing Comdex to Japan and other parts of Asia, Comdex cannot get much larger in America: more than 200,000 people already attend its exhibitions in Las Vegas. As for Ziff-Davis, the market for computer magazines is already competitive and growing more so.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Expansion by acquiring overseas companies is usually considered risky, particularly for Japanese companies, which have a dismal record. The last companies to put their faith in creative Americans were Sony and Matsushita, which both bought studios in Hollywood. Softbank claims that it is better at picking winners and that it is buying into a growth industry. Perhaps. But Nintendo looks a safer bet.

<p><b>Wireless telephony</b></p>
<h1>Built on thin air</h1>
<p>ON MAY 14th Britain's first radio telephone--or "fixed wireless"--service was launched by Ionica, a small company in Cambridge. Around the world, telephone companies are transfixed. For if Ionica is a success, its technology could rip up the big telephone monopolies: fixed wireless is by far the cheapest way to build a competing network from scratch.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But is that single advantage enough to build a profitable business in a mature market like Britain? For Britons, fixed wireless offers no special technical advantage. Indeed, apart from a pizza-box-sized aerial on the roof, they should notice no difference at all compared with their normal wired service. Unlike its technological cousin, the mobile telephone, wireless goes nowhere. It offers a familiar handset attached to a cord. It is just a cheap way to connect a home to a telephone network.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is this economic advantage that gives Ionica, with a modest &#163;150m ($230m) in the bank, the courage to challenge Britain's mighty <font size=-1>BT</font>. The cable-television companies have to spend some &#163;600 for each home they pass, regardless of whether the householder wants the television or telephone services they offer. But Ionica claims that its fixed costs are only &#163;5-10 for each potential customer: the price of a base station divided by all the homes it could reach. The added cost of installing an aerial and electronics in a customer's home are incurred only when a customer is willing to pay.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ionica claims that, because its costs are lower, it can undercut <font size=-1>BT</font> and still make money. Its prices will be 15% below <font size=-1>BT</font>'s for most calls, although because of the initial costs of switching, most subscribers will not see much difference for the first year. It also has a new, all-digital network, so that it can offer a few fancy services (such as three numbers, each with distinctive rings, for each line) that <font size=-1>BT</font> cannot match. And, because it has a direct link to the home, it can provide national and international services more cheaply than other firms that must piggyback on <font size=-1>BT</font>'s lines, for a fee, for the final few miles.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Ionica faces considerable disadvantages. It is fiendishly hard for any company to compete with a former monopoly in the "local loop" --the connections from individual homes to the main telephone networks. Local calls and line-rental rates are subsidised in Britain, as in most other countries, by long-distance calls. And <font size=-1>BT</font>, toughened by years of competition, is a leaner target than most of Europe's monopolies. Its rates are already among the world's lowest--and falling.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Cable companies, facing the same squeeze, have nevertheless been able to lure nearly 1.5m telephone subscribers away from <font size=-1>BT</font>. But they have two advantages over Ionica: television (only 20% of subscribers take the telephone service alone), and the promise of future multimedia services, such as high-speed Internet access. Ionica claims its network can be upgraded to offer multimedia, but that will increase its cost dramatically. Besides, it will never be able to carry as much data as the fibre-optic cable networks. And even the cable companies now complain that they will not be able to make money in a market where regulators keep tightening price controls.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ionica is aiming for 5% of the British market--about 1.4m homes--by the end of the decade, although it says it can break even with half as many. Its target is ambitious: it took the cable companies four years to reach that number.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ionica's is not the only trial of this sort: Telecom Finland launched a similar service in March. But Herschel Shosteck Associates, a telecoms consultancy in Wheaton, Maryland, notes that the economics of fixed wireless are much better in Finland, thanks to a chilling $900 connection fee for ordinary telephone lines.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the developed world, fixed wireless may always be a niche market. On the other hand, it is the ideal technology for the developing world, where there are few existing lines to compete with and little money to lay new ones. In poor countries the potential market for mobile and fixed wireless, says Herschel Shosteck, could reach more than 300m subscribers by the end of 2000. Whether Ionica succeeds or not in Britain is almost beside the point; the real game is elsewhere.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?832374000,iss">Search</a>

<h1>The road from imitation to innovation</h1>
<p><b>Developing economies have long been imitators of western technology. Should rich economies worry as they turn into innovators?</b></p>

<p>BEING a copycat can sometimes get you into trouble, as China discovered this week when America threatened to impose sanctions on it for allegedly violating some American firms' intellectual-property rights. However, although producing cut-price copies of, say, software programs is illegal, imitating western know-how in other respects is a legitimate way for emerging markets to catch up rich ones. East Asia's breathtaking growth over the past couple of decades partly reflects this process.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At present, innovation is heavily concentrated in rich economies: they account for 96% of total world <font size=-1>R&D</font> spending. This reflects the fact that developed nations can afford to spend more on innovation, which, in turn, boosts future income and thus finances more research. Moreover, they also have better educated workforces. Poorer countries with a plentiful supply of less-skilled labour will tend to focus on basic manufacturing, copying western techniques. So, runs the theory, they will tend to specialise in low-tech industries; high-tech ones will remain the preserve of the rich world.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But things are changing: some Asian economies are fast becoming innovators. South Korea and Taiwan already spend as much on <font size=-1>R&D</font> as a proportion of their <font size=-1>GDP</font>s as many European economies (see <a href="fn1.gif">chart</a>)--and their spending has grown more rapidly in recent years than that of any rich economy. The results are beginning to show: Taiwan now registers more patents in America each year (per head of its population) than Britain does.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This worries some people in rich countries. They fear that jobs and living standards at home will be threatened as Asian dragons shift to more sophisticated products and production methods. But a recent paper* by a team of economists at the London Business School concludes that such fears are misplaced.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The study points out that the creation of knowledge--whether in developed or developing countries--spreads its benefits across borders. As a result, increased innovation in Asia should raise living standards in rich countries, too, by expanding both the range of goods that consumers can buy and the inputs that firms can use. Similarly, as innovation helps to lift Asian incomes, the market for rich-world exports will expand. All this will boost global growth. Poorer countries, such as China, will follow the catch-up path for some time, but as their incomes and technology approach western levels, the scope for imitation will shrink. To sustain growth they will also have to generate new products and processes.
</p><p><b>The smother of invention</b></b>
<br>Indeed, the <font size=-1>LBS</font> team argues that what the rich world should be worried about is not too much innovation in developing countries, but too little. The root of the problem is that <font size=-1>R&D</font> spending yields a public as well as a private return. Firms will invest in <font size=-1>R&D</font> if their expected future profits exceed their initial costs. Such research also yields general knowledge that is not product-specific, but which may be of use to other firms and countries. The snag is that this "externality" is not captured in firms' financial sums. As a result, the level of innovation in an economy may be less than it should be.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since the <font size=-1>R&D</font> externality is partly international, there is a case, on the face of it, for governments to join together and subsidise each other's innovation. To examine this question, the <font size=-1>LBS</font> team used a mathematical model in which two main factors determine the levels of imitation and innovation in low-income economies, and hence the pattern of trade between rich and poor countries. The first is the speed at which poor nations absorb ideas and techniques from rich countries. The more slowly a country assimilates knowledge because of, say, poor education, the harder it will be for it to be an imitator. And the second is the relative cost of imitating as opposed to innovating (as a rule, the lower wages are relative to those in rich economies, the greater will be the incentive simply to copy).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>LBS</font>'s economists tested the effects of various types of <font size=-1>R&D</font> subsidies on the model. If a subsidy is given to firms in developed countries, this will boost innovation and growth there, but as incomes rise (and hence the wage gap between rich and poor countries widens), this will also make imitation more attractive than innovation in poor countries. As a result, global innovation may be left unchanged, or it may fall. Likewise, if an <font size=-1>R&D</font> subsidy in a poor country is used to finance imitation, this will prove counterproductive: not only will it make innovation in poor countries less attractive, it will also discourage innovators in rich countries by eroding the returns from the <font size=-1>R&D</font> they pursue.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The authors conclude that the best subsidy for <font size=-1>R&D</font> from a global perspective is, in fact, one granted for innovation in a developing country. Thanks to its positive spillover effects, more innovation in these nations will also boost growth in developed economies, too.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This leads the <font size=-1>LBS</font> economists to conclude that, since financial support for innovation in poor economies benefits rich countries as well, it may be in the west's interests to help pay for it. And, who knows, if developing countries are encouraged to become explorers, they may be less inclined to be pirates.

<p><b>Internet censorship</b></p>
<h1>The top shelf</h1>

<p>ON THE Internet the talk used to be all about the moral issues behind censorship. Nowadays, the debate has turned to the technical means of doing it. It is not that censorship is any less controversial on-line, just that it now seems inevitable. In France, the authorities recently arrested two Internet managers for not stopping child pornography from flowing through their systems. In countries such as China and Singapore, there is little debate on censorship at all: these governments will try to censor the Internet--the question is how.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most of the blocking methods so far have fallen into three categories: software that consults a list of known sites and blocks them according to criteria chosen by the <font size=-1>PC</font> owner; software that looks for suspect words to decide when to block sites; and the fencing off of portions of the Internet by firms that provide Internet access.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;None of the three can stop a curious ten-year old for long. The Internet is too big and changing too quickly for any list-maker to keep up. Screening out www.playboy.com is easy; tracking down an obscure Swedish site with even more skin on display is harder. These days many users start their Web-surfing at one of the many search services that index most of the Internet. The top five queries at one of these, Infoseek, are the names of such busty starlets as Pamela Anderson, each of which may turn up hundreds of Web sites devoted to their charms. Every day the list changes: a censor would be hard pressed to keep abreast.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Word-screening software is weaker still, largely because computers have a notoriously hard time extracting meaning from the written word. Simply looking for keywords is bound to fail: America Online faced a near riot when its word-screening software accidentally shut down a forum for discussing breast cancer (because it mentioned breasts), and a software package from another company blocked the official White House Web site because it mentioned the presidential "couple".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Weakest of all are the attempts to block whole sections of the Internet. Last year, CompuServe, an on-line service, banned more than 200 "newsgroups"--open discussion areas on many disparate topics--in response to a threat from Bavarian prosecutors. This was fairly simple. Unlike most Internet content, newsgroups are broadcast to each service provider's computers, where they can easily be screened. However, CompuServe's ban had only a limited effect: knowledgable users soon found other sources for the same material.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The largest part of the Internet, the Web, is even harder to block sensibly. The Web operates on a very different model: content stays in one place and viewers come to see it. Internet providers--normally spurred on by governments--can just cut off a site. But when German prosecutors tried to shut down a neo-Nazi Web site in America, copies of the material appeared Hydra-like elsewhere, as free-speech defenders copied it on to their own Web sites.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is another system that might work better: self-rating. At a meeting in Paris earlier this month, a consortium of Internet and computer firms released the specifications for such a scheme. The Platform for Internet Content Selection (<font size=-1>PICS</font>) allows Internet content providers, from <i>The Economist</i> to <i>Bianca's Smut Shack</i>, to label their offerings, much like a film rating. Software, running either on a user's own <font size=-1>PC</font> or on the computers of the Internet provider (where it is harder to bypass), would screen according to criteria set by a parent, an employer, or even a government.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The ratings could cover anything, from sex to political leanings. Although many sites might be responsible in their self-assessments, judgements of this sort are inherently subjective. A swimming-costume catalogue that would pass muster with America's Boy Scouts might blow fuses in Oman. Likewise, one man's dry economic theory page is another's cesspool of counter-revolutionary thought.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So the <font size=-1>PICS</font> standard allows third parties to rate sites, too. Thus the Simon Wiesenthal centre might want to run a "ratings server" that ranked sites on the basis of anti-Semitic content. Parents who wanted to keep their kids away from Holocaust revisionism could configure their software to check that server before access was granted to any site. Government censorship with this system would probably be as leaky as earlier attempts: Chinese Internet users could find ways around a server on which their government might try to screen dissident sites. But the system would make it easier for parents to protect their children.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although it might seem curious that Internet advocates would want to create a tool that some governments are sure to use to suppress information, the alternative, as they see it, is worse: the prosecution of those who put content on the Internet or let it pass through their machines. The advantage of the <font size=-1>PICS</font> system is that it does not limit what people write on the Internet, only what they read. Free speech is protected, at the cost of a sort of self-censorship.

<h1><center>Tobacco on trial</center></h1>

THE urge to blame someone else for a sorrow you have brought upon yourself is human, but it is irresponsible. It should not be indulged. When their choices do not harm other people, adults must choose for themselves; and, enjoying this choice, they must face its consequences.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In America, however, accepting the consequences of your own actions when you can both blame and be richly "compensated" by somebody else goes against the litigious grain. And when these others are tobacco barons, known better for their vast wealth than for their dedication to the public health, it is not surprising that many people are glad to see the cigarette industry squirming in the courts. With millions of litigants queuing up for compensation, and a pair of principled non-inhalers in the White House, the tobacco firms look unusually vulnerable (see <a href="sf1.html">page</a>). Even so, it is hard to see much merit in these lawsuits. It can surely not have escaped the attention of many of the plaintiffs that smoking is unhealthy. Their latest wheeze is to concentrate on the addictive nature of nicotine ("as addicts, we could not choose freely"). But again, the notion that giving up is hard to do has hardly been a state secret.
</p><p><b>The liberal conundrum</b>
<br>It is relatively easy, then, to dismiss the claims of smokers who knowingly harm themselves. The duty of governments is harder to disentangle. In most rich countries they have gone to great lengths to inform citizens about the dangers of smoking. Having informed, should they also discourage?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One argument that suggests they should is that smoking does harm not only to the smoker but to the rest of society too, by imposing on it the cost of looking after smokers who are dying. This argument is surely stronger than the claim that non-smokers are damaged directly by breathing in the leakage from smokers' puffs. But it is not as strong as it seems. A surfeit of cream buns is also bad for your health. Should cream buns then be punitively taxed, stamped with a health warning or banned from consumption in public places? Besides, smokers save society money too, by dying young.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If you take away the alleged social cost of smoking, the case for governments actively to discourage smoking begins to look a good deal weaker. And yet, in practice if not in principle, most rich countries have already gone far beyond the business of telling smokers the dispiriting facts about what carcinogenic tars do to the insides of lungs. They are deep into the discouragement business as well. The advertising of cigarettes is severely restricted. Selling cigarettes to minors is illegal. Cigarettes are taxed especially heavily. And the supposedly neutral "information" that is provided to smokers has begun to feel a lot more like propaganda: cigarette packets say in large letters that "Smoking kills" where once they merely said "Smoking may be harmful to your health".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In many places, this policy of official discouragement has fostered or strengthened an ugly climate of intolerance. As health warnings become increasingly strident, the smoker starts to feel that he is being admonished rather than informed. This is finger wagging of the sort enjoyed by the busybodies who have lately shooed smokers out of the public parks of Bellaire in Texas. It may well be beside the point too. What a recent book called the "sublime" beauty of smoking is tied to the pastime's nastiness and danger. A brand that called itself "Death" embraced this danger and still sold. Against this background, there comes a point when public education turns into hectoring, and encourages in non-smokers a disturbing lack of respect for the other fellow's private choices.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the rich world, where this point has long been reached, the discouragement of smoking has gone too far. But should it be rolled back all the way to the point where the government merely informs and does not discourage at all? That would be the libertarian preference: leave people to make, and accept the consequences of, their own informed choices, even if these are self-destructive. But this would imply a radical change. By rights, cigarettes would then be advertised much more widely than they are now, and taxed less highly. More people would smoke, and die as a result of it. Though consistent, the policy would feel wrong to many people.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And it would feel wrong for some good reasons. The strongest has to do with children. Informed choice is all very well, but weighing the present rewards of smoking against the possibility of illness far in the future is hard, and children, for whom age and decay are especially distant, are especially bad at it. They are, however, poorer than adults, and more impressionable. This justifies abnormally high taxes on tobacco, together with some restrictions on advertising. Satisfying as it might be from a libertarian perspective to draw the line at information, there is a case, where tobacco is concerned, for some mild official discouragement as well.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And other substances? There are zealots who say that tobacco should be outlawed, on the grounds that other dangerous, and arguably much less dangerous, drugs such as cocaine or heroin are outlawed. The zealots have a point in urging consistency. Yet to most people the criminalisation of smoking sounds ludicrous, not just because it would be so obviously illiberal to outlaw an activity that generally damages nobody but the actor, but also because, as the prohibition of alcohol clearly showed, such measures do not work.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The bold answer here is not to outlaw tobacco but to apply to all drugs the policy of legalise-and-discourage that applies to cigarettes, with the degree of discouragement matched to the substance concerned. This would not only have the virtue of consistency. It would also be to acknowledge that, in the case of many drugs such as marijuana, cocaine and heroin the policy of prohibition has already collapsed almost as comprehensively as it did in the case of alcohol, and a lot more violently. Tobacco may be a scourge. It is also, oddly, a worked example of a better way for liberal societies to live with drugs.

<center><table width=65%><tr valign=top><td valign=top width=30%>


<h2>Spain slims</h2>
<p>Jose Maria Aznar became <b>Spain's first conservative prime minister</b> since the Franco era. He promised to cut unemployment and prepare Spain for European economic and monetary union in 1999. His new government plans to cut Pta250 billion ($2 billion) from spending this year.
<p>The European Commission inched towards lifting the world-wide ban on the export of <b>British beef</b>, imposed because of "mad-cow" disease. It said it would recommend allowing the export of gelatin, tallow and semen derived from British cattle. But Germany and other governments may not agree.</p>
<p>Russia said it would expel nine British diplomats on charges of <b>spying</b>. Britain countered that the charges were unproved and hinted that it might deport some Russians. The two countries may yet reach a negotiated solution. Russia's threat was seen by some as an attempt by President Yeltsin to improve his re-election prospects; a new poll shows him far behind his Communist rival, Gennady Zyuganov.</p>
<p>Proceedings against <b>alleged war criminals</b> from former Yugoslavia opened in The Hague with the trial of Dusan Tadic, a Bosnian Serb caf&eacute; owner. It is the first international war-crimes trial since the end of the second world war.</p>
<p>European diplomats rebuked Hans van den Broek, external affairs commissioner of the European Union, for suggesting that the <font size=-1>EU</font> could take over <b>peacekeeping in Bosnia</b> when the current peacekeeping mission ends in December. America, they fear, would be happy to leave the job solely to the Europeans.</p>
<p>The citizens of the eastern German state of Brandenburg rejected a <b>merger with Berlin</b> in a referendum.</p>
<p>Umberto Bossi, leader of the Northern League, called for a formal <b>secession of northern Italy</b> from the rest of the country. He wants to call the new country Padania.</p>
<p>Slovakia's president, Michal Kovac, postponed passage of a controversial <b>subversion law</b>. It would have allowed prison sentences for activities like organising anti-government rallies and spreading "false information" abroad.</p>
<h2>Into opposition</h2>
<p><b>South Africa</b>'s white-led National Party pulled out of the government of national unity the day after agreement was reached on a new constitution for the country, ending the transitional agreement of the past two years. F.W. de Klerk, the party leader, said the birth of a new nation now demands a strong multi-party system. The markets shook. Meanwhile, local voting in troubled KwaZulu-Natal was postponed.</p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>New rules were agreed by 57 countries at a United Nations meeting in Geneva to restrict the sale and use of anti-personnel <b>landmines</b>. Non-detectable mines are to be banned, though not for at least nine years, and the rules on mine use will apply to internal conflicts, not just inter-state ones. Disgusted anti-mine campaigners have vowed to fight on for a complete ban.</p>
<p>The evidence suggests, said a <font size=-1>UN</font> report presented to the Security Council, that Israel's shelling of the <font size=-1>UN</font> compound at <b>Qana</b>, which killed 100 Lebanese civilians, was probably not accidental. Israel, supported by America, angrily rejected the report.</p>
<p>Demonstrations by the <b>Bahraini</b> <b>opposition </b>grew more violent after a protester was killed by security men.</p>
<h2>Fiscal spanner</h2>
<p>Democrats in Congress blocked Republican attempts to repeal the <b>petrol tax</b> of 4.3 cents a gallon, insisting it should be coupled with a rise in the minimum wage from $4.25 to $5.15 an hour. Both measures are politically popular but threaten to wreak havoc on attempts to reduce the federal budget deficit.</p>
<p>President Clinton widened his lead over the Republican presidential nominee, <b>Bob Dole</b>, to 25 percentage points in the latest Harris poll. The poll also predicted that Ross Perot, if he ran, would take 16% of the vote.</p>
<p><b>Colombia</b>'s army and air force struck at its ever-bolder and bloodier guerrillas.</p>
<p>Pressure mounted against <b>Argentina</b>'s defence minister, over revelations that</p>
<p>Argentine weapons were sold to Croatia (while under <font size=-1>UN</font> embargo) and to Ecuador during last year's fighting with Peru (a quarrel in which, by treaty, Argentina has to remain neutral).</p>
<h2>Indian limbo</h2>
<p>A weak coalition seemed the likeliest outcome of the <b>Indian general election</b>, based on early results. The Congress party of Narasimha Rao seemed likely to lose half its seats, with the Hindu-nationalist <font size=-1>BJP</font> becoming the single largest party in Parliament. But no single party was in a position to form a government on its own.</p>
<p>A new confrontation between China and America loomed, this time over <b>intellectual property</b>. The White House threatened to impose trade sanctions unless China improved its compliance with previous agreements by May 15th. China made a show of closing several pirate compact-disc factories.</p>
<p>Fires have devastated the <b>Mongolian </b>province of Arhangay, killing at least 17 people and making more than 1,000 homeless.</p>
<p>An <b>Indonesian </b>member of parliament, Sri Bintang Pamungkas, was sentenced to 34 months in jail by a Jakarta court for allegedly calling President Suharto a dictator in a speech in Germany.</p>
<p>The Philippines' president, <b>Fidel Ramos</b>, promised new taxes, and a better collection system, expected to bring in an extra $500m a year.</p>

<h2>Getting airborne</h2>
<p><b>General Electric</b> and <b>Pratt &amp; Whitney</b> are setting up a joint venture to build an engine for the next century's "super-jumbo" airliners from Boeing. Collaboration between the two American firms could damage Rolls-Royce, Britain's engine manufacturer.</p>
<p>With less than a year to full competition in Western Europe's skyways, some airlines are still struggling. The near-trebling of pre-tax profits in the first quarter by <b>Scandinavian Airlines System</b> failed to impress investors. They chiefly noticed that operating profits slumped by 67%, that costs rose and that gains from last year's alliance with Lufthansa have not yet shown up.</p>
<p>Two frail airlines unveiled recovery plans. Italy's <b>Alitalia</b> plans to reduce the number of employees by 11% and inject 3 trillion lire ($1.9 billion), while making its pilots fly more. Belgium's <b>Sabena</b>, pressed by its 49.5% owner, Swissair, is offering employees a choice: a payroll cut of 18%, a pay cut of 15% or changes in working practices.</p>
<h2>Team spirit</h2>
<p>Talks between <b>Lucas Industries</b>, a British automotive and aerospace group, and <b>Varity </b>of America, a maker of car components and diesel engines, that could lead to a merger or strategic alliance of their braking operations lifted their share prices. Talk of a takeover bid by Varity was scotched.</p>
<p><b>Turner Broadcasting</b> put a brave face on reports that the Federal Trade Commission was ready to block its proposed $7.5 billion merger with <b>Time Warner </b>on the grounds that the combination of the two cable-television giants would hurt competition.</p>
<p>Adia of Switzerland and Ecco of France are to merge, creating a <b>temp agency</b> with revenues of SFr7.7 billion ($6.2 billion)--just a whisker below America's Manpower, which remains the world's biggest employment firm.</p>
<p><b>Saint-Gobain</b>, a glass-to-building materials group, is back in expansionary mode with the FFr15.5 billion ($3 billion) purchase of 56.6% of Poliet from asset-shedding Paribas in one of the biggest buys in France in recent years.</p>
<p>More twists and turns in Britain's electricity saga. A distributor, <b>Midlands Electricity</b>, accepted a &#163;1.73 billion ($2.6 billion) bid from New Jersey's General Public Utilities and Ohio's Cinergy. But the British government now says it will use its golden share in National Power, a generator, to block a bid from Southern Company of America.</p>
<h2>Doldrums</h2>
<p><b>Eurotunnel</b> haggled with its 225 creditor banks over the refinancing of its massive &#163;8.4 billion ($12.7 billion) debt. One option is a debt-for-equity swap, giving the banks 49% ownership of the Channel tunnel operator in exchange for &#163;3.5 billion in debt. Shareholders would prefer banks to write off 30% of the debt and issue a FFr28 billion ($5.5 billion) bond, convertible into shares.</p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>Despite 8% growth in its British newspapers, <b>News Corp </b>reported net profits 3% lower in the three months to March, pushed down by its television operations in America and Asia. That, together with a one-off charge of A$204m ($163m) associated with the sale of its HarperCollins educational-books unit, left net profits at A$77m, from $251m a year earlier.</p>
<p>(See <a href="wtw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>For the first time in its 22 years on the stock exchange, pre-tax annual profits at <b>J. Sainsbury</b> fell. This British supermarket giant is now second to Tesco in market share. Profits slipped to &#163;764m ($1.2 billion) in 1995 from &#163;808m a year earlier.</p>
<h2>A ray of light</h2>
<p>Shares in <b>Sun Alliance </b>and<b> Royal Insurance </b>soared after they unveiled plans for a &#163;6 billion ($9 billion) merger to form the largest composite insurance company in Britain, the first such merger in more than a decade.</p>
<p>Japan's prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, called on Japanese banks to pay more towards liquidating <b>bankrupt mortgage firms</b>. The government's plan to use money to pay for the liquidation has met bitter political opposition.</p>
<p>The former chief executive of <b>Barings</b>, a British merchant bank, was barred by the Securities and Futures Authority from any management post in British financial-service firms for at least three years. Peter Norris accepts that he shares responsibility for the collapse of the bank last year after a rogue trader, Nick Leeson, ran up &#163;860m ($1.4 billion) in dealing losses.</p>
<p>Just as <b>Lloyd's of London </b>is trying to persuade its members ("names") to back a &#163;3.2 billion ($4.8 billion) plan to settle the twin problems of its losses and names' debts, the Securities and Exchange Commission may have opened the door to more litigation in America. It asked a Californian appeal court to overturn a lower court ruling that names could not sue Lloyd's in American courts.</p>
<h2>Smoke and mirrors</h2>

<p>It is the bank that can do no right. A fire destroyed the elegant 19th century Paris headquarters of<b> Cr&eacute;dit Lyonnais, </b>France's sickly state-owned bank. The cost of the fire could run to more than FFr1 billion ($195m), said Jean Peyrelevade, the chairman, adding that "the bank might be affected, but certainly not its clients." </p>
<p><p>Belgium issued an international arrest warrant for <b>Serge Dassault</b>, chairman of France's Dassault Aviation, in connection with a contract to modernise Belgian fighter planes. Last October a Belgian prosecutor alleged that Dassault had paid BFr90m ($2.9m) in bribes to the country's socialist party.</p>

<h1><left>The e-mail of the species</center></h1>
<p><b>Some people just don't know when to shut up</b></p>

IT IS a characteristic of nets and webs that they catch things, so perhaps those who venture on to the Internet and its multimedia offshoot, the World Wide Web, should not complain when they find themselves ensnared. Still, a good grumble sometimes works wonders. This one is about the difficulty of extricating oneself from Internet entanglements, and specifically about bringing e-mail exchanges to an end.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Once upon a time, not all that long ago, readers who wanted to make a comment about something they had read in <i>The Economist</i> had to pick up a pen and paper and compose a letter, which they wrote in longhand. Even when the typewriter came along, the paper still had to be inserted, first in the machine, then in the envelope, ultimately in the letter-box. It was a fairly time-consuming business, and it had a tax on it in the shape of a stamp--all of which served to concentrate the minds of would-be letter-writers to make them stop and think whether they really had something to say that was worth saying. Often they had, and if so might expect to receive a polite reply. Sometimes that reply was enough to satisfy the reader, occasionally it was not, but only rarely did the correspondence drag tediously on.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nowadays many people make their comments by e-mail. Some who are not regular readers have articles drawn to their attention by other e-mail users who urge fellow-members of an interest-group to zap us a message. Usually these orchestrated messages are the standard stuff of generalised protest: written without much forethought, and aimed at the media in general. Sometimes they are intemperate: users of e-mail say it has only a "narrow emotional bandwidth", meaning they find it difficult to express inflexions of the voice by the mere use of words on a screen, so all their criticisms tend to come across as rude. (Never mind that the bandwidth of the typewriter never stopped letter-writers making their points politely, nor did that of the quill pen inhibit Shakespeare and company from putting quite complicated thoughts and emotions into words.) Still, whatever the inadequacies of the e-mailer, it seems discourteous to ignore him. Yet a polite, reasoned reply seldom puts a stop to the exchange. Sitting at a keyboard, it is so easy to send a reply to a reply, and for just the price of a local telephone call, or less.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Just as it is an art to say no without giving offence, so it is an art to bring a correspondence to a polite stop. Edmund Burke declared in the 18th century that the age of chivalry was dead, and that of sophisters and economists had come instead. Yet <i>The Economist</i> would like to believe that it is still possible to end an electronic exchange in a civil, if not necessarily chivalrous, manner. What is needed is a formula of the kind used by Mr Bennet in "Pride and Prejudice" when he told his daughter, "You have delighted us long enough." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;An alternative would be to discourage the correspondence at the outset. The beauty of e-mail is the ease and cheapness with which it can be used, but could it not be made selectively more difficult or expensive? Making it electronically more difficult would almost certainly discriminate against the old and in favour of the young, thus falling foul of the laws of fair play. But would it be possible to levy a tax--call it a stamp, if you will--on silly or tiresome e-mails? Or, still more tempting, to send an electric shock interactively to senders of the more offensive messages? Answers on a postcard, please.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?831769200,iss">Search</a>

<h1>Stop smoking!</h1>
<p><b>Legal challenges to American tobacco companies are raising two big questions: how much damage might product-liability suits do to the tobacco firms? And might cigarettes be classified as a drug?</b></p>

<p>SMOKING is one of the most ubiquitous activities of mankind. And, to its opponents, one of the more iniquitous. Around the world, people smoke 15 billion cigarettes every day; in America alone, they smoke over one billion a day (see <a href="sf1.gif">chart</a>). America's largest cigarette producer, Philip Morris, earns over $30 billion a year from selling tobacco. The tobacco business is one of the country's most profitable industries.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is the Goliath that the Davids with briefcases are challenging in America's courts. The scale of the battle is huge, as will be the size of the awards and the significance of the outcome if the tobacco firms lose. But before that happens, the plaintiffs have decades of failed lawsuits to reverse.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Americans have been suing tobacco firms without success since the early 1950s, when epidemiological studies by Richard Doll and Ernst Wynder first demonstrated a link between smoking and lung cancer. The law suits have come in three waves.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first were product-liability cases brought by individuals in the 1950s and 1960s. The firms fought them by nagging at the causal link between the plaintiff's history of smoking and his or her illness: the link was hard to prove. The firms also argued that plaintiffs freely chose to smoke and therefore assumed any risk themselves. The strategy worked: the firms won.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the same time, the industry set about trying to shake public confidence in the epidemiological studies, again by playing on the absence of a clear causal link. This campaign did not work: popular awareness that smoking is bad for you grew--especially after 1966, when America's surgeon general insisted that all cigarette packets bear a health warning. Ironically, however, while that helped turn public feelings against the tobacco firms, it strengthened their legal argument that smokers did know about the dangers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second wave of litigation began after 1984, when lawyers won an individual lawsuit against three tobacco companies, Philip Morris, Lorillard and Liggett, on behalf of Rose Cipollone, who had died earlier that year. A federal court ruled that the companies were liable for the lung cancer which had killed her. The verdict, however, was overturned on appeal in 1988 and Mrs Cipollone's lawyers gave up the case four years later when the cost of the battle became overwhelming. A wrongful-death suit filed immediately after the initial <i>Ci</i><i>pol</i><i>lone </i>victory is still going through the courts in New Jersey, but most anti-tobacco campaigners see little mileage left in pursuing suits on behalf of individuals.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The third wave of litigation has gathered force in the past three years, thanks to several new tactics designed to get around the difficulty of proving individual causation. This wave has three elements:
<p><font size=-1><li></font>
Reasoning that illness caused by smoking increased the charges to Medicaid, America's health system for the poor, Michael Moore, the attorney general of Mississippi, argued that the state was a victim of wrongdoing by the industry and sued the main tobacco companies to recover its extra costs. Seven more states (Florida, Louisiana, Massachusetts, Minnesota, Texas, West Virginia and, on May 1st, Maryland) have followed suit. Florida passed laws in May 1994 intended to allow statistical evidence to be used in court and to force the industry away from assumption-of-risk arguments. The state government has just maintained these laws in the face of lobbying to have them struck down by tobacco firms and other businesses worried that the provisions might one day affect them.
<p><font size=-1><li></font>
The second recent innovation drew inspiration--and several lawyers--from the attempts of asbestosis sufferers in the 1980s to win compensation from big producers of the mineral. These took the form of class-action suits, in which thousands of individual claims are bundled together in a single trial. The size of the potential payout meant that high-powered lawyers, whose fees would normally have been beyond the means of most individual plaintiffs, were ready to take on the cases. One of the largest such class-action suits, <i>Castano v American Tobacco Company</i>, was filed in New Orleans in March 1994 on behalf of all smokers in America addicted to nicotine, plus their heirs and relations (Mr Castano is simply a representative). The legal guns are correspondingly big-bore: 65 firms are involved and each has pledged to spend at least $100,000-worth of time a year on the case. A judge certified the class as legally valid in February 1995, but the defendants at once appealed. A ruling is likely in July.
<p><font size=-1><li></font>
The <i>Castano</i> suit involves one further tactical refinement. Rather than concentrate directly on the harm tobacco does to health, the case focuses on the addictiveness of nicotine and the tobacco industry's alleged mendacity about it. The significance of the addiction argument is that it undercuts the "free-choice" defence of the tobacco companies. The plaintiffs' lawyers argue that, after an initial free decision to try cigarettes--often taken well before adulthood--many smokers are no longer making an unimpeded choice but are instead compelled to go on buying cigarettes to feed their habit. (For an explanation of how the addition works, see <a href="sf2.html">page</a>.)
</p><p><b>Tar wars</b>
<br>Whether the plaintiffs win their case is, obviously, a matter for the courts. But there are several reasons for thinking that, this time, the tobacco firms have a much tougher fight on their hands than ever before--not only in the courts but outside, too.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first reason is that one company has already bowed to some of the plaintiffs' demands. On March 13th Liggett, the smallest of the big American cigarette companies and a producer of Chesterfield cigarettes (see <a href="sf2.gif">chart</a>) and unbranded "generics", shocked everyone by announcing that it had reached a settlement with the <i>Castano</i> plaintiffs. Two days later it announced a similar settlement in five of the state Medicaid suits. Under the deals, the <i>Castano</i> class would receive up to 5% of Liggett's income for 25 years, and the states a percentage which would depend on the final number that joined the agreement, as well as a lump sum of $5m spread over ten years. Liggett also agreed to abide by restrictions on advertising said to appeal to children.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Liggett case has several special features which means that the deal may not necessarily set a precedent for others. The company settled partly for particular reasons of corporate strategy. Bennett LeBow, the chairman of Liggett's parent company, wanted his firm to merge with the tobacco interests of <font size=-1>RJR</font> Nabisco, America's second largest tobacco firm. He hoped Liggett's settlement would facilitate a merger since the deal included a provision that its terms would extend to any cigarette company Liggett might merge with. In the event, Mr LeBow's bid failed--his slate of directors were not elected to the <font size=-1>RJR</font> board. Moreover, Liggett has not conceded an important principle at stake: in accepting the advertising restrictions, it did not accept that children have become hooked on cigarettes as a result of the publicity. The company has been dropped from the cases but has retained the right to hop back aboard should the remaining tobacco companies eventually prevail. In other words, if the worse comes to the worst, Liggett has capped its liabilities but, if the other firms win, Liggett does not have to pay anything: a one-way bet. For all these reasons, the plaintiffs may find it hard to say that, because Liggett settled, other firms must too. Nevertheless, the settlement is important because it is the first occasion on which a tobacco company has ever ended a lawsuit in anything other than victory.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second reason for thinking that this time may be different is that a number of recent disclosures, based on internal scientific work by the tobacco firms, have reached the public domain and, say anti-smoking campaigners, cast new light on what the tobacco firms knew and did not know about addiction.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On May 12th 1994, a crate of 4,000 pages of memoranda, letters and reports from Brown &amp; Williamson and British American Tobacco (<font size=-1>B</font>.<font size=-1>A</font>.<font size=-1>T</font>), its international parent, arrived in the office of Stanton Glantz, a cardiologist at the University of California, San Francisco. The documents reflect internal debates about disease, addiction and research into making cigarettes safer. They include a statement, made in 1963 by Addison Yeaman, general counsel of Brown &amp; Williamson, that "Nicotine is addictive. We are, then, in the business of selling nicotine, an addictive drug." Anti-smoking campaigners claim that this calls into question evidence given to Congress by the bosses of the main American tobacco companies: in 1994, they stood before a congressional investigatory committee and testified on oath that they did not believe nicotine to be addictive.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The companies are sticking to their testimony and say that it was given according to their best authority. Meanwhile, the debate has entered the public domain. Though Brown &amp; Williamson won a restraining order preventing the man who leaked the documents, Merrell Williams (a former temporary employee), from discussing them with anyone, Dr Glantz and his colleagues at the university library made the entire set available on the World Wide Web (they are to be found at <a href="http://www.library.ucsf.edu/tobacco">http://www.library.ucsf.edu/tobacco</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The legal significance of these (and other) leaked documents remains in question. The tobacco firms say the documents were taken illegally and will not comment on their contents. Anti-smoking campaigners say that the documents suggest the firms have long understood nicotine pharmacology and have experimented with how to control the level of nicotine in a cigarette. Until that dispute is resolved, the most that can be said for sure is that the allegations have increased public suspicion of the tobacco firms.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But that itself is significant because it has added to the third reason for thinking the lawyers might have the tobacco firms on the run: companies are coming under increased legislative pressure as a result of successful lobbying to restrict smoking in public. This is something that should not weigh with the courts, but might.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Several cities, including New York, have already banned smoking in public places, such as sports stadiums. Some towns in New Jersey have banned smoking on public beaches. Two Californian towns, Davis and Palo Alto, have banned smoking near public buildings--a response to the crowds of smokers gathered round entrances after being driven from their offices by no-smoking policies. And in one town in Florida (Fort Pierce), the local housing authority has required new tenants to sign an agreement not to smoke in their apartments. This is the first time people have been banned from smoking at home by a public body.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The growing power of the anti-smoking lobby might not only influence juries but could also increase the possibility that the federal government might step in to regulate the tobacco business. This possibility came closer as a result of testimony before Congress in March 1994 from David Kessler, the commissioner of the Food and Drug Administration (<font size=-1>FDA</font>).
</p><p><b>Are cigarettes a drug?</b></b>
<br>The act which set up the <font size=-1>FDA</font> gave it jurisdiction over consumer products "intended to affect the structure or any function of the body" . The agency argues that the effects of nicotine on the nervous system qualify it as a drug under this definition.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The tobacco industries have hit the ceiling. In August 1995 the <font size=-1>FDA</font> proposed a set of rules for regulating the sale of tobacco, along with a detailed analysis of its claim to jurisdiction over nicotine. It then waited for responses. Over 710,000 flooded in, more letters than the agency has received on any other business. The industry wrote to dispute the <font size=-1>FDA</font>'s claim to jurisdiction, arguing over the definition of addiction (Philip Morris has taken its argument to the Internet, with 300 pages at <a href="http://pmusainfo.webbed.com">http://pmusainfo.webbed.com</a>). Eleven tobacco companies and 20 other groups, including advertisers, shop-owners and distributors have filed four further lawsuits challenging the <font size=-1>FDA</font>'s proposals.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If granted jurisdiction, the agency would in theory be able to ban tobacco outright, or to demand maximum levels of tar or nicotine in cigarettes. In practice, the agency has wide discretion and the sense to see that prohibiting 50m Americans from smoking could be a disaster--not least for health (because people would then smoke illegally-made and possibly more dangerous cigarettes and because the prospect of 50m bad-tempered Americans all trying to give up at once hardly bears thinking about). Instead, the agency will try to reduce the number of future smokers by concentrating on under-age smoking today.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nine-tenths of all smokers start before they are 18, so the <font size=-1>FDA</font> has made it its goal to reduce by half, within seven years of gaining jurisdiction, the 3,000 Americans under 18 who start the habit every day. It wants to restrict the use of colour and pictures in advertisements likely to be seen by young people and to ban the production of branded freebies such as hats and tee-shirts. It would also make 18 a national minimum age to buy tobacco (at the moment this age limit is imposed by each state separately).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Getting the power to enforce its proposals depends on Mr Kessler, the <font size=-1>FDA</font>'s commissioner, persuading the president to enact them. Mr Clinton is more sympathetic than any previous president: his White House was quickly declared a no-smoking zone. But the proposal has got tangled up with the presidential election. A Republican victory would undoubtedly scupper the <font size=-1>FDA</font>'s efforts. Victory by the incumbent would help its cause, though the agency would still face opposition from some congressmen working on legislation to prevent the <font size=-1>FDA</font> from winning its battle.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In short, the fight against the multi-billion dollar tobacco business is getting fiercer both in government and the courts. An enormous amount is at stake. In the past, some businesses have been driven into bankruptcy by product-liability suits--notably asbestos firms in the 1970s and 1980s and, more recently, producers of silicon breast-implants (plus their insurers). The tobacco firms seem in a better position to ride out the storm than the firms involved in those cases. The lawsuits are not yet won in the courts; the <font size=-1>FDA</font>'s attempt to classify cigarettes as a drug is facing a lot of legislative opposition. What is clear is that they are under attack as never before. The next few months will determine in what shape they will survive.

<p><b>Education</b></p>
<h1>A is for appal</h1>

<p>GILLIAN SHEPHARD, the education and employment secretary, and Chris Woodhead, chief inspector of schools in England, have added universities' education faculties to their list of those to blame for low academic standards. Poor teaching, in part due to poor training of teachers, was the main reason for the alarming findings of a new study of children's reading abilities in 45 inner-London primary schools, published on May 7th. Responding to the study, Mrs Shephard announced extra powers for inspectors to set reading tests in schools, and to question local councils on what they are doing to improve their schools. But teacher training also faces a drastic shake-up: there will be a league table of training institutions, and the worst performers may be closed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Inspectors found that an astonishing 80% of seven-year-olds in the 45 schools were behind with their reading. They also found, which is no less astonishing, that many of the teachers had no idea how to teach pupils to read. In particular, pupils were not being taught phonics (the sounds made by each letter of the alphabet) properly. Mrs Shephard and Mr Woodhead accepted the claims of some of these teachers that their initial training courses did not teach them how to teach phonics, and that they had been given little further training since the start of their careers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Until recently, inspections of teacher-training institutions were rare, and inspectors' reports were kept under wraps. Now, all institutions are being inspected. The reports are being published along with a league table based on inspectors' gradings. Those teacher-training courses at the bottom of the table may be closed down. On May 3rd, a damning report on Charlotte Mason College (part of Lancaster University) was published which concluded that "a high proportion of students were not competent in teaching reading".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Anthea Millett, chief executive of the Teacher Training Agency, the government's regulatory body, says she expects the reports will show a wide variation in how well universities equip their students to teach reading and other key subjects. As well as being used to compile league tables, evidence from the inspectors' reports may be used to justify the agency imposing more detailed specifications on what trainee teachers are taught.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So future primary-school teachers are likely to arrive in their first job with a much better grasp of how to teach pupils to read. But Jim Campbell, professor of education at Warwick University (which has just received a more flattering report on its teacher-training courses), points out that the majority of primary-school teachers are in their 40s, and so were trained at a time when relatively little attention was paid to the teaching of reading.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These teachers, with perhaps 20 years' experience, are often reluctant to go on retraining courses. At the moment these are voluntary. Giving head teachers the right to insist that teachers attend retraining would provoke a furious reaction. And since there are more than 200,000 primary-school teachers, sending even a fraction of them on courses would be hugely expensive (the current cost of in-service training for teachers is already around &#163;400m). Not only are head teachers reluctant to upset their staff by sending them on courses, there is currently no effective mechanism for finding out whether those sent for retraining are actually better teachers when they return to the classroom.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So the government faces an unenviable choice in its vital drive to stamp out illiteracy. Either wait years for older teachers to retire and be replaced by a new generation of better-trained ones. Or spend a fortune and risk a rumpus by insisting that large numbers of primary teachers go back to school and learn things they should have known all along.

<h1>Riches through the looking-glass</h1>

THE stockmarket launch of Chiroscience in 1994 was a flop. Analysts doubted whether it was a serious competitor in a crowded part of the biotechnology business. But in the past week its market valuation has surged to &#163;400m, four times its value at flotation--even though on May 7th it said it had raised &#163;40m from its shareholders to keep it going. The firm seems to have dispelled investors' doubts by showing that, with its links to a worldwide network of university laboratories, it can come up with a string of potentially money-spinning drugs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Chiroscience specialises in chiral compounds--molecules that exist in two forms, each the mirror-image of the other. The two forms often have different effects: one may be a useful drug, the other may have nasty side-effects. Attempts to make such compounds usually produce a mixture of both forms. Chiroscience and other firms have been trawling a list of drugs which are a mixture of both chiral forms, and which had been rejected because of side-effects or were coming to the ends of their patents. Their aim is to discover whether either chiral form on its own makes a better drug, and then to work out how to make this good version without its malevolent mirror-image.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Chiroscience's closest rivals are Sepracor and Celgene, two American firms with their own methods for making chiral compounds. But Erling Refsum, an analyst at Yamaichi Securities in London, says that they have got bogged down in their hunt through the drug industry's back catalogue. Meanwhile Chiroscience has persuaded most of the world's top ten drug companies that its manufacturing technology is best, and has sold them licences to use these methods for their own chiral chemistry projects. And it has been working on some newly discovered chiral compounds called matrix metalloproteinase inhibitors (<font size=-1>MMPI</font>s). Its first <font size=-1>MMPI</font>, a possible arthritis treatment, has just begun clinical trials; preliminary tests on another one suggest it could be an effective cancer treatment.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Treating the world's ageing population for arthritis could be a huge money-spinner. Doctors can currently offer sufferers little more than pain relievers. Mr Refsum reckons that if <font size=-1>MMPI</font>s turn out to be good at treating the underlying causes of arthritis, the global market for them could be $25 billion a year. The market for cancer treatments based on <font size=-1>MMPI</font>s is also vast. Even if some of the other firms working on <font size=-1>MMPI</font>s also succeed, Mr Refsum says there is room for many of them to make vast profits.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Chiroscience's future suddenly looks brighter. But biotechnology is a fast-moving business, and is littered with firms which soared and then crashed. If the firm loses its touch at tapping academic specialists, or rival firms prove better at the same game, the stockmarket's doubts could quickly return.

<p><b>Broadcasting</b></p>
<h1>Digital decade</h1>

<p>WHEN John Birt, the <font size=-1>BBC</font>'s director general, set out his vision for the next decade on May 9th, the future came across in ones and zeros. For multi-channel digital television is going to replace the meagre choice of four analogue channels now on offer in four out of five British homes.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Plenty of channels creates plenty of opportunity, but mainly for pay-television. Subscriptions are the fastest-growing source of new television revenues and the lion's share goes to <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font>, 40% owned by Rupert Murdoch's News International. <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font>'s revenues and profits are already rising rapidly and its market capitalisation makes it Britain's second-largest media group. The firm is using its river of cash to buy sports rights and to invest in a digital service which it plans to launch next year. It hopes to dominate the market: the satellite it plans to use will be in a different orbit from Europe's other television satellites, creating a deterrent to potential rivals.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>BBC</font> will get a chance to launch its own digital services if, as the government plans, it is offered space in the spectrum for digital terrestrial broadcasting. Those services will include wide-screen television and 24-hour news. But some are likely to be sold to viewers, which will lead to charges of cross-subsidy. The <font size=-1>BBC</font> can rebut those charges, but it faces a bigger quandary. Will <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font> build a proprietary system into the set-top box its viewers will buy, forcing them to acquire a second box if they want to receive the <font size=-1>BBC</font>'s digital channels?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Given the modest size of the British market, even <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font> would probably like some way to share the cost of the set-top box with others. One radical solution, canvassed by the Labour Party, is to sell in advance the spectrum that would subsequently be freed by switching off analogue transmission, and use the cash to buy people digital sets. Alternatively, <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font> may be persuaded to team up with the <font size=-1>BBC</font> to launch a common digital system. That would coax the <font size=-1>BBC</font>'s up-market viewers to taste the delights of pay television. It would leave <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font> with more money to spend on buying sports and film rights. And it might convince the Office of Fair Trading, now investigating <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font>, that the company was not out to thwart competition.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But is it in the <font size=-1>BBC</font>'s interest to encourage people to view so many channels? In homes with satellite or cable services, its viewing share is only 30%, compared with almost 46% for the whole country. In fact, the <font size=-1>BBC</font> has little choice: if it does not create upmarket digital subscription services, <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font> will do so--just as Classic <font size=-1>FM</font>, a commercial station devoted to classical music, has pinched many <font size=-1>BBC</font> music lovers.

<h1>Martyred marketeers</h1>

<p>THE Football Association's commercial director resigned on May 8th during an investigation into illegal ticket sales; the police rounded up ticket touts in the run-up to the Cup Final on May 11th and the Euro 96 football championship next month. Television news bulletins obediently showed pixellated faces being dragged into vans to prove the police's determination to purge society of these vermin.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Britain's hostility to those who sell on the open market tickets that are in theory available only through official channels seems odd. In almost all of the economy it is illegal for a cartel to rig the market, and the government spends much time and effort trying to prevent this happening. In the sports-ticket business, however, the market-riggers have the state's protection, and it is illegal to try to bust the cartel. Indeed, the law against the free-marketeers has been tightened: the police used to rely on bye-laws, but they now have the Criminal Justice Act behind them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It seems even odder that, when the Football Association (<font size=-1>FA</font>) and the clubs know about the excess demand for their tickets, they do not charge more to retain the excess profit that currently goes to the touts. But that is not, as it were, football. Running a football club may be big business, but the fans also think they have a right to affordable tickets. Most fans reckon ticket prices are already too high, and would rather rely on clubs to ration them than pay higher prices. And nobody wants to make football fans angry. As for ticket touts, according to Steve Double of the <font size=-1>FA</font>, they are not generally seen as beneficent agents of the invisible hand. "We get hammered for letting them live."

<p><b>Local elections</b></p>
<h1>Short of a miracle</h1>

<p>THE Tories were routed, so John Major stays leader. Thus runs the paradoxical story of May 2nd's local elections, confirmed by the most detailed examination of the results yet, conducted on the basis of <i>The Economist</i>'s regular ward-by-ward local-election survey carried out by John Curtice of Strathclyde University.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Tories lost over half--581 out of 1,092--of the seats they were defending. Projected into a nationwide general-election vote, their performance was worth just 27%, 16 points behind Labour and only one point ahead of the Liberal Democrats. By any standards, it was a bad result.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But it was also a recovery. The Conservative vote, in line with the opinion polls, was two points up on last year. And the losses were certainly no worse than expected. This was enough to quell speculation about the Tory leadership.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tory spokesmen did their best to talk up their performance. They argued that the party had lost fewer seats than in either 1986 or 1991, also 12 months before a general election which they went on to win. They could have used much better arguments. Labour invited voters to use the elections to hit the Tories "where it hurts" . They do not seem to have done so. The results suggest that voters are no longer angry with the government, simply disillusioned.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Angry voters could be expected to vote for opposition parties, but disillusioned voters stay at home. This is precisely what happened last week: only 31% went to the polls, fewer than at any district election since 1973. Those who did stay at home were more likely to be Conservatives. The party did best where turnout held up most.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This was vividly illustrated in the four councils the party was defending, Broxbourne, Huntingdon, Macclesfield, and Runnymede. Turnout rose in all four. And in all four the Tory vote rose by as much as 7-8%. As a result, the party retained its majority in all but Runnymede.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, the Tory recovery is not as modest as some observers claimed. Many said that the result was the party's second-worst local election performance ever. It was not. The party's vote was not only higher than last year, but 0.4 percentage points up on 1994 as well.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The recovery was strongest where the Tories most wanted it. As our table (see <a href="br1.gif">table</a>) shows, the Tory vote rose most since last year in those wards it was defending. The party's traditional heartlands are beginning to return to the fold.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Above all, the Tories' misfortunes were grossly exaggerated by the electoral system. It took fewer than 2,000 votes to elect a Labour councillor, nearly 3,000 to elect a Liberal Democrat one, but nearly 6,000 to elect a Conservative. The Tories have caught the old Liberal disease of coming second often and winning rarely.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Meanwhile, both opposition parties have problems. Although the Liberal Democrats did better than their opinion poll ratings yet again, their vote was on average still more than four percentage points lower than in 1994 in those wards that had elections this year and two years ago. And Labour's projected vote was a full eight points below its average performance in opinion polls. According to the British Election Panel Survey, an academic survey which tracks voters through this Parliament, only one-sixth of this gap can be attributed to tactical voters switching from Labour to the Liberal Democrats.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So are the prospects for the Tories in the general election better than most pundits claim? Alas for Mr Major, the answer is no.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Imagine an election next spring. Imagine that the Tories secure a two-and-a-half percentage point swing from Labour over the next year, as they have over the past year. Imagine, finally, that they do even better than that in seats they are defending, achieving an extra swing of 1% in the south of England. The result is still a disaster. On these assumptions, the Conservatives would have only 186 <font size=-1>MP</font>s, fewer even than the 209 Labour won in its <i>annus horribilis</i> of 1983. More than one Tory seat in three would fall.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Why so bleak? Our table gives the answer. The recovery in the party's heartlands since last year has done little to reverse an adverse longer-term trend. Compared with four years ago (as opposed to one year ago), Tory support was down far more in those wards it was defending than elsewhere. Moreover, voters in those wards are opting for whichever of Labour or the Liberal Democrats are best placed to defeat the Tories. As a result, the electoral system threatens to magnify Tory unpopularity in a general election, as voters treat the Liberal Democrats and Labour as if they had an electoral pact.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For now, Mr Major is safe. The progress which the Tories made last week saw to that. But progress is not enough. To win, he needs a miracle.

<h1>The war of the wires</h1>
<p><b>Two years ago America's local telephone companies dismissed the Internet as a fad. Now they worry it will ruin their business</b></p>

<p>WINTER 1997: on a snowy afternoon in New York city, an elderly grandmother feels sick and reaches for the telephone to call an ambulance, but there is no dialtone. She had always paid her telephone bills on time, just to ensure that help was at hand. Now the telephone system has let her down--all because a few dozen Internet junkies on her street are hogging all the available telephone circuits.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is the nightmare that America's local telephone companies, or "Baby Bells", are quietly describing to any regulator who will listen. It has already happened in a small way, they claim, during the recent snow storms on the east coast. While callers spend half an hour a day, on average, chatting on local calls, heavy Internet users may spend three times as long on the same lines with their modems (and the Internet users often have a second line). Some set their computers to dial in several times an hour to check their e-mail. Others remain connected all day.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The telephone network is designed on the assumption that the average call is about three minutes long, and that the average telephone is used for nine minutes or fewer during peak hours. But typical modem use starts at 15 minutes and quickly moves skyward. Staying endlessly on the line costs many Internet users nothing, thanks to a combination of free local calls in most of North America and the fact that most Internet services charge a flat fee, with no time charges.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Baby Bells reckon that these modem hogs should somehow pay for the extra equipment telephone companies must buy to keep up with their ravenous consumption. At least four Baby Bells--Nynex, <font size=-1>US</font> West, Pacific Bell and Bell Atlantic--are now lobbying the Federal Communications Commission (<font size=-1>FCC</font>) to apply per-minute access fees, much like those already applied to long-distance calls, for calls to Internet services.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The battle between the Baby Bells and the Internet is the first skirmish in what promises to be a wider war between the Internet and telephone companies of all sorts. This war will be international: in Britain, the telephone company serving Hull, the only town with free local calls, recently banned a large Internet service because its users would not get off the lines. And it will not just be confined to data transmission: already telephone companies on both sides of the Atlantic are begging for laws to restrict voice telephony on the Internet (see <a href="wb2.html">page</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;From the point of view of the Baby Bells, the Internet is a parasite. Unlike the long-distance companies, which lease some of their capacity to carry Internet traffic, the local telephone companies have little say over how their networks are used. The Baby Bells (and ultimately their customers) bear a large part of the Internet's costs, while receiving little or none of its revenues.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is partly the Baby Bells' own fault for being slow to offer Internet services of their own. But in North America, it is also a function of a regulatory system that never considered the possibility that people would want to use their telephones all day. The economics of the Internet over long-distance routes are still a baffling maze of trickle-up payments and barters, but the picture over the last mile to a user's home is all too clear: it is a free ride.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In February, <font size=-1>AT&T</font>, America's biggest long-distance company, began to offer free Internet access for a year--a deal tempting enough to attract several hundred thousand users in its first month. As the Bells plaintively point out, they are paying for <font size=-1>AT&T</font>'s largesse: the long-distance giant has set up a network of dial-in points located within a local call for most users, thereby exploiting the loophole that allows them to use local networks for Internet service without paying the access charges <font size=-1>AT&T</font> normally must pay the Bells for long-distance calls. <font size=-1>MCI</font>, the second-largest long-distance carrier, is now offering its own Internet service.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Without a way to charge Internet service-providers directly, the Baby Bells currently recover their money from the access fees they charge all long-distance users. Such fees typically amount to around 45% of the charge for long-distance calls. Within two or three years, around 20% of those access fees will be attributable to Internet users, reckons Bernd Pfeiffer, a Nynex executive. Why not bill the offenders directly, he argues, with a charge of as little as a penny a minute? Even for a heavy user the tax would be less than $50 a month.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Internet advocates see it differently. "It's their old strategy--they're seeking a regulatory handout instead of competing," says Dhruv Khanna, a communications lawyer with Intel, a semiconductor firm. The fast growth of the Internet in North America has been partly due to flat-fee rates, which encourage users to experiment at leisure. Subscribers in countries with per-minute charges, as is the case in most of Europe, use their telephones about a third as much as Americans; activists say that forcing the Internet into a system that charges by the minute would probably have the same chilling effect.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All the accusations and claims of high principle tend to obscure the fact that the dispute is over a relatively small number of people. Knock out all the Americans who use the Internet only for sending e-mail, and who use the Internet at offices which have direct connections (ie, bypassing the Baby Bells' lines), and you are left with about 9m home-based heavy users. However, around 7.5m of these use intermediaries such as America Online or CompuServe whose time-based charges discourage long sessions. The Baby Bells' case thus comes down to just 1.5m modem users.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, this understates the problem on two counts. First, the Internet is doubling in size every year. This year will see the first wave of mass-market Internet devices, from <font size=-1>TV</font> set-top boxes to game machines and cheap "network computers", that will make the matter worse. Meanwhile, the proliferation of multimedia sites on the Internet is only increasing the time users spend on-line.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Second, the clash between modem and voice calls is the first collision between century-old phone technology and the era of digital communications introduced by the personal computer. The voice calls carried by the Bells (and most other telecoms firms around the world) are connected by an electronic version of the old telephone operator known as "circuit switching": a call gets a line to itself for its duration, after which the circuit is switched to another call. The Internet uses a much more efficient technique called "packet switching" , which allows many transmissions to share the same line, with computers at both ends sorting them out.
</p><p><b>The digital divide</b>
<br>The modems that so annoy the Bells symbolise this rift: they exist to turn pure digital signals into the sort of analogue noise that a circuit-switched network can understand. The same line with a new switching technology called Asymmetric Digital Subscriber Line (<font size=-1>ADSL</font>) can carry up to 400 times as much data. Even a cheaper technology known as Integrated Services Digital Network (<font size=-1>ISDN</font>) that has been around for years can multiply transmission speed five-fold. Last year, for the first time, data exceeded voice traffic on the world's telecoms networks. Surely the day has come for data to move from voice networks to purely digital ones?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Baby Bells can already offer <font size=-1>ISDN</font> over most of their regions. Yet they have fewer than 400,000 <font size=-1>ISDN</font> users between them. <font size=-1>ISDN</font> is complicated to install, has never been widely promoted by the Bells, and can cost more than $40 per month (with a set-up fee that can amount to more than $200). Internet users are now trying to convince the Bells that they are foolish to let <font size=-1>ISDN</font> languish. If they were to offer their own <font size=-1>ISDN</font> Internet access, they could get more than $50 a month in subscription fees from the same users they claim are costing them nearly that much by hogging the voice network with their modems.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With some $30 billion invested in the old circuit-switching infrastructure, the Bells seem to be thinking more about recovering the investments they have already made than promoting alternatives. But the sooner they see the Internet as an opportunity rather than a threat, the sooner they can stop scaring grandmothers with tales of modem users run amok.

<h1>Only disconnect</h1>

<p>THE fight over access fees is really a question of good manners: the Internet, argue the telecom companies, is abusing their hospitality, overloading their networks. Another set of battles could, one day, prove much more turbulent; these are taking place in areas where the Internet is robbing the telecoms companies of customers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In March the America's Carriers Telecommunication Association, an organisation of about 160 of the smaller long-distance telephone companies, filed a petition with America's Federal Communications Commission to regulate attempts to use the Internet for voice calls, claiming that this represented unfair competition. Meanwhile, Canadian telecommunications regulators are trying to force an Internet company in Ontario to pay fees to Canadian telephone companies for the same reason.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Voice calls on the Internet are still something of a novelty. They usually require prearranged connections: a fear of being regulated keeps Internet telephony services from linking into the regular telephone networks on anything but an experimental basis. Users also have to be tolerant of the network's chronic delay and distortion. On the other hand, such calls are in effect free. Once they reach a certain (minimal) level of quality, millions will make them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A more immediate threat to the telephone carriers comes in the business of providing private data networks for companies. Sun Microsystems, a computer maker, has already announced plans to abandon the expensive global network it leases from several telephone companies, including America's <font size=-1>MCI</font> and Sprint, and to connect its scattered offices together via the Internet.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Defections of this sort should worry telephone companies. A few years ago, they were counting on rich profits from services such as voice mail and data services, reasoning that their huge networks meant that they alone could offer these things. Now, thanks to the Internet, anyone can offer such services; there is no particular advantage in owning the underlying telephone lines. Worse, the Internet is already starting to embrace more traditional telephone services, from fax services to videoconferencing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Within a few years telephone companies will have to change accordingly, argues Analysys, a British consultancy. Its suggestion: break in two. One part would run the network itself, selling capacity to all comers; the other would offer services, starting with regular telephony but moving anything from news to financial data.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Analysys argues that those telephone companies that choose to remain vertically integrated are in danger of being dragged down by regulatory restrictions on cross-subsidies, as well as by their own mammoth size. In contrast, those that split up will be able to compete much more effectively with nimble Internet competitors. Better, arguably, than praying for regulators to save your skin.

<p><b>Voice recognition</b></p>
<h1>The Galaxy's guide to the hitch-hiker</h1>

<font size=1>CAMBRIDGE, MASSACHUSETTS</font>
<p>IN FILMS about the future, computers generally feature either as electronic personifications of evil, or as your plastic pal who's fun to be with. But whichever guise they appear in, they differ from the cussed, keyboard-driven creatures familiar to contemporary man in two important ways. They can listen. And they can talk.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Talking is not too difficult--speech-synthesis programs have been around for a while, though computers are hardly great conversationalists. Listening and, more importantly, understanding, though, is still mostly science fiction. But the desire to design a listening machine is strong in software engineers. So strong that they have been at it for several decades, with what might generously be described as limited success.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The problems are legion. The computer must first recognise each word in a sentence, even when spoken in a sloppy, everyday cadence. It must parse the sentence into its grammatical elements. It must then try to understand the meaning of what it has parsed, and finally it must act on it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is a formidable task, particularly for the limited brains of the personal computers (<font size=-1>PC</font>s) on which a useful system would have to run. But on top of all this, there is the problem of context. Critics of a philosophical bent argue that language is a social activity requiring shared background assumptions. Since those assumptions can never be completely and objectively listed, they cannot be programmed into a computer.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Spoken Language Systems Group at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology Laboratory for Computer Science, which is led by Victor Zue, thinks, however, that it has gone some way to dealing with these difficulties. It has done so by removing most of the processing problem from the <font size=-1>PC</font>s to powerful central machines that can do some serious word-crunching, and by dodging the issue of context.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dr Zue's systems restrict context by operating in limited "knowledge domains". Two prototypes that have been running for the past few years are extremely limited. Voyager is a user's guide to Cambridge, helping people to find their way to Chinese restaurants and other tourist necessities. And Pegasus is connected to the American Airlines Eaasy reservation system. But a third system, Galaxy, which Dr Zue is in the process of developing, manages to have it both ways. By operating in a bigger virtual world--the World Wide Web of the Internet--it can link disparate knowledge domains together in a way that is invisible to the user.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Galaxy's goal is to do for the Internet what graphical icons did for personal computers--give it an intuitive feel that anyone can grasp. A person asking Galaxy for help does not need to know who created the information sought, which computer it sits on, its address on the network, or even its "transmission protocol" (ie, which acronym or jokey mnemonic--such as ftp, gopher or http--is needed to fetch it). He merely asks, "What will the weather be like tomorrow in Manhattan?" and, with luck, the answer will come back in a few seconds (though not necessarily any more accurately than if he had got it from a human weather forecaster). And if Galaxy does not understand the first time, it can ask supplementary questions, like an interviewer trying to pin down the ambiguities of a politician.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Galaxy's manifestation in a user's <font size=-1>PC</font> is a small program known as a client. This serves merely as a courier, shuttling the user's questions to a piece of heavyweight silicon known as a language server, and then taking the server's reply and delivering it back to the <font size=-1>PC</font>'s user. The language servers do the computationally intensive work of speech recognition and language processing. Each also knows how to interrogate the relevant "knowledge server" for the question at hand. These machines find the data a language server needs to compose answers for the original <font size=-1>PC</font>'s client program to turn into synthesised speech (or a typed text for those unfortunates still chained to a screen). Making all this possible requires an enormous amount of programming.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The basic research that Dr Zue's team has had to carry out in order to write Galaxy's programs includes modelling how people hear, what linguistic regularities pop up in their spontaneous speech (which may, in this context, be English, Spanish, Chinese or Japanese), and how to deal with such problems as foreign accents. For only after having understood the question (Galaxy knows more than 4,000 English words, and dealing with unknown ones was yet another wrinkle that Dr Zue's team had to iron out), can the server then seek an answer from the appropriate knowledge domain.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ultimately, Dr Zue hopes to eliminate the <font size=-1>PC</font> altogether, and have a system that answers questions down a telephone. Whether other people will create enough knowledge-domain servers out there to provide the answers, and whether they will be fun to be with, remains to be seen.

<html><head><title>Restoring Germany's shine</title></head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">
<p align=center><img src="http://www.economist.com/econlogosmall.gif" width=78 height=39  alt="The Economist"></p>

<h1><center>Restoring Germany's shine</center></h1>

"SOCIALLY obscene"; "the destruction of the welfare state". With such fine phrases, German trade unionists heaped abuse on the spending cuts and labour-market reforms that their government proposed on April 26th. However misguided, these opponents of change were at least right in recognising the significance of the package: if implemented, it could prove a turning point for Germany. The proposals, which aim to chop total public spending by 2% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> next year, would be the country's biggest spending cuts for decades. The significance of the reforms, moreover, lies not just in their scope but in the manner of their introduction: the government now seems willing to push ahead despite howls of protest from the unions. Many people will view this challenge to Germany's tradition of decision-making by consensus as dangerous; but it is unavoidable if the economy is to restore its old, now distinctly tarnished, shine.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The German model--a much envied system based on consensus between politicians, managers and unions--is in deep trouble. For many years, it worked well: until the late 1970s, Germany could boast of an economic miracle and could trace its success to the country's system of economic management. Because the framework within which markets operated was determined by consensus, there was comparatively little room for government tinkering. Policy was stable and companies were free to get on with the business of improving their products, seeking new customers and increasing wealth.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That was then. Now, the miracle has become a myth. Since 1979, productivity in German business has risen by only half the average increase in European economies; in the past two decades, Germany has created proportionately fewer jobs than most other big economies. And the country has become an uncompetitive place in which to do business.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Part of the trouble can be traced to the shock of unification in 1990 and to the enormous bills which that has entailed. But much more is rooted in the German model itself (see <a href="sf1.html">pages</a>). To ensure that no one misses out on prosperity, an over-generous welfare system grew up in the late 1960s and the 1970s. Social benefits and holiday pay add a hefty 80% on top of basic wage costs. To underpin the contract between managers and workers, the country's labour and product markets have become riddled with rules and rigidities that hinder new firms and new jobs. Germany's income-tax system is complex and unfair, with high marginal tax rates alongside a multitude of tax loopholes: these allow the rich to escape tax, while average workers pay the highest tax rates among the big seven economies. The country's corporate tax rate is the highest of any large economy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Hence, at a time when some Europeans are looking to Germany as a model for pan-European social policies, and even American cabinet-members are finding inspiration in Germany's "stakeholder economy", the German government itself is recognising that the model needs to change. It is proposing things which, by its standards, are radical, and deserves credit for that. To cut spending it wants a public-sector wage freeze, and reductions in sick pay and other benefits. To help create jobs it has proposed that small firms should be exempt from employment protection laws. The government's goal is to reduce public spending to 46% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> by 2000, from around 50% at present. That would still leave it above today's 42% share in Britain but below the 50%-plus in France and Italy. In part the measures were driven by the government's short-term need to slim its budget deficit to meet the Maastricht criteria to join Europe's single currency. But more important is the long-term need for structural reform.
</p><p><b>Wirtschaftsblunder</b>
<br>The biggest danger now is not that the government will, as its critics fear, destroy Germany's distinctive system of economic management through excessive zeal. The threat of that is remote. It is that the government will fail to push its reforms through--and the possibility of that is real.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For one thing, the ruling coalition has only a narrow majority in the lower house of parliament, while the opposition Social Democrats are in a majority in the upper house. They may force the government to dilute its proposals. For another, some of the impetus for reform comes from the state of the economic cycle, which could change again soon. At the moment, Germany is spluttering. Unemployment has risen above 4m; in the year to February industrial production plunged by 6%; the six German economic institutes have just reduced their forecast of <font size=-1>GDP</font> growth this year to a mere 0.75%.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Economic gloom makes people more willing to accept the need for change. The danger is that recovery next year will appear to lessen the urgency of reform and make Germans complacent again. But recovery alone will not reduce unemployment markedly; most of that is structural. Nor will it affect those features of the German system that are now damaging the country's performance. Much remains to be done.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The system of centralised wage bargaining, under which trade unions and bosses set pay across whole industries regardless of individual firms' profitability, used to work well because it helped to avoid inflationary leapfrogging. But in the face of rapid technological change and competition in some sectors from low-wage economies, relative wages need to adjust, and the system inhibits that. High minimum wages prevent the low-skilled jobless from pricing themselves back into work. Hence, though the consensus has benefited existing workers and employers, it hurts the increasing numbers of jobless. The wage-bargaining system needs further reform.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition to encouraging a more flexible labour market and consolidating welfare reform, the government also needs to liberalise services, which must expand if new jobs are to be created. Of the big economies, Germany has the smallest service sector, thanks to archaic, job-inhibiting rules. Most notorious are Germany's ridiculous shop opening hours (eg, shops currently have to close at 2pm most Saturdays). The government is planning only modest reforms to these.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Against that litany of woes, Chancellor Kohl's package, for all its proposed daring, must be considered merely a start, a welcome signal that the welfare state is no longer regarded as untouchable. Because there is more to do, the critics of reform will argue that change risks destroying Germany's distinctive social-market economy. In truth, even if the proposals were implemented in full, they would fall far short of that. Reform of the system is needed; full-scale destruction is not. Chancellor Kohl is merely throwing his weight behind the operation of market forces. In coming years, such forces are more likely to represent the interests of Germany as a whole than is the mouldy old model, with its closed roundtable discussions between politicians, bosses and trade unions.

<h2>Five months to go</h2>
<p>Seven months into the fiscal year, the Republican Congress and the Clinton administration agreed at last on a $160 billion <b>budget</b> for 1996. The spending bill included a cut of $20 billion in money terms, but provided an extra $5 billion for the education, training and environment programmes President Clinton wanted.<p>
Mr Clinton was questioned under oath in the bank-fraud trial of his former Arkansas business partners, James and Susan McDougal, giving his evidence on videotape at the White House. The McDougals and the Clintons were co-sponsors of the ill-fated <b>Whitewater </b>property development.<p>
The Justice Department said it would investigate whether illegal industry collusion had contributed to a recent surge in <b>petrol prices</b>, which have increased by 12% since mid-February. Mr Clinton ordered the Energy Department to sell 12m barrels of crude oil from the country's reserves in an effort to drive down prices.<p>
<b>William Colby</b>, a former head of the <font size=-1>CIA</font>, was missing after his canoe was found capsized near his holiday home in Maryland.<p>
<b>Paraguay</b>'s mutinous army chief, General Lino Oviedo, lost his gamble. Sacked, but refusing to quit until he was promised the post of defence minister, he resigned--to find President Juan Carlos Wasmosy, under pressure from democrats at home and abroad, had resolved not to give him the job.<p>
<b>Colombia</b>'s beleaguered President Ernesto Samper lost another minister, his finance chief, Guillermo Perry. He has not been accused of involvement in the ruling party's scandal over drug money and campaign finance.

<h2>Germany bruised</h2>
<p>The German government announced a DM70 billion ($46 billion) <b>savings package </b>for 1997, which includes cutting sick pay and other health benefits, delaying a rise in family benefits and denying a pay rise to civil servants. Other proposed reforms include raising the retirement age, introducing competition into the energy market and liberalising restrictive shopping hours. The package met fierce resistance from unions.<p>
Nine weeks after the general election, <b>Jose Maria Aznar</b>, leader of Spain's conservative People's Party, is to be invested as prime minister at the head of a loose parliamentary majority including the main Catalan and Basque parties. The supreme court cleared the outgoing prime minister, <b>Felipe Gonzalez</b>, of charges that he oversaw a "dirty war" in the 1980s against Basque terrorists.<p>
Leaders of the <b>Nordic and Baltic</b> countries, together with those of Germany, Russia and Poland, were due to meet on a Swedish island to discuss peaceful co-operation in the region.<p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
Within a week of one rebel leader of <b>Chechnya</b>--Jokar Dudaev--being killed, probably by a Russian rocket, it was rumoured that his apparent successor, Zelimkhan Yandarbiev, had met a similar fate--until he appeared, smiling, on television.<p>
Britain's prime minister, John Major, said that if a referendum were held now, the British people would<b> refuse to join</b> Europe's economic and monetary union.<p>
(See <a href="wtw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>The impasse over a worldwide ban on </b><b>British beef </b>continued, with uncertainties remaining over Britain's readiness to initiate a cull deemed satisfactory by the European Union.

<h2>Back to base</h2>
<p>A truce, restating rules designed to protect civilians, ended Israel's <b>blitz on Lebanon</b> and Hizbullah's rocketing of northern Galilee. Israeli evacuees returned to their homes. So did the Lebanese but often found them shattered. They buried their dead, including the 102 people killed at Qana.<p>
Shimon Peres was warmly welcomed by Bill Clinton, and offered <b>laser weapons</b> that might, but probably would not, disable an approaching Katyusha rocket. Yasser Arafat followed him to Washington, claiming his reward for changing the <font size=-1>PLO</font>'s covenant. A Jewish rabbi was stabbed by a Palestinian in Hebron, casting further doubt on Israel's early redeployment from the city.<p>
<b>South Africa</b>'s trade unions held a one-day strike to protest a clause in the proposed constitution giving employers the right to <b>lock strikers out</b>. The rand, which fell further in the run-up to the strike, stabilised after the government raised interest rates.<p>
A ceasefire in the Liberian capital, <b>Monrovia</b>, collapsed. In renewed fighting American marines shot dead three Liberians.

<h2>India elects</h2>
<p>The first two rounds of <b>India's general election </b>were said by the authorities to have been "largely peaceful". About 25 people died.<p>
At least 38 people died when a <b>bomb </b>blew up a bus near Lahore. The Pakistani government blamed "terrorists" linked, it hinted, to India.<p>
Australians observed a minute's silence in memory of 35 people killed by a gunman who ran amok in <b>Tasmania</b>.<p>
Members of a gang that stole a cable supplying electricity to a statue of <b>Kim Il Sung</b>, the former North Korean leader, have been shot as political enemies, according to a South Korean newspaper.<p>
The <b>Hong Kong </b>government said it would not co-operate with the puppet legislature that will replace the democratically elected Legco when China takes over the British colony in July 1997.<p>

<h2>Uncommunicative</h2>
<p>After two years of trying to bring about a global pact on <b>liberalising telecommunications</b>, the World Trade Organisation failed to win an agreement by this week's deadline. They set a new deadline of February 15th next year, after the Americans complained that other countries had offered to open their markets too little, especially in the case of satellite communications.<p>
The United States said it would complain formally to the World Trade Organisation about the failure of its trading partners to protect <b>intellectual property</b>. China headed America's annual list of transgressors; other culprits were Portugal, Turkey, India and Pakistan.<p>
In the largest rescheduling ever negotiated by the Paris Club of western creditors, nearly $40 billion of <b>Russian debt </b>was rescheduled over 25 years. Russia is required, in return, to adhere to the radical economic and market reforms that the <font size=-1>IMF</font> insisted upon in negotiating its own recent $10 billion loan.<p>
The European Commission halted state aid of 23 billion drachmas ($94m) to <b>Olympic Airways</b>, on the grounds that the Greek government is interfering too much in the airline's management. The commission wants a promise that this will stop before it agrees to release this second slice of a restructuring worth 54 billion drachmas.<p>
Albacom, a joint venture between <b>British Telecom </b>and its Italian partner, Banca Nazionale del Lavoro, is forming an alliance with <b>Mediaset</b>, the television and media arm of Silvio Berlusconi's Fininvest group. Each will take a stake in the other. The alliance plans to compete in Italy's liberalising telecoms market.<p>
<font size=-1>MFS</font> Communications, an American telecoms firm, agreed to pay $2 billion in shares for <font size=-1>UU</font>Net Technologies, an <b>Internet </b>service provider.

<h1>Is the model broken?</h1>
<p><b>Germany's social-market system--which has delivered enviable stability and prosperity for decades--is in worse shape than it looks</b></p>


<p>COUNTRIES around the world are seeking to reform their welfare states and deregulate their economies in the face of international competition. In most, success, where it has come, has been bought only at the cost of considerable social disruption. Last winter, France endured weeks of public-sector strikes and even riots in response to the government's plans to reduce public spending in line with the Maastricht criteria for economic and monetary union. In the 1980s, Britain faced even more turbulence (including a year-long miners' strike) as Margaret Thatcher's government pushed through deregulation and sharp public-spending cuts. Now, Germany is taking its biggest step yet down this road.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Helmut Kohl has proposed public spending cuts amounting to DM70 billion ($46 billion) next year alone, the scrapping of antiquated laws controlling the energy market and a modest liberalisation of the country's notoriously restrictive shopping hours. As thousands took to the streets in protest on May Day, the Chancellor must be hoping that the opposition will ebb away and that his country's much-admired consensus model of government--a system that encourages co-operation between parties, federal and local governments and trade unions and bosses--will enable Germany to reform itself smoothly, as it has done in the past.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Over the past five years, Germany has coped with the largest external shock any western country has faced for half a century: the incorporation, in a single blow, of 16m people with an average standard of living only one-fifth that of the rest of the country. Despite the gigantic bills of unification--in 1995 gross transfers to the former East Germany totalled DM200 billion--inflation was kept in check and <font size=-1>GDP</font> grew by an average of 1.5% a year in 1991-95 (see <a href="sf1.gif">chart</a>). This was slightly above the European average and more than Japan's growth.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But, though the model coped with unification well, that event still hit the system hard. On many measures, the economy has been lagging behind for a decade and a half: business productivity, for example, has grown by less than half the industrial-economy average since 1979; exporters have lost market share for nine of the past ten years. Now, according to the six big economic institutes, growth this year will be a mere 0.75%. Manifestly, considerable change has been possible within the existing model. Indeed, it was possible without the basic components of the system changing much. But what has happened is that unification has brought to the surface faults in the German model which were always there, but would otherwise have taken longer to become evident.
</p><p><b>How it works</b>
<br>At the heart of Germany's distinctive "social-market economy" is a system called <i>Mit</i><i>bestimmung</i> (or co-determination): by law, employees have half the seats on large companies' supervisory boards, the top governing bodies which hire and fire senior managers. This is part of a network of arrangements which both foster close ties between workers and managers and encourage a distinctive form of corporate governance: firms and banks own shares in each other, thus minimising the ownership-dispersing effects of stockmarkets and shareholders. The political counterparts to these economic arrangements are a highly decentralised federal system which gives extensive powers to 16 <i>L&auml;nder</i> (states) and a consensual forms of politics in which decisions are taken--as far as possible--with the tacit support of the main parties, the Christian Democrats and Social Democrats.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite the shock of unification, the system survived virtually unscathed. The main parties' policies were closer after 1990 than they had been for many years. There was some tinkering with the arrangements that link workers and managers, but the workers' supervisory role remained untouched and most wage settlements were reached in the traditional manner--by agreement between established unions and bosses' organisations which applied not to individual firms but to whole industries. The federal arrangements underwent expansion, not reform: the new states were added to a largely unchanged federation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To its supporters, the model does not merely allow change to occur; some argue that it helps reform to happen more smoothly, more predictably--and hence more effectively--than under adversarial systems. Because political parties eventually converge on one course of action, that course can be fixed more securely than in a confrontational country, such as Britain or America, where the possibility of policy reversal is greater. As a result, markets operate within a more stable framework.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So Mr Kohl and his supporters are seeking to justify the government's new package by saying it is not an attack on the system, but a necessary measure to preserve it. "One cannot live beyond one's means", the chancellor told parliament. "If we do not act now, more jobs will disappear. Then welfare would be unfinanceable."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The reforms, as befits a consensual country, seek to spread the load evenly between the federal government, local governments and the social-security system. Some cuts threaten comfortable German ways and look a little like robbing the overfed of their third plum pudding; others affect the jobless and the sick. They include:
<p><font size=-1><li>A fall in unemployment benefits;
</font><font size=-1><li>A reduction of sick pay from 100% to 80% of basic wages;
</font><font size=-1><li>The limitation of state-subsidised cures at health resorts--spas, beaches, moor and mountain retreats--to three weeks every four years instead of the present four weeks every three years ;
</font><font size=-1><li>The postponement of a previously-agreed 10% rise in child benefit;
</font><font size=-1><li>A gradual rise in the retirement-age for women from 60 to 63 years starting next year, and for men from 63 to 65 from 2000;
</font><font size=-1><li>The removal from holiday pay of regular overtime earnings, hitherto included; and
</font><font size=-1><li>The removal of job-protection guarantees for firms with 10 or fewer employees.</font>
<p>When the government began this latest round of public-sector reform with a get-together of ministers, unions and bosses in January, G&uuml;nter Rexrodt, the economy minister, said with pardonable pride that "there's bitter conflict over this sort of thing elsewhere, and here everyone gets together with the chancellor and we find the right direction." But the sheer size of the welfare reform suggests that, this time, something new is happening. Far from smoothing the needed changes, the German model may be being tested to destruction by them.
</p><p><b>Broken or chipped?</b>
<br>If implemented in full (admittedly a big if) these spending cuts would be equivalent to 2% of <font size=-1>GDP</font> next year. That is a huge sum, comparable to Margaret Thatcher's fiercest years. In contrast, the controversial "austerity" plan in France cuts public spending in real terms barely at all. Admittedly, welfare reform is not special to the German model: it is high on the agenda of other rich countries too. But because generous welfare payments help give everyone a stake in the system, and hence buttress consensus, it is hard to unravel the welfare state without affecting other parts of the consensual system too. Chancellor Kohl swears that he is determined to defend both--but the sheer scale of the welfare reform suggests that the cost of maintaining the wider system is rising to levels previously unheard of in Germany.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At least as important as the scale of the cuts is the manner of proposing them. Mr Rexrodt's self-congratulatory comments came after a first meeting of ministers, unions and bosses. But by the time Mr Kohl got round to unveiling the proposed reforms to parliament, negotiations with the unions had been broken off. The government nevertheless decided to stick its neck out and proposed the whole programme to parliament. Hence the outcry from Germany's powerful unions and from the Social Democratic opposition. "Socially obscene ...merciless," they cried. "A declaration of war on social justice," said Oskar Lafontaine, the Social Democratic leader. Even within the governing coalition, half a dozen supporters, both Christian Democrats and liberal Free Democrats, have balked at the plan. This is not the first time the government had gone out on a limb over an issue, but it is extremely rare for a step of this magnitude to be taken by the government alone.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So, paradoxically, in the name of preserving the model, the government has already dented two parts of it--the political-party consensus and the extensive welfare state. That alone might not be enough to make the whole system unravel. After all, there has been political conflict before, and the welfare state, which expanded hugely after the late 1960s, was not part of the original postwar model. The trouble is that the model has since developed in such a way that each part reinforces the others. Political consensus, for example, has been possible partly because, since the co-determination system helped defuse conflicts between managers and workers and the federal system lessened disputes involving regions and the centre, national parties were able to operate within a relatively narrow range of opinion. As a result, as one bit of the model goes awry, so could the rest.

</p><p><b>Workers v managers</b>
<br>It is one element of the rest--the contract between capital and labour--that is now coming most under strain. Take the labour side first. Despite having increased productivity in 1992-94, German workers are not so much more productive than their fellows in Poland or Japan that they can justify the world's highest labour costs  (see <a href="sf2.gif">chart</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some of the biggest companies are expanding their production abroad and the small and medium-sized companies that are Germany's manufacturing backbone are following suit, lured especially across the border in central Europe, where wages are around a tenth of domestic levels. This might not matter if new investment were flowing in. But foreign firms are also reluctant to set up in high-wage Germany, while local ones are investing mainly in labour-saving technology. Western Germany has shed more than 1m workers in the past four years; last year, the country invested DM37 billion more in direct investment abroad than foreigners invested in the country.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Germany's unemployment level--at over 4m, it has reached its highest since the frightening 1930s, though remaining far smaller as a percentage of the workforce--is something that affects the model directly, in a way that even the financing crisis of the welfare system does not. This is because the link between managers and workers lies at the root of the whole system. Already, union power is eroding because unions speak for a shrinking share of the population: in 1995 membership of the German Trade Union Federation dropped by 3.9% to 9.4m. In addition, if the labour laws are making workers too expensive and inflexible, and if they are preventing people being priced back into work, then something has gone wrong at the heart of the model. In that sense, unemployment is a measure of the model's failure.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now employers are demanding not just pay restraint but fundamental changes to the collective-bargaining system, under which wages and conditions are set by industry associations on behalf of employers and by unions on behalf of workers. Most managers still accept the principle that basic labour contracts should be negotiated collectively. But they want these general agreements to specify little more than basic wages and working hours. Everything else would be negotiated between individual firms and their workers, who are usually more pliant than the trade unions that represent them. They would decide, for example, how to distribute work across the week. Firms also want permission to pay less than the basic agreed wage in times of hardship, demanding, in effect, an escape clause from the basic contract that would be almost unheard-of in western Germany.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some companies are not waiting for new contracts. Daimler-Benz, Germany's biggest industrial conglomerate, has insisted on introducing Saturday working at some of its factories, even though its labour contract rules this out; its workers, desperate to stop Daimler from moving their jobs abroad, have agreed. Following the government's decision to chop sick pay from 100% of a worker's wages to 80%, employers are eager to redraft their own labour contracts along similar lines.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, managers are busily undoing some of the distinctive features of German corporate governance. Traditionally, German finance directors worried first about pleasing their banks and only second about delivering profits to shareholders. But now, with firms competing globally for capital as well as for markets and production sites, finance directors must measure the performance of their firms' shares against those of competitors worldwide. Shareholders no longer cool their heels while the chairman entertains his bankers; now they walk straight into the chairman's office. The fad for "shareholder value" is bringing to Germany capitalist trappings that arouse resentment even in less egalitarian countries. Executives are starting to award themselves share options (the better to align their interests with those of shareholders); the stockmarket is booming; and companies are adopting new Anglo-American accounting standards that rip away the veils that once shrouded their profits.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In these circumstances, the new economic package represents a further and possibly decisive tilt in the balance of power between workers and managers. The government is proposing to let firms with ten employees or fewer sack workers easily (raising the threshold from five). Conceding business's long-standing argument that high taxes kill jobs, Mr Kohl's fiscal package includes the abolition of a tax on capital and the reduction of one on profits, which finances mainly local governments. These cuts, admittedly, are to be financed by cutting tax breaks for depreciation (which could make investment even less attractive). But the government has made clear where its heart lies by proposing the abolition of a "wealth tax" on business.
</p><p><b>System failure or system reform?</b>
<br>Despite the changes that are starting to transform the nature of Germany's contract between unions and labour, it would be wrong to assume that every component of the German model is now doomed to radical transformation. For one thing, other parts of the system have changed comparatively little. Despite the emergence of new parties such as the Greens and the former communists in the eastern states, the two largest parties retain their traditional hold over electors' loyalty: the ruling Christian Democrats and the opposition Social Democrats continue to attract around 70% of all voters between them, roughly the same share as before unification. There is no sign of any sort of big political realignment.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For another, the government may well not command enough parliamentary support to ram its reform plans through over opposition from the <font size=-1>SPD</font> and from some of its own hesitating supporters. The coalition's majority in the lower house of parliament is only ten, while the <font size=-1>SDP</font> dominates the upper house (whose assent is required for some, though not all, of the reforms). It is a good bet that the government's proposed assault on the welfare state will be softened when it comes to a vote. In addition, one-third of the total spending cuts are supposed to come from a public-sector wage freeze--which the unions are unlikely to accept without a fight.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That said, it is clear that Germany's post-unification period is over and is giving way to change. Reform has begun and, at least in worker-manager relations, is likely to be deep. What remains in doubt is whether the changes will produce a new version of the model, better adapted to the next quarter-century, or whether the whole system will buckle under the strain of reform and end by producing in Germany a version of the Anglo-American model of capitalism, with its adversarial politics, and its red-in-tooth-and-claw economics. If the government and the companies have their way, the outcome is more likely to be a renewed, more flexible model. If the opponents of reform block real change, they risk the entire system unravelling.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?831164400,iss">Search</a>

<p><b>Rural development</b></p>
<h1>The best of both worlds</h1>

<font size=1>INVERNESS</font>


<p>A PERENNIAL problem for Britain's rural economies is the steady exodus of talented young people, lured away not just by the excitement of big cities, but also to city-based higher education as a route to high-earning jobs. This brain drain has meant that any idea of having something as swanky as a university in a remote area to try and reverse the tide has looked hopelessly over-ambitious.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, planners at Highlands and Islands Enterprise (<font size=-1>HIE</font>), Britain's most northerly economic-development agency, think that technology now makes just such a dream possible. For the past four years, <font size=-1>HIE</font> and academics at a dozen small further education colleges scattered across the region--which is bigger than Belgium but has only 370,000 people living in it--have been working on a plan to set up a University of the Highlands and Islands.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They think that the colleges can be linked electronically to allow interactive learning within a multi-campus university. This idea goes a step further than the distance teaching offered by institutions such as the Open University. For example, students in Stornoway or Elgin could take part in two-way television tutorials given by a professor 250 miles (400km) away in the Shetland Isles.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The government agrees that this is worth pursuing. Michael Forsyth, the Scottish secretary, recently announced that the colleges, which currently have 2,700 students between them, can start expanding to reach the 4,000 students needed to qualify for university status. In due course, the colleges might attract the public cash and academic talent needed to establish a university granting full degrees. The additional students need not be exclusively highlanders; lowlanders keen to escape cities, to study topics such as rural development in a rural setting, might also be interested.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The venture will be expensive. But <font size=-1>HIE</font> officials have been given nods and winks about getting lottery money for half of the &#163;76m cost of building halls of residence and teaching facilities. The rest will come from central and local government, the European Union and private sources.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some of the outlay will have to be spent on information technology but, as it happens, much of the communications network has been built already. In 1989 <font size=-1>HIE</font> persuaded the government to let it give British Telecom &#163;4.9m towards the &#163;20m cost of installing <font size=-1>ISDN</font> (integrated systems digital network) telephone exchanges and fibre-optic cables in the region. This has not only made establishing such a university possible, it has also attracted firms to the region to take advantage of the new communications links, providing jobs for future local graduates.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One such firm is Hoskyns, a computer-services company with 3,800 employees in Britain. It opened an office in Forres, near Inverness, in 1994. It now has a staff of 50 with jobs such as pursuing parking-fine defaulters in four London boroughs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The telecommunications network also means that local people have become attuned to the possibilities offered by information technology. These include training provided by community teleworking centres, which also do desktop publishing of news-sheets and local histories. Small computer-software firms have sprung up. One of these, <font size=-1>QDATA</font> of Evanton, has produced software enabling a tutor to teach pupils at 16 different locations simultaneously, by means of video. The region's police force has used the system to train village constables.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These developments have already enabled the Highlands and Islands to attract some new jobs despite its reputation as a remote backwater. For example, Selfcare, an American medical-supplies firm, decided last year after looking at a number of sites in Britain and Ireland to set up a factory in Inverness. It will employ 375 people making medical-testing kits. The Highlands' hills and glens remain as tranquil as ever. But now it seems that tranquillity and employment, or even ambition, are entirely compatible.

<h1>The xenophobic tendency</h1>
<p><b>Britons tend to think of immigration as a drain on the state. The evidence suggests that the opposite is true</b></p>


<p>"THANK God we are Saxons!" trumpeted <i>The Economist </i>in 1843. "Flanked by the savage Celt on the one side and the flighty Gaul on the other--the one a slave to his passions, the other a victim to the theories of the hour." The moist-eyed writer was deeply grateful to belong to such a sensible race.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He would have looked askance at his successors, 150 years on. A random selection from the editorial staff of this newspaper produces an English-Ukrainian, an English-Croatian, an English-Russian, two Scottish-Welsh-German mixes distilled in colonial Africa, a pure-blooded German and, the prize exhibit, a Welsh-Armenian. All are British citizens.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Comparing themselves with America, Britons tend to think they are a rooted, homogeneous lot. Yet the last millennium is a story of ethnic mixing, as the surnames in the telephone directory of any large town show.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Leave aside post-war immigration from the Caribbean and the Indian subcontinent: Saxon blood was spiced with variety long before then. The Danes ran much of eastern England from the 9th to the 11th century; then the Normans took over. Italian merchants swarmed into London in medieval times. The Dutch came to East Anglia, and informed the architectural style that still dominates the area. Huguenots fled France in the late 17th century. At that time, Bermondsey, one of the Cockneyest bits of London, was known as "Petty Burgundy".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Over the years, Sephardic Jews came from Spain and the Netherlands; at the end of the last century, Ashkenazi Jews fled pogroms in Russia and Eastern Europe. In 1880, there were reckoned to be 60,000 Jews in Britain; over the next couple of decades, another 200,000 arrived. Then came the 20th century, and communism, and fascism, and the movement of millions of refugees across Europe. (Among them were the East European parents of Michael Howard, the flag-waving home secretary, who would never had got in had their son's policies been in operation.) Then came post-war economic growth, and workers from the Commonwealth. Then came the laws to stop it all.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Marks and Spencer, Unilever, <font size=-1>GEC</font>, Tesco, Courtaulds: immigrants have made their mark in all sectors, and dominated some. Cloth and clothing, for instance, is a much-traded business, so tends to be international; and sewing, the sort of badly paid work available to immigrants, is a skill as useful in one country as in another.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So the Dutch ran the wool trade in East Anglia in medieval times; the Huguenots set up the silk business in the 17th century; and 19th-century Jewish immigrants set themselves up as tailors and shoemakers. In the mid-20th century, as imports pushed prices down, industrialists imported Pakistani and Bangladeshi labour in order to squeeze costs. As each wave of immigrants moved on and up, its place was taken by a new one; and the old Huguenot church in Fournier Street in the East End of London became a synagogue, and is now a mosque.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Finance is similarly linked with trade, and therefore with foreigners. And because finance is important to Britain, so are the immigrant banking families.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Until they were expelled in 1290, Jewish immigrants from Spain ran British finance. Italians then got into the business: the Lombards left a street in the City named after them. As finance expanded, they came from everywhere: Barings from the Netherlands, Cazenoves from France, Hambros from Denmark, Rothschilds, Warburgs and Kleinworts from Germany. The pattern has changed only in the past decade or so, when foreigners streamed into the City via corporate takeovers rather than starting their own firms.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But beyond listing the names of brilliant and successful immigrants, is it possible to measure their contribution to the economy? Immigration should raise <font size=-1>GDP</font> and lower wages by increasing the supply of available workers. But its effect will depend crucially on the immigrants' characteristics.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many countries--Australia, Canada and Germany, for instance--carry out studies over time of cohorts of immigrants, looking at what they do, and how successful they are in comparison with the rest of the population. The British government does not; so the information about immigrants in Britain is patchy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;According to a Home Office study of 263 people who had been granted, or had applied for, asylum, such people tend to be disproportionately professional and skilled. Some 30% had been professionals in their home country, 10% had been managers or employers, and only 5% had been unskilled. According to an analysis of the 1990 Labour Force Survey, some 25% of foreign residents--which would include people intending to leave as well as people trying to settle--are in professional or managerial jobs, or are employing other people, compared with 22% of British citizens.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Recent immigrants tend more often to be self-employed than British-born people (16% compared with 12%). Their children tend to stay in education longer than do the children of British-born parents. Refugees tend to be particularly well-educated. The Home Office study found that nearly half had some sort of higher or further education; over a third had a degree, compared with 12% of British adults.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One country's immigration, in other words, is another country's brain drain. Many of the 52,040 foreign-born doctors, dentists and nurses (23% of health-service employees) working in Britain in 1994 represented a loss of human capital to other countries, some of whose governments paid for their training.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But, for a systematic analysis of the economic effects of immigration, one has to look abroad. Stymied by the lack of data about Britain, the London-based Institute of Public Policy Research commissioned work on those migrating to Germany. The studies looked at the period 1988-92, when 4.2m immigrants entered Germany, mostly from Eastern Europe and the former Soviet Union. The bulk of the immigrants were aged between 20 and 45. They were more mobile than locals, being willing to move around the country in search of employment. Within the first six months, 82% of immigrants from the former Soviet Union had found jobs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The immigrants did not appear to take jobs from the locals, which is what opponents of immigration most fear. This may have been because the economy was anyway very buoyant, or because the immigration itself generated a boom--nevertheless, the number of unemployed per vacancy, including both immigrants and natives, fell from 12 in 1988 to 5.6 in 1992. As the economy slowed down in 1992, so did the number of immigrants.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Researchers from the Rheinisch-Westf&auml;lisches Institut in Essen found that the new immigrants contributed around DM32 billion ($21 billion) in taxes and national insurance payments. Set against that are around DM18 billion received in unemployment benefit, family allowances and aid to help them integrate.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, immigrants also had an indirect impact. More people meant a greater burden on public services and infrastructure. And because they were disproportionately young, with young children, they put a special burden on schools: the average number of pupils per teacher increased by two over the period, to 19. On the other hand, being young, immigrants used the health services less frequently than the average German.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Looking at their macroeconomic impact, the study estimates that they raised the annual <font size=-1>GDP</font> growth rate by around one and a half percentage points a year, to 3.5% per year. Since their presence meant downward pressure on wages, employers are reckoned to have got a larger slice of this extra wealth than employees.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Taking into account the additional tax revenues generated by the extra economic growth, the researchers reckon that, overall, the immigrants contributed something in the region of DM14 billion a year to government finances. That positive result, they maintain, comes about largely because the immigrants represented a large inflow of human capital for which Germany had not had to pay.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although both theory and practice argue that immigration is good for economies, people do not seem to see it like that. Instead, a gut belief that "they'll take our jobs," or "they'll sponge off the state," prevails. Liberals often find it hard to combat this fear, which is inextricably intertwined with racism. Moreover, it is a belief that has endured through huge social changes.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A report to the commission set up by King James I on immigration echoes precisely the combined modern fears of the effect of technology and immigration on the job market. It complained of foreigners using machines "for working of tape, lace, ribbin and such, wherein one man doth more amonge them than 7 Englische men can doe; so as this cheape sale of theire commodities beggareth all our Englishe artificers of that trade and enricheth them."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Economic hard times sharpen these fears. One of the first recorded bouts of anti-foreigner rioting happened in a slump in 1456-57, against the Genoese, Venetians and Lombards in London who, according to a petition by the rioters, brought in "great numbers and multitude of aliens and strangers of divers nations" instead of employing native English.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Industrialisation and growth in the 19th century brought the opposite attitude. Pre-existing controls were abandoned, and people allowed to move freely in and out of the country. As Ann Dummett and Andrew Nichol say in "Strangers, Citizens, Aliens and Others" (Weidenfeld and Nicolson), an excellent study of British immigration policy over the years, "Victorian <i>laisser-faire </i>entry policies expressed <i>laisser-faire </i>economic theory as well as political liberalism."<p>
<b>The squeeze starts</b><br>
When the gate shut, it shut hard. At the end of the 19th century, economic conditions tightened and so did immigration policies. The Aliens Act of 1905 allowed immigrants to be expelled from the country if they were poor, vagrant, or convicted of any felony. In the four years after the act's implementation, 1,378 people were deported.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There were few protests. In a parliamentary debate on a follow-up act in 1914, Colonel Josiah Wedgwood, a lonely voice, said "We have not seen such a unanimous spirit of persecution since the time of the Popish Plot in 1678...Why cannot we follow the policies of our ancestors of assimilating this foreign element and teaching it that England is something worth living for?"
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the 1930s, economic worries combined with anti-Semitism and fear at the scale of the potential exodus from Germany. After Hitler annexed Austria, Britain introduced a visa system to restrict immigration further. Colonel Wedgwood opposed the idea, again with little support. The <i>Daily Mail</i>, which can boast consistency, if nothing else, in its attitude, argued that "to be ruled by the misguided sentimentalism of those who think with Colonel Wedgwood would be disastrous...once it was known that Britain offered sanctuary to all who cared to come, the floodgates would be opened."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Economic growth after the second world war led to the rules being loosened once more. Employers like the National Health Service and London Transport went fishing for workers in Commonwealth countries.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Immigrants have tended to be allowed in when the economy does well; the economy does well when immigrants have been allowed in. Very likely the causality goes both ways, though it is difficult to argue this case to voters convinced that immigrants are going to do nothing but take their jobs and claim their benefits. Such fears, and the restrictions that go with them, are understandable if irrational. But the odd thing about immigration policy in recent years is that, even during the periods of rude economic health, the government has tightened, rather than loosened, controls.<p>
<b>Women and children last</b><br>
Over the past 25 years, a stack of laws has transformed Britain from a country that welcomed people to one that it is virtually impossible to get into. The Immigration Act of 1971 stopped primary immigration; the British Nationality Act of 1981 abolished common citizenship, creating three different varieties, the least of which, British Overseas Citizenship, conferred no right to go or to live anywhere. Then a clutch of laws over the past five years, ending with this year's Asylum and Immigration bill, makes squeezing into Britain exceptionally tough (see <a href="brsf1.gif">chart</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The end of primary immigration left three principal ways of entering Britain: as the member of a family of a British national, as a refugee and on a work or business permit. All of those routes have closed further over the past few years.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Changing the rules to keep out the families of the workers who had previously been welcomed does not always show Britain at its best. For instance, many of the young women who had come from the West Indies in the 1960s had left their children behind. Once they were established in Britain, they tried to bring them in. So the government changed the rules to say that, if the mother had "sole responsibility" for the child (if it had been left in an orphanage, in other words) then she could import it. If she had not (if it had been living with its grandparents, for instance) she could not. So those women had to choose between their children and their livelihood.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Until recently, spouses could enter Britain relatively easily. That is no longer true. Immigration officers have at their disposal the "primary purpose" rule, by which the applicant is required to prove that coming to Britain was not the primary purpose of the marriage. Unless officials are satisfied of this, they must reject an application, even if they believe that there is a genuine relationship between the couple. Critics complain that this discretion is used to discriminate racially. American spouses are almost never ejected, while African and Asian ones (including the Thai and Filipino wives that desperate Englishmen buy through the post) are often thrown out.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Meanwhile, getting asylum in Britain has become harder and harder. Since 1988, airlines have been fined &#163;2,000 per person plus costs for each person they let on board without a proper visa. So if your government is trying to kill or imprison you, don't board a plane for London unless all your papers are in order (which, of course, might be difficult to arrange without being killed or imprisoned).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Be sure, too, not to change planes on your way to Britain: you may fall foul of the 1993 Asylum and Immigration Appeals Act, which invalidates your claim to asylum if you put your foot down on the soil of a third country <i>en route. </i>There are well-meaning Tories who think this has gone too far: they were responsible for defeating part of the new Immigration and Asylum bill, which will introduce further restrictions, in the House of Lords on April 23rd.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The work-permit regime has also been tightened. "Things snapped shut in the early 1990s," according to Elspeth Guild, an immigration specialist with the law firm Baileys, Shaw and Gillett.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Until quite recently, Britain welcomed some types of people who are now being shut out. Doctors, for instance, coming in for post-graduate training used to be permitted to settle. Now they have to leave after four years even though Britain has a shortage of doctors.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps the best illustration of the British attitude to foreign talent lies in its treatment of entertainers and sportsmen. Footballers, actors and musicians are the sort of people that make a country fun to live in and proud of itself. Nevertheless, Britain's immigration service is acutely aware that there are many British footballers, actors and musicians who may not be quite so good as the foreigners and would be out of a job if there were too much high-class foreign competition.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Accordingly, entertainers who want to work in Britain are subject to procedures and rules even tighter than those applied to other professions (except chefs: Britain is determinedly protective of its gastronomic reputation). If the entertainer squeezes past the objections of the relevant union--the protectionist Musicians' Union, for instance, or the actors' union, Equity--he must abide by a complex set of rules. Thanks to a big fuss in the press, Ilie Dumitrescu, a Rumanian football player, just escaped deportation: his offence was to attempt to transfer from Spurs to West Ham without having played in 75% of first-team matches for Spurs, which had originally imported him.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Jon Bon Jovi, a pop star, got caught out when a Department of Employment official heard on the radio that he was planning to co-host a radio programme. The vigilant official knew that the terms of his work permit allowed him only to perform, not to act as a disc jockey. A department spokesman confirmed this: "Someone with a work permit to be an entertainer cannot suddenly become a broadcaster." So Mr Bon Jovi went on the programme but kept his hands off the knobs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Worse than such absurdities is the Home Office's refusal to countenance the idea of talented people who want to come to live in Britain. The fact that somebody is brilliant does not gain them admission. Excellence, apparently, is not something that Britain values. It prefers to protect mediocrity than to face the challenge that talented foreigners might pose.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?831164400,iss">Search</a>

<p><b>Japanese semiconductors</b></p>
<h1>Flat as a pancake</h1>

<font size=1>TOKYO</font>
<p>THIS is a nervous time for semiconductor firms. The industry's most watched barometer, America's book-to-bill ratio for semiconductors (the monthly value of new orders divided by sales) was a balmy 1.12 at the end of 1995; it is now 0.8, its lowest level since 1985. Dataquest, a consultancy, recently cut its forecast for world chip growth this year to 7.6%, down from 37% in 1995. At the same time, new semiconductor factories are springing up around Asia faster than noodle shops.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is particularly bad news for Toshiba, Fujitsu, <font size=-1>NEC</font>, Hitachi and Mitsubishi Electric, the five big Japanese firms that make around 40% of the world's chips. They are being squeezed from two sides. American firms, notably Intel, possess better technology. And other Asian producers, notably in South Korea and Taiwan, can make commodity chips more cheaply.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Japanese firms concentrate on memory chips, over 60% of which end up in personal computers. But growth in worldwide <font size=-1>PC</font> sales has dropped from 42% in 1994 to 25% in 1995, and forecasters expect it to be under 20% this year. Short of cash, computer firms have slashed orders for new components and dumped excess memory chips on the spot market. In the past nine months the price of a standard 4-megabit <font size=-1>DRAM</font> (dynamic random-access memory) has more than halved, from around $13 to below $6. Even the newer 16-megabit <font size=-1>DRAM</font> has seen its price tumble by a third to below $20.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To make matters worse, Japan's semiconductor firms together spent a record &#165;855 billion ($8.1 billion) on new fabrication facilities (" fabs" ) in 1995, a whopping 62% increase over the previous year. Although all five of Japan's big semiconductor firms swear that they have no intention of slashing their capital spending (indeed, Hitachi, Mitsubishi Electric and <font size=-1>NEC</font> have just announced plans to build new plants and refurbish old ones), they will not increase it much either. Naoko Ito, an analyst in Tokyo with Goldman Sachs, an American investment bank, reckons that spending on new fabs in Japan will rise by a mere 3% this year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Merely cutting back production will not, however, solve Japan's long-term chip-making woes. Lower-cost manufacturers in South Korea have begun to crank up their own <font size=-1>DRAM</font> capacity. Samsung Electronics of South Korea is already the world's largest producer of memory chips, having overtaken <font size=-1>NEC</font> in 1993. Between them, South Korea's big three chip makers (Samsung, Hyundai and <font size=-1>LG</font> Electronics) supplied more than 10% of the global semiconductor market in 1995. Analysts expect them to have doubled that share by 2000. By then, South Korea will probably have become the world's biggest producer of <font size=-1>DRAM</font>s; and Samsung may have $20 billion of semiconductor sales.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The softening of demand for chips has coincided with a tricky switch to a new generation of memory chips. Both the Japanese and their rivals are shutting their 4-megabit production lines and ramping up their capacity for 16-megabit <font size=-1>DRAM</font>s. The Japanese makers claim that their products will be better, pointing to their swifter introduction of the latest memory design, needed to keep up with Intel's racy new Pentium microprocessors. But Samsung, Hyundai and <font size=-1>LG</font> Electronics are hustling their own speedy new <font size=-1>DRAM</font>s into production, too.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In order to acquire some edge, ten of Japan's biggest electronics firms have put &#165;500m apiece into a co-operative venture. This consortium, Advanced Semiconductor Technologies, will try to make chips on 12-inch wafers of silicon instead of the present 8-inch ones. With more than twice the surface area on which to etch batches of chips, a chip-making factory could, in theory, work twice as fast, significantly reducing the price of each <font size=-1>DRAM</font>. The trouble is that, even if the Japanese firms can find a successful way to squeeze more chips on to a wafer, it will not be long before the South Koreans learn to copy them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If Japan fell behind in semiconductors, that could have consequences that extend far beyond the chip industry. It is likely to have a big impact on the consumer-electronics industry as a whole. On the face of it, this industry is robust in Japan. Last year, the five big electrical groups turned in &#165;990 billion of pre-tax profits between them--nearly 50% up on the previous year. But these earnings depended disproportionately on profit from chips.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although Toshiba's product range stretches all the way from laptops to nuclear reactors, it probably earns 80% of its consolidated operating profit from microchips. Toshiba's competitors are not far behind (see <a href="wb1.gif">chart</a>). This year, in spite of the end of Japan's recession, the chip makers will be lucky to wring out an increase of 10% in earnings.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That will increase the pressure on the most broadly diversified firms to sort out their far-flung portfolios. Hitachi and Toshiba, for instance, might be forced to give up making toasters and fridges on the back of subsidies from chip making. The days when Japanese firms could count on using their semiconductor factories to bankroll their unprofitable businesses may be drawing to an end.

<p><b>Optical computing</b></p>
<h1>Correlation is now causation</h1>

<p>THE idea of using light, rather than electrons, to do the number crunching in a computer has been around for a long time. But the advantages (speed, and a lack of electrical interference between the signals in the machine) have been outweighed by the disadvantages (light is cussed stuff that will not easily bow to the disciplines needed to make it do sums). After three decades of research, however, a form of optical computing should make it to the market-place this year. <font size=-1>OCA</font> Applied Optics, of Garden Grove, California, has developed the first light-based processor that can be plugged into a personal computer. The processor is called an optical correlator.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Correlators are specialised devices designed to find "targets"--from car parts to cancer cells--inside "scenes" presented to them. They work by converting images of both the targets and the scenes into mathematical expressions known as Fourier transforms. A Fourier transform is a coded version of an image that shows the thickness, spacing and direction of every line in that image in a consistent way. The consistency and simplicity of Fourier transformation allows a computer to compare images easily and, usually, accurately.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately, reaching this consistent, simple point can involve a long mathematical grind. In electronically based correlators the Fourier transformation is done by numerical analysis. First, the images to be compared are digitised. Each is defined as a series of pixels (picture elements), with a specific position and brightness, that can be represented by a set of numbers. Next, the computer has to perform a huge number of separate calculations, relating every pixel in an image to every other pixel. This can be time-consuming, especially if the image is big.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The advantage of an optical correlator is that the processing is done by the basic physics of the system, rather than a lot of electronic shuffling. A lens can be made to produce a Fourier transform of an image directly. This is done by shining what is known as "collimated" light (ie, a beam of parallel rays, in this case a laser beam) through an image of the scene made up of liquid crystals. When the collimated beam is then focused by a lens, the result is a pattern the composition and brightnesses of whose elements corresponds to the mathematical terms of the Fourier transform.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is an interesting step backwards. An optical correlator is, in effect, an analogue computer, rather than a digital one (though the results of its computations are then digitised for transmission to its host <font size=-1>PC</font>). By missing out the step-by-step processing that digital computing requires (and also by working at the speed of light), it arrives at its result very rapidly.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For Jean-Baptiste Richon, managing director of Optical Flow Systems in Edinburgh, switching from digital processing could mean a thousand-fold increase in machine productivity. Mr Richon's work involves tracking the position of liquid and gas particles to determine the direction and speed of their flow. The system has to be able to recognise, or correlate, individual particles from one frame of video to another. This is a process that can take a traditional correlator up to two minutes, even on a specially souped-up <font size=-1>PC</font> with a Pentium chip.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Up to now, the alternative would have been to buy a huge, custom-built optical correlator, which would have cost around $100,000. But <font size=-1>OCA</font>'s correlator (which works at 1,000 correlations per second), takes advantage of new electro-optic components, such as tiny lasers, fast liquid-crystal displays and high-resolution detectors. It costs around $10,000 and is squeezed into a package only slightly bigger than an audio cassette. Using it, Mr Richon calculates that he could process a frame's worth of information in about one-sixteenth of a second. This would allow him to monitor fluid flows more or less in real time.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But optical processing is not for everyone. Roy Davies, professor of machine vision at Royal Holloway College, London, doubts that the new correlator will have more than a niche market. He reckons it is unnecessarily powerful. Industrial inspection, for instance, normally uses targets with either 3x3 or 7x7 pixels. All that is necessary to tell if a part is faulty is a single abnormal pixel--the details do not matter.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Because these pixel grids are so small, the processing can easily be performed electronically, while the rest of the computer tries to make sense of the results. Dr Davies says that the process of making sense uses up far more computing power than the correlations themselves. <font size=-1>OCA</font>'s device may work fast, he says, but it is probably not cost-effective unless the unit price drops below $1,000.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are, however, many applications that require a good deal of detail. Stuart Schoenmann, one of the directors of <font size=-1>OCA</font>, claims that potential customers want to scrutinise a range of things from circuit boards and flat-panel displays to mammograms and <font size=-1>DNA</font>. Security applications--recognising unique body-features such as faces--look especially promising. At the moment Hamamatsu Corporation, in Japan, uses an optical correlator of its own manufacture to identify fingerprints. The company's designers are now interested in replacing their system with <font size=-1>OCA</font>'s. They reckon that combining the new correlator with Hamamatsu's holographic memories could create a formidable computing combination. There may yet be a chink of light in the armour of electronics.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?831164400,iss">Search</a>

<h1><center>How safe is your bank?</center></h1>

<p>
BANKING is boring--except to its practitioners, and except when it goes wrong. Most people remember vaguely that a banking crisis helped tip the world into the Great Depression of the 1930s, with all its horrifying consequences for the second half of the century. But most people also assume that banking is nowadays under control, with the danger of failures, panics and runs abolished by careful regulation and the widespread system of deposit insurance. This assumption is, alas, wrong. If anything, the world's banking system may be becoming even more dangerous than it used to be, and the need for a thorough reform even more urgent.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There has as yet been no other "systemic" collapse on the scale of the 1930s. But failures, panics and runs continue to haunt the world's banks. They are common in the developing world, but not confined to it. It is, after all, not even a decade since rescuing their mortgage-lending "thrifts" cost America's taxpayers a decidedly unboring $150 billion. In Japan, the fate of seven ailing mortgage lenders has put a cloud over the country's banks--and the cost of rescuing the lenders has become one of the central issues in Japan's politics. A systemic collapse, though maybe less likely than in the recent past, is by no means impossible. And if one did occur, its consequences, both for the world's financial systems and the broader economy, are liable to be bigger.
</p><p><b>Risky business</b>
<br>Why? One reason is that banks are taking greater risks than they used to. Having lost ground in their traditional business of taking deposits (many savers now prefer a mutual fund) and lending at interest (most big firms now go straight to the capital markets), they earn a larger proportion of their income from the volatile trading business. At the same time, they are becoming bigger. This month alone has seen the formation of two vast new banking groups. In Japan, Mitsubishi Bank and Bank of Tokyo joined forces to become the world's biggest bank, with &#165;75 trillion ($700 billion) of assets. On the same day Chase Manhattan and Chemical Bank sealed America's biggest-ever banking marriage.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In principle, bigger banks might be safer ones. With more capital, they should be better able to withstand financial shocks, and more willing to splash out on sophisticated risk-management systems. But neither size nor systems guarantee that banks will kick their habit of messing things up from time to time. Barings claimed to have a state-of-the-art system for managing risk. Nonetheless, this venerable British merchant bank was eviscerated last year by the unhedged bets of a single trader. Although Japan contains nine of the world's ten biggest banks, its government has had to maintain confidence by promising that none of its top banks will be allowed to fail.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Barings was at least small enough for the Bank of England to stand aside and let it sink. It is doubtful whether banking regulators could confidently do the same with any of the new megabanks. It is at least possible that these would be considered "too big to fail". Governments would rightly wonder whether the abrupt felling of any one of them might pose a general threat to the financial system, either by triggering a domino-like run on other banks, or by causing a sudden loss of liquidity in national payments systems. The potential damage that such a disaster could cause has risen dramatically in recent years, as banks' exposure to one another has soared (see <a href="http://www.economist.com/surveys/banking/">our survey</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although governments have not been supine in the face of this danger, they have fallen into a trap. Their cumulative efforts to avert trouble have had the perverse effect of adding significantly to the risk. This is because, in most countries, governments have tried to eliminate runs by insuring their citizens' bank deposits, whether directly or by arranging in advance for sick banks to be rescued. Mostly, this has brought stability. But it has also created a vast moral hazard: a bank that is in trouble, but which knows that there is some form of public safety net slung underneath it, is more likely to take a reckless last gamble with its depositors' cash.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To solve this problem, countries have relied on regulation. But some regulators are now at last admitting in public that it is increasingly hard for them to keep a close eye on banks whose activities reach far beyond conventional deposit-taking and lending, and which operate globally. To make matters worse, regulators can no longer count on the "Three Musketeers" principle to help them deal with ailing banks. When banking was essentially a cartelised business, bankers were often willing to help support sick rivals as a<i> quid pro quo </i>for protection. But this "one for all and all for one" ethos is being undermined by stiffer competition. These days, it is every bank for itself.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What is to be done? Regulators in America and elsewhere are putting less emphasis on rule-making and more on encouraging banks to buttress their internal controls. Laudable though this effort is, it will not solve the underlying problem: how to let more banks fail without triggering a systemic crisis.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To enable this to happen, governments need to think again about the bargain they have struck with the banks. In return for the safety net (and for the implicit subsidy it entails), they have insisted on close regulation of what the banks do. This solution, inadequate already because of the moral hazard it creates, makes no sense in a system of banking that has become too complex for the regulators to manage. It is time to take seriously the case for a far-reaching reform.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One idea, talked about for years but never adopted, is "narrow banking". This would restrict deposit insurance to tightly supervised banks that would be allowed to invest only in safe, highly liquid assets, such as government bonds. Most of what is today considered "banking", including lending, would be left to other, uninsured financial institutions.
</p><p><b>Next year's model?</b>
<br>The beauty of narrow banking is that it would continue to provide a haven for small savers and those who prize safety above all else, while allowing the more adventurous to take a punt on riskier firms. In return for giving up their safety net, these "broad" firms could be regulated far more lightly and so would find it easier to compete with securities houses and other non-bank rivals. No longer would the fate of Aunt Agatha's $1,000 deposit dictate what, say, Chase could do in the capital markets.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Narrow banking has its critics. One danger is that the new regime would have instabilities of its own. When the sun is shining, would not depositors pile into the "broad" institutions to profit from their higher returns, only to scamper abruptly to safety the moment the economy turned down? In that case, the broad institutions might collapse like ninepins, and governments might need to bail them out anyway. And might the system damage the real economy by making it more expensive for small and middling firms to borrow?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Neither objection is compelling. The first can be dealt with by preventing broad banks from offering deposits redeemable on demand, as narrow banks would. Deposits at broad institutions could have relatively lengthy maturities, giving the institutions time to prepare for outflows. They would also almost certainly have far more capital than today's banks, and plenty of lines of credit that could be called on in an emergency. As for the cost of lending to small businesses, this would rise, but probably not by much. After all, unsubsidised finance companies already lend to such firms at rates that compete with those of banks.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Switching to narrow banking would be a dramatic and far-reaching change. It would shrink the banking system and redefine the very idea of a bank. That is why governments have so far preferred the ever-worsening muddle of insure-and-regulate. Is it too much to hope that, on this occasion, they will have the sense to fix the roof before the storm breaks?

<h2>Italy goes left</h2>
<p>(See <a href="wtw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>For the first time since the second world war, the left, with a backbone of reformed communists, is set to form a government in Italy, after winning the general election. <b>Romano Prodi</b>, an economics professor who heads the centre-left Olive Tree coalition, is near-certain to be prime minister; his views on fiscal rectitude helped the lira to strengthen. A right-wing alliance headed by Silvio Berlusconi, a media tycoon, and Gianfranco Fini, leader of the post-fascists, will form the main opposition.
<p>The rebel leader of Chechnya, <b>Jokar Dudaev</b>, who had been fighting for independence from Russia, was killed, probably in a Russian rocket attack. The war continued with unabated intensity, despite a ceasefire and peace proposal announced by Boris Yeltsin last month.</p>
<p>Turkey's Welfare Party, a pro-Islamic group which won December's general election but failed to form a government, won a parliamentary vote to launch an investigation into the personal finances of <b>Tansu Ciller</b>, who was prime minister until last month. The new prime minister, Mesut Yilmaz, who heads a coalition with Mrs Ciller's party, did not tell his party to vote against the proposal.</p>
<p>Talks between Chancellor Helmut Kohl, unions and employers to try to reach an agreement on reforming <b>Germany's welfare system </b>broke down. The government, intent on cutting public spending, wanted cuts in sick pay and job protection, proposals the unions firmly rejected.</p>
<h2>No let-up</h2>
<p><b>Lebanon</b> continued for a second week to be pounded by Israel from air, land and sea. Hizbullah continued to fire rockets into northern Israel. Warren Christopher shuttled between Jerusalem and Damascus, with a side-trip to Beirut, in his search for the ceasefire formula to bring Operation Grapes of Wrath to an end.</p>
<p>The<b> Palestine National Council</b> (the <font size=-1>PLO</font>'s parliament) convened in Gaza to revoke the clauses in its charter that deny Israel's right to exist.</p>
<p>Saudi Arabia's interior minister warned Britain that "a friend does not harm a friend" , feeding British fears that it would lose<b> Saudi trade</b> because of the decision not to deport Muhammad Massari, a Saudi dissident.</p>
<p>An American delegation arrived in Monrovia, the capital of <b>Liberia</b>, to try to secure a peace agreement during the current truce. The Americans promised $30m to help pay for a West African peacekeeping force.</p>
<p>Commonwealth countries threatened limited measures against <b>Nigeria </b>if its ruler, General Sani Abacha, refused to meet a delegation to discuss human rights. General Abacha sacked Ibrahim Dasuki as sultan of Sokoto, a position of spiritual leadership, and replaced several senior military officers.</p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<h2>Politicking</h2>
<p>The White House and Congressional Republicans cobbled together a <b>budget deal</b> for 1996. Negotiators agreed to add almost $5 billion for education, police and job training--President Clinton's chief priorities--and to find the money from other programmes.</p>
<p>A Harris poll showed Mr Clinton leading Mr Dole in the <b>presidential race </b>by 20 percentage points.</p>
<p>The Senate passed a bill allowing <b>health-care coverage </b>to be transferred from one job to another. This seemed as close as Congress was willing to get towards comprehensive health-care reform.</p>
<p><b>Bernhard Goetz</b>, who shot and paralysed a black youth on the New York subway in 1984 when he feared he was about to be robbed, was ordered to pay the victim $43m in damages.</p>
<p>A sale of items owned by <b>Jacqueline Kennedy Onassis</b> reached more than $11m in its first two days in New York. Meanwhile it was announced that the tools used by <b>Jeffrey Dahmer</b>, a serial killer, to dismember his victims would be auctioned to raise money for the victims' families.</p>
<p><b>Paraguay</b>'s President Juan Carlos Wasmosy sacked the country's army commander, General Lino Oviedo, who refused to go. Neighbouring countries and the United States suspended military aid. Mr Oviedo then went--to be defence minister.</p>
<p>Having floated its currency, <b>Venezuela</b> reached agreement--in principle--with the <font size=-1>IMF</font> for a $1.4 billion stand-by. The World Bank and <font size=-1>IDB</font> will help, making a total package of over $3 billion.</p>
<p>The <b>Brazilian</b> government said it would speed up land reform after the April 17th killing of some 20 landless demonstrators by police in the Amazon state of Para.</p>
<h2>Cult fear</h2>
<p>The trial began in Japan of <b>Shoko Asahara</b>, a cult leader accused of a gas attack on the Tokyo metro which killed 11 people and damaged the country's reputation as a safe society. Mr Asahara refused to plead either guilty or not guilty. The security arrangements included 18 helicopters hovering over the court.</p>
<p><b>Pol Pot</b>, the former leader of Cambodia, is ill, according to King Norodom Sihanouk. His death would be a good thing, the king said, and would probably mean the end of the Khmer Rouge guerrilla movement.</p>
<p>In a move to resettle 36,000 Vietnamese <b>boat people </b>still in camps in South-East Asia, the United States said it would take those who had ties with America. But they would have to return to Vietnam to apply.</p>

<h2>Wedding Bells</h2>
<p>(See <a href="wtw2.gif">chart</a>)<br>In the second coupling of Baby Bells since America deregulated its telecoms market earlier this year, <b>Bell Atlantic</b> and <b>Nynex</b> announced a "merger of equals". With a combined market value of $50 billion, the enlarged Bell Atlantic will cover the Atlantic seaboard from Maine to Virginia, taking in New York and Washington, <font size=-1>DC</font>. It will be America's largest telecoms operator after <font size=-1>AT&T</font>.</p>
<p>In a $4 billion share swap, <b>Cisco Systems</b>, a leading maker of Internet data-networking equipment, agreed to acquire <b>Strata</b><b>Com</b>, a marriage that will allow Cisco to provide networking switches for data, voice and video communications across public and private computer networks.</p>
<p><b>Eurotunnel</b>, the debt-laden operator of the Channel tunnel, declared a loss of &#163;925m ($1.5 billion) for its first full year. But revenues amounted to &#163;299m, with a promise of a 50% increase this year. Having suspended interest payments on more than &#163;8 billion-worth of debt last September, Eurotunnel said it hoped to reach a new agreement with its creditor banks by the summer.</p>
<p>America's <b>Digital Equipment</b> continued a remarkable recovery from near-bankruptcy. Results in the computer maker's third quarter showed a 68% jump in net profits to $124m, its sixth straight quarter of profits after running up $5 billion in losses in 1991-94.</p>
<p>Struggling after its recent takeover of another entertainment colossus, Capital Cities/<font size=-1>ABC</font>, <b>Walt Disney </b>declared a net loss of $25m in the second quarter after a $316m profit a year ago. Even after one-off charges, revenue was down as a result of lower sales of its films and videos. Its share price fell.</p>
<p>There was better news for <b>Euro Disney</b>, whose parent is Walt Disney. Its losses in the first half narrowed to FFr169m ($34m) from FFr241m a year earlier. The group predicted a big increase in revenues in the second half, its busier period.</p>
<p>A year after Canada's Seagram bought the giant <b>MCA</b> entertainment group, it found a big name for the big Hollywood job. It appointed Frank Biondi, recently fired as head of Viacom, another big media outfit, as <font size=-1>MCA</font>'s chief executive.</p>
<p><b>Conrad Black</b>'s Hollinger International is taking full control of the Telegraph group, which publishes the <i>Daily Telegraph</i>, Britain's top-selling broadsheet newspaper, and the <i>Sunday Telegraph</i>. It agreed to pay around &#163;300m ($454m) for the 36% it does not already own.</p>
<p><b>PepsiCo </b>pulled out of a joint venture in Myanmar (Burma), where it has 85% of the soft-drinks market, after pressure from American human-rights groups. It sold its 40% stake for an undisclosed sum to its partner, which can produce Pepsi products for another five years yet.</p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<h2>Annulled</h2>
<p>(See <a href="wtw3.gif">chart</a>)<br>The British government overruled the recommendation of its monopolies commission and blocked two controversial mergers that would have brought more vertical integration to the <b>electricity</b> industry. PowerGen's bid for</p>
<p>Midlands Electricity and National Power's for Southern Electric cannot now go ahead.</p>
<p>The European Commission blocked a bid by South Africa's Gencor and Britain's Lonrho to merge their <b>platinum</b> operations. The commission said the move would have left two companies in control of the world's platinum production. The other company is South Africa's Anglo American.</p>
<h2>In clover</h2>
<p>Japan's largest securities house, <b>Nomura</b>, recorded its biggest annual profit in five years. It made &#165;91.5 billion ($949m) in the year to end-March compared with &#165;6.8 billion in the previous year.</p>
<p>Salomon, parent of the <b>Salomon Brothers </b>investment bank, said net profits more than trebled in the first quarter, to $276m.</p>
<p>Mexico announced plans for an innovative deal in which it will exchange $2.5 billion of its <b>Brady bonds</b>, which are backed by American Treasury bonds, for debt which has no such collateral. If this swap succeeds, it would mark another important step in Mexico's return to relative financial respectability.</p>
<p><b>Swiss Bank Corporation </b>moved to strengthen its operations outside Switzerland. It has bought Standard Chartered's international private-banking operations with assets under management of $5 billion, mainly in South-East Asia, and a $1 billion private-client portfolio from America's Chase Manhattan Private Bank.</p>
<h2>Joy ride</h2>
<p>Group net profits at <b>Volkswagen</b> grew ninefold in the first quarter, to DM116m ($79m), as sales rose 15% and costs were contained. But the German car manufacturer, Europe's biggest, still reckoned full-year profits would be modest.</p>
<p><b>Fiat</b> plans to halve investment spending over the next five years but will continue to introduce three new car models a year, a strategy that has helped it gain market share.</p>
<p><p>First-quarter net profits at America's biggest car maker, <b>General Motors</b>, fell to $1.02 billion compared with $2.10 billion a year earlier. Some $900m of the fall was due to last month's 17-day strike.</p>

<p><b>Constitutional reform</b></p>
<h1>Gordian knots</h1>
<p>
TONY BLAIR may have thought that he had picked an easy target. Surveying the Labour Party's ambitious plans for constitutional reform in a speech earlier this year, he highlighted the party's promise to remove hereditary peers from the House of Lords. After all, who could defend the old duffers, there only "because 300 years ago their ancestor was the mistress of a monarch"? In fact, as a new report makes clear, reform of the House of Lords, far from being an easy target, is more likely to prove a can of ermined worms.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On April 25th, the Constitution Unit, a collection of academics, former civil servants and politicians backed by a group of charities, published its first two reports, on the reform of the Lords, and on how to deliver constitutional reforms in general (&#163;10 each from The Constitution Unit, 4 Tavistock Place, London <font size=-1>WC1H</font> <font size=-1>9RA</font>). Future reports on devolution, human rights, referendums, relations with Europe and other constitutional issues are due to be published later this year. The reports are meant to spell out in detail how reforms might be implemented, not just to bleat about their desirability.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first two reports are admirably lucid expositions of the options and obstacles facing reformers. Although the Constitution Unit is non-partisan, and its advisory committee includes members from all three main parties, its work seems squarely aimed at Labour, which not only promises wide-ranging constitutional change, like the Liberal Democrats, but also looks set to be in a position to fulfil such pledges as the next government.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Both reports make it clear that the task facing Labour is daunting. Even if voters are as favourably disposed towards change as they tell pollsters, overtly changing Britain's constitutional arrangements is going to be fraught with pitfalls. The basic problem of changing a system of government even while operating it faces reformers in any established democracy. But in Britain this problem is made far worse by the fact that there is no written constitution, and so no agreed and explicit mechanisms for amending it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The most easily achieved constitutional reforms in Britain have been surreptitious, or gradual, such as the Tories' reduction in local-government powers in the 1980s. Explicit reforms announced as "constitutional" have always proved enormously time-consuming and controversial and, like Labour's devolution proposals of the 1970s, have often failed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Constitution Unit's report on reforming the House of Lords makes clear the complexities of even so simple a change as ushering out the anachronism of hereditary peers. Mr Blair's plan is to kick them out (except a few hardworking ones, who would be reappointed), and then to leave the House of Lords largely intact until a plan for an elected second chamber can be agreed, probably years later in a second Labour term. Of course the danger is that the move to an elected chamber may never happen. In any case, an all-appointed chamber would exist for some time. This prospect has already been dismissed by both the Lib Dems and the Tories as an "ermine-clad quango" . It does seem an awkward outcome to defend, even as a supposedly interim measure, for a party which has waged such a fierce campaign against the proliferation of appointed quangos under the Tories.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even if Labour does achieve an appointee-only House of Lords, how will appointments be made? Will appointment be an honour, or a job? What will the party balance be? (Even without hereditary peers the Tories still have the most seats, though not a majority.) The report floats the intriguing idea that the main parties could agree to let the government of the day have a simple majority of one, or the largest contingent of peers. But reaching such an agreement would not be easy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Equally significant, changing the Lords' composition is likely to change its behaviour. The report rightly points out that an appointed chamber, shorn of hereditary peers, might well feel more legitimate, and so might exercise its limited powers more aggressively, frustrating the government and enraging the House of Commons. And the move to an appointed chamber will spark an immediate debate about the next step: the move to an elected chamber. How will peers be elected? For what term? What will be the role and powers of any new elected upper house? Will the devolved assemblies which Labour has promised Scotland, Wales and the English regions have a role in a new, elected chamber? Is rivalry between the Commons and a newly fashioned upper house a virtue, or to be avoided at all costs?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So far Labour is only just beginning to tackle such questions. Most other big constitutional issues, simple in principle, will prove just as complex and contentious in practice. If Mr Blair is serious about his party's sweeping and ambitious reform agenda, he had better get to grips with the detail soon.

<h1>A new kind of quangocrat</h1>
<p>THE old school tie, already tattered, is about to be thoroughly shredded. On April 23rd, Sir Leonard Peach, the first commissioner for public appointments, published a new code of practice for 8,300 ministerial appointments to executive quangos, ranging from the London Docklands Development Corporation to the Wine Standards Board of the Vintners' Company. The code, which will come into force on July 1st, marks the beginning of the end of the patronage state.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In future, such appointments are to be made on merit. All will be subject to scrutiny by non-partisan panels. The appointments process will be made transparent, with jobs widely advertised. Those active politically will not be barred from appointment, but their political allegiance will become a matter of public record. Appointments will be audited for Sir Leonard. Anyone who feels ill-treated will be able to appeal to him, and his annual report will publicly chastise backsliders.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The new code, like Sir Leonard's appointment, stems from Lord Nolan's report on standards in public life. That followed growing public alarm that the Tories were bending the system to reward their friends. Sir Leonard's code will discourage ministers from using the system to bolster their political favourites, or to advance those they trust to implement their policies without question.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A public-spirited man from a private-sector background, Sir Leonard admits that the new system may need to be extended in the light of experience. Though it includes the high-paying quangos, it excludes the 10,000 members of purely advisory bodies, and a further 22,000 appointments to tribunals. And the ultimate power of appointment remains with ministers, rather than being transferred to independent commissioners.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the biggest question mark against the exercise may arise if there is a change of government. Labour officially supports Sir Leonard. Indeed, some Labour people would have liked him to go further, making it compulsory for appointees to disclose any large political donations they have made. Unofficially, though, some shadow-cabinet members sing a different tune. For 17 years, they say, the Tories have been stuffing quangos with second-rate businessmen. To redress the balance, they would like to do some stuffing of their own. But they can achieve that result without resorting to corrupt practices, by expanding the criteria of merit, so that wider public-service values as well as business values count.

<p><b>Transport policy</b></p>
<h1>Kerb-crawling</h1>


<p>ANYONE who wonders why the government has failed to produce a transport policy document for 17 years has only to read the green (ie, consultative) paper published on April 25th to discover the answer. Paralysis in policy-making, caused by an ideological obsession with the motor car and a terror of unpopular measures to restrain traffic, is the culprit. The resulting legacy of worsening congestion on the roads and under-used, under-invested public transport has now become too obvious to ignore.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The fact that the government felt compelled, after so many years of silence, to publish a green paper is a sign that the political sands are beginning to shift. Nevertheless with a general election looming, Sir George Young, the greenest transport secretary since Labour's Barbara Castle in the 1960s, has not been able to push his colleagues into saying much.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sir George had two big ideas. He wanted to create road corporations as the first step to privatising most main roads, and he wanted to overhaul vehicle taxation. Both ideas, eminently sensible, were shot down by cabinet colleagues as far too dangerous. Instead ministers have fallen back on the time-worn and largely ineffective formula of giving more powers to local authorities to plan and restrain traffic in their areas.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The green paper endorses the switch in spending from new roads to public transport, foreshadowed in the last budget. But it offers no clear answer to the question of how congestion from growing car usage can be tackled.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The paper rejects the idea of setting targets, which was advocated by a Royal Commission on Environmental Pollution 18 months ago. That report called for a trebling in the use of public transport and in the amount of freight carried by rail by 2020. "Our view is that you have got to have a consensus on measures to restrain traffic before setting targets," explains one transport department official. The commission's demand for a doubling in the real price of petrol and diesel fuels by the year 2000 to stabilise carbon dioxide emissions is studiously ignored. Ironically, the commission's call for a halving of expenditure on motorways and new trunk roads is already being delivered by default, thanks to public-expenditure cuts.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Leaving difficult decisions to local councils has its attractions in the run-up to an election. It may even result in a few interesting traffic-control experiments. But no amount of local decision-making can substitute for a clear national policy on how to deal with road traffic which is forecast to double by 2025.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The green paper avoids committing the government even to such an obvious measure as changing the system of company-car taxation which rewards drivers for driving more. Four out of five cars coming into London in the hours of peak congestion are company-owned cars. Most of their drivers enjoy free parking at their place of work, a benefit which will remain untaxed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The failure to address such arguments is excused at Westminster on the grounds that changes to car taxation and traffic restraint are political poison. But a study of public attitudes, published as an annexe to the green paper, found that three-quarters of those questioned accepted that additional measures for controlling traffic growth were urgently needed. An earlier study found that 54% of respondents would accept being unable to drive in town or city centres in order to reduce environmental damage.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Transport issues are also heading up the political agenda. A <font size=-1>MORI</font> poll last year found that 12% of people said transport policies were important in determining how they would vote at a general election. Asked which party had the better policies, a paltry 5% said the Conservatives. A whopping 61% backed Labour's transport policies, apparently unaware that Labour, like the government, has so far offered little in the way of new policies.

<p><b>Telecoms mergers</b></p>
<h1>And this is competition?</h1>

<font size=1>NEW YORK</font><p><b>The merger between Nynex and Bell Atlantic makes sense for the two firms concerned; regulators may beg to differ</b></p>

<p>LESS than three years ago Ray Smith, chairman and chief executive of Bell Atlantic, unveiled what was billed as "the Multimedia Deal of the Century": the merger of his regional telecoms group (or "Baby Bell") with Tele-Communications Inc (<font size=-1>TCI</font>), America's biggest cable operator, to create a new company worth about $60 billion. Four months later the deal was dead, killed in part by what Mr Smith called "the unsettled regulatory climate".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now, in the wake of a telecoms bill that has deregulated America's telephone market, Mr Smith is trying again, amidst a second flurry of superlatives. On April 22nd he unveiled "the Telecoms Deal of the Century": a merger with Nynex, another Baby Bell, to create the country's second-largest telecoms group, with a market value of $50 billion. But regulators may yet again leave Mr Smith on hold.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The deal, says Mr Smith, is "a merger of equals in every sense" . Each Baby Bell serves 13m customers in adjacent regions that, together, include 13 north-eastern and mid-Atlantic states, plus the District of Columbia. Last year each company generated $13.4 billion in revenues. And the pair are already engaged: two years ago they merged their cellular operations. Nynex, however, is the weaker firm. In the first quarter its operating-profit margin stood at 21.4%, compared with Bell Atlantic's 25.2%. Nynex's long-term debt is $9.1 billion; its new partner's is $6.2 billion. And Bell Atlantic has almost twice as much cash.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bickering over Nynex's value--its share price has been inflated by months of rumours--came close to scuppering the deal, just as squabbling over <font size=-1>TCI</font>'s valuation helped end Bell Atlantic's previous engagement. In the end, the merger values Nynex at a small discount to its market price, leaving Bell Atlantic shareholders with 56% of the new firm (which will also be known as Bell Atlantic). The question of who will run the group--another factor in the failure of the <font size=-1>TCI</font> deal--was settled more easily. A year after the merger is finalised, Ivan Seidenberg, Nynex's boss, will succeed Mr Smith as chief executive of the new firm. He will then take over from Mr Smith as chairman when the latter retires.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The union of Bell Atlantic and Nynex comes only three weeks after Pacific Telesis and <font size=-1>SBC</font> Communications, another two of America's seven (now five) Baby Bells, announced a merger that will create a $45 billion telecoms giant. Driving both deals is the appealing profitability of long-distance telephony. Each year, some $20 billion of long-distance calls originate in the two regions covered by Bell Atlantic and Nynex--and much of the profit from these is pocketed by <font size=-1>AT&T</font>, <font size=-1>MCI</font> and Sprint, America's three big long-distance carriers. Because 45% of those calls both start and finish on its territory, however, the new Bell Atlantic could carry them from end to end, instead of passing part of each call--and its profit--to the long-distance carriers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Around a third of America's international calls are made from the new Bell Atlantic's turf. This could be particularly valuable if, like <font size=-1>AT&T</font>, <font size=-1>MCI</font> and Sprint, the new company links up with an overseas telecoms firm. A global alliance would make sense. The new Bell Atlantic already has extensive overseas interests, especially in Europe and Asia, and gradual global telecoms deregulation should make these increasingly lucrative. Economies of scale will also boost the new firm's competitiveness. The merger will save $600m a year in operating expenses (helped by a 2.3% cut in the group's combined workforce, to 130,000) and up to $300m annually in capital spending.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All this assumes that the merger is consummated. The whole point of the telecoms bill was to open up markets and foster competition. Mr Smith says these two aims will be promoted by the merger, because the new Bell Atlantic will be better able to compete with the likes of <font size=-1>AT&T</font>. This sidesteps a key objection. Because Bell Atlantic and Nynex operate in adjacent territories, they could easily have competed for each other's local calls.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By merging, however, each has eliminated its biggest potential local rival, a strategy that will hardly help consumers, as the Federal Communications Commission (<font size=-1>FCC</font>) has noted. The merger between PacTel and <font size=-1>SBC</font>, by contrast, is less likely to hurt local competition. With their home territories several states apart, they were unlikely to have invaded each other's regions.
<p><b>Jingled Bells
</b><br>The <font size=-1>FCC</font> and the Justice Department may yet accept Mr Smith's line that a merger between Bell Atlantic and Nynex is still in the public interest because of its positive effect on long-distance competition--an argument he backs up by noting that <font size=-1>AT&T</font> and <font size=-1>MCI</font> have already lodged their protests with Washington. (Sprint, however, has kept quiet: presumably because, on April 23rd, Nynex signed a deal to resell Sprint's long-distance services in six states outside the Baby Bell's home territory.)
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Mr Smith will have a tougher time with the numerous state and district regulators that have to approve the deal, and which have already been flooded with protests by consumer groups. Only one state has to turn nasty--and New York's regulators, as Nynex will testify, have a reputation for toughness--to kill the deal.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Had they bided their time, Bell Atlantic and Nynex might only have had federal regulators to worry about. On April 19th the <font size=-1>FCC</font> said it was mulling over the idea of establishing explicit national rules to govern competition in regional telephone markets. These would effectively circumvent the whims of state regulators--a move that might ease the passage of complex multi-state mergers such as that between Bell Atlantic and Nynex. Whether the Baby Bells' deal would actually comply with the <font size=-1>FCC</font>'s proposed rules--which will stress the need for more, rather than fewer, regional competitors--is another matter.

<h1>Free-mail</h1>
<p>AS THE morning post too often demonstrates, direct-mail advertising is a sloppy business. Without much knowledge of people's likes and dislikes, advertisers resort to the shotgun approach. They send out lots of letters, hoping that some are opened, and maybe even a few read and responded to. It is grossly inefficient: the letters cost a fortune to send, waste time, and consume a lot of trees.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The main problems have been that it is hard to find an audience, to work out who is in it, and to discover what they like. Yet on the Internet, people willingly reveal such details all the time as the price of admission to useful sites.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now Juno Online, a New York company in which D.E. Shaw, an investment bank, has a $20m stake, has found a way to put the two worlds together. It is offering free e-mail access to anybody in America with a personal computer and modem. In exchange, subscribers part with their demographic details--and put up with advertisements in the corner of their computer screens.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So far Juno, which launched its e-mail service on April 22nd, has attracted 15 advertisers, including Snapple, a soft-drinks company, and Lands' End, a clothing retailer. For them, the advantages are manifold. They can use advertising like direct mail, to deliver a specific message to, say, nobody but tennis-playing women in their 30s.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Because subscribers know that they will receive advertising anyway, they have a strong interest in describing themselves to Juno as accurately as possible. Unlike direct mail, which may go unopened and unread, advertising on Juno is paid for only when the recipient gets it. And there is a cost saving: Juno, and FreeMark Communications, which launches a rival free e-mail service on May 6th, both reckon they will be around eight times cheaper than direct mail, while offering advertising that consumers are more likely to respond to.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But why should consumers agree to part with their intimate details and a corner of their screens? Juno and FreeMark argue that the simplicity of their software will attract technophobes. Both companies, unlike employers, schools and universities, are offering people the same e-mail address for life. Josh Bernoff, a consultant with Forrester Research in Boston, thinks that millions of households may want e-mail only, rather than the Internet's complex delights.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Both firms know that success will depend on signing up plenty of users quickly. FreeMark, for example, has arranged to distribute its software to Citibank's west-coast clients and will offer free sports reports by e-mail. However, without several hundred thousand customers logging on fairly soon, no advertiser will stay for long.</td></tr></table>

<h1>McCurrencies: where's the beef?</h1>
<p><b>How seriously should you take the Big Mac index?</b></p>

<img src="fn1.gif" width=453 height=707 align="left"><p><br>TEN years on, <i>The Economist</i>'s Big Mac index is still going strong. Mad-cow disease notwithstanding, it is time to dish up our annual feast of burgernomics. The Big Mac index was devised as a light-hearted guide to whether currencies are at their "correct" level. It is not intended to be a predictor of exchange-rates, but a tool to make economic theory more digestible.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Burgernomics is based upon the theory of purchasing-power parity (<font size=-1>PPP</font>). This argues that, in the long run, the exchange rate between two currencies should move towards the rate that would equalise the prices of an identical basket of goods and services in the two countries. Our basket is a McDonald's Big Mac, which is made to roughly the same recipe in more than 80 countries. The Big Mac <font size=-1>PPP</font> is the exchange rate that would make a burger cost the same in America as it does abroad. Comparing this with the actual rate is one test of whether a currency is undervalued or overvalued.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first column of the table shows the local-currency prices of a Big Mac; the second converts them into dollars. The average price in America (including sales tax) is $2.36. However, bargain hunters should head for China, where a burger costs only $1.15. At the other extreme, the Swiss price of $4.80 is enough to make Big Mac fans choke on their all-beef patties. This implies that the yuan is once again the most undervalued currency, and the Swiss franc the most overvalued.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The third column shows Big Mac <font size=-1>PPP</font>s. For example, if you divide the Japanese price of a <i>Biggu Makku</i> by the American one, you get a dollar <font size=-1>PPP</font> of &#165;122. The actual rate on April 22nd was &#165;107, implying that the yen was 14% overvalued against the dollar. Similar sums show that the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark is overvalued by 37%. In general, the dollar is undervalued against the currencies of most big industrial economies, but overvalued against developing countries' ones.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thanks partly to the dollar's recovery, the other rich-country currencies look less overvalued than a year ago. Adjustment to <font size=-1>PPP</font> can also come from changes in relative prices rather than exchange-rate movements. The most dramatic example of this is Japan, where the price of a Big Mac was slashed by more than a quarter late last year. This reduced the yen's overvaluation from 100% to 14%.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Big Mac index was originally introduced as a bit of fun. Yet it has inspired several serious studies over the past year. Li Lian Ong, an economist at the University of Western Australia, wrote her <font size=-1>P</font>h<font size=-1>D</font> thesis on the index.*<font size=1>1</font> She concludes that "the Big Mac index is surprisingly accurate in tracking exchange rates over the longer term." Another study, by Robert Cumby of Georgetown University in Washington, <font size=-1>DC</font>, also found that deviations from "McParity" are usually temporary.*<font size=1>2</font><br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But a third study, by Michael Pakko and Patricia Pollard of the Federal Reserve Bank of St Louis, is more sceptical.*<font size=1>3</font> It concludes that "the Big Mac does as well--or as poorly--at demonstrating the principles and pitfalls of <font size=-1>PPP</font> as more sophisticated measures." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Their study concludes that although Big Mac <font size=-1>PPP</font> may hold in the very long run, currencies can deviate from it for lengthy periods. There are several reasons why the Big Mac index may be flawed:
<font size=-1><li></font>The theory of <font size=-1>PPP</font> falsely assumes that there are no barriers to trade. High prices in Europe, Japan and South Korea partly reflect high tariffs on beef. Differences in transport costs also act as a trade barrier: shipping perishable ingredients such as lettuce and beef is dear.
<font size=-1><li></font>Prices are distorted by taxes. High rates of value-added tax in countries such as Denmark and Sweden exaggerate the degree to which their currencies are overvalued.
<font size=-1><li></font>The Big Mac is not just a basket of commodities: its price must cover rents and the cost of other non-traded inputs. Deviations of <font size=-1>PPP</font> may simply reflect differences in such costs.
<font size=-1><li></font>Profit margins vary among countries according to the strength of competition. In the United States, the Big Mac has many close substitutes, but in other countries McDonald's is able to charge a premium.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite these weaknesses, which <i>The Economist</i> has long acknowledged, the Big Mac index still comes up with <font size=-1>PPP</font> estimates that are similar to those based on more sophisticated methods. Burgernomics has its methodological flaws, but our money is where our mouths are.<p><font size=-1>*<font size=1>1</font> ``Burgernomics: The Economics of the Big Mac Standard''. University of Western Australia, November 1995. <p>*<font size=1>2</font> ``Forecasting Exchange Rates and Relative Prices With the Hamburger Standard: Is What You Want What You Get With McParity?''.

<h1>Squidgy forever</h1>

<p>IN A veritable lifetime of embarrassments, one of the worst for the Princess of Wales came after eavesdroppers listened in on a conversation with a boyfriend who called her "Squidgy" . They could do this because her mobile telephone used analogue rather than digital technology, and could not therefore be protected by the fancy encryption technology available on digital networks.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In many parts of the world, however, eavesdroppers can listen in even on digital cellphones. This is because the American government will not allow the encryption technology to be exported, for fear that it will protect the privacy of (other countries') spies and drug traffickers. The export ban is part of a long-standing effort to protect America's lead in making and breaking codes. Much of the relevant mathematics is secret.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This ban, a relic of the cold war, nowadays infuriates westerners visiting countries such as Russia to do business. Given the ramshackle local telephones, many such visitors take along their own cellphones. They were not--until America's Commerce Department relented in February--allowed to take along the encryption technology that would prevent Russian gangsters from eavesdropping on their business deals.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Under an amendment to America's International Trafficking in Arms Regulations, the export of encryption technologies is now exempted for personal use. In other words, Americans are now allowed to leave the country with a secure cellphone (and encryption software loaded on their computers), provided they keep it to themselves.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But there is a catch. A secure cellphone is not secure unless it is used on a secure network, and both the United States and the European Union continue to ban the export of the necessary networking equipment. That is why, in March, two American senators introduced separate bills that would allow the unrestricted export of encryption technology, opening the burgeoning communications security market to American companies overseas. Whether the <font size=-1>EU</font> countries, big cellphone exporters, will change their policies accordingly is not clear. Russia's gangsters, and tabloid journalists, are no doubt praying for years of indecision.

<h1><center>Over the top</center></h1>

ISRAEL has the right, and indeed the duty, to protect its people. And it would be excellent for the peace of the region if Shimon Peres, Israel's prime minister, were to win re-election next month. But neither the protection of its citizens in northern Galilee, nor the hope of a comprehensive Middle Eastern peace, justifies the forcible displacement of up to half a million inoffensive Lebanese, and the savaging of their homes and livelihoods. Those consequences were planned. The death of more than 50 refugees sheltering in a <font size=-1>UN</font> base in southern Lebanon, reported as <i>The Economist</i> went to press on April 18th, was merely a foreseeable contingency. It brought the toll of fatalities close to 100. Operation Grapes of Wrath, launched a week ago, requires the ends to justify the means. They do not.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When Israel was surrounded by enemies, convinced that a lost battle would be a last battle, its disproportionate response to Arab acts of aggression was understandable. But those days are long gone. Israel is either at peace with its neighbours, or negotiating peace. Since, as a state, it is no longer in danger, the world should no longer smile when it claims two eyes for an eye.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That said, Israel had a dilemma, as do all countries, in responding effectively to a guerrilla threat. The Hizbullah campaign against Israel's occupation of a slice of south Lebanon had grown fiercer; the guerrillas were killing Israeli soldiers and firing rockets into Israel--though still keeping to the rough tit-for-tat rules worked out after Israel's last pounding of Lebanon in 1993 (see <a href="sf1.html">pages</a>). Mr Peres, facing an election and under attack from the opposition for not being "strong", decided he had to do something.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He had a number of options. With its spies in Lebanon, Israel can pick out Hizbullah chieftains. Yet this has been tried before: Hizbullah leaders have been killed and kidnapped and the guerrillas carried on. Hizbullah positions could be destroyed but, again, the guerrillas' response would be yet another salvo of rockets into Israel. Action that was demonstrably ineffective would do no good to Mr Peres's electoral prospects. If there was to be a reaction, suggested advisers, it should be over-reaction. Mr Peres, wrongly rejecting a more modest, albeit imperfect, response, gave way.
</p><p><b>Trampling out the vintage</b>
<br>The massive bombardment of Lebanon that followed, bombing and shelling targets as far north as Beirut, putting most of southern Lebanon to flight, has not, in fact, silenced the guerrillas: the number of rockets falling on the fields and townships of northern Galilee has increased. But Israelis are delighted, after a prolonged period of morose self-examination, to see somebody--anybody--being punished.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;American diplomacy, which ended the 1993 onslaught, is again taking over. The result could be no more than a refinement of the 1993 rules of engagement. On the other hand, if a grain of good sense enters the argument, the new agreement could point, under clear conditions, to Israel's early withdrawal from Lebanon--a country that Israel insists it has no designs on. This, by removing the guerrillas'<i> raison d'tre</i>, would indeed help.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But these American-led consultations--with Israel, Lebanon and Syria--highlight the true purpose of Grapes of Wrath. Forget the talk of Hizbullah targets. The bombardment was not to hurt Hizbullah, which like most guerrilla bands is pretty invulnerable to such attacks, but to hurt the governments that allow Hizbullah to operate. The creation of a mass refugee problem in Beirut, the bombing of power stations that returned the capital to the black-out of the civil war, the threat to the airport: all this seems to have been designed to frighten away the investors now creating a new Lebanon.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although the Lebanese government itself has no power to curb the guerrillas, it reports to its patron, Syria. And although Syria's President Hafez Assad cares not a jot for Lebanese casualties or Lebanese refugees, he has a big stake in Lebanon's reconstruction through its prime minister, Rafik Hariri. Under pressure, both Syria and Lebanon are likely to listen to America's suggestions, particularly if there is a nod in the direction of taking Syria off the State Department's list of countries that sponsor terrorism.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Hizbullah, which gets its money from far-away Iran, would find it difficult to defy Syria, the master-power on the spot. But it could try. Its boasts about fanatical recruits lining up for paradise through the martyrdom of suicide-bombing may be bluster. On the other hand, they may not. If Hizbullah, which last month sent a suicide-bomber to kill a soldier, decides that this is the route to follow, Mr Peres's bright electoral prospects would, once again, be darkened.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It would be wrong to imply that Mr Peres has been guided entirely by opinion-poll considerations. But if the election had not been pressing on him, the need to show himself a "strong" leader so urgent, he might well have resisted the temptation to turn much of southern Lebanon into a crater. The electoral framework makes the operation particularly cynical: a pounding of people who in no way deserved it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Good may eventually come out of evil. But Israel, at this turning-point in its history, needed to show itself an honest, as well as a strong, neighbour. The punishment of Lebanon reveals that Israel the peace-seeker is still Israel the embattled, punching first and talking afterwards.

<h2>Middle East blitz</h2>
<p>Israel continued its air and artillery bombardment of <b>Lebanon</b>. It killed more than 50 people sheltering at a <font size=-1>UN</font> peacekeepers' base near Tyre. And it struck power stations, Beirut suburbs and a Palestinian refugee camp. Hizbullah continued to fire rockets into northern Israel. The <font size=-1>UN</font> Security Council got nowhere, but the French and American governments embarked on diplomatic initiatives.
<p>Four gunmen--thought to be Islamic extremists--opened fire on <b>tourists </b>outside a hotel near Cairo, killing 18 people and wounding 15.</p>
<p>Fighting continued in <b>Liberia</b>. Charles Taylor's forces attacked an army barracks in the capital, Monrovia, where 10,000 people took refuge, and looting by young fighters continued as food and water in the city ran short. America said it would land 1,500 marines to secure its embassy.</p>
<p>South Africa's <b>Truth</b> <b>and Reconciliation</b> Commission, whose chairman is Archbishop Desmond Tutu, held its first sessions. It will hear the tales both of victims (or relatives who survived them) and of perpetrators of political crime in apartheid days.</p>
<p><b>Cyril Ramaphosa</b>, secretary-general of the African National Congress and once considered a possible successor to President Nelson Mandela, is giving up active politics to go into business.</p>
<h2>Indomitable</h2>
<p><b>Pat Buchanan</b>, Bob Dole's sole remaining challenger in the Republican presidential campaign, said he would not campaign for the Pennsylvania primary but was staying in the race. His sister, Bay, who manages his campaign, said a third-party bid was "very much an open option".</p>
<p>President Clinton vetoed a $13 billion bill that would have obliged America to give more political support to <b>Taiwan</b>. He said it would "restrict presidential authority".</p>
<p><b>Mickey Kantor</b>, formerly the United States trade representative, was appointed commerce secretary to replace Ron Brown, who was killed earlier this month in an air crash in Croatia.</p>
<p><b>Venezuela's</b> President Rafael Caldera joined the rest of 1990s Latin America with a <font size=-1>U</font>-turn on economic policy: petrol prices rose fivefold, exchange controls are to go and interest rates to be freed. As a cushion, some social measures and a 70% public-sector wage increase are promised. Protests were mild; the last such measures, in 1989, left 300 dead.</p>
<p>In <b>Brazil</b>, a Supreme Court judge dealt the government a heavy blow, ordering suspension of work on a bill to reform the welfare system.</p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>The ruling <font size=-1>PRI</font> and two leftish opposition parties reached agreement on electoral reform in <b>Mexico</b>. But the right-wing <font size=-1>PAN</font>, the leading opposition party, stayed aloof.</p>
<h2>America abroad</h2>
<p>Bill Clinton paid a visit to South Korea and Japan. In South Korea, a joint American-South Korean proposal was announced for <b>peace talks</b>, aimed at finally ending the Korean war. They would involve the two Koreas, America and China. In Japan, America agreed to the closure of some of its bases, including a large air base, on the southern island of Okinawa. But other agreements strengthened American-Japanese military co-operation.</p>
<p>In South Korea, the ruling <b>New Korea Party</b>, led by President Kim Young Sam, lost its overall majority in elections to the National Assembly, but avoided the severe setback that opinion polls had predicted.</p>
<p>China struck a conciliatory note in its disputes with South-East Asian countries over rival territorial claims in the <b>South China Sea</b>. The Chinese suggested all sides sign a joint declaration of principles, aimed at maintaining good relations.</p>
<p>A bomb went off in Pakistan at a charitable hospital built by <b>Imran Khan</b>, a former cricket hero. Six people were killed. Mr Khan reiterated his intention to enter politics.</p>
<p>Yozo Yokota, the <font size=-1>UN</font> "special rapporteur" on <b>Myanmar</b> told a <font size=-1>UN</font> committee that forced labour, torture and arbitrary killing were "still widespread" in the country.</p>
<h2>Rebuilding Bosnia</h2>
<p>A conference called to muster aid to rebuild <b>Bosnia</b> raised the $1.8 billion that the World Bank and the <font size=-1>EU</font> want to spend there this year. The Bosnian Serbs did not turn up, because they were told they could come only as part of an all-Bosnia delegation. Many donors said the Bosnian Serbs should receive no aid until they kick out Radovan Karadzic and Ratko Mladic, two of their leaders who have been indicted as alleged war criminals.</p>
<p>Up to 17 candidates may run in <b>Russia</b>'s presidential election in June, the Central Electoral Commission reported. Boris Yeltsin, Gennady Zyuganov, Vladimir Zhirinovsky and Mikhail Gorbachev completed formalities and are assured of places on the ballot. The commission will rule on another 13 candidates by April 26th.</p>
<p>After Franz Fischler, the <font size=-1>EU</font> farm commissioner, said he would willingly eat British beef, John Major accused Britain's partners of imposing a <b>ban on British beef</b> <b>exports</b> for the sake of their own markets rather than on grounds of public health.</p>

<h2>A leap forward</h2>
<p>(See <a href="wtw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>The latest <i>World Economic Outlook</i> from the <font size=-1>IMF</font> predicts continued <b>solid growth</b> for the main industrial economies, albeit at a slower pace than in 1995. On average, <font size=-1>GDP</font> is set to grow by 2.0% in 1996, compared with 2.1% in 1995, before rising again to 2.6% in 1997. The <font size=-1>IMF</font> expects a more robust recovery in Japan. After four years at a virtual standstill, its <font size=-1>GDP</font> is expected to grow by 2.5% in 1996 and 3.1% in 1997.</p>
<p>A fillip for Europe's economies: the <b>Bundesbank</b> cut Germany's discount rate from 3% to 2.5% and its Lombard rate from 5% to 4.5%.</p>
<p>Government shareholders in the <b>European Bank for Reconstruction and Development</b> agreed to double the bank's capital with an injection of 10 billion ecus ($12 billion), the first capital increase and, said shareholders, its last. They also discussed ways of defining "graduation": when ex-communist countries no longer need help. Earliest graduates are likely to include the Czech Republic and Poland.</p>
<p>America's <b>Apple Computer</b> announced a loss of $740m in the firm's second quarter, even bigger than had been expected. There was more mixed news from <b>IBM</b>. Its first-quarter revenues from services rose, but those from hardware were flat. Lou Gerstner, the firm's boss, asserted that <b>IBM</b> was on "the proper course" , but its share price fell.</p>
<p>The European Commission said that it would approve the Uniworld <b>telecoms alliance </b>between <font size=-1>AT&T</font> of America and four European operators only if the American firm allows <font size=-1>EU</font> telecoms companies access to its transatlantic network. The Commission said that <font size=-1>AT&T</font>'s Euro-partners would in turn have to abide by the <font size=-1>EU</font> timetable for telecoms liberalisation.</p>
<p>It was a bad week for shareholder activists. Martin Ebner, who through <font size=-1>BK</font> Vision holds a big stake in <b>Union Bank of Switzerland</b>, failed to block the election of Robert Studer as chairman. In New York, two mutinous shareholders, Bennett LeBow and Carl Icahn, conceded defeat in a long battle to force <b>RJR Nabisco</b> to split apart its food and tobacco interests.</p>
<p>(See <a href="wtw2.gif">chart</a>)<br>Australia's venerable media group, <b>John Fairfax</b>, is ousting its latest chief executive, Bob Mansfield, after only four months, reportedly after clashes with the board and with Fairfax's main shareholder, Conrad Black, who holds a 25% stake. With two other media heavyweights involved--Kerry Packer holds 18%, Rupert Murdoch 5%--and chances of a government relaxation of media cross-ownership rules that will unleash all three, turbulence at Fairfax is likely to continue.</p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p><b>American banks </b>had a strong first quarter. Only Chase Manhattan recorded a net loss after a one-off charge related to its recent merger with Chemical. That aside, its profits soared by 44% over the first quarter of 1995 to $937m.</p>
<p><b>Groupe des Assurances Nationales</b>, a state-owned French insurer, announced net losses of FFr1.8 billion ($360m) last year, compared with losses of FFr5.3 billion in 1994. But the firm predicted that it will be privatised in 1997, when it should be in profit again.</p>
<h2>Gaijin in charge</h2>
<p>A <b>foreigner </b>is to become president of a big Japanese company. America's second-biggest car maker, Ford, is spending &#165;52 billion ($480m) to raise its 25% stake in Mazda to a controlling 33.4%. Henry Wallace, a Ford man who is currently vice-president of Mazda, will become its president.</p>
<p>The plot in Japan's <b>housing-loan scandal</b> took a further twist, with police making their first arrest. Kenichi Sueno, head of a property company called Sueno Kosan, was held on suspicion of making false statements in documents.</p>
<p>An American electricity utility, Southern Company, said it might bid for <b>National Power</b>, one of Britain's two privatised electricity-generating giants, but is waiting to see whether the government will approve more vertical integration in the industry.</p>
<p>Talks between two Baby Bells have reopened. A merger of <b>Bell Atlantic </b>and <b>Nynex</b> would be worth more than $22 billion.</p>
<p>Creditors pushed <b>AIOC</b>, an American commodities trading company which used to be dominant in Russia's huge metals market, into filing for chapter 11 protection after the firm made heavy losses on futures trades.</p>
<p><b>Lonrho</b>, a British conglomerate with plans to demerge its mining interests, gave one of its shareholders, <b>Anglo American</b>, a South African mining giant, an option to raise its stake, prompting speculation Anglo may take control of Lonrho's mining assets after a demerger.</p>
<h2>Silly names!</h2>
<p>The share price of <b>Yahoo!</b> more than trebled in its debut on the Nasdaq stockmarket, valuing the year-old Internet search firm, which has yet to make a profit, at more than $1 billion.</p>
<p><p><b>France T&eacutel&eacutecom</b> is launching an Internet service for consumers called Wanadoo, which will also give access to Minitel, its own on-line service, and will include Youpi!, a French-user-friendly version of the Yahoo! system of searching the Internet. Netscape and Microsoft software will come with the service.</p>

<h1>Two eyes for an eye</h1>

<p><b>Why has violence flared between Israel and Lebanon? What does Israel really want? And what are the chances of a peaceful resolution? These three pages look at the events of the past week, at their immediate and longer-term backgrounds, and at the near future</b></p>


<p>A WEEK into Israel's ferocious bombardment of "Hizbullah targets" in Lebanon, there was no sign that the guerrilla movement had been broken. As thousand upon thousand of Israeli shells and bombs thump down on Lebanon, ancient Katyusha rockets continue to be plonked into Galilee's deserted fields. Operation Grapes of Wrath, a resonant clich&eacute from "The Battle Hymn of the Republic", was launched to protect the Israelis of northern Galilee. It has not, in that respect, been a demonstrable success. Yet it has still been a domestic triumph. And, at the start when casualties were low, it won international sympathy; the reproaches were muted.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Strange that: Lebanon, though not Hizbullah, has been badly hurt, its land once again a battlefield, its people being killed and made homeless. Since the barrage began on April 11th, several hundred thousand Lebanese have been forced to flee their homes, trailing up the single road north, seeking temporary refuge in the streets, schools and mosques of Beirut. Their presence, plus Israel's surgical strikes at two of Beirut's power stations, have plunged the capital back into the disorder it thought it had escaped.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Close to 100 Lebanese, most of them civilians, had been killed in the first week of the bombardment, half of them on April 18th when Israel shelled a <font size=-1>UN</font> peacekeeping base near Tyre where hundreds of Lebanese refugees were sheltering. Earlier in the day, a family of nine, including small children, had been killed in a raid on a village near Nabatiyeh (see <a href="sf1.gif">map</a>). The casualty rate, at first relatively low because of Israel's policy of telling people to get out before it blasted their homes, was rising fast. The number of dead Lebanese civilians, in just a few days, was many times more than the 12 people in northern Israel killed by Hizbullah rockets in the 14 years since Israel invaded Lebanon in 1982.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Israel has struck houses in Beirut, supposedly belonging to Hizbullah but not inhabited by them. Helicopter gunships attacked a Palestinian refugee camp, wounding the small son of a radical commander, the object of the chase. One of the power stations hit was in Lebanon's Christian heartland where no Hizbullah guerrilla would show his face. Its destruction, Israel said, was in revenge for the rocket that broke a single power line in Galilee.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By mid-week diplomacy was stirring. How quickly it would take hold remained doubtful. Shimon Peres, Israel's prime minister, had earlier felt confident enough to tell the residents of northern Israel, escaping from the rockets, that they would soon be back in their homes.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The diplomacy, it was plain from the start, would have to be American. A meeting of the United Nations Security Council, called by Lebanon on April 15th, failed under America's frown to utter even the most circumspect criticism of Israel's action. France's foreign minister, Herv&eacute de Charette, dispatched by President Jacques Chirac on a peace-making mission, was snubbed, on his arrival in Israel, by Mr Peres who said it was too early to talk about peace. He valiantly carried on, visiting Damascus and Beirut before returning to Israel. France is one of the few western countries to have suggested that Israel may have been in the wrong. In contrast, Britain's minister of defence, Michael Portillo, who happened to be visiting Israel at the time, went over the top in Israel's support.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then Warren Christopher, America's secretary of state who was touring East Asia with Bill Clinton, reached for the telephone and the real bargaining began. There seem to be two alternatives. The first is to restore the rules of engagement that Mr Christopher worked out in 1993 in a peace deal after Israel's last big bombardment of Lebanon, though this time the curbs on Hizbullah would be much tighter and those on Israel much looser. The second is more ambitious. The Americans are proposing a plan under which all guerrilla action against Israel would stop, and be guaranteed by Syria not to resume, in return for Israel getting ready to withdraw from its "security zone" in Lebanon. The Arabs will not buy this in its present form; Israel is interested.
</p><p><b>The immediate background</b></b>
<br>Israel is punishing the Lebanese in the name of anti-terrorism. This stretches the term. Certainly, the Hizbullah guerrillas create terror--or at least fear, annoyance and pain--by firing their Katyusha rockets into northern Israel. But confusion has crept into the anti-terrorist argument.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Israel was hit by undisputed terrorism this February and March when, in four separate incidents, suicide-bombers sent by Hamas and Islamic Jihad, which are Palestinian Islamist groups, killed 59 people who had been going about their peaceful business in Israeli cities. In the wave of international outrage that followed--at its height during an anti-terrorism conference in Egypt--the interpretation of "terrorism" came to be spread thick and wide. It became tempting to lump Lebanon's Hizbullah with Palestine's Hamas: both, after all, were enemies of Israel, murky and militant.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;May they both be damned, said Israel's friends. Hamas and Islamic Jihad try to undo the current Israeli-Palestinian peace process by terrorising the Israeli public into an anti-peace mood. Hizbullah (the party of God) was born with Iranian help during Israel's invasion of Lebanon in 1982. It still depends on Iranian money. Its guerrillas, like their Palestinian colleagues, are a fanatic anti-Zionist bunch who have done foul deeds in the past and could do them again. The party does not accept Israel's right to exist and when Lebanon eventually reaches the stage of making peace with Israel, it could, like Hamas, try to destroy that peace.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps. But, on the other hand, Hizbullah's leaders could go in the opposite direction, dropping their guns and pursuing their political ambitions within Lebanon. With the savage civil-war years behind them, they have acquired an active political organisation; their social network of schools and institutions is much wider than Hizbullah's relatively small numbers would suggest. Hizbullah candidates competed in the 1992 elections, winning eight of the 128 seats in parliament. The party might well decide to try to challenge Amal, Lebanon's main Shia Muslim party, for the hearts and minds of Lebanon's 1.2m Shias, the country's biggest single group.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What Hizbullah might or might not do if there were peace is speculation. The facts are that the Hizbullah guerrillas nowadays, a band of a few hundred men, fight Israel's occupation of a slice of southern Lebanon, and their main targets have been Israeli soldiers not Israeli civilians. The party's secretary-general, Sheikh Hassan Nasrallah, defines Hizbullah's anti-Israeli ambitions in limited terms. If he is to be believed, the organisation wants only to drive Israelis out of Lebanon, not into the sea. Syria, with nearly 30,000 troops in Lebanon, is happy to let the guerrillas get on with their campaign. And the Lebanese government itself, however awkward it finds their presence, cannot openly oppose people struggling for the return of Lebanese territory.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Hizbullah is not a straightforward terrorist group. Nor was the sequence of events leading to Israel's attack as simple a routine as terrorism answered by counter-terrorism. There were rules, albeit of a brutish sort, governing the war in southern Lebanon. Three years ago, when a week-long Israeli blasting of the land last made refugees out of several hundred thousand Lebanese, Mr Christopher worked out a truce between Israel on the one hand and Syria and Lebanon on the other, jointly representing Hizbullah. This informal arrangement laid down that it was all right for Hizbullah and the Israeli army to fight each other in Israel's occupation zone, but Hizbullah was not to slam rockets into northern Israel and Israel's soldiers were not to attack Lebanese villages.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The rules were generally observed, although broken from time to time by both sides. Israelis in Galilee could relax, though never completely. But Israeli soldiers found their job increasingly dangerous. At one time Israel's Lebanese military proxy, the South Lebanon Army (<font size=-1>SLA</font>), patrolled the zone. But the <font size=-1>SLA</font>, by now, barely counts as a military force; its demoralised members have their minds fixed on their own uncertain future after an Israeli-Lebanese peace. And Hizbullah, this year, has shown itself increasingly proficient at killing Israeli soldiers. Its intelligence has improved, it uses tricks to draw Israeli units into pursuit and then to ambush them, and, on March 20th, it returned to ancient ways (more recently borrowed by Hamas) by sending a suicide-bomber to kill a soldier.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That may have been the moment when Israel decided the rules would have to be revised. The suicide-bomber opened a vista of military funerals--and Israel has never allowed the death of its conscript soldiers to be an inevitable part of army life. The vicious tit-for-tat killing wound on for a time. The Israelis killed two Lebanese civilians; Hizbullah fired Katyusha rockets into Israel; a Lebanese youngster was killed by an unexplained explosion; Hizbullah fired more rockets injuring several Israeli civilians; another Israeli soldier was killed. Then, on April 11th, Israel struck, making that last Katyusha salvo its justification.
</p><p><b>The long-term explanation</b>
<br>Lebanon is the battleground on which Israel fights its wars, first with the Palestine Liberation Organisation (<font size=-1>PLO</font>), now with Hizbullah. Yet, for the first 20 years or so of Israel's independence, Israelis living near the Lebanese border were the safest of all the frontiersmen. The Lebanese got on with their own affairs; the Israelis, while keeping a wary eye on water resources, had no designs on Lebanese territory.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The event that changed this came in the early 1970s, when Jordan's King Hussein, with Israel breathing down his neck, forced the <font size=-1>PLO</font> out of his country. The <font size=-1>PLO</font> regrouped in Lebanon, taking control of part of the south, creating a state within a state from which it launched attacks on Israel. The border became a war zone.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1978 the Israelis, made bold by their breakthrough with Egypt (and by the havoc of Lebanon's own civil war), invaded southern Lebanon. After three months, and many Lebanese and Palestinian casualties, the Israelis went home but, on the way, ignoring <font size=-1>UN</font> instructions to withdraw completely, they handed over a chunk of the southernmost part of Lebanon to the <font size=-1>SLA</font>, an army that they financed, equipped and controlled. The <font size=-1>PLO</font>, despite this, continued its operations. In 1982, the decision was taken--whether by Israel's prime minister, the late Menahem Begin, or by his defence minister, Ariel Sharon, is still disputed--to send ground troops all the way to Beirut and crush the <font size=-1>PLO</font> once and for all. Lebanon would be freed of Palestinians, and of Syrians too, said the propaganda. And the Israelis could henceforth live at peace, with no <font size=-1>PLO</font> trying to drive them out of the occupied West Bank and Gaza.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It all went terribly wrong. It took Israel three bloody months to seize Beirut. The <font size=-1>PLO</font> and its fighters were indeed driven out of the country but survived to fight--and eventually to make peace--elsewhere. Hizbullah was formed in 1982, inspired by Iranian revolutionaries largely in response to Israel's invasion. At least 12,000 people were killed during that invasion, including 600 Israeli soldiers. Palestinian refugees were massacred in their camps in a Beirut district under Israeli military control. An American-led force tried to stop the fighting but limped home after a suicide-bomber killed 240 marines. Lebanon, when it had eventually fought itself to a standstill, ended up under Syrian control.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When Israel withdrew from Lebanon in 1985, it established, formally if unilaterally, that a "security zone" in the south should remain under its control. This uneven buffer area, about nine miles (14km) wide, amounts to roughly one-twelfth of Lebanon. It does indeed protect northern Israel from armed incursions. But it cannot protect Israeli citizens from rockets that can be fired from outside the zone--and it provides Hizbullah with an excuse, and indeed support, for its continued resistance.
</p><p><b>The politics behind the operation</b></b>
<br>Israel has bad, sour memories from its 1982 invasion and no Israeli politician, if he has any choice at all, would again send ground troops into Lebanon's steely trap. But the current operation, Israelis think, is different. Israeli lives are barely at risk. Unseen foes are being satisfactorily thumped. Months of agonising are done with. Israel is demonstrating, as it so often used to do, that it is not a country to be trifled with. Dissenting voices are rare, dismissed as cranks, who question the value of a "security zone" that is causing so much pain.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Peres, the one-time thinker, is in a new element, a reassuring presence striding about in a battledress. Television footage of the prime minister, who is also defence minister, shows him debriefing helicopter pilots on sandy landing-strips, his grey hair tousled by the draught of the rotor blades. With Israel's election due on May 29th, it is all far more effective than anything the campaign professionals could possibly have contrived. While it would be too much to claim the offensive is a campaign gimmick--Israel, after all, has genuine security worries--the fact is that it has paid electoral dividends.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It puts a sheepish Likud opposition, and its leader Binyamin Netanyahu in particular, in the shade. The Likud had been about to unleash a blitz of media and billboard advertisements centring on the slogan "Defence is too big for Peres". That has now been shelved and the Likud is flailing about for a cogent new line.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Suspicions of Mr Peres's "weakness" have vanished. His campaign slogan, "A strong Israel with Peres", suddenly rings true. Israeli television news, like American television in the Gulf war and sometimes with as little relevance, shows missiles pinpointing targets that then explode. The whole affair is a tremendous electoral bonanza--though one that could go terribly wrong if, for instance, Hizbullah carries out its threat to send suicide recruits behind Israel's lines.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The prime minister and his men have been careful to keep expectations low. Unlike the heady months when the <font size=-1>PLO</font> was to disappear from the face of the earth, there is no talk of "destroying" Hizbullah and no great hopes of disarming it. Ehud Barak, Israel's foreign minister who was army chief in 1993, suggested on television that the operation could be considered a success if it provided Israel's townships with two Katyusha-free years.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But if the Americans do succeed in restoring the rules of engagement that prevailed after 1993, the Israelis are bidding for a much tighter interpretation--at least of the rules that bind Hizbullah. They want a ban, under any circumstances, on rockets fired across the frontier. For themselves, they want the rules relaxed: their gunners, they say, should be permitted to target Katyusha launchers, even if these are in villages. Moreover, they want the right to hot pursuit of Hizbullah units out of the security zone--without such pursuit giving Hizbullah an equivalent right to fire its rockets into Israel.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Likud opposition is demanding even more. Mr Netanyahu says that he wants the infrastructure of Hizbullah in southern Lebanon to be dismantled (whatever that means) and Syria to be "deterred" from allowing the group to reconstruct itself. Two of his top lieutenants, Ariel Sharon and Rafael Eitan, both hawkish veterans of the 1982 war, go much further. They want Israel to expand its security zone to the Litani river (see <a href="sf1.gif">map</a>). This would mean either incorporating another 250,000 unfriendly residents--or forcibly preventing them from returning to their homes when the bombardment stops. Either scenario conjures up in Israeli minds the nightmare of a new Lebanese embroilment. So Mr Netanyahu, an expert in verbal casuistry, has rejected this advice, at least "at this stage".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Peres's government is looking beyond tactical gains on the frontier. After all, as he and his aides reiterate, the bombardment was ordered by leaders committed to a comprehensive peace process: that is, a process that must include both Syria and Lebanon (a lasting peace with Lebanon will not be possible without peace with Syria).
</p><p><b>What next?</b></b>
<br>An odd way to pursue a peace, perhaps. But Israel reckons that, when the punishment comes to an end, Syria may be more amenable about the terms for peace. In Mr Barak's words, "We are showing the Syrians that we are prepared to endanger their years of investment in Lebanon." Apart from Syria's military and political presence in Lebanon, some 1m Syrians are employed in Lebanon's reviving economy--and sustained bombardment is the surest means to scare off investors.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Israel had been encouraged by the initially muted response of most Arab governments. The Tunisians went ahead and opened an Israeli interests office in Tunis. Iran's President Ali Akbar Rafsanjani even telephoned Libya's Colonel Muammar Qaddafi to complain about the feebleness of the reaction to Israel's adventure. Then, on April 18th, came both the shelling of the <font size=-1>UN</font> base and a terrorist outrage that may well be related to the events in Lebanon: Egyptian gunmen killed 18 tourists, most of them Greek, in a Cairo hotel.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lebanon's prime minister, Rafik Hariri, with a big stake in Beirut's reconstruction, is travelling around trying to drum up support. His foreign minister, Faris Bouez, told an emergency meeting of the Arab League that peace depends on an Israeli commitment to leave Lebanon. "When Israel promises, in a way that is definitive, unequivocal and final, to withdraw completely from Lebanese territory," said Mr Bouez, "only then will Lebanon say that this is a safe border."Is Mr Peres listening?

<h1>Wage war</h1>


BRITAIN'S financial markets wobbled on April 17th when new labour-market data revealed an unexpectedly sharp fall in unemployment, down by 25,700 in March, and a rise in average earnings by 3.5% in the year to February. The annual growth of earnings had been stuck at 3.25% since last July. These two surprises coming together prompted fears that the labour market may be starting to tighten, possibly pushing up inflation. The following day's announcement of a surprise 0.5% month-on-month jump in underlying inflation in March, pushing up the annual rate of inflation to 2.9%, did nothing to calm market nerves.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Recent earnings growth has been surprisingly weak. Indeed, as our <a href="br1.gif">chart</a> shows, unusually in the last four years it has lagged behind the growth of (nominal) labour productivity. This has contributed to a sharp decline in the share of wages in British national income, and a rise in the share of profits (a trend mirrored in other industrial economies). Adair Turner, the director-general of the <font size=-1>CBI</font>, has suggested that this switch from labour to capital may have gone far enough. But Douglas McWilliams, an economist at <font size=-1>CEBR</font>, a research firm, reckons the shift has barely begun, and that over the next 25 years the share of wages in national income will fall from today's 68% to less than 45%.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This, he argues, is because British business earns a low rate of return on capital compared with rival economies and will have to raise this sharply if it is to continue to attract capital, let alone achieve the increase in investment he says will be needed early next century. Maybe. But this assumes a perfectly liquid, competitive global capital market. Although the world is moving in that direction, it is doing so very slowly.

<p><b>Northern Ireland</b></p>
<h1>Gerrymander</h1><font size=1>BELFAST</font><p>NORTHERN IRELAND'S strange politics have produced what will be one of history's oddest elections. The rules, which were published on April 16th, are convoluted and illogical, and blatantly manipulate the electoral process. But the rationale behind them is simple: if peace is to be made, the tiny parties which speak for loyalist paramilitaries must be at the table negotiating a peace settlement, though they have never won so much as 1% of the vote.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On May 30th, voters will elect five people in each of Northern Ireland's 18 Westminster constituencies. The ten parties with the highest total vote will then be allowed to choose two delegates each.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The 110 people thus elected and delegated form the pool from which their parties will choose negotiators for the all-party talks. Votes will not determine negotiating strength. Large and small parties will send similar-sized teams. None is to exceed three, with three in support.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The 110 delegates will also be entitled "to discuss issues relevant to promoting dialogue and understanding within Northern Ireland". The forum will be "deliberative only" and will not have the power to influence negotiations.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Or so the draft legislation says. The government wants to pass it by May 3rd, but there will be discordant voices. Unionists who exacted these elections from John Major as the price for sitting down with the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s political voice, Sinn Fein, are not disposed to abandon the idea of an assembly which could debate and approve negotiating positions.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Of course, unless and until the <font size=-1>IRA</font> calls another ceasefire (a prospect which seemed more remote after a bomb went off in west London on April 18th), Sinn Fein is excluded from negotiations. If it contests the election and wins, however, its members are entitled to sit in the forum. But both Sinn Fein and the larger, non-violent nationalist party, the <font size=-1>SDLP</font>, see the forum as no more than a throwback to the bigoted unionist-dominated assemblies of old.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Messing with the electoral process can get you into trouble. The government originally proposed that no more than 15 parties should contest the election. One step ahead of threatened judicial challenges they have now published a list of 30 eligible names. Several, bizarrely, are those of individuals: "Independent Chambers", "Independent Kerr", "Independent McCaffrey". One of these individuals had threatened to go to court if not included.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet the manipulation still may not bring the desired result: those intended to benefit may not make the "top ten". The transcendentalist Natural Law Party, levitating on the votes of those alienated from local politics, may end up negotiating Ulster's future in seats reserved for Loyalist paramilitary frontmen, as may the Green Party. Worse from the government's point of view, Northern Irish Conservatives standing in defiance of the party seem certain to make it. This election looks likely to create more difficulties than it solves.

<p><b>London government</b></p>
<h1>New mayors</h1>

<p>THERE is a strong case that Britain's big local governments should be run by mayors, directly elected by the people, rather than, as now, by leaders who are indirectly elected by local councillors. There is a weaker but not negligible case that London should have an elected authority, responsible for strategic planning and transport, and replacing the old Greater London Council (<font size=-1>GLC</font>) which the government abolished in 1986. However, if you put both these ideas together, as did Tony Blair, the Labour leader, in a speech on April 17th, you end up with a nonsense.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For what is the case for an elected mayor? As embraced not only by Mr Blair, but also by Michael Heseltine, the deputy prime minister, and many local government gurus, it is to create local politicians with the clout of a Rudolph Giuliani in New York, or a Jacques Chirac when he ran Paris. Head-to-head contests between strong candidates would make local elections real, and not just verdicts on the national standing of the political parties. They would also give the winners direct electoral mandates. The nearest London has got to a leader was when the newt-loving Ken Livingstone ran the <font size=-1>GLC</font>, just before its abolition.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately, Mr Blair's London mayor would have a mandate but not much power. His base, the proposed new London authority, would not provide the main services for which local councils are responsible. Real power would lie with the 32 London boroughs, and with non-elected officials of central government.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is a recipe for instability. In the days of the <font size=-1>GLC</font>, which was also less powerful than the boroughs, its leaders were prone to grandstanding. Indeed Mr Livingstone got it abolished by using the council as a political base for socialism rather than for services. Since the new authority proposed by Labour will have even less power than did the <font size=-1>GLC</font>, the new mayor will be sorely tempted to play the same game. He will be driven to spend his time, for example, pestering Whitehall for more money for the capital.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor will his appointment do anything for accountability. As he is visible, Londoners will blame him for the failings of local government. However most of these will really be down to their local councils.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Fortunately, Labour is consulting Londoners before finalising its plans. They should give it a clear message. Yes, we would like an elected mayor, providing that he really is running the city. But no, we do not want an elected mayor if he is not going to do anything for us except to play party politics.

<p><b>Church of England</b></p>
<h1>It's a miracle</h1>


<p>WHEN the Church of England revealed that it had lost &#163;800m in the early 1990s due to lousy property investments, there was uproar from church members, much serious talk of dismantling the costly nationwide parish system, and unholy glee amongst the unwashed masses as they pondered the incompatibility of God and Mammon. So it was a relieved George Carey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, who announced that the church's investments were "bouncing back", up by &#163;300m in 1995 to the second highest level ever (see <a href="br2.gif">chart</a>). Hard decisions taken in 1992 are being proved right, he said. Really?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Church of England was not alone in losing heavily on property in the 1990s. But its results were so much worse than other investors because property comprised a hefty 60% of its portfolio. A typical conservative investment institution, such as a pension fund or insurance company, invested no more than 10-15% in property, often much less. The Church Commissioners, who manage the portfolio, now recognise the absurdity of investing so much in as risky an asset as property, and have cut its share of their portfolio to 36%, with a long-term target of less than 30%. Even that is a high figure, however, which would leave the church badly exposed to any future property crash.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Church Commissioners admit that their portfolio is not ideal for investment performance, but reckon it is the best they can do given their obligations to provide the church with cash. To stump up what is needed, an amount that has soared over the last 20 years, the Church Commissioners have to invest disproportionately in assets such as property which pay out plenty of cash but may produce little capital growth. Government rules stop them selling assets and handing over the proceeds, although they have partly got around this by "coupon stripping"--buying a share just before it pays a dividend then selling it, usually for less, as soon as the dividend is received. This practice, which generated &#163;12m in cash last year, is legal, if hardly in the spirit of the rules.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To ease the pressure on the commissioners to pursue a quirky investment strategy, the church has agreed to reduce the amount of income it expects from them--and required greater giving from pew-fillers to make good the difference. That has helped, but, as the commissioners still feel obliged to allocate a risky 30% of their portfolio to property, clearly not enough. To be sure of avoiding a future property debacle, Mr Carey would have to cut the commissioners' obligations further and send the collection plate round again.

<h1>Something worth watching, at last</h1>

<font size=1>PARIS, BERLIN AND LONDON</font><p><b>Digital television has thrown Europe's media groups into a frenzy. But will it make money?
</b><p>NOT since the days of Metternich has continental Europe seen such a web of conspiratorial, expensive alliances. In both France and Germany rival consortia of media moguls are forming and reforming. The reason: digital broadcasting, hailed by its fans as the short cut to interactive television. Digital broadcasting promises many more channels of television than analogue; it can also provide pay-per-view programmes (such as soccer matches) much more easily and it offers ways of transmitting software such as computer games.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Europe's first full-blown digital offering will be launched on April 27th by France's Canal+. Though Italy's Telepiu has already started digital satellite broadcasting in a modest way, Canal+ is offering a bouquet of 25 channels, including pay-per-view films and sports, thematic channels and an option to download software. In two landmark deals, the company has stitched up the pay-per-view rights to first-division French football and acquired rights to the Disney channel.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To receive the basic service subscribers have to pay FFr98 ($19) a month, plus FFr45 a month to rent the receiving equipment. That is still cheap, compared with FFr136 for the analogue pay-<font size=-1>TV</font> service which offers fewer channels. Bruno Delecour of Canal+ hopes subscribers will spend an average of FFr200 a month, rather than the FFr150 that analogue attracts. He thinks the project will cost at most FFr500m, and expects to break even after three years with 900,000 subscribers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Others mutter that the costs will be far higher. That is more likely if a rival group goes ahead with a plan to offer another digital service in September. The alliance, announced this week by Jacques Chirac's government, is enmeshed in French politics. It includes France T&eacutel&eacutevision, the French public broadcaster, <font size=-1>TF</font>1, the main commercial broadcaster, and Lyonnaise des Eaux, whose president, Jerome Monod, is a big noise in Mr Chirac's Gaullist party. Canal+ is close to France's Socialists. The alliance's most important catch, though, is <font size=-1>CLT</font>, a media group based in Luxembourg.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To many, the deal (still not formally signed) looks mad. Neither <font size=-1>TF</font>1 nor France T&eacutel&eacutevision appears to have the cash to finance such a venture; none of the partners has experience in pay-television, on which digital services will inevitably depend for their main revenue; and none seems to have a clear view of what programming the venture will offer.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, if the deal goes through, it will enrage Havas, a French media group which owns 24% of Canal+, and has a minority stake in <font size=-1>CLT</font>. Relations between Havas and Albert Fr&egravere, the boss of <font size=-1>CLT</font>, are already dire. <font size=-1>CLT</font>'s yearning to launch a digital venture in France and Germany led it into an agreement last August with Rupert Murdoch's <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font>. In early March <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font> abruptly defected to a digital alliance with Bertelsmann, a giant German group--and Canal+. Mr Fr&egravere blames Havas.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But <font size=-1>CLT</font>'s French foray is not just irritating for Havas. At the beginning of April Bertelsmann agreed to merge <font size=-1>UFA</font>, its television and film subsidiary, with <font size=-1>CLT</font>, in a new company in which both groups would have equal shares. "That is not a very good or stable agreement," observes Gilles Fontaine of <font size=-1>IDATE</font>, a French media consultancy. Bertelsmann has for some time had an alliance with Canal+. This week, the Germans were blunt: <font size=-1>CLT</font> must choose between the French venture and <font size=-1>UFA</font>. Given Havas's weak position, the internal wrangling promises to be vicious.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>CLT</font> and Bertelsmann need to stay on good terms because in Germany they are allies in what could be an even fiercer war. Both are members of <font size=-1>MMBG</font>, an alliance that also includes Canal+ and Deutsche Telekom, and which on paper looks immensely strong. Fielded against them is an alliance put together by Leo Kirch, a shadowy Bavarian mogul, including his own Kirch group, Vebacom, the telecoms subsidiary of Veba, a large energy conglomerate, and Metro, Germany's biggest retailer. Crucially, Mr Kirch promises to get a decoder box on the market and up to 50 channels on the air in July. According to one of its shareholders, <font size=-1>MMBG</font> will be launched by Christmas "only if it is really lucky".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Germany, at least, the reasons for rivalry go beyond mere political and corporate pique. Each consortium has members who hope to sell services associated with its box. For instance, since the decoder box can deliver signals to computers as well as to televisions, Vebacom could use it to sell telecoms services. "It could be every house's link with the outside world for encrypted services," claims Vebacom.
<p><b>Give me a reason to pay<br></b>But will viewers really want to shell out, particularly if they have to decide between two competing technologies? In Britain, many viewers shunned (analogue) satellite broadcasting as long as there were two incompatible services; once Mr Murdoch's Sky won and took over its rival <font size=-1>BSB</font>, the service took off. The chances are that the same will happen when it comes to set-top boxes in France and Germany. In Germany the speedy Mr Kirch may have a slight edge. In France it is hard to imagine Canal+ losing. Indeed, it has already offered to carry other broadcasters' signals, at a price they claim is outrageously high.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But even if all digital channels were available on any box, would digital television pay? In Germany, whose viewers are offered more free television than anyone in Europe, the investment is steep. Martin Gruschka of Arthur D. Little, a consultancy, estimates that it costs DM1 billion ($660m) to launch a box, including the costs of developing and marketing, and of setting up a subscriber-management system. Programming costs extra: the Kirch Group is expected to spend up to DM700m to launch <font size=-1>DF</font>1, its digital subsidiary. By 2000, claims the group, it will have 2m subscribers and reach break-even in operating terms.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With lots of public and advertising-financed channels, German viewers have been unenthusiastic about pay television. Premiere, Germany's only pay-<font size=-1>TV</font> channel, launched in 1991, is only now becoming profitable. Klaus Schrape, media analyst at Prognos, a Swiss consultancy, points out that Germans already pay about DM50 a month in cable subscriptions and television tax. Digital's promoters expect them to add DM20-30 a month to rent a box, and an average of DM40 a month for programming. He thinks only 7-8% of households will take digital television by 2000, well short of the 10% at which growth accelerates and unit costs start to fall rapidly. At best, break-even is five years off.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The strategy of <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font>, the world's biggest direct-to-home broadcaster, suggests the case for caution. Sky has already designed an elaborate digital package, which would offer some interactive services and rental capacity for corporate television, as well as showing the familiar mix of thematic channels, films and sport, and pay-per-view. It has booked ample transponder space, and been testing decoder boxes since the beginning of 1995. "If we wanted to launch this autumn, we could definitely do so," says David Chance, <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font>'s deputy managing director.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But unlike its continental partners, <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font> faces no immediate rival. It has therefore decided to wait until 1997 or even 1998. One reason is that the British government is still deciding how to regulate the terms on which other broadcasters have access to Sky's digital system. Another is the hope that the cost of decoder boxes will fall (unlike Canal+, Sky's customers will buy their own). More to the point, Sky's analogue business is still growing at a healthy pace, while Canal+ seems to be nearing a ceiling. So why risk cannibalising it, when nobody else is threatening to do so?

<p><b>Information technology</b></p>
<h1>Tomorrow's network, tomorrow</h1>
<p><b>Asynchronous Transfer Mode switches are the latest mouthful to thrill Silicon Valley. But who will buy them?</b></p>

<p>JEAN-LOUIS GASSEE, who used to run Apple Computer's research labs, has called it "Silicon Valley sophism": the assumption among the wired elite that a new technology will take off "because it would be cool if it did." Examples include virtual reality, personal digital assistants, and practically everything dreamt up at the Media Lab of the Massachusetts Institute of Technology. These innovations thrill boffins but make little impact on consumers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the early 1980s one such flop was a digital-networking technology called <font size=-1>ISDN</font>. Though telephone companies enthused about <font size=-1>ISDN</font>'s use for home videophones (a sure sign of a non-starter, as nearly 40 years of videophone demonstrations have proved), consumers just yawned. Now an even faster networking technology, called Asynchronous Transfer Mode (<font size=-1>ATM</font>), has got the geeks in a lather again.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>ATM</font> is already half a decade old. Its selling point is that it is tailor-made for multimedia. The Internet, plus the various "local" and "wide" area networks (<font size=-1>LAN</font>s and <font size=-1>WAN</font>s) used by companies chop data into "packets" of variable length. By dealing with packets, the network does not need to consider what sort of information is being transmitted; it just mixes all the packets together and pumps them through the network by the fastest route available at any time, allowing software on the receiving side to sort them out again.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nonetheless, packet-switching has its drawbacks. The sorting takes up valuable time; and the irregular nature of the packets creates bursts of frantic motion followed by frozen pauses. That wrecks "real-time" music or video, where the re-ordering process can make the best digital recording sound like short-wave radio.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>ATM</font> solves this problem by breaking the digital information into tiny "cells", or mini-packets, of exactly the same 53-bit size. These uniform cells travel faster and are easier to sort out when they arrive, raising transmission speeds to 155m bits per second, more than 15 times the speed of normal <font size=-1>LAN</font>s, and permitting a network to carry broadcast-quality video and sound.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All this has brought dollar signs into the eyes of the technology's champions. <i>The Red Herring</i>, a Silicon Valley magazine, devoted much of its latest issue to the technology under such headlines as "<font size=-1>ATM</font> changes everything". And the market value of <font size=-1>FORE</font> Systems, a six-year-old company which is the leading supplier of <font size=-1>ATM</font> equipment, has doubled in the past year to more than $2 billion--even though the firm made net profits in the year to March 1995 of only $7.4m on revenues of $76m.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the same time, mainstream makers of networking equipment, such as Cisco Systems, 3Com and Bay Network, have been acquiring <font size=-1>ATM</font> technology rapidly. Small networking firms such as Cascade Communications, StrataCom and Newbridge Networks are jostling with established giants such as <font size=-1>AT&T</font>, <font size=-1>IBM</font> and Fujitsu in the scramble to claim a piece of what they all expect to be a huge market.
</p><p><b>Not so WANderful</b></b>
<br>But does <font size=-1>ATM</font> really change everything? It is undeniably smoother, faster, and, yes, cooler than today's standards. But nearly three years after manufacturers started to produce <font size=-1>ATM</font> switches, sales are still modest: about $270m in 1995, out of a total market for data-networking equipment of about $7 billion. Even by 1998, reckons the Vertical Systems Group, a consultancy in Dedham, Massachusetts, <font size=-1>ATM</font> revenues will be around $1.6 billion, less than those from frame relay, an older and less capable technology that has the advantage of being less trouble to install and use.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unlike the Internet, which uses existing telephone lines, networks and computers, <font size=-1>ATM</font> often requires new cabling and new software, along with network managers who can make it work its magic. A firm that embarks on this course will often need to hire new people, invest in training, and prepare for headaches of various sorts.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That may be worthwhile for big communications companies, whose business is pumping data through wires. Long-distance telephone carriers prize <font size=-1>ATM</font>'s ability to handle voice, video-conferencing and computer data seamlessly. Some of those that carry Internet traffic have already installed <font size=-1>ATM</font> switches on their most congested links. Firms building new networks, such as the cable-<font size=-1>TV</font> companies that are preparing to offer high-speed Internet and other interactive services to the home, are increasingly choosing <font size=-1>ATM</font>, too.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, most of the world's data networks are on internal company <font size=-1>LAN</font>s or <font size=-1>WAN</font>s. (A <font size=-1>LAN</font> tends to be within a single building or campus; a <font size=-1>WAN</font> is made up of the leased lines linking up various <font size=-1>LAN</font>s). This is the domain of hard-nosed systems managers who think more about monthly budgets than multimedia. And since most corporate <font size=-1>PC</font>s do not have sound cards or <font size=-1>CD-ROM</font>s, they could not use <font size=-1>ATM</font> video and audio even if they could get it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the case of <font size=-1>WAN</font>s, moreover, <font size=-1>ATM</font> can sometimes be too fast. The technology generally runs at speeds of at least 51m bits per second, and leasing a telephone line capable of handling this can cost $100,000 a month. That is a lot to pay for a sharper picture in your video-conferences.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the case of <font size=-1>LAN</font>s, the problem is not so much the cost of transmission within a building or campus, but the cost of installation. An <font size=-1>ATM</font> card and switch for a <font size=-1>PC</font> costs around $800, and might not be compatible with the existing software. It costs half as much to buy a turbocharged version of the old Ethernet standard that most <font size=-1>PC</font>s already use, and which will transmit data at a speed of up to 100m bits per second, fast enough for most current multimedia products. Forrester Research, a Massachusetts consultancy, reckons that by 1998, only 10% of <font size=-1>LAN</font> traffic will have moved to <font size=-1>ATM</font>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>ATM</font>'s backers hope that two changes will make systems managers readier to accept the new technology. One is its falling price. Several firms make 25m-bits-per-second gear that is expected soon to cost as little as $400 per <font size=-1>PC</font>, and which should work with existing Ethernet networks (though they will need new software to make the most of their features).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In addition, the technology may benefit from the current management fad for turning groups of workers, even in different offices, into teams. Unlike a conventional <font size=-1>LAN</font>, <font size=-1>ATM</font> is flexible enough for a network manager to connect teams at will, regardless of where they are. With such "virtual <font size=-1>LAN</font>s" , managers can reconfigure network connections between employees as often, and as easily, as they redraw their organisational charts.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the meantime, many <font size=-1>ATM</font> makers are hedging their bets. In February, for example, <font size=-1>FORE</font> agreed to pay $684m for Alantec, a San Jose firm which makes fast versions of the old Ethernet standard. <font size=-1>ATM</font>'s day will undoubtedly come, but maybe not quite yet. Too little demand and too much hassle: many a promising technology has foundered on these rocks before.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?829954800,iss">Search</a>

<html><head><title>Asia's flagging alliance</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><p align=center><img src="http://www.economist.com/econlogosmall.gif" width=78 height=39  alt="The Economist"></p><h1><center>Asia's flagging alliance</center></h1>THE handshake will be demonstrably firm, the declaration--issued jointly--will be deliberately reassuring, the timing could scarcely be bettered. On April 16th, less than a month after China ended its menacing military manoeuvres off Taiwan, and amid troubling new tensions on the Korean peninsula, Bill Clinton will travel to Tokyo to reaffirm America's security treaty with Japan. And since the America-Japan alliance is the cornerstone of security in East Asia, next week's summit should help calm rattled nerves around the region. But, alas, not for long. Fashioned for a bygone era, the America-Japan alliance is itself under strain. If it is to survive and to go on underpinning a wider stability, it needs to be radically redesigned. In future, Japan needs to be able to do more to help America meet East Asia's fast-changing security needs.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The alliance's great weakness is its lop-sidedness: America is committed by treaty to help defend Japan against attack, but the treaty's vague wording about upholding "peace and security in the Far East" has enabled Japan to avoid making a military contribution beyond its own shores. When the Soviet Union posed a global threat, the bargain made sense: Japan could busy itself building democracy and a wealthy economy behind America's broad military shield, while America could base its planes and warships deterringly close to the potential hot spots in Asia's version of the cold war. But, since the cold war ended, dissatisfaction has been growing. Trade tensions have obsessed America. Some Japanese now ask why they should pay huge sums to support the 47,000 or so American troops (out of about 100,000 in the region) still on their soil. Some Americans argue that Japan, one of the world's richest countries in an increasingly wealthy region, should be able to defend itself (see <a href="sf1.html">pages</a>).<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet, as recent events have shown, with the end of the cold war East Asia's troubles have not disappeared, they have grown more diverse. First came suspicions that prickly North Korea may have been building nuclear weapons. Then a more powerful and militarily assertive China started pressing territorial claims against its neighbours, from Japan in the north to the Philippines and Indonesia in the south, as well as bullying Taiwan. With Russia on the sidelines, and China playing awkwardly by its own rules, the natural balancer in East Asia's changing power game ought to be Japan. But continued suspicions of a Japan striking out alone, and the absence of any other reassuring multilateral alliances, make America's continued presence essential. Without it, the region's rivals could swiftly end up in a brawl.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Americans, however, are increasingly reluctant to take on East Asia's military burdens alone. With fewer friendly bases in the region (those in the Philippines went in 1992, Hong Kong's will go next year), America will need to rely more heavily on Japan simply to keep its ships and aircraft on patrol. Acknowledging this, at next week's summit Japan will agree to help out more with peacetime supplies, spare parts and the like. And diplomats on both sides are quietly preening themselves for getting a public mention of wider security co-operation into the joint declaration. Yet the co-operation envisaged falls far short of the militarily useful sort. Come the next crisis, the America-Japan alliance will still be found wanting--and both sides will share the blame.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Japan fends off accusations of freeloading on America's defence budget by pointing, not just to its contribution (some 70%) to America's troop costs in Japan, but to its growing share of "soft" security tasks, within the region and beyond: using its aid and diplomacy to ease tensions, contributing some (mostly unarmed) peacekeepers, not just cash, to United Nations missions, from Cambodia to the Golan Heights. Yet it still balks at the "hard" military jobs on which stability in East Asia depends. In the confrontation over North Korea's nuclear ambitions, Japan pointed to its constitution and refused to contemplate even minimal military support for America--even though Japan's own security was at risk. Had either side miscalculated, bringing China and America to blows last month over Taiwan, Japan's warships would have stayed in port, its top-of-the-range aircraft grounded.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Clearly, if push ever does come to shove in East Asia, that sort of you're-on-your-own attitude will shatter the America-Japan alliance. So while toasting their increasingly insecure security treaty in Tokyo next week, America's president and Japan's prime minister could usefully start discussing new ways to strengthen it.</p><p><b>Broke, if you don't fix it</b><br>Japan's constitution did not stop it building up its own Self-Defence Forces, or, despite opposition, contributing to <font size=-1>UN</font> peacekeeping operations. It is only a bar to offering more robust military assistance to the <font size=-1>UN</font> or to joining in collective military action with America if politicians choose to read it that way. Though reinterpreting the constitution to allow Japan to play a more grown-up security role is no longer taboo in Japan, it would take strong political will to push it through. The sooner it is done, however, the safer will be the alliance on which Japan's wider security depends.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet a rebalanced alliance would make demands of America, too. Just as Japan has been content to hide securely behind America, so America has found it convenient to have an ally that asks few questions. Scarcely any Japanese officials, even the most senior ones, know what goes on at America's Japanese bases: though one of the aircraft-carriers that America recently sent to help protect Taiwan came from Japan, America did not think to let the Japanese government in on its plans. But if Japan is to stand closer to America's shoulder in future crises, America needs to acquire unaccustomed habits of consultation about threats to peace well before they explode, not just expect Japan to help pick up the messy pieces.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;None of this will come easily. But, as the secure foundation for East Asia's growing prosperity, a restored America-Japan alliance is irreplaceable. Best to fix it, therefore, before the damage becomes irreparable.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?829350000,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="sf1.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&#169; Copyright</a> 1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

The first round of the election takes place on June 16th.<p>Fighting in Chechnya between Russian forces and rebel <b>Chechen guerrillas</b> continued, despite Mr Yeltsin's declaration of a ceasefire on March 31st and his new willingness to negotiate with the Chechen leader, Jokar Dudaev, through intermediaries. Mr Dudaev still officially demands outright independence, but unofficially hints at flexibility.</p><p>China's prime minister, <b>Li Peng</b>, visited France and signed $2 billion-worth of trade deals, the biggest with Airbus Industrie. But his visit was marred by a diplomatic wrangle with Alain Jupp&eacute, the French prime minister, over human rights in China. The two men dropped the normal exchange of banquet toasts, after objecting to references to human rights in each other's draft remarks.</p><p>Fighting between <b>Kurdish guerrillas</b> and Turkish government forces intensified in eastern Turkey. The government said that more than 100 guerrillas and 30 Turkish soldiers had died in less than a week. An early peace settlement seems unlikely.</p><p>Barely five weeks after Spain's general election was won by Jose Maria Aznar and his conservative People's Party (<font size=-1>PP</font>), the leader of the main Catalan nationalist party, <b>Jordi Pujol</b>, has threatened to provoke another general election. The <font size=-1>PP</font>, which lacks a majority of seats in the new parliament, needs to make a deal with the Catalans, but Mr Pujol is playing hard to get.</p><p>The French president, Jacques Chirac, on a visit to Egypt, proposed a <b>Euro-Mediterranean summit</b>, which could, he said, lead to a "stability pact" to promote peace all round the Mediterranean.</p><h2>A terrorist hermit</h2><p>Theodore Kaczynski, suspected by the <font size=-1>FBI</font> of being the <b>Unabomber</b>, an anti-technology terrorist who has killed three people and injured many others in mail bombings over the past 18 years, was arrested in Montana and charged with possession of bomb-making materials. Agents say they found a live bomb ready for mailing and the names of some of the victims in his cabin.</p><p>Hearings began in Denver in the trial of Timothy McVeigh and Terry Nichols, charged in connection with the bombing in <b>Oklahoma City </b>a year ago which killed 169 people.</p><p>President Bill Clinton signed bills giving him the power to <b>veto </b>single items in budget bills, and reforming <b>farm subsidies </b>for the first time in 60 years. Both were favoured goals of the Republican majority in Congress.</p></td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%><p>After a 15-month investigation, the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission filed suit against Mitsubishi Motor for "continued physical and verbal <b>abuse against women</b>" at its plant in Normal, Illinois.</p><p>The Children's Defence Fund reported that in 1993 gunfire was the second-biggest cause of death among <b>American children </b>aged 10 to 19 (accidents were the first), and that a child died from gunfire in America every 92 minutes.</p><h2>Beirut attacked</h2><p>The tacit agreement between <b>Israel and Hizbullah</b> not to attack civilian targets collapsed after a Lebanese boy was killed in an explosion, and the Hizbullah rocketed a northern Israeli town. Israeli aircraft blasted Lebanon, including Hizbullah's offices in Beirut's densely populated suburbs.</p><p>After several days of factional fighting and hostage-taking in Liberia's capital,<b> Monrovia</b>, America evacuated its nationals and some other foreigners by helicopter. The fighting leaves last year's peace accord and prospects for disarmament and elections in ruins.</p><p>A Saudi-owned company pulled the plug on an<b> Arabic television service</b> that it had been providing jointly with the <font size=-1>BBC</font> after the service transmitted a documentary critical of the Saudi regime. The programme was not only shown in Britain but transmitted in Arabic to the Middle East and North Africa.</p><p><b>Jordan </b>agreed to let American military aircraft use its main air base for surveillance flights over southern Iraq.</p><h2>Cocking a snook</h2><p>For three nights up to 300 <b>North Korean soldiers </b>breached the armistice agreement on the Korean peninsula by moving into the demilitarised zone separating North and South Korea. The North is thought to be weary of the truce agreed in 1953 and wants to negotiate a peace treaty with America, which keeps a large defence force in the South.</p><p>A report prepared for the <b>Vietnamese Communist Party </b>congress in June envisages a lively private sector over the next five years, but says the state should be the main engine for growth.</p><p>The number of British nationals in <b>Hong Kong </b>increased by 39% to 34,500 in the eight months to February. Many more British companies are said to be moving to the territory to concentrate on the Chinese market. The British population is the third largest there, after those of the United States and the Philippines.</p><p></p></td></tr></table></center><p align=center><a href="wtw2.html">BUSINESS THIS WEEK</a></p><br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?829350000,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="wtw2.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&#169; Copyright</a> 1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

Union Bank of Switzerland, the biggest by market capitalisation and profits, and <font size=-1>CS</font> Holding, just ahead on assets, together would control a third of banking in Switzerland, where nearly 500 banks vie for diminishing profits.</p><p><b>Suez</b>, a French banking and industrial conglomerate, reported a net loss of FFr4 billion ($800m) in 1995, compared with FFr4.8 billion in 1994. The group expects to return to profit in 1996, even though it thinks it might again have to increase its provisions against dud loans.</p><p>More Americans than expected went back to work in March, jolting Wall Street, again. The <b>Dow</b> fell 1.6% on April 8th and a further 1.3% on April 10th. The dollar hit a 26-month high against the yen and a 14-month high against the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark. In Tokyo, the <b>Nikkei </b>dropped on the news but later recovered to set a four-year high.</p><p>The <b>rand </b>sank to new dollar lows as investors, nervous about South Africa's economy, reacted badly to rumours about an easing of foreign-exchange controls, as they did to earlier rumours about Nelson Mandela's health. The new finance minister has not restored calm.</p><p>About one in five of <b>Russia's banks </b>is either bankrupt or in serious trouble, said the Association of Russian Banks. But the central bank said it would not save weak ones. A recent report on Russian banking, sponsored by the European Union, predicted that more than half the country's banks will disappear over the next few years.</p><h2>Driving force</h2><p><b>Chrysler</b> agreed a $475m sale of most of its defence-electronics and airborne-systems operations to <b>Raytheon</b>, which has been expanding in those areas. The sale is part of the car maker's agreement with its biggest shareholder, Kirk Kerkorian, who has waged a long battle with Chrysler to return some of its cash hoard to shareholders.</p><p>Japan's second-biggest car maker, <b>Nissan</b>, is changing its boss. Yoshifumi Tsuji (above) is moving a year early and handing the job of president to Yoshikazu Hanawa.</p><p>America's big car makers made big profits last year but tough targets meant that their chief executives all had <b>pay cuts</b>. General Motors cut John Smith's pay by 9.2% and Ford's Alex Trotman lost 33% of his. Chrysler disclosed last month that it paid Robert Eaton 22% less.</p></td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%><p>Bulgaria's attempts to attract foreign investors took a battering when the German-owned <b>Rover Group </b>said it would close its new $20m car factory in the Black Sea port of Varna. It blames broken government promises, extra duties and tariffs, and cashless consumers.</p><p>China announced that it was buying another 30 new aircraft from <b>Airbus</b>, the European rival to Boeing, in a deal worth $1.5 billion.</p><h2>Wrathless grapes</h2><p>(See <a href="wtw2.gif">chart</a>)<br><b>French wine makers </b>had a good year for exports in 1995, despite threats of boycotts when France carried out a series of nuclear tests in the Pacific; the number of bottles sold in Australia, admittedly a tiny number, rose by 130%. Germany remained the biggest importer by volume; Britain again by value.</p><p>Digital Equipment, Microsoft and <font size=-1>MCI</font> Communications have teamed up to provide fully integrated products and services for <b>intranets</b>, the private ghettos many firms are creating within the Internet.</p><p>Two big media groups formed an alliance, backdated to January 1st, under which <b>Kirch Gruppe </b>of Germany acquires the German-language rights to television programmes and films made by Paramount Pictures, a subsidiary of America's <b>Viacom</b>.

In the Pacific, the American-Japanese alliance is also showing strain; and it seems natural to suppose that this partnership, too, will nonetheless survive. If <font size=-1>NATO</font> has weathered the bickering over Bosnia, the arguments over enlargement, and the ebbing of the Russian threat, then surely the American-Japanese alliance can overcome apparently equivalent obstacles. All it will take is a bit of statesmanship on both sides: a resolution to refrain from calling the other nasty names and a feel-good summit.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That will be Bill Clinton's hope as he sets off next week to visit Japan and South Korea. Having infuriated the Japanese by cancelling a trip to Osaka last November, Mr Clinton plans to be in Japan from April 16th to 18th, a longish trip by his standards. Unlike previous summits, which focused on trade, this one will dwell on security. It will try to stiffen Japan's willingness to play host to 47,000 American troops, which has been wavering since three American servicemen raped a Japanese schoolgirl last September. Protestors calling for the Americans to withdraw mustered Japan's biggest demonstration in a quarter of a century.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To placate the Japanese, Mr Clinton will probably announce the return of some land now used by American troops. He will be the guest of the emperor, whose father the Americans nearly hanged after 1945: the perfect symbol of reconciliation. He will shake hands with Japan's prime minister, Ryutaro Hashimoto, who only a year ago was hurling abuse at American trade negotiators. And, with stage-managed amity, he will emphasise the importance of the two countries' alliance to East Asia's security at a time of growing regional instability--witness China's bullying of Taiwan, or North Korea's recent renunciation of the armistice that ended the Korean war.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Can the partnership be patched up in this way? There are two broad reasons for supposing that it cannot, and that the comforting analogy with <font size=-1>NATO </font>promotes complacency. The first doubt holds that trade arguments will soon dominate the partnership again, and that the healing effect of next week's summit will therefore be fleeting. The second maintains that the alliance is doomed by forces that no summit can address: that America is gradually losing its appetite for defending allies rich enough to defend themselves, and that rich Japan is losing patience with American tutelage.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Either of these arguments, if true, could consign the alliance to gradual decay, with potentially dreadful consequences. Deprived of America's nuclear shield, Japan would develop its own nuclear weapons to stay even with China. South Korea, which has been invaded by both Japan and China in the past, would shortly follow. So might the more sophisticated South-East Asian states, whose military budgets are already growing rapidly. Pretty soon, the whole region could be nuclear and nervous.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such an arms race would unfold on a continent far less stable than Europe at the height of the cold war. China faces a succession struggle; North Korea faces famine and possible collapse; South Korean democracy is in a tempestuous infancy. Farther south, Indonesia has succession worries of its own; Hong Kong will revert to China next year; and Taiwan is trying to stave off a similar fate. In short, if the American-Japanese alliance frays, the miracle economies of the Pacific rim could set a second record for mankind. Having pulled off history's fastest ever advance in human welfare, they could next succumb to its fastest and nastiest reversal.</p><p><b>Trade troubles</b><br>How real are these dangers? Consider, first, the possibility that trade rows will undermine America's partnership with Japan. Such disputes have dogged the alliance for many years, and the partnership has survived. In 1992, for instance, George Bush went to Tokyo brandishing a list of trade demands, flanked by industrialists demanding better access to Japanese markets. But the trade disputes seem to be getting worse--and have begun to jeopardise the security part of the partnership.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Clinton came to power promising to redouble the commercial bias. Visiting Tokyo for the <font size=-1>G7</font> summit in 1993, he turned his meeting with Kiichi Miyazawa, Japan's prime minister of the time, into a trade negotiation. The defence treaty barely got a mention.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Clinton team argued that, with the cold war at an end, geo-politics could give way to geo-economics. Communism had collapsed; or, where it had not, communists were too intent on getting rich to threaten anybody. In the absence of this threat, America could withdraw from the costly, tiring business of propping up allies and staring down foes. Instead, it should concentrate on economic goals, chiefly export promotion. If the pursuit of economic gain hurt cold-war ties, then so be it.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This thinking changed American policy. The Commerce Department saw its budget and prestige expand; the State Department grew demoralised. The biggest impact from this shift fell on America's dealings with Japan. Here was a country whose security role now seemed less crucial. And here was a country whose vast markets appeared closed to American products. With his trip to Tokyo in 1993, Mr Clinton inaugurated a policy of aggressive trade demands, untrammelled by concern for the wider partnership.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Three years later, Japan-bashing on trade has damaged relations between the two countries. An opinion poll taken in the middle of last year's acrimonious car talks found that friendly feelings between the two countries had hit a ten-year low. Japan's trade minister of the time grew wildly popular by denouncing American demands; so popular, indeed, that he is now prime minister. Meanwhile, thuggish China and North Korea have demonstrated that the security alliance with Japan is as necessary as ever.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1995 Joseph Nye, a senior Defence-Department official, declared that the military alliance was suffering from neglect.<a href="#foot">*1</a> Wedded to geo-economics, the Clinton team at first failed to gave his concerns their due. What made the difference was last September's rape of the schoolgirl and the wave of anti-American demonstrations that followed. Supported by much of the Japanese press, the demonstrators argued that it was outrageous for Japan to pay 70% of the cost of maintaining American bases on its soil, if American servicemen behaved so badly. Even politicians on whom America had previously relied failed to speak out in defence of the security treaty. In Washington, the Defence Department's vague concern turned into "real panic", in the words of one of Mr Nye's advisers.</p><p><b>Half a hope</b> <b>on trade</b><br>That was enough to produce Mr Clinton's sudden switch to worrying about the military alliance. But is the switch anything more than a panic reaction? At first sight, it does not look like it. The prospects for keeping security at the top of the agenda with Japan are dim. Republicans are as reluctant as Democrats to return to the vigilance of the cold war; there are few votes in it. Richard Lugar, the one Republican presidential candidate to stress his knowledge of foreign affairs, got almost no votes in the primaries. At the State Department, old Japan hands marvel at how the tough congressional questions that they used to face have given way to yawning indifference. In sum, neither party seems interested in giving a consistently high priority to the security treaty with Japan.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That said, however, there remains half a hope that America will come back to security in future. It lies in the failure of Japan-bashing trade policies.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When he goes to Tokyo, the president will no doubt claim credit for America's shrinking trade deficit with Japan (see <a href="sf2.gif">chart</a>). But the truth is that this reflects the yen's rise to around &#165;107 to the dollar, up from &#165;126 when Mr Clinton took office. It does not reflect the trade talks initiated in 1993, because most of America's important demands have been turned down flat by Japanese officials. Japan-bashing has failed on its own terms.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor will it succeed any time soon. Japanese intransigence on trade is likely to prove permanent. During the 1970s and 1980s Japan repeatedly yielded to foreign-trade demands, whether for access to its domestic market or for "voluntary" restraints upon its exports. But that was because Japan's firms were making miracle profits during their years of catch-up growth. Now that they are less flush, these firms are far less keen on "generosity".<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Besides, the Japanese are now protected by the World Trade Organisation. During last year's car talks, America threatened to use its draconian "Super 301" trade law, which provides for punitive sanctions against countries deemed to be unfair traders. The Japanese said that they would challenge the legality of such a step under <font size=-1>WTO</font> rules. The counter-threat worked; the Americans backed down; the Japanese are not going to be cowed by Super 301 in future.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Japanese steadfastness is not the only reason why Japan-bashing has failed. The other is that bashing can backfire on America's own economic interests. Since the 1980s, the fear of a trade war has spread occasional panic through Wall Street. During last year's trade row, investors worried that, by forcing up the yen, American trade pressure might hasten a banking crisis in Japan, with ugly consequences for the American banks that do business with them. Not long afterwards, America's trade negotiators signed a deal on car trade that included little of what they had originally wanted.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;None of this means that trade rows are gone. Mr Clinton will not be able to avoid mentioning several disputes next week, concerning photographic film, insurance and semiconductors. Decades of trade rows have produced an interest group of dispute-experts in Washington, who make a fine living by lobbying on behalf of firms trying to penetrate Japan and who know just how to keep trade rows active. But the limited gains from such disputes should at least mean that they are kept in check. No longer will they be pursued without regard to the security relationship.</p><p><b>Half-baked on security</b><br>If trade rows can be more-or-less contained, what of the other threats to the alliance? These come down to the idea that the security treaty, born of Japan's defeat in 1945, is now anachronistic. Some Americans argue that Japan has outgrown the need for American defence; as the world's second biggest economy, it should do its own soldiering. For their part, some Japanese feel that reliance on American troops is a slur on the nation's pride; they are fed up with being "a mercantile nation that just writes cheques", in the words of Mr Hashimoto.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These are serious objections. General Douglas MacArthur, who ruled Japan from 1945 to 1951, likened Japan to a child in need of America's fatherly protection. The military alliance that he helped devise reflects this paternalism. America promises to protect Japan and to quench instability in Asia (see <a href="sf1.gif">map</a>). In return, Japan merely offers bases for American troops. The Japanese do maintain a "Self-Defence Force" but its usefulness is stunted by Japan's pacifist constitution, which forbids going to war.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For a surprisingly long time, the alliance worked on the basis of America's conquering self-confidence and Japan's corresponding humility. Until the 1970s, Americans continued to see Japan as a backward place where you could afford cheap maids; Japan continued to admire American ways and products. A deep self-doubt possessed the Japanese, who were ashamed to sing the national anthem or raise the flag; some left-wingers regarded the Japanese state itself as illegitimate.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All this has been changed by Japan's stunning economic success. Now it is the Japanese who find America cheap, who complain that American workers are lazy and their products unreliable. Japan's flag and national anthem are no longer suppressed; the anti-nationalist left-wing has all but evaporated. The old self-doubt has been replaced by self-confidence, sometimes overblown. In many respects, Japanese reckon they know better than MacArthur's heirs--and plenty of Americans are willing to agree with them.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For at least a decade, therefore, the two countries' military alliance has seemed precariously lop-sided. Some critics, seeing that MacArthur's father-child arrangement has been slow to adapt, are starting to lose patience. Last year Chalmers Johnson, the president of the Japan Policy Research Institute, argued that Japan would never take more responsibility for its own defence while the American security treaty remained in place; he therefore called on his country to close down its Japanese bases.<a href="#foot2">*2</a>  On Japan's side, a different version of this argument emerged. The rape, some said, proved that Americans behaved as though they were still members of an occupation force. The only way to cure Americans of their arrogance was to send them packing.</p><p><b>Complacency revisited</b><br>It will be easy for next week's summiteers to dismiss these extreme views. Only a small minority wants all American troops to go; a poll taken after last September's rape found that just 14% of Japanese held this opinion. But, having ignored the perils of geo-economics for too long, America had better not ignore this second set of threats. For the truth is that the security treaty is every bit as anachronistic as the critics charge. Unless it is brought up to date, nobody should be surprised if the extremists multiply.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, the same poll demonstrates the dangers of complacency. Even fewer Japanese--just 7%--wanted the bases maintained at their current size; the vast majority resented their presence, and wanted them scaled back gradually. More polls, assembled in a new book<a href="#foot3">*3</a>, suggest that younger Japanese are more hostile to the bases than their elders; and that many doubt whether America would defend Japan in a crisis. In 1990, 62% of Japanese said that America would be a reliable ally; in 1994, only 47% did. At times a majority has said that the bases, by provoking enemy attack, may actually reduce Japan's security.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The alliance needs to be modified before such resentments undermine it. Since last autumn's rape, America has begun to take up this task. The armed forces are preparing to hand back unneeded land--not the airbases, which America must keep if it is to deploy troops quickly in Asia and the Middle East, but housing estates and suchlike. Mr Clinton's visit will also bring the announcement of a scheme to involve Japan more in logistical support for American troops taking part in peacetime military exercises or peacekeeping operations.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Japan's sense of involvement with the American forces on its soil ought to be promoted further. Japanese defence officials and diplomats seldom visit America's bases in Japan, and one recent exception to this rule suggests how valuable more exceptions could be. A month ago a group of bigwigs from Tokyo was loaded onto a buggy and driven past endless helicopters, tanks and other war materiel. All they could say was <i>sugoi</i>!, which means, roughly, Wow! They had heard Americans talk of their commitment to Japan. Now they had seen the evidence.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some Japan hands in Washington discuss the <i>sugoi </i>factor and wonder how they can build on it. But the trouble is that a strong unilateralist strain remains in America's military policy, a tendency as marked in Asia as it was in Bosnia. When Bill Clinton sent aircraft carriers to watch over the Taiwan Strait recently, he did not forewarn the Japanese. Left out of American plans, they are hardly likely to feel confident in American protection.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This matters, because Japan's leaders will need to feel more confidence in the alliance if they are to play their part in strengthening it. Japanese voters are even less keen than their American counterparts on expanding their military responsibilities abroad. Polls suggest that most Japanese think it wrong to use force to maintain international law; and that most doubt whether their country's military power will ever match its economic stature. If the security treaty is to be modernised, a bold politician will have to look his countrymen in the eyes and demand that they rethink some of their most basic attitudes.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Scary as it may sound, the long-term health of the alliance with America may therefore hinge on Japan's chaotic politics. Since 1993, a one-party system has given way to a chaos of competing splinter groups and then to something resembling two-party competition. Over the same three years, the country has been ruled by five different prime ministers. But, out of this mess, something promising has emerged. Both the two main parties are led by men who want to expand Japan's responsibilities. These leaders need all the support they can get from their American friends. Mr Clinton's visit next week will be a start. But the finishing point remains distant.<br><p><a <font size=-1>*1 <a name="foot">''The Case for Deep Engagement''.</a> By Joseph Nye. <i>Foreign Affairs</i>.

So it should; it has had plenty of practice.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The latest confrontation on the Korean peninsula bears all the hallmarks of well orchestrated political theatre. In sending up to 300 heavily armed soldiers into the demilitarised buffer zone at Panmunjom on three separate occasions, from April 5th to April 7th, North Korea's communist dictatorship certainly caught the world's attention. Bellicose declarations that war between North and South Korea is inevitable, and that the North would no longer abide by the terms of the armistice that ended the Korean war more than 40 years ago, have garnered the desired headlines.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But despite all the war-like rhetoric, neither the Americans--who have over 30,000 troops in South Korea--nor the South Koreans believe that a conflict is imminent. They have detected no signs of a build-up of North Korean troops or other threatening manoeuvres that might indicate preparations for an attack. The only sign of a change visible to recent visitors to the frontier was that the North Koreans were not wearing armbands, which are required under the military armistice.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Privately, the American and South Korean analysis of the situation may be similar. But the two governments' public reactions have been different. The Americans, who have no desire for another security crisis in Asia, have played down the North Korean actions. They continued to escort tourists through the public areas at Panmunjom as North Korea conducted its manoeuvres, an ostentatious sign that they were not alarmed.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By contrast, South Korean officials have been talking the crisis up. State television showed South Korean forces crouching in combat positions, and running along the south side of the demilitarised zone with blackened faces.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But, when pressed at a news conference, a senior defence-ministry official conceded that the armed forces as a whole were still on the same general level of alert as they had been before the latest crisis. American and South Korean officials say the "watch" grade has been increased one point, which means that intelligence readings are analysed more frequently.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many South Koreans take a cynical view. Parliamentary elections were held on April 11th. In the past, war scares have created a bit of a bounce in the vote for the government. It seems that history may have repeated itself. Early projections by state television, after the polls had closed, predicted that Mr Kim's New Korea Party would increase its majority--contrary to most expectations. "I don't understand why North Korea helps the ruling party at every election," bemoaned one member of the opposition.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Not understanding the North Koreans is a fairly common complaint. But the best guess is that the North probably has two aims. Meddling in the South Korean elections is always tempting. And with President Clinton heading for Seoul next week, on his way to Tokyo, the opportunity to engage the Americans' attention was clearly too good to miss.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since <font size=-1>KEDO</font>, an American-led consortium, offered to supply two 1,000-megawatt nuclear reactors costing $4.5 billion in exchange for North Korea's agreeing to shut its plutonium-making reactors, the communist regime has realised that by far its best chance for survival is to extract more concessions from America. It has made no secret of its long-term aim to replace the armistice signed in 1955 by North Korea, China and the United States with a peace treaty solely with the Americans. The United States has strongly resisted this idea. In the meantime, the North's aim is probably to get the Clinton administration to supply more aid and diplomatic recognition. South Korea, meanwhile, wants to convince the North that only by making peace with the South will it get economic help. So the South is keen to block northern overtures to America and to Japan.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although the situation is not yet a crisis, it could become one. North Korea knows that brinkmanship and threats worked during the nuclear crisis. Its capacity for making mischief is its only asset. Its armed forces are more numerous than those in the South; but are reckoned to be far weaker. If the North does not get what it wants now, it is sure to up the ante. And with their survival at stake, North Korea's rulers may be prone to reckless miscalculation.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?829350000,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="br1.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&#169; Copyright</a> 1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

<p><b>Blair's American visit</b></p>
<h1>Love fest</h1>

<p>AS EXPECTED, Tony Blair received a warm welcome in Washington this week from Bill Clinton. Can they ever be as close as Ronnie and Margaret? Perhaps, but it may not matter much if they are.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Both men already have a lot in common. Both are Oxford-educated 40-somethings, enjoy middle-of-the-road rock music, claim a Christian basis for their politics and are married to successful, independent-minded lawyers. Above all, each has modernised an ailing left-of-centre party.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Blair and his new Labour advisers identify strongly with Mr Clinton's new Democrats. This partly reflects personal ties. Jonathan Powell, Mr Blair's chief of staff, was working at the British embassy in Washington during the Clinton campaign of 1992 and followed it closely. Phillip Gould, Mr Blair's pollster, played a minor advisory role in the Clinton campaign. David Milliband, a Blair aide, and Ed Balls, an adviser to Gordon Brown, the shadow chancellor, have forged strong links with members of the Clinton administration, such as Larry Summers at the Treasury and Robert Reich, the secretary of labour.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Blair's desire to emulate Mr Clinton's success is evident in his espousal of Clintonite policies such as workfare, and his endorsement of communitarianism. Moreover, Mr Blair's big idea, the "stakeholder society", has led leftish thinkers on both sides of the Atlantic to talk of possible common policies, much as Margaret (now Lady) Thatcher and Ronald Reagan jointly pursued income-tax cuts and deregulation. Mr Reich is a keen advocate of "stakeholder capitalism": he advocates making companies "good citizens" by giving them new duties to stakeholders such as employees and the "community". A group of congressional Democrats is exploring ways to promote the "responsible corporation" as, in Britain, Will Hutton has done in a best-selling book, "The State We're In" .
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But it seems unlikely that many concrete policies will emerge from all this chatter and communing. Mr Blair is wisely distancing himself from talk of tampering directly with firms; one goal of this week's visit was to persuade American investors of his economic solidity. Mr Clinton has been careful not to let Mr Reich turn many of his words into actions.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Those close to Mr Blair prefer to emphasise the lessons to be learnt from Mr Clinton's experiences as a left-wing moderniser running for office. To them, Mr Clinton is good at campaigning, bad at governing. He allowed voters' hopes for change to rise too high, and failed to think through his biggest campaign commitment, to reform health care. As a result his efforts at reform were an embarrassing flop.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thus Blairites are attempting to restrain public expectations before Britain's general election and are grappling with the practicalities of constitutional reform, the policy most likely to provide Mr Blair's equivalent of the health-care fiasco.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Whatever else they do, however, neither Mr Clinton nor Mr Blair plans to reverse the economic reforms of their right-wing predecessors. History may judge that to be the most significant thing these leaders of the left had in common.

<p><b>Off the rails</b> &nbsp;
Roger Salmon said he would resign in October as head of Opraf, the rail-franchising regulator--two years early--because by then he would have achieved all he had set out to do. Labour claimed he was leaving because it would sack him if elected.</p>
<p><b>Off the air</b> &nbsp;

<p><b>Testing time</b> &nbsp;
<font size=-1>AIDS</font> clinics and charities received thousands of calls from people who had taken tests for <font size=-1>HIV</font>, after an announcement that some tests may have falsely shown that the patient was free of the virus.</p>
<p><b>Mad bomber</b> &nbsp;

Left-wing delegates to the annual conference of the National Union of Teachers blocked the union leadership's plans to widen the use of secret ballots of union members. Doug McAvoy, the general secretary, vowed to press on with the reforms nevertheless.</p>
<p><b>Miracle</b> &nbsp;
George Carey, the Archbishop of Canterbury, said a strong performance by the Church of England's property investments helped its assets grow by &#163;300m ($450m) last year. The church now claims to have recovered almost all of the heavy losses caused by property speculation in the late 1980s.</p>
<p><b>Cuts</b> &nbsp;

But it is certain that the 1995 accounts of Italy's leading information-technology group will be splattered with crimson ink. A loss will in itself hardly surprise the group's shareholders, who have become accustomed to increasingly bad news ever since 1991 (see <a href="wb1.gif">chart</a>). All the same, its dimensions should worry even the most ardent fans of Carlo De Benedetti, Olivetti's chairman: the figure for 1995 is likely to be around 1.5 trillion lire ($920m).<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Olivetti's annual reports used to be stylish affairs, filled with dazzling diagrams showing the company's progress. More recently, such gimmicks have disappeared. The price of an Olivetti share has tumbled to just over 800 lire from 9,000 lire in 1987. As Olivetti's largest shareholder (his family owns, indirectly, a 15% stake) Mr De Benedetti has suffered too. Yet the biggest blow may be to his prestige: gone are the days when his international image was as sleek as his company's computers.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Olivetti has already announced losses for the first half of 1995 of almost 1.1 trillion lire on revenues of 4.7 trillion lire. The chief culprit was a 900 billion lire restructuring charge: as well as laying off staff and closing factories, Olivetti also reorganised itself, spinning off two of its businesses--personal computers and office products--into two new companies, Olivetti Personal Computers (<font size=-1>OPC</font>) and Lexikon, both of which came into being in January 1996.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The biggest problem is <font size=-1>OPC</font>, whose antecedents lost more than 200 billion lire last year--before various reorganisation and financial charges. Olivetti sold only 720,000 <font size=-1>PC</font>s last year (about the same number as in 1992); and even this figure may have been artificially boosted by what looks like a year-end clearance sale (around 40% of its <font size=-1>PC</font>s were sold in the last quarter). <font size=-1>OPC</font>'s target is to break even this year. To this end, it has concentrated <font size=-1>PC</font> production in one factory, in the process cutting its staff from about 4,000 to 1,800.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But is it too late? Even if <font size=-1>OPC</font> reaches its ambitious target of selling 900,000 <font size=-1>PC</font>s this year, it will still clearly be a second-division firm. With no obvious edge (its <font size=-1>PC</font>s, though quite stylish, are neither cheaper nor technically better than its rivals'), <font size=-1>OPC</font>'s only niche is geographic: it relies heavily on European sales, and on its home market in particular--both of which are now being attacked by more powerful computer makers such as America's Compaq.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even insiders now concede that if <font size=-1>OPC</font> fails to make money this year, the group will have to quit the business altogether. There has been some speculation, dismissed by Olivetti, that <font size=-1>OPC</font> might be sold to Bull, a troubled French computer company. The harsher truth is that a buyer for <font size=-1>OPC</font> may be hard to find. Cynics note that its establishment as a separate company has made the <font size=-1>PC</font> business easier to close as well as to sell.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All of Olivetti's current profits come from two areas: Lexikon, which makes office equipment such as fax machines, photocopiers and printers, and its systems-and-services division, which is still controlled by the main company and enjoys particularly strong custom from financial and public-sector institutions. Here at least Olivetti possesses a few clear advantages (for instance, it is a leader in bank-automation products). On the other hand, it is facing increasing competition, particularly in Italy, and its profit margins are under pressure in both areas.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most of Olivetti's hopes for growth are pinned on two areas which currently yield little revenue (see <a href="wb1.gif">chart</a>): Telemedia, its embryonic multimedia-technology subsidiary, and, particularly, Omnitel Pronto Italia, a new cellular-telephone company in which Olivetti has a 41.3% stake. Omnitel looks like a winner: it has at last navigated around a series of obstructions created by Italy's state telephone company (which, curiously enough, owns the first national cellular service) and it is recruiting subscribers fast. However, profits are two years off, and the firm is currently eating up cash. By June, Olivetti has to stump up 145 billion lire as its part of a 350 billion lire capital injection.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In December, Olivetti raised a massive 2.3 trillion lire of fresh capital to pay for its reorganisation and to finance its investment plans. The group's "net financial indebtedness" (ie, excluding cash and intra-company debt) at the end of the year was still around 800 billion lire. This year it plans to sell 400 billion lire-worth of non-strategic assets, of which it has already raised 200 billion lire (half of that through the sale of Zincocelere, a circuit-board maker). Olivetti is now looking for a purchaser of Eurofly, its executive-jet subsidiary that looks out of place in the company's current reduced circumstances.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some bearish analysts are privately forecasting another cash crunch later this year. In that event, Olivetti might have to sell more assets, or perhaps float off Lexikon. Pointing to the 903 billion lire raised in 1993, as well as to the December rights issue, Paola Toschi of Milla &amp; Co, a Milanese securities house, argues that investors will not support yet another rights issue.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, one of Mr De Benedetti's problems is that his shareholders, most of whom are now non-Italians, have become increasingly mutinous. In retrospect, the rights issue last year was badly handled. There was confusion about the sort of profits the firm was promising to deliver. Investors subscribed for shares at 1,000 lire, only to see them drop to just over 700 at one point (the subsequent partial recovery in the share price has been largely due to a bullish market rather than new faith in Olivetti).<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This matters. In the past, one of Olivetti's intangible assets has been the goodwill felt towards the company, which was a pioneer not only in design but also in areas such as employee relations. Mr De Benedetti too had a powerful personal following, based on his reputation in the 1980s as one of the clean brooms that would sweep out the Augean stables of Italian industry. This goodwill now appears to be very nearly exhausted. Olivetti will survive next Tuesday's results; the real test will be 1996's half-year figures in September.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?829350000,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="ob1.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&#169; Copyright</a> 1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

It seems a lot of people credited him for their start, too. Mr Packard founded, along with Bill Hewlett, one of the most successful high-tech firms in history, Hewlett-Packard. (The order of names was chosen by the toss of a coin, but, as it turned out, in reverse order of influence.) More importantly, in a small garage in Addison Avenue in Palo Alto, California, the two men started what would become Silicon Valley.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is hard, on reviewing Mr Packard's life, to understand how this boy from Pueblo, Colorado, who liked to be in the open air and would spend some of his happiest moments driving a bulldozer on his ranch, could have inspired such digital-age icons as Microsoft's Bill Gates, Intel's Andy Grove, and Steve Jobs, Apple Computer's co-founder. Mr Packard was always a gentleman, who insisted that his employees respect their competitors and never criticise them in front of customers. Today the business is full of predators, publicly contemptuous of their rivals, who preach such battlefield exhortations as "Eat lunch or be lunch" and "Only the paranoid survive".<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As a child, Mr Packard wished he had been born in an earlier day, when America's west was still a frontier and its people pioneers. He proved that the same spirit, channelled into technology and business rather than land and conquest, could create and cross new frontiers.</p><p><b>Birth of the brightest</b></b><br>Mr Packard and Mr Hewlett started <font size=-1>HP</font> in 1939 as a west coast firm in an industry dominated by east coast firms such as General Electric and Westinghouse. Their first sale was an audio oscillator used in a Disney film, "Fantasia". <font size=-1>HP</font> built up ties with Stanford: an engineering professor named Fred Terman tutored many of those who would become Silicon Valley's early stars. <font size=-1>HP</font> was one of the first firms to move into Stanford's business park, ground zero of the Valley's industrial explosion. It was an innovator and nimble in entering new business, traits that today define the region's firms. And it made heaps of money: more than $30 billion in annual sales today, not terribly far behind <font size=-1>IBM</font>. It is the Valley's largest company and biggest employer. Some 25 of the Valley's top executives are <font size=-1>HP</font> alumni.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No doubt there would have been a computer industry in California without <font size=-1>HP</font>. It was just one of several electronics firms that were starting up on the west coast in the late 1930s, a trend that accelerated during the second world war. But <font size=-1>HP</font> is the only one from those early days to have survived as a force in the industry. The fact that <font size=-1>HP</font> started with two guys in a garage, and took off, was an inspiration. It wasn't quite log cabin to White House--it was better.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But, the lack of courtesy apart, there is much that Mr Packard would have disapproved of in today's Valley. Growing up in the depression, and seeing what banks could do to companies, he swore never to take on long-term debt. The firm grew on profits alone, and did not even go public until nearly its 20th year. Today's computer industry start-ups often go public before they are two, and will beg and borrow whatever it takes to keep up with the industry's skyrocketing growth. Compaq reached $1 billion in annual sales in less than a decade, something it took <font size=-1>HP</font> 40 years to achieve.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The firm practises pragmatic benevolence. It has never had a lay-off, and was one of the first firms to offer share options and profit-related pay. It has trusted employees, leaving equipment rooms unlocked (and believing that access to equipment might encourage employees to tinker in their off hours, perhaps inventing some new product).<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At 6ft 5in, Mr Packard had an imposing presence, and he relished face-to-face contact with his employees. When he worked at General Electric after leaving university, he spent a day on a factory line and cracked the problem behind its failure rate with vacuum tubes. From then on, when things went wrong at <font size=-1>HP</font>, he would head for the shop floor. This "management by walking around" (later dignified by management theorists as <font size=-1>MBWA</font>) reflected Mr Packard's low tolerance for boardroom decision-making, business schools and professional managers (although the firm would have to embrace all three as it grew larger). In 1969 he was asked by the Nixon administration to become assistant secretary of defence. He found the three years he spent in the job frustrating. The defence procurement system ran counter to the principles of efficiency <font size=-1>HP</font> held dear. He said the Pentagon would do as well picking names from a hat.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He was generous with his wealth. With his death the Packard Foundation's endowment will grow to $6.6 billion, making it America's third largest charity. He and Mr Hewlett gave Stanford more than $300m. Sharing his wealth with the region that made him great may partially account for his revered status with even the most jaundiced young Silicon Valley entrepreneurs. But there is more to it than that. The days of civility and organic growth may be gone in the industry hothouse, but the geeks still know solid technology, well made. David Packard set the tone of Silicon Valley by valuing nothing higher than a good machine.</td></tr></table><br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?829350000,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="index.html">Contents</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&#169; Copyright</a> 1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

<h1><center>Learning to cope</center></h1>

ECONOMIC insecurity is all the rage. It is a theme that will dominate the forthcoming elections in Britain and America, even though both are enjoying steady growth and low unemployment by international standards. Today most of the big economies feel anxious in a way that is not explained by the usual economic statistics. What worries people is not the fact of joblessness so much as the threat of it; not the lack of economic growth so much as its distribution. People who used to think their jobs were safe and their standard of living would rise each year can no longer take either for granted.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The scale of the problem tends to be exaggerated. In many economies, competition (domestic as much as foreign) and new technology are touching people who were hitherto immune from such forces. It may seem to them that the world has changed in a terrifying way; often, it is merely that their corner has become more like the world at large. Moreover, crucial aspects of "insecurity" are shrouded in statistical fog. Have real household earnings stagnated in America? It depends what you mean by "real" (because adjusting for inflation is a tricky business). It depends what you mean by "household" (because the pattern of household composition has changed a lot). It depends what you mean by "earnings" (because employers now pay their workers more in the form of non-wage benefits).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nonetheless, the issue raises questions well worth answering. Two, for now. What can governments do to promote growth in productivity and hence in overall living standards? And what can they do to reduce persistent unemployment--so that the benefits of growth are more widely shared, and the possibility of unemployment becomes a bit less scary?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Predictably, at this week's meeting of rich-country labour ministers in Lille, many Europeans objected to America's insistence that a large part of the cure for European unemployment was lighter regulation of labour markets. That way, the Europeans said, lies falling wages and even greater insecurity. This is a familiar quarrel and little more needs to be said about it. America's phenomenal success in creating new jobs and Europe's abject failure to do so speak for themselves.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More interesting perhaps is another proposed remedy for insecurity: state-supported training. Everybody loves this idea. Here is the best way to help workers cope with a changing jobs market. With more training, governments can encourage not only lots of new jobs, but lots of good jobs. It is a prescription temptingly in tune with the times: knowledge workers...flexibility...human capital. Training is a kind of investment, after all. Who ever objected to investment?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Well, since you ask. Deregulating labour markets is controversial but should not be; spending more public money on training, whether on public schemes or on subsidies for private schemes, is not controversial but should be. The standard argument is that the market is bound to provide too little training: why should a firm bear the cost when trained workers can take their new skills elsewhere? But people accept this idea much too quickly. The fact is, the great bulk of training actually carried out in a modern economy is on-the-job training arranged at the employer's initiative. There is no mystery about it. Spending money on training can make sense, despite poaching, if one of two things is true. Either the firm must be able to pay a comparatively low wage during training (recovering some of the cost from the worker), or else the training must be firm-specific (and therefore of little interest to a would-be poacher). Often both are true.
</p><p><b>Floors and bridges</b>
<br>If training is under-provided, and it sometimes may be, it must be for deeper reasons than the specious " market failure" argument. For instance, if there is a floor below which wages cannot fall (either because of a minimum wage, or because of the way the welfare system works), the private bargain over training will be blocked for workers at the bottom of the income scale. In the same way, the "tax wedge" between the costs of employment to the firm (wages plus payroll taxes and other mandated costs) and the benefits of employment to the worker (wages minus taxes) militates against private arrangements. So if training is under-provided, this may be the unintended consequence of other policies--and, if so, a good way to promote training would be to change those other policies.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This conclusion is reinforced when you consider the evidence of state-run training schemes in America and Europe. By and large, their record is disappointing (see <a href="sf1.html">page</a>). There are exceptions. In some ways, Germany's "dual-education system" is one--but for revealing reasons. Its success, such as it is, may have less to do with imparting valuable skills than with giving German employers cheap labour and German apprentices continuing education in very basic (as opposed to job-related) skills. The first point reaffirms the importance of a labour market that lets deals be struck between workers and employers--in a word, deregulation. The second point, echoed in many other countries, suggests that the skills which companies are unwilling to provide for themselves are the elementary ones of literacy and numeracy. In short, firms mainly want not trained workers but trainable ones.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In many countries, persistent unemployment among young people is a failure not of the training regime but of the education system. In this way, the problem of economic insecurity at the bottom of the income scale goes broader than questions of the labour market, narrowly understood. The same is true of insecurity in its other, middle-class, guise. State-run training for displaced-but-educated workers is likely, in itself, to do little the market cannot. More to the point would be measures to reduce the dread with which middle-class workers regard the possibility of a spell of unemployment. Such fears are often bound up with long-term financial arrangements. In many industrial countries, workers who lose their job see the value of their pension eroded (even if they move smartly to another firm). In countries where company-provided health insurance is the norm, even more may be at stake when a spell of unemployment looms.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Arrangements of this kind are once again partly, if not largely, the unintended consequence of other kinds of government policy. Typically, regulation has combined with personal and corporate tax rules to promote arrangements that make workers dependent on employers for more than wages. That may once have seemed in the workers' interests. It no longer does. Financial independence from one's employer is far better suited to modern conditions.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Economic insecurity is a broader and subtler question than it seems at first sight. Labour ministers, with all their little fixes and palliatives, may be the people least likely to say anything wise about it. And that goes double for Europeans.

<h2>Union meeting</h2>
<p>The <b>European Union</b>'s 15 leaders opened their inter-governmental conference in Turin to revise the Maastricht treaty and pave the way towards a larger Union of up to 27 members. Worries about Britain's beef crisis helped the leaders briefly to put aside deeper differences over how the <font size=-1>EU</font> should change.<p>
After three days of talks on the <b>mad-cow crisis</b>, <font size=-1>EU</font> farm ministers agreed to pay 70% of the costs of the slaughter of 4.6m older cattle in Britain. But they refused to lift the ban on British beef until the government proposes a more extensive slaughter policy.<p>
President Yeltsin unveiled a plan for <b>peace in Chechnya</b>. He suggested the Chechens' rebel leader, Jokar Dudaev, could be involved in negotiations and that Chechnya could have far-reaching autonomy that would still fall just short of independence.<p>An American air-force plane carrying <B>Ron Brown, America's commerce secretary,</b> was reported missing, believed crashed, over Croatia. It was on a flight from Tuzla to Dubrovnik, carrying a delegation of businessmen and government officials.<P><b>Fran&ccedil;ois L&eacuteotard</b>, a former defence minister, was elected to replace Val&eacutery Giscard d'Estaing as head of the Union for French Democracy (<font size=-1>UDF</font>), the junior partner in the ruling coalition, beating Alain Madelin, a former finance minister. Mr L&eacuteotard will now be seen as a candidate for the presidency in 2002.<p>
<b>Portugal</b>'s conservative Social Democrats, in opposition after 14 years in power, elected a new leader, Marcelo Rebelo de Sousa, following the resignation of Anibal Cavaco Silva, the country's former prime minister.<p>
The Group of Seven industrial countries, with 23m unemployed between them, met in Lille to discuss ways of <b>creating jobs</b> without letting labour standards fall. The group tried to chart a course between free-marketeers and interventionists.<p>
Complaining of a lack of provision for ex-presidents in Poland, Lech Walesa returned--in a Mercedes--to his old job in the <b>Gdansk shipyard</b>, 16 years after he left it to found the Solidarity movement that helped destroy communism in the country. The government also put part of its stake in the near-bankrupt shipyard up for sale.

<h2>Bowing out</h2>
<p>The Bangladeshi prime minister, Khaleda Zia, <b>resigned </b>and dissolved parliament, bowing to opposition demands for a general election to be held under a neutral transitional government.<p>
More than 50,000 people in <b>Hong Kong </b>applied for British travel documents on their last day of issue. The documents are an alternative to passports that will be issued by China, after the end of British rule in 1997.<p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
With President Clinton due to visit <b>Japan </b>for security talks on April 16th, the Japanese government sought to assure the Chinese that any defence agreements with America were not designed to "contain" China.<p>
An opinion poll indicated that the Congress party is likely to lose its majority in the <b>Indian general election </b>which begins on April 27th, but with a predicted 191 seats (out of 543 in the lower house) will remain the biggest party. The opposition <font size=-1>BJP</font> is expected to win 170 seats.<p>
Yoshimi Tanaka, wanted in Japan for allegedly <b>hijacking </b>a Japanese airliner to North Korea in 1970, was arrested in Pattaya, Thailand, with millions of counterfeit American dollars in his possession. Mr Tanaka tried unsuccessfully to escape to Vietnam in a North Korean embassy car.

<h2>Behemoth slims</h2>
<p>Owed $3 billion by its members and with no cash in hand, the <b>United Nations</b> is to cut its staff by 10% over the next four months and slash many programmes.<p>
With an election coming up, Shimon Peres, Israel's prime minister, promised that he would subject any final peace accord with the Palestinians to a<b> referendum</b>. Yasser Arafat claimed that this violates earlier agreements.<p>
Egypt's security court sentenced three <b>Muslim militants </b>to death for killing three policemen in southern Egypt in 1993.<p>
A delegation of Italian, Spanish and Irish officials, visiting Tehran, pressed<b> Iran</b> to condemn terrorism if its dialogue with the European Union is to continue.<p>
<b>South Africa</b> saw markets react calmly to the replacement of Chris Liebenberg, its non-political finance minister, by Trevor Manuel, an <font size=-1>ANC</font> man. The special ministry for reconstruction and development was abolished. It had not worked.<p>
Correction: 11 <font size=-1>ANC</font> supporters involved in a <b>South African</b> <b>massacre </b>mentioned here last week were the victims, not the perpetrators.

<h2>Shades of Waco</h2>
<p>For the second week, more than 100 <font size=-1>FBI</font> agents surrounded a remote ranch in Montana belonging to a militant group called the <b>Montana Freemen</b>. Randy Weaver, whose wife and son were killed in an <font size=-1>FBI</font> siege in Idaho in 1992, offered to mediate.<p>
In Caracas, 34 western-hemisphere countries put together an <b>anti-corruption convention</b>; 21 signed it.<p>
<b>Peru's</b> prime minister, Dante Cordova, resigned; seemingly, because he thought President Alberto Fujimori's market-freeing reforms were being pushed ahead too fast.<p>

<h2>Connecting</h2>
<p>In a deal valued at nearly $17 billion, two of America's <b>Baby Bell</b> telecoms companies are to merge for the first time to create one of the world's biggest telecoms groups, with a market value of $45 billion. For Texas-based <font size=-1>SBC</font> Communications (formerly Southwestern Bell) the main attraction of subsuming Pacific Telesis under the <font size=-1>SBC</font> name is Pacific's huge Californian market.<p>
(see <a href="wtw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>
The reopening of merger talks between Britain's two largest telecoms operators, <b>British Telecom</b> and <b>Cable and Wireless</b>, pushed their share prices up sharply. Any deal would value <font size=-1>C&W</font> at &#163;12.5 billion ($19 billion); market capitalisation of the two would be close to that of the two Baby Bells. <font size=-1>BT</font> wants <font size=-1>C&W</font>'s desirable 57.5% stake in Hongkong Telecom to create a launchpad for its ambitions in Asia.<p>
With the $8.9 billion purchase of <b>U.S. Healthcare</b>, a leading operator of health-maintenance organisations known for keeping a tight grip on medical expenses, cash-rich <b>Aetna </b>will become America's biggest medical-benefits group.<p>
<b>General Motors</b> agreed on terms to spin off its <font size=-1>EDS</font> computer-consultancy unit. They include a tax-free exchange of shares and a $500m pay-out from <font size=-1>EDS</font> to its car-making parent. <font size=-1>EDS</font> expects to benefit from its freedom; meanwhile, it announced a restructuring that will cut jobs and result in a charge in the second quarter of $500m-750m.<p>
Luxembourg-based <b>CLT</b> and the television subsidiary of <b>Bertelsmann</b>, Germany's biggest media company, are to create Europe's biggest <font size=-1>TV</font> broadcaster through a merger worth $6.6 billion. Provided regulators approve, the new company will try to extend its dominance to Europe's fledgling pay-<font size=-1>TV</font> market with help from Rupert Murdoch and Canal Plus of France.<p>
Germany's biggest industrial firm, <b>Daimler-Benz</b>, reported a DM5.7 billion ($3.9 billion) loss for 1995. The company said it would not pay a dividend for the year, but forecast a profit in 1996.

<h2>Soaring</h2>
<p>(see <a href="wtw2.gif">chart</a>)<br>
The <b>French franc</b> had its best run against the <font size=-1>D</font>-mark for nearly two years, buoyed by optimism about the French economy and a corresponding weakness in Germany's. The combination gives the French hope of some sort of monetary union being achieved on schedule. The dollar also hit a two-year high, against the yen.<p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
Despite another bank collapse, the <b>Tokyo stockmarket</b> soared to a four-year high at the beginning of a new financial year. This reflected hopes of better corporate earnings growth and an improving economy. On April 3rd the bond market wobbled after Japan's central-bank governor hinted that interest rates could soon rise.

<h2>Not very Swiss</h2>
<p>Martin Ebner, whose <font size=-1>BK</font> Vision is <b>Union Bank of Switzerland</b>'s largest shareholder and a thorn in its side, said he would oppose the election of Robert Studer, currently chief executive, as chairman at the bank's <font size=-1>AGM</font> later this month.<p>
Two huge <b>bank mergers </b>came into force. Bank of Tokyo and Mitsubishi Bank united to form Tokyo Mitsubishi Bank, the world's biggest, with &#165;75 trillion ($700 billion) of assets; and the merger of Chase Manhattan with Chemical Banking creates America's biggest bank (Chase Manhattan) with assets of $304 billion.<p>
Days after the Italian government promised a rescue, <b>Banco di Napoli</b> recorded the worst results ever run up by an Italian bank--a loss of 3.16 trillion lire ($1.94 billion) for 1995, compared with a 1.15 trillion lire loss a year earlier. The bank also said its capital base had shrunk from 3.58 trillion lire to 522 billion lire.<p>
<p>
Japan's finance ministry set up a panel to review its operations and ordered a wide-ranging review of its banking policy. Its action comes after more embarrassing incidents. Reminiscent of the $1.1 billion Daiwa fiasco, Long-Term Credit Bank of Japan admitted false reporting of bond-trading at its American unit, though no losses were incurred. And the continuing financial crisis in Japan led to the collapse of Taiheiyo Bank--only the second listed bank to go bust in 50 years.

<h2>Floating</h2>
<p>In one of the biggest public share offerings ever, Sweden's <b>Scania</b>, one of the world's largest lorry and bus makers, was valued at SKr36 billion ($5.4 billion) when 50% of it was launched by Investor, Wallenberg's investment unit, on the Stockholm and New York stock exchanges.<p>
Less than two years after the <font size=-1>QE2</font> set off on a cruise before a &#163;30m ($46m) refit was complete, resulting in &#163;7.5m paid out to passengers in compensation, <b>Cunard </b>is planning another overhaul. Peter Ward, Cunard's new head, reckons its flagship liner is worth the work.<p>
Japan's top car maker, cash-rich <b>Toyota</b>, plans to spend &#165;100 billion ($930m) on buying back 1.2% of its shares. It would be Japan's biggest-ever share buyback.<p>
<b>Car prices </b>in Europe need to be cut by at least 20% if consumers are to buy more cars, said a team of British car dealers. They reckon better distribution, fewer dealers and fewer models would help cut prices.<p>

<h1>What works?</h1>
<p><b>Many politicians assume that training is one of the best ways to get the jobless off the dole. The evidence suggests that it is not that simple</b></p>


<p>WHEN politicians who normally disagree about everything start agreeing on one particular thing, a degree of scepticism is in order. These days, they all agree that there should be more and better training. Labour ministers attending this week's " jobs summit" in the unemployment-ridden French city of Lille nodded in approval as Robert Reich, America's labour secretary, told them his country was committed to investing more in people, education and job training. This has become one of the few uncontroversial ideas about economic policy. Everywhere, governments boast of how much training they are doing and how much more they plan to do--while opposition parties (in Europe, at least) attack current programmes and future plans as hopelessly inadequate. Nobody seems to be saying that government-supported training is often a waste of money--nobody, that is, except the researchers who have examined the existing schemes.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the face of it, the case for generous public support for training is strong. Unskilled people are much more likely to be out of work than skilled ones; if only their qualifications could be improved, they might find jobs more readily. Not only would they benefit, but so would the economy as a whole. A better-trained workforce would be a more productive one; so more training ought to mean not just lower unemployment but also faster growth and higher living standards. Unions like training programmes because they can use them to push up wages. Academics like them because they increase demand for education. Parents like them because they give out-of-work, out-of-school youths something to do. Prophets of a post-modern society praise them as part of an ethic of life-long learning. And employers don't mind them because the public pays the bill.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As if all that were not enough, there is even a neat "market failure" argument to explain why privately provided training is bound to be inadequate. Why should firms pay to equip employees with improved skills when those workers can be poached at a moment's notice by competitors? The state must pay, or nobody will. Here, apparently, is a case where government intervention can do some good.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All in all, then, the case for publicly supported schemes seems solid. There is just one problem. In practice, they rarely work. </p><p><b>The evidence</b>
<br>In a growing body of research, economists have compared groups of unemployed people who enter government training schemes with similar groups who do not. In almost every case, these studies have found that the schemes have failed to improve either the earnings or the employment prospects of their clients. After surveying the results of various broadly based training programmes for unemployed adults, the training-friendly <font size=-1>OECD</font> was forced to conclude in 1994 that there is "remarkably meagre support for the hypothesis that such programmes are effective."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the United States, the Department of Labour runs $5 billion-worth of elaborate training schemes directed at the disadvantaged. How much do they help their clientele? "Zero is not a bad number," concludes James Heckman of the University of Chicago, who directed a government-financed study of the Job Training Partnership Act, America's largest such programme. It found that, for those aged under 21, training had no effect at all, and may even have caused young men to lose earnings. Adult participants, especially women, did improve their earnings--but that may have been because most of them had a child to raise, spurring them to work harder; meanwhile, those who went to "proprietary" training schools (ie, schools run for profit and linked to particular businesses) did better still. There is nothing new about this. A study of 22 pre-1977 training programmes for the poor found that while women saw some increases in earnings, the results were mixed, or even negative, for adult men and young people.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;America's second largest federal training programme, called Job Corps, is for poor youngsters who agree to leave home for training in basic skills. It has had some success. Job Corps participants are more likely to graduate from high school and earn a bit more than their equivalents. But much of the measurable benefit is due to the fact that Jobs Corps youths commit fewer crimes than their peers. In other words, the programme may succeed mainly because it keeps young people occupied, rather than because it equips them with marketable skills.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Britain's experience is similar. Youth Training, Britain's flagship programme for 16- and 17-year-olds, enrolls about 200,000 youngsters a year. A government evaluation in 1994 found that almost half of those who joined dropped out before the schemes ended. Unemployment rates of those who did finish, at 27%, were higher than for the age group as a whole.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now Britain is shifting the emphasis toward apprenticeships. These account for perhaps 20,000 places, and are based in the workplace. But these places are selective and therefore tend to serve the "ones who would have been okay anyway," according to Ianthe Maclagan of a British charity, Youthaid. For occupations such as engineering, which have traditionally hired apprentices, the government is subsidising something that would have happened anyway--albeit not to the same extent. For non-traditional apprenticeships, such as in child care and information technology, start-up problems are still being sorted out.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Britain's other big training vehicles, Training and Enterprise Councils, are private companies that contract with the government to deliver training. This year these will cost &#163;1.6 billion ($2.4 billion). But an evaluation in February by the House of Commons Select Committee on Employment found that only 27% of adults in <font size=-1>TEC</font>s courses had work; even the best courses reported a success rate of less than half. The committee concluded that the <font size=-1>TEC</font>s may have made a "modest contribution" to the economy, but that "their performance in placing people in work and gaining qualifications appears to reflect economic conditions, and not to overcome them."
</p><p><b>Straining schemes</b>
<br>Summing up the British experience in a paper for the London-based Employment Policy Institute, Peter Robinson of the London School of Economics argues that, after accounting for "deadweight" (programmes helping those who would have found jobs anyway) and "substitution" (finding work at other people's expense), hardly any benefit remains from Britain's training schemes. And part of what does remain seems to come from a small, but telling detail: a few hints about deportment and interview skills go a long way. A notable experiment in America compared one group of unemployed people who received job-search advice with another that got advice plus a place on a training scheme. There was no difference in employment or earnings between the two.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Back in the 1980s, Australia's Bureau of Labour Market Research did long-term, rigorous studies of its government job-creation schemes. The results were so embarrassingly bad, claims Judith Sloan of the National Institute of Labour Research, that the bureau was shut down. Now Australia is investing about A$10 billion ($7.8 billion) over four years in job training. It is too soon to say whether the "Working Nation" scheme is succeeding, though it does seem to have helped to nudge the long-term unemployed to the front of the jobs queue through generous wage-subsidies. SkillShare, a non-profit organisation that trains disadvantaged workers for specific jobs at employers' request, is also promising.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Do these provide counter-examples of government-backed training schemes that work? Not necessarily. In both cases, substitution effects may be occurring, and there are complaints from the unemployed that they are being recycled from training schemes to short-term subsidised jobs and back again. Converting long-term unemployed into short-term unemployed serves a political purpose--to be seen to be doing something for the long-term jobless. And, by maintaining some contact between the unemployed and the world of work, it serves an economic purpose too, but a disappointingly limited one. Of five Australian training programmes studied during 1989-92, only one could report that at least half of its participants were either working or studying three months after completion.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A final piece of evidence comes from Sweden, which also spends lavishly on training the unemployed, and is beginning to wonder whether the policy is worth it. Sweden's parliament commissioned three economists to study the country's long-admired "active labour-market programmes", including job-search assistance, training and relief work. The authors concluded in 1995 that while retraining might raise, slightly, the chances of employment, it does so at higher cost, and to less effect, than simple job-search advice.
</p><p><b>A broken model</b>
<br>So much for the big government-financed training schemes. What about the biggest single scheme of all, Germany's highly regarded "dual-education system"? Under this system, most German 16-year-olds sign an apprenticeship contract with a local firm to work part-time, for below entry-level wages, in return for training at the firm. The rest of the time they go to a vocational school (eg, one for insurance, another for chemists) run by the local government. When the apprentice-pupils finish, most get--or used to get--jobs either with their employer, or at least in their field. There are a lot of good things in the German model, but this is not a government training scheme in the ordinary sense.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Rather, it a company apprenticeship scheme inextricably tied to the education system. Apprenticeships take place in a workplace, not at a training centre. Part of the cost is borne by the apprentices themselves, in the form of reduced wages and forgone opportunities. The largest chunk comes from businesses: of the total of DM312 billion ($211 billion) spent on all education in Germany in 1993, DM67 billion was spent by companies on vocational training. The teachers who train the apprentices at work are paid by the firms themselves; examinations under the system are set up by local Chambers of Commerce.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The system is certainly better than most. It provides firms with a supply of qualified workers. Through their influence over the curriculum, employers (who know what sorts of jobs will be needed in future) can ensure that school-leavers have the skills needed to do new jobs--in theory anyway. For their part, apprentices get a skill that should be marketable and gain experience of how companies really work.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such a scheme, which has its roots in Germany's consensus system of rule linking companies, unions and government, would be extremely hard for others to copy. But even if they could, it is doubtful whether they should. The system is not a solution to unemployment, something particularly apparent now that German unemployment has hit a post-war high of over 4m (11.1%). Almost half of Germany's unemployed are graduates of work-based apprenticeships; the problem is that once they have to be paid adult wages, many are too expensive to keep on. In this sense, one of the main benefits of the "dual-education system" is nothing to do with skills: it merely provides cheap labour--but only for a short time. Germany's construction workers, for example, are probably better trained than British or Polish ones. But 90,000 German builders are now sitting at home, while twice as many foreigners toil on German building sites. For jobless German brickies, meticulous training has not kept the dole at bay.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Young Germans have become so sceptical that apprenticeships will deliver a stable, well-paid job that most now prefer to go to the country's lacklustre universities, hoping to increase their chances of getting skilled employment by having two qualifications. In 1993, for the first time, more people went to university (1.9m) than into the dual education system (1.8m). Also for the first time, the number of those seeking places in the system began to fall.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Employers remain supportive but increasingly critical: they complain that it can take years--even decades--to change the curriculum, leaving training toiling in the wake of technological change. Worse, the system churns out lots of skilled blue-collar workers suitable for the super-engineering businesses that made German industry great (luxury cars, machine tools). But it churns out relatively few lesser-skilled but flexible workers able to switch easily from one task to another, which is what is needed now by businesses using intelligent computer-controlled machinery. Worse still, it churns out even fewer low-skilled (and therefore cheap) workers that German businesses need to cut labour costs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Meanwhile, German training programmes outside the dual-education system show the same gloomy results as everywhere else. The <font size=-1>OECD</font> reported research that evaluated four German programmes--two offering further training and two retraining for the unemployed. The result: "No type of training was found to have any significant impact on the flows out of either short- or long-term unemployment, nor on the flows into unemployment."
</p><p><b>Literacy or bust</b>
<br>Does this mean that (job counselling apart) government-backed training schemes are doomed to fail? No. Some do work. They tend to be small, expensive and with strong links to local employers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In California, San Jose's Centre for Employment Training drew up individual plans for its participants, and then connected them to local employers with jobs to offer. Three years later, graduates were earning much more than similar workers. Unemployed Canadians did well under a scheme to help employers fill jobs that required scarce skills. Australians in SkillShare who were referred directly to employers were far more likely to get and keep a job than their fellow SkillSharers. The bits of America's Job Training Partnership Act devoted to on-the-job training for people ready to work did quite well--for example, training women to be licensed practical nurses in nearby hospitals.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Schemes such as this, by their nature, cannot hope to have more than a marginal impact on unemployment. Larger-scale training programmes devoted to the uneducated, unskilled and jobless might hope to make a bigger difference--but, as the evidence shows, do not.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Often, this may be because the skills that matter are more elementary than those taught in training schemes. If so, the priority should be to improve basic education and so reduce the numbers of hard-to-employ earlier in life. In a report released in January, Industry in Education, a British employers' group, said that what they really needed was not more skills training, but people able to address an envelope. An <font size=-1>OECD</font> survey released in December suggests that complaints about basic literacy are widespread even in countries with nominally high literacy rates. In Sweden, which came off best, one in 12 men could not understand the instructions on an aspirin bottle; in the Netherlands, the figure was one in ten; in Germany one in seven; and in Canada and America one in five.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is a good case for providing education in basic literacy and numeracy for adults who need it. But do not expect too much. Many of those who have spent ten or more years in full-time education without learning to read or add up may be beyond help of this sort. "Persons from disadvantaged environments are not very malleable after their late teens or perhaps their early 20s," warns Chicago's Mr Heckman.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Anti-unemployment policy would fare better by concentrating on lowering the costs of employment. This can be done through subsidy, lower taxes, deregulation or some mixture of the three. Apprenticeship programmes in Spain and Germany, and Australia's Jobstart, a wage subsidy programme, show that the demand for lower-skilled labour does exist, provided that the cost is not too high.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Once in work, on-the-job training (as opposed to out-of-a-job training) brings clear improvements in productivity and wages. That is true even for low-wage jobs. A study that followed American minimum-wage workers found that after three years of work, only 15% were still working in minimum-wage positions--and for many of those, the job was a second, part-time one. The rest had moved on. Research on income movements in Britain, Germany and the Nordic countries has found that workers move up and down the income ladder about as briskly as Americans. For those in work, then, in-house training seems to help mobility.
</p><p><b>Summing up</b>
<br>Does that support the "market failure" argument that government intervention is needed because firms will not train workers who will readily leave? Hardly. In-house training benefits companies as well as workers. That is why firms do it. Intel, for example, an American chip-maker, has a more or less continuous retraining programme, enabling the firm to adapt to the volatility of the chip business. Mass-training schemes administered by civil servants cannot meet such needs. This is a reason employers prefer to take raw recruits and train them the company way, rather than take on training-scheme graduates.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The conclusion seems to be that the supposed market failure of training is greatly exaggerated: firms will train workers, despite the risk of poaching, provided that workers are willing to meet some of the cost through lower wages, and/or that the skills concerned are firm-specific (ie, not easily sold to another employer). For most workers in most firms, these conditions are met: that is why in-company training is alive and well without benefit of public subsidy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Where government-supported training programmes have succeeded they have been either small and focused, concentrating on helping people search for work, or else they have equipped people with basic skills. Arguably, the closer training is to general education (as in Germany), the more likely it is to succeed. But even if education and training are working as they should, expect no miraculous falls in unemployment until the costs of labour to employers, and the benefits of labour to workers, have been shifted to levels the market will bear.

<p><b>Huttonomics</b></p>
<h1>Triumph of the Will</h1>

<p>THE transformation of Will Hutton from humble television reporter to Britain's leading leftist guru took another step forward on March 29th with his appointment as editor of the<i> Observer</i>. The loss-making Sunday newspaper hopes to tap a rich vein of success. Mr Hutton's book, " The State We're In", has sold more than 125,000 copies. Many give Mr Hutton the credit for inspiring Tony Blair's big idea, the "stakeholder society".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is all very odd. Mr Hutton did not invent the stakeholder idea: it goes way back. He did not even rediscover it: the idea had never faded away. Oddest of all, given Mr Hutton's supposedly inspirational role, he and Mr Blair disagree about nearly everything. They share a preference for constitutional change and a vocation to transform all our lives for the better, but otherwise have nothing in common.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What matters about Mr Blair is his willingness to accept most of the Tories' economic reforms. By "stakeholder society", he seems to mean only that Labour will try harder to help the poor, the unemployed and the disadvantaged. He has avoided suggesting that he wants to reform the basic workings of the economy. But that is precisely what Mr Hutton advocates.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He does not mince words about this. Unimpressed by evidence that Britain's economy has become much more competitive since the 1970s, that the City of London is envied the world over and that public services have become more efficient than before, Mr Hutton argues that the country's economic, political and social institutions require far-reaching reform. So far-reaching that other countries have achieved similar change only after "defeat in war, economic collapse or revolution".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In developing these arguments, Mr Hutton's trademark is to link, and thereby explain, apparently disparate events by means of cod economic theory and an encompassing loathing for "Thatcherism", the cause of all bad things. His ingenuity in application of this method knows no bounds. He recently discussed the massacre of schoolchildren in Dunblane in the context of Britain's "winner-take-all culture", with reference to economic theories of trust. These theories are not fully bogus: he isn't just making them up. But they were devised to explain why businesses succeed, not the behaviour of homicidal maniacs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unlike Mr Blair, Mr Hutton objects to the government's anti-inflation policies. He favours a "Keynesian" fiscal boost to promote full employment. He differs, too, in regarding fundamental changes in the financing and management of firms as crucial to the creation of a stakeholder society.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In a review for <i>Prospect</i> of "The Blair Revolution", a book by Peter Mandelson and Roger Liddle (close advisers to Mr Blair), Mr Hutton approved of the authors' attacks on short-termism in the City of London, but not the "minimalist stakeholder reforms" they proposed. (They, in turn, accused him of using "pseudo-Marxist language".) He wants the state to encourage investors to act like committed long-term owners; to expand the supply of cheap, long-term debt; to make firms lower the returns they expect from investing; and to make employers more loyal to their workers. If this is stakeholding, Mr Blair wants nothing to do with it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the<i> Observer</i> Mr Hutton has a chance to put his theories to work. Presumably, the paper's returns are already adequately low. Radical reform is bound to be needed, though, because it is always needed. The task will be to combine it with due respect for the networks of loyalty and trust that define the ethos of the institution (Fukuyama, <i>passim</i>). Radicalism without change, that is the challenge. Good luck to him.

<h1>Manufacturing growth</h1>


BRITISH manufacturing output has increased by a modest 21% since 1980. But the productivity of manufacturers (how many units of output they produce from given inputs of labour and capital) has soared. Labour productivity (output per employee) has more than doubled (see <a href="br1.gif">chart</a>). In the 1980s, this was dubbed the "productivity miracle". Today, economists are finding less metaphysical reasons for the improvement.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In "Productivity Growth," a paper presented at the Royal Economic Society conference on April 2nd, Gavin Cameron, an economist at Oxford University, explores the causes of higher productivity in each of the 19 industries that make up the manufacturing sector. Every industry has enjoyed dramatically faster productivity growth since 1980 than it did in the 1970s. Falling employment was a common factor. But beyond that, the reasons for the change varied from one industry to the next.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;De-unionisation, which has been rapid since the early 1980s, was crucial in engineering, one of the most heavily unionised industries. But in chemicals, where union membership was lower, further decline had little effect on productivity. Intriguingly, in electronics, greater unionisation appeared to raise productivity. This may have been due to the spread of single union deals with benefits linked to higher productivity, reckons Mr Cameron.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Increased spending on research and development was influential in metals and minerals, chemicals and electronics. However, many of the industries enjoyed no significant productivity boost from higher <font size=-1>R&D</font>--although these were mostly the ones that spent relatively little on it. Higher average skills and qualifications were particularly important in boosting productivity in electronics.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour-productivity growth has slowed during the past year: manufacturing output has been flat and employment in manufacturing has increased for the first time in many years. Will the improvement seen in the 1980s prove a one-off? Only time will tell.

<p><b>Local elections</b></p>
<h1>May mayhem </h1>


<p>BRIAN MAWHINNEY, the Tory chairman, has recently claimed that his party is on the road to electoral recovery. But some 700 Tory councillors may disagree if, as seems likely, they lose their seats in next month's local elections, for which nominations closed on April 3rd.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Despite Mr Mawhinney's heroic optimism, the Tories are facing another sharp electoral rebuke. Most of the seats up for grabs on May 2nd were last contested just four weeks after the Tory triumph in the 1992 general election. Labour then was demoralised and dejected, and the party's vote slumped. The Tories' victory was equivalent to a huge national lead of 15 percentage points, compared with eight points in the general election .
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now those Conservative gains have to be defended in a harsher political climate. Although the Tories have done better in local by-elections (see <a href="br4.html">box</a>), and although opinion polls show Labour's lead cut by three points since Christmas, Labour remains 22 points ahead.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour's performance in local elections since 1992 has yet to match its national poll ratings. But even if the gap between the two is the same this year as it was last, Labour can still expect to secure the equivalent of an 18-point national lead. That means a swing to Labour of 16.5% since the 1992 local elections. The Liberal Democrats can also expect more votes. That is why the Tories may lose as many as 700 of the 1,100 seats they are defending.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ironically, even such drastic losses will not actually shift power in many town halls. Labour already has majority control of 31 of the 36 metropolitan districts outside London where elections are taking place, and ten of the 14 new unitary councils. In the rest of the metropolitan districts no party now has overall control. But with just one-third of seats to be contested in most places, the only significant Labour gain is likely to be Trafford, a once solidly Tory suburb just south of Manchester.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the 100 less powerful non-metropolitan districts the pattern is more mixed: 36 of these are already controlled by Labour and 16 by the Liberal Democrats. The Conservatives are defending just four non-metropolitan districts, with no political party enjoying control of the rest. In three of the four, Broxbourne, Macclesfield and Runnymede, the Tory majority looks vulnerable. John Major's best hope of avoiding a wipe-out rests on the Tories' ability to cling on to his own local council, Huntingdon.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour has a good chance of wresting control of Basildon, famous as the home of upwardly-mobile "Essex man", who supposedly delivered victory to Margaret Thatcher. And the Liberal Democrats need only a small swing to win control of middle-class Tunbridge Wells, which now seems on the whole to be fairly disgusted with the Tories. With the Conservatives set for another resounding rejection by new as well as long-established Tory areas, even Mr Mawhinney must, in his heart, be wondering whether they stand a ghost of a chance at the general election.

<h1>Up the Tories</h1>

<p>THE Conservatives face a setback in local elections on May 2nd. But they are at least making some headway in local by-elections, which occur when a councillor quits or dies. The latest of <i>The Economist</i>'s quarterly surveys of such by-elections shows that the Tories polled 32% of the vote in Jan-March 1996 (see <a href="br2.gif">chart</a>), putting them just three percentage points behind Labour.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Tories have been trumpeting their gains in local by-elections recently. Some commentators doubt whether they are significant. By-elections are not held where a seat falls vacant which would be filled within six months at a regular council election. This means that in local by-elections the Tories are not now having to defend seats which they won at their high point in May 1992, because these seats are due to be contested again on May 2nd. This has automatically cut Tory losses in by-elections.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor should too much weight be placed on the increase in their share of the vote. This depends on which particular seats fall vacant in a given quarter, which is subject to random variation. The sample is also small.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even so, Downing Street should be encouraged by the latest results. The Tories have not won as big a slice of the votes since the fourth quarter of 1992. With the Liberal Democrat vote solid, Labour, with 35% of the total, is down sharply on its 1995 average of nearly 43%.

<p><b>Sentencing</b></p>
<h1>Howard's way</h1>


<p>THE much-trailed white paper on sentencing policy, published on April 3rd by Michael Howard, the home secretary, has more to do with politics than crime.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The white paper proposes minimum prison sentences of three years for persistent burglars, seven years for drug dealers and mandatory life sentences for violent and sex offenders on a second conviction. These might deter some criminals, if such sentences ever become law, but that is unlikely. The white paper is aimed more at public opinion than parliamentary draughtsmen. Mr Howard's bill would be bitterly opposed by a broad coalition of the judiciary, prison governors and penal reformers. Even if this Parliament runs its full course until May next year there will be little time to get the bill passed, especially because it will face considerable obstacles, not least in the House of Lords.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Howard knows this. But he is less concerned with getting his ideas on to the statute books than in getting them into his party's next election manifesto. The government's record on crime allows for no complacency. Although falling recently, since 1980, recorded crime has doubled while the number of those convicted or cautioned fell by 6%. None of this is much to crow about, especially for a party which prides itself on its reputation for law and order. Nor for a home secretary on the right of his party with leadership ambitions.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tougher sentences will do nothing to improve conviction rates. In fact, they could reduce them further by discouraging accused people from confessing or plea bargaining. And there must be a question over whether wild swings in penal policy achieve anything other than to undermine public confidence in the entire criminal justice system. As Lord Taylor, the Lord Chief Justice, noted recently, Britain has had more Criminal Justice Acts in the past six years than in the previous 60 years. Only five years ago, the 1991 Criminal Justice Act aimed to reduce the numbers of those given custodial sentences on the grounds that prison simply did not work.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Howard has now set off on precisely the opposite course, with no evidence that it will do anything to reduce crime. Incarcerating thousands of young men for longer and longer periods would be expensive. The white paper admits that the prison population, already at a record 52,000, would increase by a quarter over the next decade if Mr Howard gets his way on sentences. At least 20 more prisons would also be needed to house maybe 13,000 new prisoners at a cost to the taxpayer in the peak years around 2010 of about &#163;500m a year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Howard does have a legitimate point when it comes to the lack of progression in sentencing for crimes such as burglary and drug dealing. Home Office statistics show that the average length of sentence for a persistent burglar (seven or more convictions) in Crown Courts in 1993-94 was 19.4 months, barely three months more than that handed down for a first offence.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the white paper's proposal for a minimum three-year sentence combined with no automatic early release is a crude way to deal with this. Sentencing guidelines set by the Court of Appeal, as Labour has proposed, make more sense. Faced with a drug addict who needs treatment, rather than a three-year incarceration for burglary, a judge would still have the discretion to impose a non-custodial sentence combined with a treatment order. Mr Howard has brushed aside such arguments. He is after headlines, not justice.

<p><b>Railtrack</b></p>
<h1>Labour shunt</h1>

<p>AFTER months of internal agonising, Labour's committment to "a publicly owned, publicly accountable railway" has vanished in a puff of political smoke. The gritty realities of New Labour were revealed on March 29th by Clare Short, the party's transport spokesperson, in a speech which skirted around the merits of public ownership in favour of more regulation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The decision is a victory for Gordon Brown and his shadow Treasury team over John Prescott, the party's deputy leader, who had championed ways of regaining public control over the rail network. Several devices had been proposed, among them forcing Railtrack's investors to accept non-voting preference shares or redirecting public subsidy to increase control over Railtrack. But they were all rejected by the party's leadership as either dangerously confiscatory or hugely expensive.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The tacit acceptance of privatisation has gone down badly with Labour's left wing. "To back away from our commitment to a publicly owned railway in this way is very worrying," said one disgruntled shadow cabinet member. The rail unions, enraged by Labour's backtracking, will continue to campaign for the publicly owned railway promised with enthusiasm by successive party conferences.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Instead of renationalisation, the party is now promising high levels of public subsidy and more regulation to achieve an integrated railway system. Public ownership was dismissed by Ms Short as a second-order issue dependent on "the availability of resources, and as priorities allow." For the moment, Labour is placing its hopes on widening the powers of the rail regulator to enable him to direct Railtrack's investment spending, to clawback profits from its disposal of surplus property and to control track-access charges.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This sounds draconian, but in reality it is not much different from the Tories' approach. The rail regulator already has extensive powers to control charges, fares and investment levels. If Labour had really wanted to keep the rail network in the public sector, it could have done so. A threat to impose an annual levy on Railtrack, equivalent to any profit it proposed to distribute to shareholders in dividends, would have brought privatisation to an abrupt halt. Even the party's initial plan to reduce Railtrack's access charges in order to maximise track usage would have given investors real cause for worry. As it is, Labour's current plans will merely depress Railtrack's launch share price without adding much to investors' long-term risks.

<h1>The lure of distance</h1>

NEW YORK<p><b>In general, the further a telephone call travels, the more profitable it is. Telecoms companies around the world are now scampering to take advantage of this. But how long will it last?</b></p>


<p>THIS spring the world's telephone lines are abuzz with telecoms firms whispering sweet nothings in each other's ears. In America, <font size=-1>SBC</font> Communications and Pacific Telesis, two big local telephone firms (or " Baby Bells"), are merging to create a telecoms giant worth $45 billion. Some of the other five Baby Bells--notably Nynex and Bell Atlantic--are also thought to be dialing up dates with each other. And across the Atlantic, a mooted merger between British Telecom (<font size=-1>BT</font>) and Cable and Wireless (<font size=-1>C&W</font>) would hand <font size=-1>BT</font> control of Hongkong Telecom, the island's dominant carrier, and create an Anglo-Asian colossus valued at some $55 billion.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At first glance, these appear to be very different kinds of deals, but they share a common fixation: the lure of long-distance telephony. Although the cost of transmitting a long-distance telephone call is usually no greater than that for a local call, telephone calls are priced by distance (as well as by time). In the United States, domestic long-distance calls yield gross profit margins of well over 40%, and international calls can be even more profitable. Even better, in most telephone markets, the volume of long-distance and international calls is increasing much faster than local ones.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The hitch is that this telephonic treasure trove is currently split between a series of different local, long-distance and overseas telephone companies, depending on the kind of call and the route it takes. The basic aim of the new mergers is to grab a bigger slice of revenues from each call--ideally by carrying it from end to end.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>BT</font> has been crafting a strategy to grab a larger share of international call revenues since 1993, when it paid $4.3 billion for a 20% stake in <font size=-1>MCI</font>, America's second-biggest long-distance telephone company. Since then, <font size=-1>BT</font> has formed alliances with utilities such as Viag and <font size=-1>RWE</font>, whose fibre-optic networks <font size=-1>BT</font> hopes will help it conquer the lucrative German market when Europe's telecoms industry is deregulated in 1998. Merging with <font size=-1>C&W</font>, in which Germany's fibre-optic-rich Veba has a 10.5% stake, might also help that cause. And--Hongkong Telecom aside--the deal would also allow <font size=-1>BT</font>, aided by <font size=-1>C&W</font>'s extensive undersea fibre-optic network, to win business in Asia.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>SBC</font>'s $16.7 billion takeover of PacTel, unveiled on April 1st, has a little to do with opportunism: PacTel looks weak and cheap. But the main strategic benefit will come from long-distance and international calls. A fifth of America's calls to Asia, and more than half of those to Mexico, originate on the duo's home patch--and the new group will be able to consolidate its Mexican strength thanks to <font size=-1>SBC</font>'s 10% stake in Telefonos de Mexico. At the same time, the merger will cut billing costs and other overheads, giving PacTel and <font size=-1>SBC</font> the financial muscle and economies of scale to compete in the long-distance market--and, in time, to attract an overseas partner.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Will these mergers achieve their goal? The way in which telephone revenues are shared out is a complicated business. Overseas calls are passed from one country to another according to a system of international accounting rates, which usually splits the price for handling the call between the dominant telecoms operator in each country. If there is an imbalance in payments between operators at the end of the year, a settlement is paid to even things up--usually by the firm which charges its customers the lowest rates. In America's case, its long-distance telecoms firms run a $4-billion-a-year "deficit" with the rest of the world that eats into their (still healthy) profits from the business.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is also a carve-up within America's domestic market. Of every dollar of domestic revenues the long-distance firms earn, about 45 cents is paid to the Baby Bells, which until recently had a monopoly on the local portion of each call. But since the passage of America's telecoms bill earlier this year, the Baby Bells and the long-distance carriers have been allowed to compete on each other's telephonic turf; the chief aim of both groups is to get their hands on the long-distance business.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A particular target of telecoms firms fascinated by distance are large multinational customers. After all, such companies pay hefty telephone bills to a gaggle of local and international carriers around the world. The theory: rather than deal with a dozen or more telephone firms, multinationals can simply call a single telecoms giant and sign up for both global and local services.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Internationally, the first ventures to connect with this market were Concert, <font size=-1>MCI</font>'s global alliance with <font size=-1>BT</font>, and <font size=-1>AT&T</font>'s WorldPartners alliance with Japan's <font size=-1>KDD</font> and others. In February, Sprint, America's third-biggest long-distance carrier, closed a deal to sell 10% stakes in itself to both France T&eacutel&eacutecom and Deutsche Telekom for $1.8 billion apiece. The threesome has formed Global One, selling telecoms services to clients such as <font size=-1>LVMH</font> M&ouml;et-Hennessy Louis Vuitton and the Swedish government.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In time, these ventures promise business (and, eventually, non-business) customers much more than plain old telephone services. Sprint talks excitedly about integrating products such as e-mail and voicemail. <font size=-1>MCI</font> is spicing up its services with Internet and networking products based largely on software made by Microsoft (with which it formed an alliance in January), and served up with the help of <font size=-1>SHL</font> Systemhouse, a big computer-services group <font size=-1>MCI</font> bought for $1.1 billion last November. And <font size=-1>AT&T</font>, in an on-again, off-again alliance with <font size=-1>IBM</font>, is building a host of corporate Internet services based on the Notes software developed by Big Blue's Lotus Development subsidiary.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How much all these grand plans will ever amount to is hard to gauge. Concert earned revenues of only $228m in 1995, barely a beep in <font size=-1>MCI</font>'s and <font size=-1>BT</font>'s combined total sales of close to $40 billion. The venture does, however, have more than $1 billion-worth of contracts in the bag--although these are unlikely to turn much of a profit until the end of the decade. Global One boasts that revenues in its first year will total $800m.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<font size=-1>AT&T</font>'s alliance, by contrast, seems to be little more than a marketing venture. To make it pay, the company really needs to take a stake in an overseas telecoms firm. <font size=-1>AT&T</font> has shown interest in buying Britain's Mercury Communications from Cable and Wireless, which will have to sell <font size=-1>BT</font>'s biggest domestic rival if it merges with <font size=-1>BT</font>. Fearful of ending up with <font size=-1>AT&T</font> as its biggest competitor, <font size=-1>BT</font> is doing its best to make sure that Mercury gets sold to somebody--anybody--else (see <a href="wb2.html">box</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is easy to understand why ambitious telecoms giants are so enchanted by the long-distance and international market: big profits, big customers and a big pot in which to dip their greedy hands. Contrast that with local telephone services: in most rich countries these are growing slowly, if at all, and will largely remain highly regulated. Local calls may generate 50% more revenue than long-distance calls in America, but winning new growth in the market--or breaking an incumbent's stranglehold--is prohibitively expensive.
</p><p><b>The death of distance</b></b>
<br>There are, however, two big drawbacks to going long rather than local. The first is that big telecoms firms are not the only ones to have spotted the golden opportunities. One set of rivals consists of the various international "call-back" services that undercut telecoms tariffs by a huge margin. Call-back firms already sell over $300m of calls each year, mostly to the same corporate customers being courted by telecoms giants. And other cut-price rivals abound, including "systems integrators" that buy long-distance capacity in bulk from telecoms firms, reselling it to customers at big discounts, and the cable <font size=-1>TV</font> companies that are plotting to offer cheap telephone services down their lines.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, the bigger threat could be the Internet (ironically one of the areas in which every telecoms company is trying to prove its prowess). Telephone calls made over the Internet, using software such as that sold by America's VocalTec, are unlikely to prove a direct threat to telecoms companies, mainly because the Net simply does not have the capacity to handle large call volumes. But Internet calls, which cost customers the same regardless of whether they are international or local, are starting to make a nonsense of the concept of charging for distance--just as <font size=-1>PC</font>s made the idea of paying for time on a shared mainframe computer obsolete.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As more of the world's messages--be they spoken or written--are carried via a network that imposes incremental charges for neither distance nor time, the pressure on long-distance and international call tariffs will intensify. Worse, the biggest users of the Internet are the very companies telecoms firms hope will buy their new global and long-distance offerings. Add to all this the effects of competition and deregulation, and the long-distance and global telephone market starts to look less like a growth business and more like a commodity combat zone.

<h1>A match made in heaven</h1>
<p>BRITISH TELECOM, or <font size=-1>BT</font> as it now likes to be known, is a big fish in a small pond. With a market capitalisation of &#163;24 billion ($37 billion), it is far and away Britain's biggest telephone company. But it is not quite big enough to become the all-embracing, global telephone company it has long wanted to be. A merger with Cable and Wireless (<font size=-1>C&W</font>), a British telephone company operating in around 50 countries, and worth around &#163;12 billion, would change all that. But will it go ahead?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They seem to make a perfect match. <font size=-1>BT</font> dominates Britain and is strong in America and Europe. <font size=-1>C&W</font> has a lucrative 57.5% stake in Hongkong Telecom, and a string of operations in emerging markets in the Caribbean and Asia. Analysys, a British consultancy, reckons that by 2005 developing countries will make up 30% of the projected $900 billion worldwide telecoms market, up from 16% of around $520 billion in revenues today.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, romances that everybody wants to happen have a habit of either not coming off or taking a long time to totter to the altar. The first problem is price. At least twice before, discussions foundered over <font size=-1>BT</font>'s valuation of the smaller company. With <font size=-1>C&W</font> worth less than &#163;10 billion before talks began, <font size=-1>BT</font> is unlikely to offer more than &#163;11.5 billion; <font size=-1>C&W</font> is rumoured to want &#163;13 billion.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The deal also requires some complicated financial engineering. The rules of Hong Kong's stock exchange force anyone acquiring <font size=-1>C&W</font> to buy the remaining 42.5% of Hongkong Telecom--thus adding an intimidating &#163;6 billion to the final price. That means that the deal will probably have to be structured so that <font size=-1>C&W</font> actually ends up buying <font size=-1>BT</font>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The next problem is Britain's antitrust regulators. <font size=-1>C&W</font> owns 80% of Mercury, Britain's second-largest telephone operator; this must now be sold--probably for around &#163;2.5 billion or so. The list of potential suitors includes <font size=-1>AT&T</font>, America's biggest long-distance company which is moving into Europe quickly, and a consortia of American companies which own British cable-television operators. <font size=-1>BT</font>'s favourite appears to be Deutsche Telekom--for three reasons. First, it does not want to help <font size=-1>AT&T</font>. Second, there is a chance that favouring Germany's state-owned telecoms operator might ease <font size=-1>BT</font>'s own entry into the German market. And, lastly, Deutsche Telekom is unlikely to be a particularly fierce competitor.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are other, smaller, complications. <font size=-1>C&W</font> Inc, a small but profitable long-distance carrier based in Virginia, will probably need to be sold to satisfy local regulators. And <font size=-1>BT</font> and <font size=-1>C&W</font> may have to choose between the various alliances they have formed with rival utilities in Germany. Here the survivor is likely to be <font size=-1>C&W</font>'s partner, Veba, which has a 10.5% stake in <font size=-1>C&W</font>; that will not please <font size=-1>BT</font>'s partners, <font size=-1>RWE</font> and Viag, both of which are building networks of their own. It will be a long way to the altar.</td></tr></table>

THE initial shock of last week's revelations about the transmissibility of mad-cow disease to humans has faded. Unfortunately, it is giving way not to a sober assessment of choices, but to a party-political quarrel of dispiriting, albeit predictable, vapidity. The Labour Party charges the government with "reckless disregard" for public safety and excessive zeal for deregulation. The Tories reply with accusations of scaremongering. British beef is safe, the government says. To imply otherwise supposedly shows reckless disregard for the economy; with Europe ganging up on us (the European Union has imposed a worldwide ban on exports of British beef), to do so is also downright unpatriotic.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is unfair to accuse the Tories of recklessness, and fatuous to connect the <font size=-1>BSE</font> scare with deregulation. But in learning lessons from what has happened, and in deciding what to do next, the government does need to accept that mistakes have been made. This is a time when a little wisdom among Britain's political leaders would go a long way. In the past week, Britain's citizens have looked for it in vain.
</p><p><b>Past and present</b>
<br>Two questions remain uppermost in people's minds. First, did they or their families become infected with the human equivalent of <font size=-1>BSE</font> during the 1980s, before the government introduced measures to prevent suspect material entering the food chain? Second, is there still a risk from eating beef?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In answer to the first, the government has said almost nothing. This is understandable, because there is little to say that is reassuring. Too little is known about <font size=-1>BSE</font> and its human counterpart, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (<font size=-1>CJD</font>), to tell how many people (if any) have already caught it from beef. Most experts now accept that exposure to <font size=-1>BSE</font> may cause <font size=-1>CJD</font>--the finding that sparked the current uproar--but even this is uncertain. If infection is possible, crucial questions remain. Does susceptibility depend on the victim's genetic make-up? How long and how variable is the incubation period? And so on. Without answers, there is no basis for estimating how bad an outbreak might be. Up to a point, the reasons long advanced for thinking that humans could not be infected by <font size=-1>BSE</font> suggest that an epidemic is unlikely. However, these arguments are not conclusive. Research is under way, but the answers will come slowly (see <a href="sf1.html">pages</a>). For now, the only real guide to the scale of the problem will be the rate at which new cases of anomalous <font size=-1>CJD</font> appear over the next year or two.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Has enough been done to ensure that beef is now safe? Undoubtedly, due to measures introduced in the late 1980s, it is much safer than before. The chief risk is that the new rules will not be complied with, either because of evasion or because meat for consumption becomes accidentally contaminated by infected offal (abattoirs are not operating theatres). Stricter supervision might reduce but not eliminate the first; as for the second, on any policy short of total destruction of Britain's cattle, at least some infected cows (not yet showing symptoms) will find their way into abattoirs. In short, if <font size=-1>BSE</font> causes <font size=-1>CJD</font>, there will be new victims despite the measures. But the number will be tiny in relation to the number (if any) who have already caught <font size=-1>CJD</font> from beef.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Evidently, a lot depends on what you mean by "safe". Three months ago the health secretary, Stephen Dorrell, said that "we've removed from the human food chain the organs that could conceivably be linked to a transmission". Even before last week's revelations, that was an egregious remark: it was and is conceivable that <font size=-1>BSE</font> might be transmitted not merely by contamination of otherwise safe meat but also through offal such as liver, through nervous tissue in steak, and even through milk. These last three are very, very unlikely, but that is all one can say. This week Mr Dorrell adjusted his vocabulary, and talked about "safe in the common usage of the term". On that definition, British beef probably is now safe.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This more careful use of language is welcome. If the government is to restore its credibility, it must seek chiefly to inform, not to reassure by whatever means. Yet it keeps forgetting this. The current wavering over a selective cull of Britain's cattle is being presented not as a matter of balancing cost against additional safety--which is how it should be judged--but as a question of how to "restore confidence" (see <a href="br1.html">page</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This has been the government's biggest mistake throughout. The charge of recklessness is unfair because ministers have, on the whole, reacted promptly to new scientific advice. With hindsight, they should have tried to eradicate <font size=-1>BSE</font> when it was first identified in 1986, but at the time the decision not to do so was reasonable. Even without benefit of hindsight, the government should have done more to spur research on <font size=-1>BSE</font> and <font size=-1>CJD</font>. It should have enforced its post-1986 regulations more effectively. And it should have planned for the contingency that <font size=-1>BSE</font> might after all cause <font size=-1>CJD</font>. It is astonishing that the government, if its statements of the past week are any guide, was entirely unprepared for that possibility.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These mistakes all flow from the same source: a reluctance to take seriously a tiny, but greater-than-zero, risk of a dreadful outcome. This reluctance, in turn, was presumably based on "the damage to confidence" that would result from acknowledging, exploring and discussing the risk. Apparently, despite everything, British ministers are not yet ready to abandon that attitude.

<h2>Europe disposes</h2>
The European Union imposed a worldwide ban on exports of beef from Britain after the British government conceded a possible link between a new strain of the deadly Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease and eating beef products infected with <font size=-1>BSE</font>, known as <b>mad-cow disease</b>. British ministers claimed that the country's beef is safe. But a large part of Britain's almost 12m-strong cattle herd may have to be destroyed before the ban is lifted.
<p>An inter-governmental conference was due to open in Turin on March 29th to map out the <b>European Union's future</b>. The conference--with foreign ministers due to meet monthly--is expected to run for at least a year.
<p>The <font size=-1>IMF</font> voted to approve a $10.1 billion three-year <b>loan to Russia</b>. But it said the disbursement of the money might be halted if a future Russian government implemented "communist" economic policies. The terms of the loan oblige Russia to restrict monetary growth and to reduce import tariffs.</p>
<p>France again refused to implement the <b>Schengen agreement</b>, designed to lead to the free movement of people in Europe, citing worries about drugs coming into France from the Netherlands. Six countries are implementing the accord.</p>
<p>The position of Germany's chancellor, <b>Helmut Kohl</b>, was strengthened when the main opposition party, the Social Democrats, did badly in elections to three state parliaments. The embattled Free Democrats, junior partners with Mr Kohl's Christian Democrats in the ruling coalition, did relatively well.</p>
<p>French and German finance ministers and central bankers together proclaimed that a <b>single European currency </b>could be launched on schedule in 1999. The head of Germany's Bundesbank, Hans Tietmeyer, had recently expressed doubts that the timetable could be adhered to.</p>
<p>(See <a href="wtw1.gif">chart</a>)<br><b>Slovakia</b>'s parliament signed a friendship treaty with neighbouring <b>Hungary </b>to convince the <font size=-1>EU</font> that they will respect each other's ethnic minorities. But Slovakia also passed two repressive "anti-subversion" laws that could be used to squash dissent. Hungary also became a member of the <font size=-1>OECD</font>.
<h2>A Chinese first</h2>
Lee Teng-hui was elected president of <b>Taiwan </b>in what was called the first democratic election in 5,000 years of Chinese history. China ended its military exercises, designed to intimidate Taiwan, and America withdrew one of two aircraft carriers that had monitored the war games.</p>
<p>Civil servants in <b>Hong Kong </b>were told by China they must promise to support the puppet legislature that will replace the elected representatives when the British colony is handed over to the Chinese next year.</p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>India's hopes of bringing peace to <b>Kashmir </b>suffered a blow when nine militants seeking independence for the state were shot dead at a Muslim shrine. One policeman was killed. But a police siege of the shrine was ended after negotiations.</p>
<p>France, Britain and the United States signed a treaty banning nuclear weapons from the <b>South Pacific</b>. Countries in the region signed the treaty 11 years ago.
<h2>Short on ideas</h2>
Bob Dole officially clinched the <b>Republican presidential nomination </b>with victories in primaries in California, Nevada and Washington state. But 52% of those who voted for him in California said he had no new ideas, and 45% said they wished there had been someone else on the ballot (other than Pat Buchanan, that is).</p>
<p>William Bratton, <b>New York's police commissioner</b>, is resigning to work in the private sector. In his 27 months in office, serious crime in New York has fallen by 32%.</p>
<p>Scientists began to flood the <b>Grand Canyon </b>with 117 billion gallons of water from the Colorado River in order to distribute sand and mud more evenly along the canyon floor. This "periodic disturbance" will cost $4.3m.</p>
<p>Talks reopened between <b>Guatemala</b>'s government and rebels. Both hope for a deal by September.</p>
<p><b>Brazil's</b> government celebrated two successes in Congress: the reversal of an earlier vote against its pensions reforms, and the sidelining of a banking inquiry.</p>
<p><b>Cuba</b> claimed further incursions into its airspace.
<h2>Rising tension</h2>
In <b>South Africa</b>'s turbulent KwaZulu-Natal province, a massacre cost 11 lives: <font size=-1>ANC</font> supporters were responsible, said police. The <font size=-1>ANC</font>-dominated central government banned the carrying of "traditional weapons" at rallies in many districts. Its target: Zulu supporters of the Inkatha Freedom Party. At a march in Johannesburg, they largely obeyed the ban.</p>
<p>An Israeli court sentenced <b>Yigal Amir</b> to life imprisonment for the premeditated murder of Yitzhak Rabin.</p>
<p>Iraq held a <b>parliamentary election</b>, the first since 1989, claiming that 93.5% of the electorate voted. All 160 candidates from the ruling Baath Party won seats in the powerless 220-member assembly.</p>
<p><b>Bahrain executed </b>Isa Qambar, an opposition activist, for killing a policeman last year, after a trial that Amnesty International and local lawyers said was flawed.</p>
<p>The Egyptian president, Hosni Mubarak, appointed a<b> liberal cleric</b>, Mohammad Tantawi, as grand sheikh of al-Azhar. Succeeding a hardliner, he will be spiritual guide to hundreds of millions of Sunni Muslims.</p>

<h2>Shedding the load</h2><p>(See <a href="wtw2.gif">table</a>)<br><b>Japan's banks </b>vied with each other to announce the biggest write-offs, in a concerted effort to clear the worst of their bad debts. Almost all the country's top commercial and trust banks will declare losses for the year to end-March; in the process they will write off around &#165;8.8 trillion ($92 billion), nearly a quarter of the latest government estimates of the system's total bad loans.
<p>Another consolidation in the British financial-services industry: the <b>Halifax Building Society</b>, the country's largest, is to pay &#163;800m ($1.2 billion) for <b>Clerical Medical</b>, an insurer. The Halifax will become one of Britain's biggest retail banks when it goes public next year.</p>
<p>In an effort to speed up a return to health of state-owned <b>Banco di Napoli</b>, the Italian government imposed new conditions on a loan of 2.4 trillion lire ($1.5 billion) that the treasury and a group of banks had granted the stricken bank in November. The bank must make a new restructuring plan and cut its labour costs. The treasury is taking over its management in an effort to prepare it for full privatisation next year.</p>
<p>Werner Rey, wanted in Switzerland on fraud charges, was arrested in the Bahamas and now faces extradition proceedings. His <b>Omni Holding Co </b>collapsed with debts of some SFr3 billion ($1.7 billion) in 1991, owing huge sums to Swiss Bank Corp and nearly bringing down a smaller Swiss bank.
<h2>Trade-offs</h2>
<b>France </b>and<b> America </b>reached agreement over one of their many airline disputes. Air France will be allowed to make 500 extra flights this summer to four American cities in exchange for France withdrawing a threat to cut landing rights for American airlines. But the chances of the two countries renewing their more wide-ranging air pact that lapsed in 1992 look slim.</p>
<p>The World Trade Organisation warned 50 countries that there was little time left to reach agreement on global <b>telecoms liberalisation</b>. With an end-April deadline, America has yet to see the " critical mass" of sensible offers from other countries that it says it must have before it will open its own markets to more foreign competition.
<h2>Come together</h2>
In a deal that brings together the two largest owners of shopping centres in America, <b>Simon Property Group</b> of Indiana and <b>DeBartolo Realty </b>of next-door Ohio are to merge to form America's largest property company, with 10m square metres of retail space and a total market value of $7.5 billion.</p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>A British shipping, construction and property group, <b>P&O</b>, is to sell assets worth &#163;1 billion ($1.52 billion) over the next three years to try to boost its share price, the worst performing in the <font size=-1>FT-SE 100</font> last year. Disposals will include the flotation of one of Britain's biggest house builders, Bovis Homes, the sale of &#163;500m-worth of property and a reduction in its bulk-shipping interests. <font size=-1>P&O</font> said pre-tax profits fell 8% to &#163;320m last year.</p>
<p>A proposed merger to create America's biggest railway company suffered a serious setback when the Texas Railroad Commission voted to oppose <b>Union Pacific</b>'s proposed $5.4 billion purchase of <b>Southern Pacific Rail</b>. Union Pacific said the decision was "parochial"; a more senior regulator will have the final say later in the year.
<h2>Taking stock</h2><p>(See <a href="wtw3.gif">chart</a>)<br>Pre-tax profits at <b>Inchcape</b>, a British distribution and services group, plunged in 1995 by 92% to &#163;17.4m ($27.5m) after exceptional items of &#163;129.4m, hurt by a strong yen and weak demand in its Japanese-car distribution business. Amid a shake-up that will refocus group activities, the company cut its dividend and announced it was replacing its chief executive, Charles Mackay, with Philip Cushing, Inchcape's managing director. Its share price rose.</p>
<p><b>Alcatel</b> <b>Alsthom</b>, a French telecoms and industrial group, reported a loss of FFr25.6 billion ($5.1 billion) in 1995, the biggest loss in French corporate history. The loss arose from heavy charges for reorganisation and asset write-downs.</p>
<p>Desperate to get a foot in China's door, Rupert Murdoch's News Corp unveiled a joint venture between its own loss-making <b>Star TV </b>(45%), and two Hong Kong firms with good contacts in China, Today's China (45%) and China Wise International (10%). The ambition is to use the new broadcasting network, called Phoenix Satellite Television, to break into China's restricted cable-<font size=-1>TV</font> market.</p>
<p>Heavily traded shares in <b>Orange</b> closed at a 16% premium to their offer price after the &#163;2.45 billion ($3.75 billion) flotation of the British mobile-phone group, jointly owned by Hong Kong's Hutchison Whampoa and by British Aerospace. The offering was some ten times oversubscribed.</p>
<p><b>Apple Computer</b> said it expects to report a net quarterly loss of $700m, its largest-ever, in the three months to end-March. Most of the loss stemmed from inventory write-downs and restructuring charges. Moody's had already downgraded Apple's credit rating. Gilbert Amelio, Apple's newish chief executive, said the firm's problems were "fixable" .</p>
<p>Manfred Schmitt, chairman and founder of <b>Escom</b>, Germany's biggest <font size=-1>PC</font> maker, resigned after the company ran up losses of DM125m ($87m) in 1995.</p>

<h1>Mad cows and Englishmen</h1>

<p><b>Ignorance and confusion surround mad-cow disease. These pages look at what is, and is not, known about it and its human equivalent</b></p>


<p>"HASTY, ill-prepared, disproportionate and unscientific." Those were the words of Britain's top vet, Keith Meldrum, condemning his European colleagues for imposing a ban on the international sale of all meat, offal, semen, embryos, and other products of British cattle. After the ban was confirmed by the European Commission on March 27th, the only people allowed to eat the roast beef of old England were the British themselves.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Mr Meldrum's words might more aptly be applied to the whole terrible tale. Hasty and ill-prepared? The description fits the statement in the British parliament on March 20th that began the uproar. The British government has had years to prepare the public for the possibility that there is a link between Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (<font size=-1>CJD</font>), an infection that rots the human brain, and <font size=-1>BSE</font>, a fatal ailment in cattle. Yet ever since Britain's health secretary, Stephen Dorrell, announced that ten young people had contracted a new strain of <font size=-1>CJD</font> that could be related to cows, the minister has appeared like a man caught by surprise. He has spent most of his time hiding behind the advice of scientists.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Dorrell's colleague, the agriculture minister Douglas Hogg, has come out of the affair no better. Though his department has had a decade to think about how to cope with <font size=-1>BSE</font>--ever since the first case in 1986--he has lurched from one policy to another. Having first suggested that millions of British cattle might be slaughtered, Mr Hogg then appeared to back away from the possibility. Many Britons suspected that he had been overruled by a conservative government fearful of electoral and economic consequences. But after burger chains, airlines, and the farmers themselves began to call for culling older cattle, Mr Hogg looked as if he might change tack again.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Disproportionate and unscientific? That is an appropriate description of the panic that has swept Britain. One scientist has said that between 500 and 500,000 Britons could die from <font size=-1>CJD</font> each year. It would be more accurate to say that the outcome will be between zero (because no one yet knows for sure whether <font size=-1>CJD</font> can be caused by eating diseased beef) and tens of millions (that is, everyone who has eaten the stuff).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What little of sense that can be said about mad-cow disease has been buried beneath a mountain of ill-founded speculation. To help sort through the confusion, this article addresses three questions: what is known about the science involved? How does the disease spread from one species to other? And what is the link between the diseases in cattle and in humans? The box on the final page asks why is the disease concentrated in Britain? And is mad-cow disease now out of the food chain?
</p><p><b>What is known about the disease?</b>
<br>A fair amount is known about the basic science involved in both <font size=-1>CJD</font> and <font size=-1>BSE</font>. Unfortunately, the picture that emerges is extremely odd--and because of that, quick solutions to the most pressing policy problems are highly unlikely.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Both <font size=-1>CJD</font> and <font size=-1>BSE</font> belong to a rare and curious group of diseases called spongiform encephalopathies. These are scientific oddities. Other diseases are caused by bacteria and viruses, which need their own bacterial and viral proteins to survive. Such proteins can be attacked and destroyed by the host's own immune system<b>. </b>Encephalopathies are different because the infection seems to depend on the infected animal's own proteins. Lacking foreign protein, the infection remains invisible to the victim's immune system.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This group of diseases has been known for some time. The best-known human form, Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, was described early this century; another form, known as kuru, was identified in Papua New Guinea in 1957. The diseases are extremely rare: <font size=-1>CJD</font> affects about one person in a million worldwide; there have been about 2,600 cases of kuru in all. (See <a href="sf1.gif">table</a>)
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The most startling feature of the diseases was defined only as recently as 1980 by Stanley Prusiner, of the University of California, San Francisco. He argued that encephalopathies are caused by a misshapen protein called a prion. Like all proteins, prions are made by reading a genetic message, but they do not themselves contain any genetic material. The idea that something without genetic material could be infectious was regarded as heresy at the time Dr Prusiner suggested it, because something without genes could not, according to biological theory, reproduce. Some scientists still think prions may contain a tiny amount of genetic material. But most now accept that they have none.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The protein in question comes in two forms. One is healthy, produced by ordinary nerve cells in the brain. But there is another, mis-shapen variety. Dr Prusiner argued that encephalopathies are spread when the mis-shapen form wraps itself round the healthy one, converting it into another mis-shapen kind. This begins a chain reaction, destroying healthy protein and finally rotting the brain. Exactly how this happens is unclear, though research published in this week's <i>Nature</i>, a British magazine, suggests the malignant protein might stimulate the oxidation of nerve tissue. At any rate, by the end, the brain looks like a sponge, hence the term for the cattle version of the disease, bovine spongiform encephalopathy. It is possible that similar mechanisms might underlie other degenerative diseases such as Alzheimer's.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The nature of such diseases makes them hard to study. The only way to detect whether one is present in a piece of tissue is to inject it into mice and wait 700 days to see if they develop any symptoms. So research is time-consuming, and a cure will be slow to come. The mis-shapen prion resists being broken down by the cell's enzymes, or by heat or radiation. It is almost certainly resistant to vaccination. The best hope lies in finding drugs that prevent prion proteins from changing shape, hence preventing the disease from developing. Such treatment is many years away.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The peculiar nature of the diseases also explains how they spread within a species. Most cases of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease, for example, seem to have occurred as a result of spontaneous mutation of the nerve cells, causing the brain to produce the malign form of prion protein. Other human forms of the disease--one called Gerstmann-Str&aumlt;ussler-Scheinker disease and another called fatal familial insomnia--are inherited. As far as is known, none of the diseases can be spread by contagion, nor through the blood, nor through sexual contact. But they can be spread by eating infected nerve cells. This is known from the outbreak of kuru among the Fore highlanders of Papua New Guinea. The disease, known as " laughing death", seems to have been spread by ritual cannibalism: the Fore honoured dead relatives by eating their brain or smearing it on their bodies.
</p><p><b>Crossing the species barrier</b></b>
<br>So diseases like <font size=-1>CJD</font> can be transmitted within a single species by eating infected nerve cells. Such diseases can also cross from one species to another.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Research by Richard Marsh of the University of Madison, Wisconsin, strongly suggests that outbreaks of encephalopathy in mink during recent decades (there have been 20 in all) were caused by feeding them meat from infected sheep or cows. Dr Marsh also thinks that some cases in America were spread to mink from cows that died on the hoof in the 1960s; if so, then very low levels of <font size=-1>BSE</font> could have long existed in America--though that has never been officially accepted. Most, if not all, encephalopathies also seem able to move to a new species if an animal gets a large enough dose.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, the vulnerability of one species to the diseases of another varies considerably. Mice can be infected with <font size=-1>BSE</font>; hamsters cannot. In Britain in 1991 it became clear that Max, a cat, had eaten up the disease with his food. Around 80 cats have followed him to the grave, but not one dog.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps most striking, the most common prion disease, scrapie (which affects sheep and goats), has been around for hundreds of years but in that time, no link has ever been shown between scrapie and <font size=-1>CJD</font>. There is no scrapie reported in Australia, but <font size=-1>CJD</font> is as common there as it is in Britain, where scrapie is rife. Farmers, abattoir workers and those eating sheep offal do not get <font size=-1>CJD</font> any more often than teachers, social workers and vegetarians (at least they did not until <font size=-1>BSE</font> came along).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In sum, while <font size=-1>CJD</font>-like diseases can spread from one species to another, the pattern is varied. Some species can get a disease. Others cannot.
</p><p><b>Can humans catch mad-cow disease?</b>
<br>Now put two questions together: if a disease like <font size=-1>CJD</font> can be transmitted by eating infected nerve cells and if such diseases can cross from one species to another, does that mean that humans could get a form of the disease from cattle? In other words, could <font size=-1>CJD</font> be caused by infected beef?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Evidence that it might emerged after ten recent cases of <font size=-1>CJD</font> were examined by James Ironside, of the Western General Hospital in Edinburgh. He says that the symptoms of the victims and the anatomy of their brains were unusual. Typically, <font size=-1>CJD</font> is a disease of old age, usually striking people older than 60. The best-known victim of the disease was George Balanchine, a Russian choreographer, who died of <font size=-1>CJD</font> at 79.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Dr Ironside found that his cases departed from this pattern. Their average age at death was only 27. Patients had taken longer than usual to die. The first symptom was a loss of co-ordination. Loss of reason and memory, which are usually seen at an early stage in the disease, occurred later on. The brains of all ten contained large quantities of identical, florid plaques that are rare in normal <font size=-1>CJD</font>. Nothing like it had been seen in people before. If <font size=-1>BSE</font> were to pass into man, it could look like this.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That is the new evidence of a link between the two diseases. It is partly circumstantial. There is also geographical evidence: this form of <font size=-1>CJD</font> is occurring in Britain, the country which has by far the largest number of cases of <font size=-1>BSE</font>. However, the fact remains that there is, as yet, no scientific proof linking human encephalopathies with their animal occurrence.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To grasp how the disease can leap easily between some species and not others, it helps to understand something of the organisation of genes and proteins. First bear in mind that genetic material is made up of twisted ladders of <font size=-1>DNA</font>. Groups of three rungs in the ladder work together to tell a cell in what order to assemble the amino acids that make up a protein.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Now remember that diseases such as <font size=-1>CJD</font> develop when a malign prion protein subverts a normal one. The mechanism is not known but it is likely to happen more readily if the proteins are similar. Within one species, proteins tend to be identical. Between species, barriers exist, but at different heights. Sheep and cows, for instance, share a lot of genetic material: their prion proteins differ by only seven amino acids. That could explain why scrapie could have crossed the species barrier to infect cattle.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But human prion proteins differ from those of cattle at more than 30 places. That is why, for so many years, many scientists thought that mad-cow disease would not be transmitted to humans. This basic fact of molecular biology has not, of course, been changed by the recent outbreak of <font size=-1>CJD</font> in Britain. So if (it remains a big if), <font size=-1>BSE</font> has leaped over the species barrier to man, then it remains a scientific curiosity why the leap occurred.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is one possible explanation. It might be that certain parts of the prion-protein molecule are more important than others for breaking the species barrier. If so, and if it turns out that the prion proteins of cattle resemble those in humans at critical points, then <font size=-1>BSE</font> might sometimes be able to cross the barrier even though the genetic material of cattle and humans is so different. All that, however, is just speculation: there has been no proof.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The conclusions seem to be as follows. There is circumstantial evidence of a link between mad-cow disease and <font size=-1>CJD</font> but no scientific proof. The science does indicate where a link between the two diseases might be found, though one has not been discovered. And, the remarks of the British health minister notwithstanding, such a link is "conceivable" , if unlikely.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What does that mean for the progress of <font size=-1>CJD</font> in Britain now? To judge by other forms of the disease, this new strain has a dormant period in the body, though nobody knows how long it is, nor how it varies between infected individuals. The new cases were probably infected before 1989, when the government took steps to keep <font size=-1>BSE</font>-infected food away from humans. Infected food had been floating around for at least three years before the government acted. So even if infection is no longer occurring, there are likely to be more new cases. On the other hand, there does seem to be a species barrier (though it might sometimes be crossed). That remains the best reason for thinking that, though there will almost certainly be more cases of <font size=-1>CJD</font>, an epidemic of hundreds of thousands is extremely unlikely.

<h1>Cash for cows</h1>
<p><b>Predictions that Britain's economy will be seriously damaged by the scare over mad-cow disease are exaggerated</b></p>

<p>THE health panic triggered by the government's admission that the fatal Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease (<font size=-1>CJD</font>) might be caused by eating beef has fast become an economic scare. Share and bond prices suffered as speculation mounted that a worldwide ban on exports of British beef and related products (from soup to jelly babies), plus a cull of the cattle herd, might lower growth, raise inflation and unemployment, and cost the taxpayer up to &#163;20 billion ($30 billion).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is certainly a grim time for cattle farmers, who have still not recovered the market share they lost in the previous big scare about <font size=-1>BSE</font> in 1989. But will their problems really have much impact on the economy as a whole?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Consider, for instance, the most extreme policy response, the slaughter of all of Britain's 11.8m cattle--something that is not yet a serious proposal, not least because it would mean killing cows now producing milk, currently unaffected by the scare. Farmers now get compensation of up to &#163;865 per slaughtered infected cow. At that rate the total bill would be &#163;10.2 billion. On top of this there would be the cost of killing and burning each cow, currently &#163;120. Allowing for some extra expenditure on new incineration capacity, that cost might come to &#163;2 billion. Some are suggesting that as well as compensating farmers for their lost cattle, they should be bought new cows. But compensating them twice in this way is unreasonably generous.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Welfare payments to workers made redundant would also have to be met. The British Meat and Livestock Commission calculates that around 400,000 people are employed in beef and dairy farming. The Treasury reckons that every 100,000 rise in unemployment puts up the social-security bill by &#163;275m. So, even on the assumption that the entire workforce were fired and unable to find other work, the cost would be &#163;1.1 billion a year. That would be bearable.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Payments might be made to workers sacked in other beef-related industries. But most firms using beef products will simply switch to foreign suppliers, and so be affected only to the extent that world prices rise as British beef disappears. Besides, new jobs would be created slaughtering cattle, and in farming livestock such as poultry, pork and lamb, for which demand has risen as consumers have shunned beef.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The maximum bill facing the taxpayer would thus be something less than &#163;15 billion, with continuing costs of up to &#163;1 billion a year. Some help has now been promised by the <font size=-1>EU</font>. The government would have no difficulty borrowing the rest. It would largely be a one-off cost, so financial markets would not regard the resulting rise in the public-sector borrowing requirement as a permanent deterioration of the public finances. So there need be little extra pressure to raise interest rates or abandon planned tax cuts.
</p><p><b>Mad cows and sterling</b></b>
<br>Slaughtering the national herd would affect the balance of payments. Alex Gerrard, an economist at the securities wing of Union Bank of Switzerland, says a complete cessation of beef and dairy production, plus imports of live cattle to replace the current herd, would increase the current-account deficit by up to &#163;6.5 billion a year for several years. (The 1995 deficit was &#163;6.7 billion.) Deficits tend to damage an economy only if they persist for many years--although there is a chance that a bigger deficit would weaken sterling, pushing up import costs and thus inflation. In the short run, the fall in beef prices might lower inflation, depending on how much prices rise for other foods. But if the entire herd were slaughtered, beef prices would almost certainly rise. The absolute maximum by which <font size=-1>GDP</font> would fall is 1.2%.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Less drastic options, such as those being considered by the cabinet when it met on March 28th, would have a smaller impact. Doing nothing might kill exports of British beef, for a while anyway, but dairy exports would continue. The increase in the current-account deficit would be only one-third as big as in the worst case.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What happens to domestic beef sales will depend on two factors: first, how far consumers keep buying beef because of government assurances and lower prices; and second, how successful producers are in differentiating beef produced from diseased herds from beef produced from unaffected herds. Some 85% of beef herds and 40% of dairy herds remain unaffected. Lower sales and prices would certainly hurt farmers and cost jobs. But it is unlikely that sales would plummet to zero, so the fall in <font size=-1>GDP</font> would be less than the 0.3% accounted for by beef production.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The National Farmers Union argues that limited culling is better than none if consumer confidence in British beef is to be restored and the export ban lifted. It wants the government to kill and burn dairy cattle, and bulls and cows used to produce beef calves, at the end of their working lives. As they are older, these are the ones most likely to have <font size=-1>BSE</font>. At present, they are slaughtered and sold for human consumption; 850,000 such cows are killed every year. As these elderly cattle fetch only around &#163;500 a head, compensation should not be much more than &#163;400m. The only other cost would be a 20% fall in domestic beef output, reducing <font size=-1>GDP</font> by a minuscule 0.05%. Few jobs should be lost.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All this assumes that the worst fears about eating beef turn out to be wrong. In the unlikely event that such fears prove well-founded, and projected deaths rise into the hundreds of thousands, the economic implications of the <font size=-1>BSE</font> scare would take on a different complexion. (Imagine the analysts' reports: "People expecting to die may switch from saving to spending, fuelling an unsustainable consumer boom.") In such a case, however, the economic implications are unlikely to be of much concern. At last, a scenario in which Britain stops worrying about the economy.

<p><b>Northern Ireland</b></p>
<h1>All parties great and small</h1>

<font size=1>BELFAST</font>
<p>GERRYMANDERING is traditionally designed to preserve the power of the haves against the have-nots. An exception, however, is the way that the British government has fixed the elections to be held in Northern Ireland on May 30th. It will give two seats each to the biggest ten parties in the province, whether or not they win seats in any individual constituency.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The idea is to ensure that there will be a wide spectrum of opinion in the pool from which representatives for all-party talks, beginning on June 10th, will be drawn. Sinn Fein will be allowed to stand, since the government knows that preventing it would be counter-productive. But Sinn Fein will be at the talks only if the <font size=-1>IRA</font> meanwhile restores its ceasefire.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Northern Ireland's four big parties--the Ulster Unionist Party, the Social Democratic &amp; Labour Party, the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Fein--are well known. But the six parties most likely to join them are not.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The largest, with around 9% of the vote, is the<b> Alliance</b> <b>Party.</b> Formed in 1970, it offers a middle road between anti-Catholic unionism and anti-British nationalism. It upholds the union as the choice of the majority, but argues for devolution from London to Belfast, for power-sharing between nationalists and unionists, and for closer co-operation with the Irish republic. Led by John Alderdice, who is (appropriately) a psychiatrist, the Alliance is largely a party of middle-class Protestants.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The<b> Workers' Party</b>, led by John Lowry, and the<b> Democratic Left</b>, led by Proinsias de Rossa--who is a member of the Irish government--together seem likely to draw less than 1% of the vote. They are descended from the Official Republicans, nicknamed the "Stickies", Marxists who split from the Provisionals (ie, the current <font size=-1>IRA</font>) in 1970. The "Stickies" progressively shed the doctrines and symbols of violent nationalism, and then nationalism itself. Both groups would like parties in Northern Ireland to agree on a system of government without involving the government in Dublin. The shadow of the gun has been slow to fade and other parties scoff at their avowed support for law and order.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The<b> Ulster Democratic Party</b> (<font size=-1>UDP</font>), in the party's own words, "emanated from the Ulster Defence Association" (<font size=-1>UDA</font>), the largest loyalist paramilitary group. As with Sinn Fein and the <font size=-1>IRA</font>, the <font size=-1>UDP</font> says it is separate from the <font size=-1>UDA</font> but has "an insight into <font size=-1>UDA</font> thinking." It claims the large unionist parties are unrepresentative of working-class Protestants, and suggests a form of power-sharing with nationalists. Strongest in Belfast and nearby Lisburn, it has three elected representatives on local councils: Gary McMichael, the party leader, and two former <font size=-1>DUP</font> councillors.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The<b> Progressive Unionist Party</b> (<font size=-1>PUP</font>) calls itself the "political confidant" of the Ulster Volunteer Force (<font size=-1>UVF</font>), another group of loyalist paramilitaries. Formed in 1979, but scarcely noticed until the loyalist ceasefire, the <font size=-1>PUP</font> has only one councillor: Hugh Smyth, who was nevertheless Lord Mayor of Belfast in 1994. It prefers to be described as "socialist" rather than unionist, and has two articulate spokesmen in David Ervine and Billy Hutchinson, who is a reformed lifer.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Last of the ten is likely to be the <b>UK Unionist </b>Robert McCartney, who won a by-election to the British parliament in prosperous North Down in 1995. Mr McCartney maintains that if all British parties organised in Northern Ireland, sectarianism would gradually end. Ironically, the Tories, who do organise in Northern Ireland and win about 6% of the vote, have just been ordered by their bosses in London not to stand in the elections, on the absurd grounds that ministers will represent their voters at the talks.

<h1>A mighty jam</h1>

<p>THE government's plan to charge motorists for the use of motorways--a central part of its transport policy--is facing serious delay at best, at worst total collapse. Less than a year ago, ministers announced, amid much publicity, that tests of electronic-payment systems would start on the <font size=-1>M3</font> motorway this summer. But within the next few days Sir George Young, the transport secretary, is expected to announce an indefinite postponement of the &#163;20m trial. Officials hope to save something from the wreck by announcing that limited trials of tolling equipment will take place later this year on test tracks at the Transport Research Laboratory at Crowthorne in Berkshire.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The abandonment of the <font size=-1>M3</font> trial has been forced on the government by the withdrawal of four of the eight consortia chosen by the Department of Transport to compete to provide a national tolling system. Three of the eight--Siemens, Tollway and Autolink--have already said that they will not take part in the <font size=-1>M3</font> trials. A fourth, Tollstar, is expected to announce shortly that it too is pulling out.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All eight of the consortia, selected from 29 applicants, have become increasingly disillusioned by the lack of a clear government commitment to road pricing. The trial was already running 18 months behind schedule, partly because ministers were wary of taking difficult decisions in the run-up to a general election.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One factor raising doubts about the future of motorway charging is the outcome of last year's tolling trial on the Bonn-to-Cologne motorway in Germany. Although some systems achieved accuracy rates of 99.9%, the German government has decided against introducing motorway tolls for cars. Instead, it plans to proceed first with a scheme to charge only heavy-goods vehicles.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The British government is even more terrified of motorists' reactions to charging. Although Department of Transport forecasts suggest that traffic might double between now and 2025, ministers believe that tolls are politically unsellable.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As a result, the so-called "great transport debate" started by Brian Mawhinney, the previous transport minister, has dissolved into incoherence. The road-building programme has been cut, but no alternative method of dealing with traffic growth has been put in its place. A German transport economist, Carmen Hass-Klau, unkindly rubbed this in when she told a recent European transport conference that the only activity in the field in which Britain led the world was talking. In every other area, she said, Britain was at least a decade behind the rest of Europe.

<p><b>Divorce and pensions</b></p>
<h1>Split decision</h1>

<p>MINISTERS may squirm when forced to confront questions of marriage, divorce and the fabric of society. But these are nothing compared with the shudders produced when the public coffers are at risk. This was evident during the Commons debate this week on the new Family Law Bill, already passed by the House of Lords. Although heated words were exchanged about no-fault divorce and cooling-off periods, the government's big worry is what the legislation might cost.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The bill, as amended in the Lords, would allow judges to divide the pension assets of divorcing couples. Although Roger Freeman, the minister responsible for the bill, has in principle accepted the new rule, it is unlikely to take effect before the next election.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At present, judges often consider a spouse's pension when ruling on divorce settlements. But since pensions cannot be carved up, any settlement must instead rearrange other assets to balance things out. She gets the house, he keeps the pension.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The House of Lords tried to simplify things in the 1995 Pensions Act, by allowing couples to split their pensions upon divorcing. This proposal was watered down in the Commons. As passed, the act lets judges divide up future pension payments explicitly in a divorce settlement. The pension is not split now, but the pensioner can be required to turn over a share of it to his spouse when either partner retires.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This will help, but problems remain. The biggest is that the pension rights still nominally belong to the pensioner. When he or she dies, the spouse is no longer entitled to further payments. Hence a House of Lords' amendment to the new bill allowing judges to split the fund at the time of the divorce. Many Tories in the Commons support this, which has forced the government to concede the point. But the government has also said it will not implement the new rule until it has issued a consultative green paper on the proposal.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Allowing pension-splitting will be a legislative nightmare. The social-security department reckons that at least 30 laws will have to be rewritten to accommodate the new rule. But even worse is the cost.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tax revenue will be lost because each spouse would receive separate pension payments, on which each would be entitled to a tax allowance. Fortunately, this cost is likely to be modest, perhaps no more than &#163;80m a year, and would be largely offset by a fall in means-tested benefits.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The bigger worry is public-sector pension funds, which the new rule would clobber. Whereas most private plans set assets aside to cover future payments, those for many public employees are financed on a pay-as-you-go basis. If divorcees suddenly demand their share of the loot, they would have to pay out sooner than they planned, which could cost them around &#163;500m a year. The choice is stark: either public employees will have to be excluded from the new rules, or the taxpayer will face a big bill.

<p><b>A-levels</b></p>
<h1>Exam success</h1>

<p>EDUCATION'S Mr Fixit does it again. Having already organised a truce between the government and teachers over the national curriculum for children between five and 16, Sir Ron Dearing, a former Post Office boss, has now come up with a peace plan for another educational war: reform of the exams taken by those between 16 and 19. Sir Ron's proposals, published on March 27th, contain something to please both traditionalists (academic <font size=-1>A</font>-levels will not be abolished and "general national vocational qualifications", <font size=-1>GNVQ</font>s, will be made harder) and modernisers (young people will study a wider range of subjects). Well done, Sir Ron, said the government, the opposition, employers and universities. But this does not mean that his reforms will be the last.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sir Ron's trouble-shooting skills were certainly needed. The courses offered as stepping-stones from school to either university or work are a jumble. In particular, <font size=-1>GNVQ</font>s, introduced in 1993 as a practical alternative to academically oriented <font size=-1>A</font>-levels, have created confusion and suspicion.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some subjects, such as business, are offered as both <font size=-1>A</font>-levels and <font size=-1>GNVQ</font>s, leaving students baffled over which to take. Each <font size=-1>GNVQ</font> is supposed to be worth two <font size=-1>A</font>-levels, but few believe it. One exam-board chief has described <font size=-1>GNVQ</font>s as "a doddle". Employers and university tutors lament that even young people with top <font size=-1>A</font>-level grades are poor at communicating, worse at maths and hopeless in computing and languages.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Under Sir Ron's reforms, pupils in England, Wales and Northern Ireland will no longer have to narrow their studies to two or three subjects at the age of 16. As already happens in Scotland, for their first year in the sixth form they will be able to take perhaps five subjects, plus a course on "key skills" (communication, maths and use of computers). They will take new tests, to be called <font size=-1>AS</font>-levels, at the end of the first year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But whereas Scottish pupils go straight to university or work after taking a broad range of "highers" at age 17, those south of the border will do another year in the sixth form. They will take up to four specialist courses: traditional <font size=-1>A</font>-levels, new Applied <font size=-1>A</font>-levels (a tougher version of <font size=-1>GNVQ</font>s), super-tough <font size=-1>S</font>-levels, or a mixture. This approach gives pupils an extra year to decide which subjects to specialise in. It should reduce failures, currently 30% for <font size=-1>A</font>-levels and 40% for <font size=-1>GNVQ</font>s.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Dearing plan is a compromise. It bridges the gap between those employers and universities which wanted <font size=-1>A</font>-levels to be replaced with a broader course of study and the demands of those (including ministers) who saw them as the untouchable "gold standard" of the education system.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The traditionalists have a point. <font size=-1>A</font>-levels may be old-fashioned, but they are respected as a test of a pupil's academic capabilities, and no credible alternative has yet been established. But many employers believe that young people need a broader range of knowledge than past generations did. Even postponing the point at which pupils specialise by a further year, as proposed in these reforms, may not be enough.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Fortunately, Sir Ron has designed the new system so that it can easily be reformed again. Once the present mess is replaced by a coherent set of courses, in which academic studies and practical subjects share the same high standards, then both <font size=-1>A</font>-levels and the new Applied <font size=-1>A</font>-levels could be split up into smaller units. This would allow sixth-formers to take, say, five topics in their second year instead of two or three. The traditionalists may have won this battle. In time, the modernisers may get their way.

<p><b>Housing</b></p>
<h1>Blockbusters</h1>


<p>"FIVE, four, three, two, one," a pregnant pause, and then Rowan Court, a 20-storey tower block on the Holly Street estate in Hackney, east London, is transformed into a tidy pyramid of rubble. "Rowan Court has never looked better," David Thompson, the administrator of the project, told a cheering crowd.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thanks to the Comprehensive Estates Initiative, a local plan that has set out to improve five council-owned estates, blowing up tower blocks has become a regular event in Hackney. Eight have hit the dust in the past year. Two of Rowan Court's neighbours are doomed, and at least four more will go before the campaign is completed in 2001. Residents will be rehoused in attractive, though smaller, low-rise homes that they helped to design.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Local enthusiasm is understandable. Tower blocks, fashionable among town planners in the 1960s, have proved unacceptable to most British families. On March 25th, Westminster council in London was criticised by an independent inquiry for putting homeless families into a tower block riddled with asbestos. The block has since been demolished.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But surprisingly, as the demolishers step up their work, some housing experts fear that too many tower blocks could be removed from the scene. A high-rise block is no place to raise a family. But many boast fine views from their quiet upper floors. Adults often like them. Birmingham, for example, has turned over several dozen high-rises to childless or elderly adults. Grange Court, a twin to Rowan Court in Hackney, is being refurbished to provide homes for people over 50.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This makes sense. There is an increasing demand for housing for people living alone, such as students, struggling artists, young adults just out of care, and the newly divorced. The population of single-person households is increasing by 200,000 a year, faster than any other group.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But local authorities cannot afford to sit on unpopular housing stock and wait for the number of suitable tenants to grow. They also find it hard to allocate homes to single people when many families on their books are in even greater need of housing. So many tower blocks are half-empty, inviting the attentions of the wrecking ball--even though, in a few years' time, they could be providing just the kind of homes then most in demand.

<h1>Mass slaughter at Harrogate</h1>

<p>IN PRESENT circumstances, it would be a bold delegate to the Tory mid-year conference at Harrogate who greeted John Major's speech on Saturday morning with a cry of "Where's the beef?" Nevertheless, ten days with <font size=-1>BSE</font> has done terrible things to ministers. Like the poor cows on the nightly news, they twitch and stagger as they bang their deluded heads against the iron rails of public distrust. Mass slaughter would seem a mercy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In politics, when your luck's out, your luck's out; and the timing of the beef stew could hardly have been worse. Party strategists have long planned that the Harrogate conference of the party's central council would be their turning point. There, they would deploy the results of "Our Nation's Future", an elaborate year-long consultation with party members, showing (to no one's surprise) that Tory activists would like more money and less crime and better education. Then, the prime minister would unveil the corresponding themes of the election manifesto: less tax, more jail and more selective schools. Then or thenabouts, up would shoot the Tories' poll ratings.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;They need to if the next election is not to prove an abattoir for Tories. According to <font size=-1>MORI</font>'s opinion polls, Tory ratings over the year since March 1995 have reached a low of 22% and a high of 29%. The latest figure, taken as the <font size=-1>BSE</font> row raged, is 28%. Though statistical analysis shows some recovery over the period, its pace is glacial. If the election is in May 1997, and if the Tories' poll ratings recover at the same pace over the next year as they have over the past year, the party will win 32% of the vote, and fewer than 200 seats. This would be defeat on an unprecedented scale. "The cabinet hasn't realised just how bad it will be," says one senior Tory backbencher.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet recovery will at best be delayed, at worst cancelled, by the mad-cow fiasco. In the Commons, ministers adopted the brazen tactics which saw them through the Scott report on arms sales to Iraq. They blamed public alarm on the opposition. If only Labour would shut up, John Bull would go back to his beefsteak.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But what worked with Scott may not work with mad cows. Scott was about matters remote from voters' central concerns. The beef crisis is about the thing they care about most, their health. Ministers who use the Harrogate rostrum to berate Labour (and, of course, Europe) on mad cows may reckon on the applause of the party faithful. But voters may come to think that the Tories are playing politics with their lives.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That is guesswork. But the mad-cow fandango also threatens to strike a more serious blow to the Tory strategy. It could easily deprive them of what they most need, which is to recover their reputation for competence.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The British economy is doing fairly well. Production is growing. Unemployment is falling. Inflation is steady. Most European countries envy Britain's performance. The Conservatives sought to capitalise on this in a recent political broadcast, in which various foreigners said how they wished their country was doing as well as Britain. In these circumstances, the party might hope to resurrect the trusty old slogan "Don't let Labour ruin it." Ministers, led by Michael Heseltine, the deputy prime minister, still hope that rising disposable incomes over the next year will lead to rising Tory poll ratings.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Mr Heseltine may be wrong. The Tories' problem is that the electorate is giving them no credit for economic recovery. According to <font size=-1>MORI</font> again, the link between voters' optimism about the economy and their voting intentions broke down when Britain left the European exchange-rate mechanism on "Black Wednesday" in September 1992.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor is this surprising. The episode, when interest rates went up 5% in a day, is vividly described in Philip Stephens's new book "Politics and the Pound" (Macmillan, &#163;20). Save that Mr Stephens finds no support for the theory that the prime minister cracked up that day, his account confirms voters' fears that the government simply lost control.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Since then, they have been unwilling to give the Tories credit for anything. David Sanders, an academic at Essex University who specialises in models relating voting intentions to economic data, says that he has never had less confidence in the link between the two than he has now.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, the mad-cow storm has broken just as real voters are about to go into real polling booths to give real verdicts on the government. The Tories scarcely dare hope to win the Staffordshire South East by-election on April 11th, despite their 7,192 majority in 1992. Defeat would cut the Tory majority in the Commons to one. Time is essential for recovery, yet the loss of a further seat will make it less likely that the government can last until May 1997. Senior politicians now doubt whether the Tories can make it past the autumn.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then there are the local elections on May 2nd. Early results from<i> The Economist</i>'s regular survey of local by-elections show some Tory recovery in January and February of this year. But March, so far, has not been so hot. Moreover, the seats up for grabs in May were last fought in May 1992, when the Tories were riding high. Large losses are inevitable.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Major relishes an uphill struggle. But to recover, the Tories need to land a treble. The economy must continue to do well; the voters must give them the credit for it doing well; and the party must persuade them that Labour would mess it up. Even before Britain went mad about mad cows, that looked a tough task. As it is, bad luck and bad management may mean that, whether or not the disease kills people, it kills the Tories' remaining chances of winning a fifth term.</td></tr></table>

<h1>Going for Olympic gold cards</h1>

<p><font size=1>HONG KONG, LONDON AND NEW YORK</font></b></p><p><b>Trials of digital cash and smart cards seem to be going on everywhere. Who will win the race to control tomorrow's money?</b></p>
<p>AT THIS summer's Olympic games in Atlanta, the eyes of most of the world will be on the athletes seeking their moment of glory. The eyes of many bankers, however, will be on athletes' more mundane activities. For Atlanta will also be the site of one of the largest trials to date of electronic money. If the system performs well under pressure, its creators hope that it, too, will become a world champion.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A consortium including First Union, NationsBank and Wachovia, three big American regional banks, and Visa, a credit-card firm, will give each athlete a smart card (fitted with a computer chip and memory) that acts as an "electronic purse". The disposable cards can be used throughout the Olympic area to pay for everything from a meal to a masseur.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the banks and for Visa, the Atlanta games represent a chance to grab headlines. But the scheme is serious. Consumers in Atlanta can already buy pre-paid cards and use them to make small payments at several local shops. By the summer, thousands of retailers will be connected to the network. The consortium is hoping to introduce rechargeable cards (already on trial in San Francisco) by mid-year, so that customers can simply visit an automated teller machine when they need more cash.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is but one trial among many. Banks everywhere are rushing to embrace financial smart cards, which combine electronic cash with more traditional credit and debit functions. The case for such electronic purses (which is mainly that they make notes and coins redundant) has been strengthened by the success of experiments in other areas, such as pre-paid cards for public telephones and transport systems, particularly in continental Europe.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Banks have also spotted the need for a secure and convenient payment mechanism for use over the Internet and other computer networks. Smart cards could fit the bill. Small wonder that some analysts forecast breakneck growth in their use (see <a href="fn1.gif">chart</a>). The electronic purse's target market--people who use notes and coins to make small purchases--is huge. Cash transactions accounted for $8.1 trillion of the $14 trillion of total world personal spending in 1993, according to Visa.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most digital-cash trials are single-currency projects run by groups of domestic banks. Some 24 countries have, or are planning, such schemes. Among them are emerging markets such as South Africa, Russia, Brazil and even Zambia, where a combination of high inflation and crime makes an electronic purse a particularly attractive alternative to huge wads of cash.
</p><p><b>Digital Danes</b></b>
<br>But the longest trial to date is in wealthy Denmark, where Danmont, a joint venture between the country's banks and the national telephone company, has been running since 1992. Its cards have spread to over 60 towns and cities, where they are accepted at most outlets. Danmont has issued more than half a million disposable cards; a rechargeable version was introduced last August. The company, which hopes that half the Danish population will carry its purse within seven years, has attracted the attention of would-be global rivals; Visa has bought the rights to its technology.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some markets even have competing projects. In Australia, MasterCard, Visa's biggest rival, announced on March 25th the start of a trial involving 10,000 consumers in Canberra to test a combined cash and credit or debit card issued by three of Australia's big banks. This could eventually compete with schemes sponsored by Visa in the Gold Coast area, and with Transcard, a locally developed pre-paid smart card for travel and shopping in Sydney.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The most ambitious projects are already competing for international acceptance. Trials organised by Visa and MasterCard are precursors of broader schemes. But the most advanced operation may be that of Mondex, a card-based electronic cash system developed by NatWest, a British bank. Mondex claims to be different from other purse schemes. Where they are, in effect, pre-paid debit cards, it is a purer electronic replacement for cash: money can be transferred direct from card to card via electronic readers without using a bank or other intermediary.  
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tim Jones, Mondex's chief executive, has ambitious expansion plans, despite mixed results from a showcase trial in Swindon, England. Since last July some 10,000 locals have been testing cards that can be loaded with electronic cash from special telephones and machines. Although custom has been below expectations, and plans to charge a monthly fee for the cards have been postponed, Mondex's managers feel that they can justify a roll-out throughout Britain later next year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mondex has quickly gone global by signing regional franchising agreements. For instance, <font size=-1>HSBC</font>, a British banking group and one of the project's sponsors, has bought Mondex's Asian franchise, which includes China and India. Trials are under way in Canada and America, and are planned for Australia. A group of Japanese banks and technology companies is in talks to run the franchise there.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mondex's marketing has aroused the competitive instincts of big credit-card groups such as Europay, MasterCard and Visa, each of which has thousands of member banks. Partly in an attempt to shut out Mondex, they have forged a common technical standard known as <font size=-1>EMV</font> for stored-value cards, so that merchants will be able to install a single terminal that accepts the banks' different cards. A final agreement between the companies is due soon. Mondex, however, remains sanguine about its prospects. It reckons that other firms are developing rival terminals that will be able to deal with several different standards at once, not just <font size=-1>EMV</font>'s.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But, to Mondex's chagrin, Visa is working with some of NatWest's domestic competitors, including Barclays and Lloyds, on a possible rival British purse, to be called <font size=-1>EPUK</font>. According to one banker, Visa "is adding its badge to anything that moves as a spoiling tactic against Mondex."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other banks are also hoping to cash in on the digital wave. A patented Electronic Monetary System developed by Citicorp, an American bank, is clearly behind Mondex if the yardstick is putting smart bank cards in people's hands. But when it comes to the technology involved, Citicorp's system rivals and in some respects surpasses Mondex's (see <a href="fn2.html">page</a>).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How to predict which scheme will fare best? Richard Poynder, chairman of the Smart Card Club, an independent trade association, believes the big firms are, in effect, waging a "purse war" to decide an industry standard. He reckons that Mondex offers the best deal because, unlike most other schemes, it does not envisage charging merchants for every transaction.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There will be plenty of jockeying for position as the battle for customers grows. MasterCard, which declined a chance to buy Mondex when it was still an idea, might transform the race by renewing its interest in it. Financial firms are also forming alliances with technology and telecoms firms: in Japan, Visa has linked with Toshiba, and Mondex with Hitachi.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This interlinking of businesses and systems offers a clue about how digital money might develop. The problem is too large for one bank or institution to develop a winning scheme alone. Today's parochial trials, and perhaps even the global ones, may eventually lead to a few systems run by two or three networks of purse operators. Let the fun and high-tech games begin.

<table border=6><tr><td>


<h1>Digitising dollars</h1><font size=1>NEW YORK</font><p>OUT came, on March 25th, America's redesigned $100 bill. But while Robert Rubin, the treasury secretary, oversees the roll-out of the new, harder-to-forge notes, Citicorp, one of America's biggest banks, is working to make these and all other forms of physical money redundant. In April 1994 the bank filed a patent application for its Electronic Monetary System (<font size=-1>EMS</font>). Although it is still developing the hardware for this, in conjunction with a big chip maker, its system is distinctive in several respects. If it wins broad acceptance, it could help to solve some of the financial industry's most intractable problems.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The main difference between <font size=-1>EMS</font> and other electronic-cash systems is that it is designed to work on a computer network and thus to allow secure, immediate transfers of cash. Its cards can be inserted into personal computers and contain their own tamper-proof security and transaction-processing software.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Another distinguishing feature of <font size=-1>EMS</font> is that, unlike Mondex, it allows banks to keep track of the money that they are issuing. As users fill their electronic wallets with cash, either by drawing down an existing balance or by borrowing, the bank creates digital banknotes that then travel around the electronic economy, splitting into smaller denominations as people spend their cash. Each note carries with it an electronic tag that allows the issuing bank to identify its money (although not necessarily to know who is using it).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What are the potential advantages of <font size=-1>EMS</font>? For one thing, Citicorp has already developed a version that provides a secure means of paying for goods and services on the Internet. It has even allied <font size=-1>EMS</font> with a clever software agent that enables users to seek out the best prices for a product. The bank's electronic tag should reduce the chances of on-line commercial disputes over whether payments have been made or received.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But the biggest impact could be on the banking industry itself. Citibank thinks <font size=-1>EMS</font> is an ideal way of making instant, riskless payments of large sums of money between banks, and is exploring the possibility of striking deals with other institutions to use the system. Better still, it can handle any number of foreign currencies and exchange them at an agreed rate--a function beyond the scope of Mondex, and one open to corporate users as well as to banks.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This system might also be a useful way of solving settlement risk in foreign exchange. This week, a report by a committee of central bankers called on the industry to make greater efforts itself to solve such problems. Citicorp is doing just that.

<h1>Apocalypse maybe</h1>
<p><b>Sometimes governments must respond to unknown probabilities of extremely unpleasant outcomes. Can economic theory help?</b></p>


<p>BRITAIN is preoccupied with the possibility of an outbreak of Creutzfeldt-Jakob disease caused by exposure to beef infected with <font size=-1>BSE</font>. It is too late for policy to affect the outcome for those already exposed to the infection, but not too late to affect the rate of future exposure. In the debate about what needs to be done, economists (true to form) have so far concentrated on macro-matters such as public borrowing and the external deficit. They have been silent on a far more important question of microeconomics: how should Britain weigh the costs of attempting to eradicate <font size=-1>BSE</font> against the benefits of fewer exposures in future?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the face of it, economics offers a way to think about this: cost-benefit analysis. The trouble is, although it deals with risk tolerably well, cost-benefit analysis is bad at dealing with uncertainty. To an economist, these are very different. If you know that there is a 30% chance of rain tomorrow and a 70% chance that it will stay fine, your decision about whether to carry an umbrella is subject to risk; if you have no idea whether it will rain, you face not risk but uncertainty.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The difference matters. Known probabilities allow weights to be attached to the cost of, say, getting wet in the rain. Weighted costs and benefits can be added up, and suitably discounted according to how far in the future they lie, to yield a single number: net present benefit. In theory, this allows different policies, such as carrying an umbrella, to be compared with others, such as not carrying one.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Without probabilities, such comparisons are impossible. Britain's <font size=-1>BSE</font> scare is a case of decision-making under uncertainty. If <font size=-1>BSE</font> were eradicated in a spare-no-expense way (by destroying all cattle), the possibility of further exposure would be greatly reduced. If <font size=-1>BSE</font> were eradicated more slowly, a greater possibility of human infection would remain. How much greater is unknown. Given this, how is the right policy to be discovered?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Decision theory has some ideas. First, write down a "<A HREF="fn2.gif">cost matrix</a>". The upper part of the table shows how this might look, using arbitrary units for illustration. Across the top are assumptions about the ability of <font size=-1>BSE</font> to infect humans: zero, low, medium and high. Reading down, the matrix considers three policies: do nothing, intervene mildly (selective culling) and intervene strongly (destroy all cattle).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If <font size=-1>BSE</font> does not infect humans and the government does nothing, the cost is zero. Assume that the gross cost of selective culling is 10, and that total destruction costs 40. That completes the first column of the matrix. Assuming no government action, suppose a low rate of infection costs 20, a medium rate 50 and a high rate 100. That completes the first row. To fill in the other cells, assume that selective culling reduces the rate of infection by 50% and that total destruction reduces it by 90%.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In principle, the real thing could be done for <font size=-1>BSE</font>, based on known or discoverable facts. It would need lots more cells, and would show pounds not "units". When you have got it (the matrix, that is), how do you use it? You can apply one of several rules. Gamblers might favour "minimin"--the minimum of minimums. This says, be lucky: go for the policy that puts the lowest cost within reach. In the pretend matrix shown here, that is "do nothing". It offers a net cost of zero (the lowest in the matrix) so long as luck holds and infectivity is zero.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At the other extreme, a hypercautious government would prefer "minimax"--the minimum of maximums. For each policy, this asks what the worst result would be, and then chooses the policy that offers the best of these bad outcomes. It puts a floor, as it were, under disaster. The worst result for "do nothing" is 100, for mild intervention it is 60 and for strong intervention it is 50. Minimax chooses strong intervention.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A third rule seems more appealing than either of these, though it may not be obvious at first sight. It is called "minimax regret". First you derive a regret matrix from the cost matrix. To do this you ask, for each assumption about infectivity in turn, which policy produces the best result. Then you compare the results of the other two policies with that best result, and regard the difference in cost as a measure of regret. Consider medium infectivity, for instance. The best policy is mild intervention, at a cost of 35. In the regret matrix, set that cell to zero. The cost of doing nothing, given medium infectivity, is 50, so if you chose that policy you would be 50 minus 35 worse off than under the best policy. Score 15 in the matrix. The cost of strong intervention is 45, which is 10 more than the best outcome: score 10.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Once the regret matrix is complete, apply the minimax rule as before. For each policy, what is the outcome you would regret most? For "do nothing" it is a regret of 50 (if infectivity turns out to be high); for mild intervention it is 10 (if infectivity is either zero or high); for strong intervention it is 40 (if infectivity is zero). Minimax regret chooses the policy that gives the lowest of these results. It puts a floor not under disaster, but under how bad you are going to feel if things go wrong. In this case, the rule would lead you to choose mild intervention.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Three rules, three different choices, and no firm basis for preferring one rule over another: each expresses an attitude to danger as valid as the others. But it is not quite a dead-end. Decision theory cannot create certainty where none exists, but it offers a way to organise one's thoughts, crystallise one's prejudices about caution and highlight the kinds of information that are needed to do better. British ministers should have their regret matrix worked out. It may be inconclusive--but it beats staring into space and thinking about mortality.

<p align=center><img src="http://www.economist.com/econlogosmall.gif" alt="The Economist"></p>
<h1><center>That astonishing microchip</center></h1>

IT MAY be hard to believe, but it is less than 20 years since this newspaper was introducing readers to the existence of the integrated circuit, then still exotic, and predicting that it would change the world. It did, and in pretty short order. The world's appetite for chips has so far been almost as abundant as the silicon from which they are made.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Throughout this period, chip technology has evolved rapidly, more or less in conformity with the exponential growth in power predicted by Gordon Moore, a founder of Intel, America's leading chip maker. Every time engineers seem close to bumping against the technology's limits, they find some new way to make circuits smaller, faster and cheaper. As a result, the chips that were exotic yesterday are now the commonplace components not just of the computer but also of the car, the camera and the cash card. By common consent it has been the most productivity-enhancing, life-changing technological revolution since the harnessing of steam power in the 18th century or, in the 19th, of electricity itself.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Also by common consent, this revolution also has much further to go. But if the revolution in microelectronics is not yet faltering, there are signs of two big changes.
</p><p><b>Hogs</b>
<br>One is taking place inside the semiconductor business itself. For much of the industry's short life, making chips has been a licence to print money. The first half of the 1990s was especially lucrative; sales last year topped $150 billion. Since Christmas, however, demand has fallen below expectations. Bad news in any industry, this is catastrophic in one where a single factory can cost more than $1 billion to build. The world's most advanced manufacturers are, it seems, no less vulnerable than farmers to the " hog cycle"; extrapolating from the present, they get the future wrong.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although chip makers have got supply and demand out of kilter before, there are grounds for expecting a much bigger impact this time around on the shape of the industry (see <a href="sf1.html">page</a>). And as the industry changes, so the way people think about chips should change, too.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For too long, governments have invested the industry with a special mystique. A decade ago, the United States got into a panic when Japanese chip makers seemed to be getting the better of American ones. The chip, it was argued, was at the heart of the digital age, and America had therefore to make its own. Likewise, some Asian tigers still see in chip making not just a way to make money, but also a short-cut to a higher-technology economy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But this view is, at best, out of date. Like steel, chips have become just any other commodity. From the point of view of national economies, it matters little where they are made, provided that they are available to be cheaply bought. What matters more is how they are subsequently used.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Which is, of course, the second big change. For the first 20 years or so of microelectronics, the applications for the new technology seemed obvious. Computers shrank, then moved from the basement to the desktop to the wristwatch, which will soon doubtless be able to phone the nearest restaurant as well as announce that it is time for lunch. Intelligence, of a sort, became distributed: a car's brakes may now "think" quite hard about how to avert a skid. It was microchips that made Ronald Reagan's "star wars" dream almost feasible; maybe you really could track and destroy hundreds of thousands of fast-moving objects in space. The potential applications seemed as boundless as the human imagination.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The trouble is that the imagination does have bounds. Arguably, part of the industry's present plight is the result of computational power having briefly outstripped useful applications for it. A case in point is the reluctance of people to buy Microsoft's new operating system, Windows 95. Though it simplifies and prettifies what appears on the computer's monitor, this program requires more memory than most home computers currently possess. The chip industry hoped that this would propel demand for its own products, but a lot of consumers seem to have decided, for now at least, to forgo the marginal improvement the software provides.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Taken alone, the fate of this product is nothing more than a straw in the wind, a function of one firm's decisions about timing and pricing. But a lot of other straws are bending the same way. Having initially been transformed by microelectronics, the consumer-electronics industry must now struggle to dream up new "killer applications" as lucrative as personal stereos and video recorders. There are branches of science in which it is not too fanciful to wonder whether researchers have run out of sound ways to use all the computation at their fingertips. With "genetic algorithms", computers are more or less asked to crunch numbers aimlessly in the hope of something interesting popping up. It is telling that economists have so far found the precise productivity benefits of information technology difficult to pin down and measure.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Can people ever run out of new uses for computers? For a while, perhaps, but not for long. If anything, the computer is right now in the early throes of a new phase of its revolution, as it becomes more an instrument of communication, less one of computation. It is, after all, only in the past few years that microelectronics has invented what amounts to a whole new dimension of commerce and discourse. You do not have to be a nerd or a mystic to see that historians will look back upon the emergence of "cyberspace" as a turning point no less decisive than the advent of the computer itself.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A machine that transforms communication impinges far more radically on people's lives than one that transforms computation. Why mass media, when information can be consumed in individualised packets? Must workplaces be "places" at all? The next limiting factor is not going to be the ability to imagine the future, or to invent it; many people think they can imagine it all too well. It is their willingness to embrace it that will matter most.

<h2>An edgy peace</h2>
After four years of strife, <b>Sarajevo</b> <b>was reunited</b> in accordance with the Dayton peace plan. But when Bosnia's Muslim-Croat federation took over the last of the city's Serb suburbs, most residents fled--under pressure from Serb nationalists hostile to the notion of a multi-ethnic Bosnia. Meanwhile, transatlantic tension is again rising, as the Europeans refuse to back American plans for arming Bosnia's Muslims, and the Americans have yet to provide any money for economic reconstruction.<p>Britain blocked the latest European plans to develop an embryonic cross-border European police force, <b>Europol</b>, arguing that the European Court of Justice should not be allowed to settle disputes involving the new force.<p>The British government's scientific advisers admitted for the first time that <font size=-1>BSE</font>--better known as <b>"mad cow disease"</b>--may be transmitted to humans through infected beef. The government promised stricter controls on the beef industry and more money for scientific research.<p>Germany's main opposition party, the Social Democrats, demanded that unlimited immigration of <b>ethnic Germans</b> from the former Soviet Union, where up to 2m may still live, should be stopped.<p>The Duma, the lower house of the Russian parliament, voted to reassert "the legitimacy" of <b>the Soviet Union </b>and to denounce the 1991 treaty that set up the Commonwealth of Independent States. The votes, which have no direct constitutional force, were condemned by President Boris Yeltsin.<p>The Swedish parliament approved <b>Goran Persson</b>, a former finance minister, as the country's prime minister to replace Ingvar Carlsson, who has retired.<p>
<h2>For sure</h2>
Senator Bob Dole clinched the Republican nomination for the <b>presidency </b>with a convincing sweep of mid-western state primaries. The press worried intensely about his age and state of health. His only remaining rival, Pat Buchanan, promised to continue to fight for "the rights of the unborn" and for American workers.<p>General <b>Colin Powell </b>ruled out running for "any elective office", thereby squashing speculation that he would be Mr Dole's running-mate.<p><b>Ross Perot </b>announced that he would run for the presidency if supporters of his Reform Party asked him to. He would, however, prefer to see his party led by "George Washington II", assuming he could find him.<p>Trade ministers from all western-hemisphere countries but Cuba met in Cartagena, Colombia, to discuss pan-American <b>free trade</b>. At the World Trade Organisation in Geneva, the <font size=-1>EU</font>, backed by Mexico and Canada, denounced the United States' new law on investment in Cuba; a formal dispute may follow. In Florence, Central American foreign ministers met <font size=-1>EU</font> ones, to upgrade links; the region gets more aid from <font size=-1>EU</font> countries than from the United States, but two-way trade is only $5 billion a year.</p></td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%><p>Three <b>Colombian</b> <b>ministers </b>were named for investigation in the drug-money scandal relating to last year's presidential election. One of them, the country's foreign minister, Rodrigo Pardo, resigned "temporarily".<p><b>Guatemala's</b> <font size=-1>URNG </font> rebels and army began a truce, after 35 years of fighting.<p>

<h2>Bar the shouting</h2>
A war of words broke out between America and China over <b>Taiwan</b>. After a Chinese demand that American warships stay clear of the Taiwan Strait, the defence secretary, William Perry, said that America "has the best damned navy in the world, and no one should ever forget that." Taiwan asked America to sell it weapons to break any possible blockade by the Chinese.<p>The Bangladeshi prime minister, Khaleda Zia, agreed to an opposition demand for a <b>neutral government </b>to oversee a future general election, but she refused to step down immediately.<p>The Indian government, burdened by a corruption scandal, will hold a <b>general election </b>in late April and May.<p>China's parliament, the National People's Congress, passed a law stating that <b>defendants are innocent </b>until proven guilty.<p>Australia's <b>Labor Party</b> elected Kim Beazley as its new leader, to replace Paul Keating, who led his party to defeat in the recent general election.<p>
<h2>Underwhelmed</h2>
<b>Zimbabwe's </b>President Robert Mugabe, 72, was re-elected for another six years. He took 93% of the votes, but in a turnout of only 32%.<p><b>Sierra Leone</b> got a civilian president, Ahmad Tejan Kabbah, after four years of army rule. Declared winner, he said the soldiers would hand over by end-March.<p>Mathieu K&eacuter&eacutekou, <b>Benin</b>'s old dictator, thrown out through the ballot box in 1991, appeared to have been brought back by voters disillusioned with President Nic&eacutephore Soglo. But the result remains unclear.<p><b>Sudan</b>, which may soon face <font size=-1>UN</font> sanctions for harbouring men suspected of trying to assassinate Egypt's president last year, also held a general election at which the president and most of his cabinet were re-elected.<p>South Africa's president, <b>Nelson Mandela</b>, was granted a divorce from <b>Winnie</b> after 38 years of marriage.<p>The cycle of violence in <b>Bahrain</b> continued with a hotel bombed and large-scale arrests. The government's new security measures are expected to include a special court to try protesters.<p>

<h2>Fighting the flab</h2>
<P>(See <a href="wtw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>Europe's largest car maker seems to have recovered from a bad spell of several years. Though still some way off its best year, <b>Volkswagen</b> more than doubled its net profits in 1995 to DM336m ($234m) on worldwide sales up 10%, and said it would sharply raise its dividend. But its French counterpart, <b>Renault</b>, saw net profits sag by 41% to FFr2.14 billion ($429m). Commercial-vehicle sales jumped but its car-making unit sunk from a profit of FFr289m to an operating loss of FFr1.7 billion, putting the French government's hopes of privatising Renault in jeopardy.<p>America's <b>Rockwell </b>is seeking a buyer for its aerospace and defence businesses, valued at some $3.5 billion, as the country's defence industry continues to consolidate rapidly; both Boeing and McDonnell Douglas are said to be interested in buying.<p>The German government said <b>Airbus Industrie </b>would have to turn itself from a loose consortium into an efficient, commercial company before it would consider subsidies to develop new planes. A&eacuterospatiale, the consortium's French member, appeared to welcome the idea even though it could suffer most.<p>Workers and managers were close to settling the strike at two of <b>General Motors</b>' parts factories in Dayton, Ohio. The strike, which began on March 5th over job security and the outside supply of some parts, had affected nearly all <font size=-1>GM</font>'s 29 American factories and some 175,000 workers. It was the firm's most damaging in 25 years.<p>Swedish-Swiss <b>ABB</b>, one of Europe's most admired companies, is suspected by European Union investigators of participating in an alleged price-rigging cartel in the European market for district heating.<p>Sweden's Wallenberg industrial empire expects to raise between SKr15.5 billion ($2.3 billion) and SKr18.5 billion with the sale of a 50% stake in <b>Scania</b>, the world's most profitable lorry maker, in a stockmarket flotation.<p><b>The Russians and Americans may produce a joint </b><b>supersonic passenger jet</b>, based in part on the Tupolev-144, freshly out of mothballs, whose maiden flight was in 1968 and which resembles a larger version of the Franco-British Concorde.<p>
<h2>Trades and swaps</h2>
<p>Shaking off the previous week's upsets not only in America's markets but worldwide, the <b>Dow Jones </b>soared to a new record before dropping back after Digital Equipment warned of a poor outlook for computer sales.</p></td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>The <b>London Stock Exchange</b> is moving after all to a system of electronic order-driven trading, in place of its present market-making system. This was the change advocated by Michael Lawrence, its former chief executive, whose dismissal in January was blamed by many on the power of the exchange's market-making members.<p>World <b>financial regulators </b>met in Florida and agreed to share information on unusual trades, in an effort to prevent another shock like the collapse of Britain's Barings bank last year.<p>Nine former executives at <b>Barings </b>have been barred from working in the City for up to three years by the Securities and Futures Authority. But Peter Baring, chairman of the group, and Andrew Tuckey, chairman of the investment-banking unit, were cleared by the authority.<p>
<h2>Muscle flexing</h2>
Managers of Calpers, the California Public Employees' Retirement System, asked the pension fund's board to approve an international <b>corporate governance</b> programme. The $97 billion fund would pressure the foreign firms in which it invests to be more responsive to shareholders.<p>(See <a href="wtw2.gif">chart</a>)<br><b>The Japanese economy </b>grew at its fastest rate in five years, an expansion boosted by stronger than expected consumer spending. In the last quarter of 1995, <font size=-1>GDP</font> grew by 0.9%, giving an annualised rate of 3.6% that more than doubles many estimates of growth, despite a shrinking trade surplus.<p>There were fresh rumours in <b>Argentina </b>that Domingo Cavallo would resign. Wrong again. But he did cut taxes to boost the economy, still saying that <font size=-1>GDP</font> would grow by about 5% this year.<p>Brazil's government announced an 8 billion <i>real </i>($8.1 billion) bail-out of <b>Banco do Brasil</b>, the country's largest bank.<p>
<h2>Kids' stuff</h2>
<p><b>Michael Jackson</b> and <b>Prince Alwaleed bin Talal bin Abdulaziz Saud</b>, a Saudi businessman whose interests include large stakes in Citicorp, Euro Disney and Canary Wharf, are forming a global entertainment company, Kingdom Entertainment, that will focus on " family values".<p>Britain's General Electric has found a successor to<b> Lord Weinstock</b>, who has now been managing director for 33 years and is to retire later this year. He is George Simpson, chief executive of Lucas Industries, a British engineering group which recorded a 38% jump in first-half profits to &#163;61.6m ($95.9m).<p>In a bid to placate unions opposed to privatisation, the French government said it would retain control of <b>France T&eacutel&eacutecom</b> while hoping to convert the state utility into a corporation with its own capital. But as Europe's telecoms giants come closer to liberalisation, even that step upsets the unions. They threatened to strike.<p><p></p>

<h1>When the chips are down</h1>
<p><b>The semiconductor business, one of the world's largest industries, is about to go through a period of wrenching change</b></p>

<p>FOR most of the 1990s, the chip industry has seemed like one of the most extraordinary money-making machines ever devised. Demand soared; the power of the chips themselves soared; and prices rose or stayed stable.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The result was a bonanza for chip makers which outweighed the experience of the mid-1980s, when price wars split the business in two, driving many American firms out of the mass-production end of the industry making memory chips and forcing them to concentrate on higher value-added chips such as micro-processors. It also outweighed the late 1980s, when Japanese firms (which concentrate on memory chips) lost billions during a trade war with America. The past few years have been richer than all those tough years combined.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Bankers Trust calculates that profit margins for Taiwan's chip makers, for example, rose from 16% in 1990 to nearly 60% in 1995. Last year, the number of memory chips sold rose 40% and the memory-chip business probably made profits of nearly $30 billion on revenues of $55 billion. Some fabrication plants have been making nearly $1 billion in net profits each year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What was just as extraordinary was that this period seemed to overturn a basic rule of the chip business which says that the power of a chip doubles every 18 months and, as a corollary, prices halve (originally, it was every year: the rule was expounded as long ago as 1965 by Gordon Moore, a co-founder of Intel, an American chip maker). More power for less money was the combination that made semiconductors the business that transformed business. Yet in the early 1990s, with personal-computer (<font size=-1>PC</font>) demand skyrocketing and memory chips in short supply, the price of these basic chips climbed to three times their cost of production and stayed there, defying every established pattern.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then, last December, it all started to go wrong. First, prices started to tumble. The market price of the most common kind of memory chip, which had been as high as $13 in November 1995, began dropping by more than $1 a month as <font size=-1>PC </font>makers dumped excess stocks after disappointing sales during the Christmas season. By March the price was down to around $9 (see <a href="sf1.gif">chart</a>; for comparison, a state-of-the-art micro-processor can cost $1,000).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In January, things got worse. The Semiconductor Industry Association reported that its so-called " book-to-bill" ratio had dropped to 0.92, its lowest point since 1985. That meant that for every $100-worth of chips the industry was making, it was only taking orders for $92-worth of new ones. It was the first time since 1989 that the indicator had gone below 1.0. At first, the industry shrugged off that figure as an anomaly. Then came February's number: 0.90. For businessmen accustomed to soaring sales, this sort of slump is enough to send them to the window ledge.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Suddenly, manufacturers are scrambling to postpone planned expansion. Micron, America's largest memory-chip producer, says it will delay completion of a $2.5 billion fabrication plant in Utah. Fujitsu of Japan has announced it will delay the start of a similar plant in Britain. A consortium of American and Asian firms has scrapped plans to build another plant in Taiwan.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The cutbacks are needed. Profits for the five big Japanese chip makers had been expected to grow 55% this year; instead, analysts reckon, they will grow 15%. In the past six months, the Philadelphia semiconductor index, a measure of the share prices of American chip makers, has dropped 45%.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For users of chips--which now means everyone from purchasers of <font size=-1>PC</font>s to manufacturers of cars and pop-up toasters--the fall in chip prices must be welcome. Chips are now everywhere--there are some 200 billion in use, installed in everything from computers and telecommunications to greetings cards. The average American house has 50 chips in consumer goods from the microwave oven to the door chime; a new <font size=-1>BMW </font>may have more than 50. Automotive semiconductors alone are a $5 billion market. All these businesses will benefit--albeit, in many cases, marginally--as their components become cheaper.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So will other firms. Firms such as South Korea's Samsung and Japan's <font size=-1>NEC</font> have used their semiconductor factories as cash cows to bankroll expansion into everything from <font size=-1>PC</font>s and cars to aerospace. If memory-chip prices continue to fall, the cash cows will run dry, exposing the real costs of money-losing or inefficient parts of the conglomerates, which could force the parent firms to pull back from some markets altogether. This is bad news for them, of course, but good for competitors, who no longer have cross-subsidisation from semiconductors to worry about. And consumers everywhere should benefit in the long run because production and investment will no longer be skewed by profits from chips.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But to leave the argument there, and to say that no one need worry about falling semiconductor prices, is to under-estimate how much a shake-out in the chip industry would matter in its own right. The reason has to do with the sheer size of the business. Worldwide semiconductor sales passed $150 billion last year, three times what they were a decade ago. Chips in all their varieties now make up some 15% of the world equipment market, up from 7% in the mid-1980s. By mid-1997, if the growth rates of 1995 were to continue, America's chip manufacturers (which are, remember, mainly in the luxury end of the business) would be bigger than its steel industry; by 2000, they would be as big as aerospace. Mr Moore has facetiously remarked that, on these trends, the world's semiconductor market would be bigger than the world's <font size=-1>GDP</font> by 2040. Upheavals in such an industry matter.
</p><p><b>Wheel of misfortune</b><br>(see <a href="sf2.gif">table</a>)<br>So why have prices suddenly plunged? And might they go on falling?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All industries have downturns. But semiconductor firms have good reason to fear theirs more than most. The chip market tends to be highly unstable, partly because there are few industries that involve such massive fixed costs and partly because demand for chips can change rapidly, while a new fabrication plant can take a year or more to build.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The long lead times needed to build a plant mean that the supply of chips tends to be sticky: that is, it does not adjust smoothly to price changes or to changes in demand. Normally, manufacturers tend to reduce the output of goods for which demand and price are falling. But last year's investment in chips will produce a big extra supply just as prices are slumping. This will push prices even lower.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The volatility of the chip market is compounded by manufacturers' high fixed costs. New fabrication plants ("fabs") can cost well over $1 billion, and the biggest will cost more than $2 billion within a year or two. State-of-the-tech fabs become obsolete in three to five years; staying ahead in such a business requires a large chip maker to spend vast sums simply to keep up with technology. Last year semiconductor firms spent $30 billion on new fabrication capacity. Intel, America's largest chip manufacturer, spent $3 billion alone.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To recoup its investment, a semiconductor firm will want to run the plant as near to full capacity as possible. This means it might not cut production even when demand drops, producing a glut and even lower prices. Conversely, when demand rises, there may be no spare capacity in existing plants, leading to a shortage and soaring prices.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Curiously, such market instability is a characteristic that the high-tech chip business shares with that most basic of industries, agriculture. Farming is also a commodity business in which supplies adjust stickily to demand because of long lead times (the months it takes to grow a crop or fatten an animal for market). Farmers must fix next year's output on this year's prices, leading to unstable price swings.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Volatile prices have long been used to justify government intervention in agriculture (to smooth out price fluctuations). Such intervention has occurred in the chip market, too--and made matters worse.
</p><p><b>Sinking the chip</b>
<br>In the 1980s, when <font size=-1>IBM</font> launched the <font size=-1>PC</font> revolution, Japanese firms had both the technical skills to design new chips and the money to build new plants. They started selling chips cheaply into America, causing American firms to cry foul and to accuse the Japanese of "dumping" chips at below the cost of production. The American government took up their cause, imposing steep import tariffs on Japanese chips and some consumer-electronic hardware.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The strategy backfired. By 1987 all but two big American firms had left the memory-chips business for higher-value microprocessing. Meanwhile, the tariffs had helped drive up the cost of memory chips by nearly 300%, harming chip purchasers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With America mostly out of the memory market, and Japan reining in output to avoid worsening the trade row (and because its economy was beginning to slow anyway), the result was another overshoot, this time the other way. Demand outstripped supply and prices soared. Hence the artificially inflated chip prices of the early 1990s.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Markets, like nature, abhor a vacuum. South Korean firms such as Samsung and the <font size=-1>LG </font>Group (then Lucky Goldstar) looked at high memory-chip prices and saw a chance to make a killing. Designing chips is a research-intensive job. But making them is largely a matter of buying the equipment and building a "clean room" in which to put it. The Koreans started building their own fabs, financed by the deep pockets of the <i>chaebol--</i>the family-owned conglomerates of which they are part. Last year, South Korea overtook Japan as the largest producer of memory chips, just as Japan had overtaken America ten years earlier.
</p><p><b>The chip cyclist returns</b>
<br>Given the experience of the Japanese, it might seem foolhardy for the South Koreans to bet so much of their expansion on memory chips. But they, and others like them, may have thought the industry had changed and its cycles had been tamed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Chip makers are now in closer contact with their customers than they once were. With a direct link to a <font size=-1>PC </font>makers' inventory system, a chip maker can use "just-in-time" manufacturing techniques to keep supplies tied more closely to demand. Electronics firms have cut their average chip inventory from 11 weeks in 1985 to just three, which should, in theory, restrain massive over-supply. The industry is geographically dispersed. In the 1980s, almost all of it took place in America or Japan, making chips sensitive to the yen/dollar exchange rate. Today, new entrants are flooding in from Asia (notably South Korea, Taiwan, Singapore and Hong Kong). And chips are now being used in more industries than before, making suppliers--apparently--less sensitive to any one business.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In fact, as the current downturn shows, these changes have not proved enough to flatten out the chip cycle. Surges of investment continue, regardless of what is happening to inventory-control systems. Though new producers are starting up, America and Japan still have nearly 80% of the world market between them. Above all, the spread of chips into new markets is not what it seems. True, chips are found in thousands of different devices these days. But chip manufacturers still make most of their money from just one industry: computers. Dan Hutcheson, president of <font size=-1>VLSI</font> Research, a California-based consultancy firm, reckons that computers account for some 60% of semiconductor revenues. Mobile telephones account for perhaps another 10%. Nothing else comes close.
</p><p><b>Fear Windows</b>
<br>So, ubiquitous or not, chips remain vulnerable to the fortunes of the computer business. Both the recent slump in memory-chip prices and the plunge in the book-to-bill ratio have their roots in changes affecting the <font size=-1>PC</font> industry. Those changes stem primarily from the rise of Microsoft, a software company.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In their 15 years of existence, <font size=-1>PC</font>s have evolved in fits and starts. Bursts of activity followed the invention of processor chips, made by Intel. Intel started with the 8086 chip, then the 80286, then the 80386, each separated by about three years. Each was faster than the previous generation, and sold a lot of new <font size=-1>PC</font>s. But the number and value of chips in those machines stayed about the same. Then came Microsoft's Windows operating system, introduced in the late 1980s.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Windows required 4m bytes of memory to run well, twice as much as most <font size=-1>PC</font>s then had. As the system took off, new <font size=-1>PC</font>s were made with at least that much memory, doubling the growth in demand for memory chips. Last year, Microsoft released Windows 95, which needed twice as much memory again. As <font size=-1>PC</font> users groaned under the hype surrounding the new program, chip makers were slavering at the thought of the extra demand it required.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But nothing happened--or not much. Companies have been slow to buy Windows 95, partly because of associated hardware costs, partly because it is not clear to them how to use the extra software power, and partly because Microsoft has another, more powerful, operating system, called Windows <font size=-1>NT</font>, in the wings. The result is that many firms have decided to wait and see whether to upgrade--and are buying nothing in the meantime. This has not only hurt memory chips, but has also slowed demand at the higher-value-added end of the business, micro-processing. Intel's latest processor, the Pentium Pro, runs efficiently only under one of the two new versions of Windows. In this respect, though the chip business may no longer be monolithic, different parts of it are affected similarly by changes in computing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Chip makers hope that their computer-driven woes are temporary. If <font size=-1>PC</font> sales begin to pick up soon, the "book to bill" ratio might rise above 1.0 and the free fall in prices might slow (though, with new capacity coming on stream, prices are likely to keep going down).
</p><p><b>Chip shape?</b></b>
<br>But even if this happens, the big problem--the heart-stopping price of a new fabrication plant--remains. Chip makers are running up against the physical limits of the technology itself: transistors on a state-of-the-art chip are now packed so closely together that they are near the point beyond which electrons tunnel through insulating walls and individual atoms become obstacles. Engineers may be able to get around this hurdle but the cost is likely to be astronomical. Meanwhile, the law of diminishing returns seems to be setting in. Between 1984 and 1990, the cost of a fabrication plant doubled but chip makers were able to triple the performance of a chip (measured by the number of components packed on to a sliver of silicon). They are unlikely to do as well next time. The next generation of fabs will see costs double again by 1998, but this is likely to produce only a 50% improvement in performance. What, then, can firms do?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The answer is three things:
<li> Team up. Writing recently in <i>Scientific American</i>, a monthly journal, the founders of <font size=-1>VLSI </font>Research calculate that rising costs will soon make chip manufacturing unaffordable for single firms. Increasingly, chip makers are sharing the costs of a new fab with customers, competitors, even countries. <font size=-1>IBM </font>and Toshiba are building a fab together, as are Motorola and Siemens; all four are working together on design. Texas Instruments started with a deal with the Italian government for a new fab, then tied up with Taiwan's Acer, Japan's Kobe Steel and a Singaporean consortium. The alliances have saved it more than $1 billion in capital costs over the past few years.
<li> Subcontract manufacturing. Other firms are dealing with the problem of expensive fabs by not having one at all. These so-called "fabless" firms design the chips, then contract the manufactuer of them out to a "foundry" (a factory without its own design operation). The advantage for the fabless firms is that they can get into the chip business without having to spend billions on manufacture. The foundries still face the problems of the investment cycle, of course, but at least they can mix and match customers to help spread the risk of any one customer going sour. Fabless chip firms make up just 1% of the market today, but are expected to have 5% by 2000. In the meantime, foundries such as Taiwan Semiconductor Manufacturing and Singapore's Chartered Semiconductor Manufacturing are booming.
<li> Specialise. One of the advantages of separating design from production is that it lets companies exploit technology niches while leaving the cost of manufacturing to a contractor. As Intel has faced more competition in the micro-processor business, it has diversified, producing some 30 different kinds of 486 chips, compared with just two versions of its first processor. Toshiba is doing the same with memory chips.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Firms that survive to produce chips in five or ten years' time are likely to have adopted one or all of these strategies. But chip makers' immediate concern is simply to survive the next year or two as new entrants flood into the market. Mr Hutcheson reckons that Taiwan's chip makers, for instance, may soon discover that the profits that lured them in are no longer there. Likewise for some of the South Korean firms, such as Samsung, that have expanded most aggressively. The memory-chip market, he says "has never been for the weak of heart" . A lesson to remember in the good times: the bad times invariably return.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?827532000,iss">Search</a>

<p><b>GP fundholding</b></p>
<h1>Too little change</h1>
<p><b>According to the Audit Commission, one of the key elements of the government's health reforms is not yet working</b></p>

<p>"FUNDHOLDING"--the freedom of <font size=-1>NHS</font>-employed family doctors to manage their own budgets--is "one of the great successes" of the government's controversial <font size=-1>NHS</font> reforms, according to Stephen Dorrell, the health secretary. At the beginning of 1996, there were 2,200 fundholding general practicescontrolling &#163;3 billion of health-care spending. By next month, 15,000 practices (one in two) will be managing their own fixed budgets to pay for primary care, drug costs and non-urgent hospital treatment. <font size=-1>GP</font> fundholders boast that they have improved patient care, introduced new methods of treatment, and shortened hospital waiting times.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But how far are these claims justified? A two-year inquiry to be published shortly by the Audit Commission, a government agency which reviews public spending, provides scant comfort to the scheme's champions, which include this newspaper. Some details of the report, the most extensive examination so far of the fundholding experiment, were first leaked earlier this month to the <i>Health Service Journal</i>, a medical weekly. Since then <i>The Economist</i> has seen a draft of the entire report.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It concludes that most fundholding doctors have secured "few measurable benefits to patients". Instead, fundholders themselves have garnered a fair part of such benefits as have been achieved. On average 60% of the scheme's savings have been used to improve surgery premises. Though patients benefit from this, some doctors have done even better, pocketing higher prices for their practices when they sell them to other doctors.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These findings will embarrass ministers who claim that the government's <font size=-1>NHS</font> reforms--designed to create an "internal market" by splitting "purchasers" and "providers" of health care--have revolutionised the delivery of services to patients. But the Audit Commission's findings will delight Labour and the Liberal Democrats, who have argued that the administrative costs of fundholding outweigh whatever benefits it has produced. Labour is committed to ending fundholding.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The most common complaint against fundholding is that it is creating a two-tier health service. If only that were so. In fact, the Audit Commission's report finds that average hospital waiting times for patients of fundholders were not significantly shorter than those for non-fundholding practices. The commission acknowledges the scheme's considerable potential to improve delivery of primary health services, but says that most doctors are failing to exploit its possibilities. Instead they continue to purchase the same products and services in the same quantities from the same hospitals and drug companies as in the past. In short, little has changed.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Few fundholders, the report says, possess the information needed to improve the lot of their patients. Most do not know the average waiting time to see a hospital specialist or the length of the queue for particular specialities. The commission also found no evidence that fundholders prescribe drugs more economically--by using, for example, generic instead of branded versions--than other doctors. Most fundholders also failed to save money by greater use of day surgery for minor operations instead of hospital treatment.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Audit Commission is particularly critical of health authorities, which employ <font size=-1>GP</font>s, for failing to monitor the performance of fundholders. Some 15% of <font size=-1>NHS</font> spending is already controlled by fundholders but financial oversight of this spending is patchy, according to the report.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More than one in five fundholders overspent their budgets in 1993-94. But, whereas fundholding practices are allowed to keep surpluses from their budget, and use the extra money in subsequent years, there is no mechanism for health authorities to claw back deficits. This lack of financial discipline is highlighted by the commission's report. Only 13% of the 1,308 fundholders surveyed had received any response to the financial reports they filed monthly with the health authority. Half of the fundholders interviewed by the commission had not been visited by their health authority during the previous year. The report condemns this as inadequate.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Perhaps the most damning aspect of the report is the spotlight it puts on the costs of fundholding. Staff, equipment and computing costs swallowed &#163;232m in the first five years of the scheme, the equivalent of two additional hospitals. But this is only part of the additional cost.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Local health authorities estimate that it costs them &#163;5,900 a year to deal witheach fundholder. The Audit Commission quotes the estimate of one hospitaltrust that it costs four times as much to negotiate contracts with 13 fundholding practices, accounting for 4% of the trust's income, as it does with the local health authority, accounting for 91% of its income. The <font size=-1>NHS</font> reforms were bound to raise administrative costs--if only because there was little administration, and thus financial transparency, before them. But these numbers look excessive set against the lack of measurable benefits for patients which the commission has found.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Amid so much bad news, it is easy to overlook the good. The report accepts that fundholding has led to improved communication between <font size=-1>GP</font>s, hospitals and hospital doctors. This must be of benefit to patients. It also notes that some innovative fundholders have introduced real improvements for their patients, such as local physiotherapy services. One fundholder switched orthopaedic operations to a different hospital, thereby saving his practice &#163;40,000 a year. But, says the commission, there are simply too few such examples.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The message that comes loud and clear from the Audit Commission is that the additional costs of fundholding can be justified only if real benefits to patients can be secured. The commission believes this is possible. The scheme has considerable potential, it says, arguing that the principle of devolving control over purchasing decisions to <font size=-1>GP</font>s should, eventually, produce a more efficient and responsive <font size=-1>NHS</font>. But the potential of fundholding, the commission says, has yet to be realised.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The commission makes no specific recommendations about how to do this. But it is clearly wrong that there are few sanctions against those practices which either overspend or underspend by large amounts. Deficits should not automatically be made good; nor should decisions over profit levels be left to the sole discretion of fundholders. Health authorities, which are responsible for most purchasing decisions, cannot entirely abdicate their responsibility for primary health care. They need closely to monitor both the clinical and financial performance of all fundholding practices, encouraging the spread of the best techniques. As the Audit Commission points out, the <font size=-1>NHS</font> has barely begun the first steps on a huge programme of change. The right incentives are not yet in place.

<p><b>Divorce law</b></p>
<h1>Tears at bedtime</h1>


<p>(See <a href="br1.gif">chart</a>)<br>LIKE the impulse to probe a painful tooth, divorce law appears to be irresistible to legislators. Rich countries all over the world have been tinkering with ways to make divorce better, or at least less awful. In Britain, a divorce bill proposed by Lord Mackay, the Lord Chancellor, receives its second reading in the House of Commons on March 25th, after a rough passage through the House of Lords. If it passes, it will be the fourth change to the divorce laws since 1969. And it will not be the last. On March 21st, the cabinet met to discuss the Lords' last-minute amendment, requiring equal pension rights. The government would prefer not to deal with the complexities of pension-splitting in this bill, but knows it cannot wish it away. The issue is particularly sensitive in Britain, because job-based pensions predominate; in Europe, where state pensions are more important, it has been fairly simple--though expensive--to extend equal pension rights to all adults.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Britain differs from other developed countries in two other important respects. Three-quarters of British divorces are fault-based: one partner accuses the other of adultery, cruelty or unreasonable behaviour. In many of these, one partner agrees to carry the blame in order to get a quick divorce (a two-year wait is required for a no-fault divorce). With a good lawyer and an uncrowded court schedule, a determined couple can get a divorce in three months.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Continental Europe and all other English-speaking countries have already moved towards a norm of no-fault divorce; in those countries where fault is retained, such as France, it is used sparingly. Defenders of fault say that it acts as a deterrent to frivolous divorce; sceptics wonder why, then, so many British couples seem eager to assign fault--and why Britain has the highest divorce rate in Europe.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Britain is also unusual in that divorce is possible--and not uncommon--before arrangements about finances, custody and child support have been agreed to. This, too, would change under the bill: no deal, no divorce. In some ways, then, Britain is swimming with the tide. But in others, Lord Mackay's controversial reforms set Britain somewhat apart. The first is that, under his bill, there would be no distinction between contested and uncontested divorces, as there is now. France, Belgium, Germany, Italy, Portugal and most other European countries (except some in Scandinavia) maintain some kind of distinction between divorces in which both spouses want to end a marriage, and those in which only one does. Typically, where there is an unwilling spouse, he or she can delay a divorce, but not deny it indefinitely. Critics of Lord Mackay's bill argue that removing this distinction undermines the principle that marriage is binding: it makes matrimony the only form of contract that one party can breach without penalty.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second provision that would make Britain different from many of its European neighbours concerns mediation. The legislation recommends using counsellors, rather than lawyers, to reach a settlement, in order to make divorce less nasty. Just as getting rid of fault eliminates the need to tell, or make up, outrageous stories about the "guilty" spouse, getting rid of the lawyers (some of the time, anyway) is supposed to minimise conflict.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although mediation is presented as voluntary, in practice it may often be mandatory. About three-quarters of divorces are sought by women; three-quarters of these use legal aid. To the extent that legal-aid money is instead used for mediation, the effect could be to limit legal assistance. Feminists fear that more women than men would be hurt by this. Perhaps, but feminist-friendly Australia and Canada have long emphasised mediation, and are happy with it. New Zealand has gone furthest of all. Its state mediation service is free to all couples; the government claims a high rate of reconciliation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Curiously, mediation seems an English-language phenomenon, perhaps a response to the ferociously confrontational nature of Anglo-Saxon legal systems. Nowhere in continental Europe (except a few Swiss cantons) has come out as strongly as Britain in favour of mediation. Although Germany encourages the practice, Belgium actually removed a requirement to mediate in 1994. Scandinavian countries and the Netherlands work on the principle that, if a couple wants to split, the partners should work out the details by themselves.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The third point of difference between Britain and the rest is that Lord Mackay is using divorce reform explicitly to assert the value of marriage. Reducing the trauma of divorce presents opportunities to save salvageable marriages, which he argues is the state's duty and in its interest. And yet by treating all divorce alike and putting a larger burden on the couple to come to terms, Britain would be moving in a distinctly Scandinavian direction. The Scandinavians, though, do not share Lord Mackay's view of marriage. They see it as a voluntary arrangement between two individuals, and divorce as an individual right that should be easy to exercise.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One issue no country has come to grips with is that a large minority of divorced fathers lose interest in their children. In Britain, two years after divorce about 40% of fathers have stopped visiting regularly; and Sweden is not alone in reporting that the proportion of men paying child support is slipping. Such paternal aloofness can damage children in ways that show up in their behaviour, schooling and health. Through the much-hated Child Support Agency, Britain seeks to enforce the collection of child support, but the divorce bill goes no further in defining parental obligations.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Other countries are experimenting with ways to instil the idea that post-divorce fatherhood means more than sending a cheque. Germany's proposed family law stresses that the non-custodial parent (almost always the father) retains legal responsibility; it also appeals to parents to respect their child's desire to see the absent parent. Australia's new family law encourages couples to draw up detailed "parenting plans". A number of countries, including Portugal, the Netherlands, Sweden and Denmark, promote "joint responsibility" arrangements that assert both parents' legal responsibility for their children. It is too early to say whether such legal remedies have had any effect. In practice, mothers are still likely to do most of the work, with occasional assistance from dad.

<p><b>Competition policy</b></p>
<h1>An unholy mess</h1>


<p>THOSE who dislike the government's approach to competition policy, ranging from the Labour Party to consumer organisations, say it is muddle-headed, weak and contradictory. The critics are about to be handed a perfect example of regulatory chaos.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Department of Trade and Industry (<font size=-1>DTI</font>) is on the point of abandoning a criminal investigation of Unilever's subsidiary, Birds Eye Wall's, for misleading the Monopolies and Mergers Commission (<font size=-1>MMC</font>). The <font size=-1>DTI</font> has been forced to abandon its investigation by the <font size=-1>MMC</font>'s refusal to accept that it was misled by Birds Eye Wall's when it cleared the company of unfair trading practices in its 1994 inquiry into the &#163;250m market for wrapped ice cream.This market for the goodies sold direct from shops' freezer cabinets, known in the trade as "impulse ice cream", is dominated by Wall's, which has a 66% share of it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>MMC</font>'s position is causing considerable friction in Whitehall, with officials from the Office of Fair Trading (<font size=-1>OFT</font>) in open disagreement with it. The <font size=-1>DTI</font> is also at loggerheads with the <font size=-1>MMC</font> because the agency has refused to supply transcripts of oral evidence given to it. These are needed to make an assessment of whether a prosecution could succeed. Officials believe the <font size=-1>MMC</font> is taking such an obdurate line because it fears that a prosecution would raise embarrassing questions about its handling of the case and the thoroughness of its procedures. The <font size=-1>MMC</font> has issued a formal statement to <i>The Economist</i> claiming that it had "co-operated fully" with the <font size=-1>OFT</font>'s and <font size=-1>DTI</font>'s investigations. Other Whitehall sources do not agree.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This internecine Whitehall dispute stems from a year-long investigation conducted by the <font size=-1>OFT</font> into complaints that an <font size=-1>MMC</font> inquiry into wrapped ice cream sales in 1994 had been derailed by false evidence. Two months ago, the <font size=-1>OFT</font> concluded that there was a <i>prima facie </i>case that Birds Eye Wall's had "knowingly or recklessly misled" the <font size=-1>MMC</font>. This is an offence under Section 93B of the 1973 Fair Trading Act. Penalties on conviction range from a fine to two years in prison, though no company has yet been prosecuted under the law.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The row arises from undertakings given by Birds Eye Wall's that retailers were "under no contractual obligation whatsoever" to obtain supplies of Wall's ice cream exclusively from the company's concessionaires. In response to the <font size=-1>MMC</font>'s concerns about its trading practices, Slaughter and May, the company's solicitors, wrote on November 26th, 1993: "Steps have been taken that no pressure will be put on retailers." On November 30th of that year, the commercial director of Birds Eye Wall's, Alan Brown, was asked by the <font size=-1>MMC</font>'s deputy chairman, Hans Liesner, what precise actions had been taken by the company. Mr Brown replied: "Instructions have gone to all the sales staff that no pressure should be put on retailers." However, last November Birds Eye Wall's admitted that no such instructions had, in fact, been given.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It was on the basis of these assurances, nevertheless, that the <font size=-1>MMC</font> found that the company's trading practices were not operating against the public interest. But when the <font size=-1>OFT</font> began an investigation, it was sent copies of more than 50 contracts, some dated as late as last year, which required retailers to purchase Wall's ice cream only from one of the company's concessionaires. It was also given statements by several concessionaires confirming that the policy was backed by senior Birds Eye Wall's directors. At a very late stage in the <font size=-1>OFT</font>'s investigation, Birds Eye Wall's conceded that the company had inadvertently misled the <font size=-1>MMC</font>. It admitted that instructions to sales staff that retailers were free to buy Wall's ice cream from any wholesaler had not been sent out until after the publication of the <font size=-1>MMC</font>'s report in March 1994.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As a result of this admission, together with the documentary evidence of the contracts, the <font size=-1>OFT</font> concluded that Birds Eye Wall's had misled the <font size=-1>MMC</font>. But at a meeting earlier this month of competition officials and lawyers called by the <font size=-1>DTI</font> to assess the evidence, Tony Nieduszynski, the <font size=-1>MMC</font>'s secretary, insisted that the commission had not been misled. He claimed that since July 1990, retailers had not been required to buy their Wall's ice cream from the firm's concessionaires even if some of the authorised distributors had acted as if there were still such an obligation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Faced by this position and the refusal of the <font size=-1>MMC</font> to supply essential evidence, lawyers from the <font size=-1>DTI</font> have concluded that there is no basis on which a prosecution of Birds Eye Wall's can succeed. The decision, which is unlikely to be announced for some weeks, may provoke an application for judicial review of the decision by competitor companies such as Mars and Treats.

<html><head><title>Stay back, China</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><p align=center><img src="http://www.economist.com/econlogosmall.gif" alt="The Economist"></p><h1><center>Stay back, China</center></h1>THEY may be only war games this time, but the roar of China's guns and missiles in the seas close to Taiwan brings Asia to a dangerous turning-point. China's blatant attempt to intimidate Taiwan before its first democratic presidential election, on March 23rd, suddenly has East Asia's most populous power eyeball-to-eyeball with its fourth-largest economic power, with all the damage that an accidental clash or a military miscalculation could do to stability in the region. But China's challenge goes beyond that. It cannot safely be left unanswered.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By using force to press its claim to Taiwan--as, last year, to vast tracts of the South China Sea--China has once again served notice on its neighbours and on the United States, the country with the greatest influence in the region, that it now feels strong enough to play Asia's power game by its own rules and win. If China is allowed to get away with bullying Taiwan, the security of one of the world's most dynamic, and potentially richest, regions will be in jeopardy. Yet standing up more stoutly to an increasingly pushy China will take the sort of clear thinking and plain talking that China's neighbours prefer to avoid.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is not just that the East Asians are wary of attracting mighty China's wrath--though they are. They had hoped, as western governments had, that reforms at home, combined with fast-growing trade with the outside world, would give China a big enough economic stake in the region in general and in Taiwan in particular to want to avoid a bust-up. Renegade province though it supposedly is, Taiwan is, after all, one of the biggest investors in the mainland. But money-making has not proved enough of a distraction for the newly assertive China. Meanwhile, other pressures have been at work that now make the China-Taiwan tiff too dangerous to shrug off, as East Asia's governments are still trying to do, as an " internal" Chinese affair (see <a href="as1.html">pages</a>).<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As China has grown in weight and confidence, so has Taiwan. Its huge overseas trade (12th in the world) and vast foreign-exchange reserves (second only to Japan's) make it an economic power in its own right. More important, it will soon have a properly elected president with a legitimate claim to speak for Taiwan's 21m people. That government would be foolish to provoke China unnecessarily by declaring independence, but it cannot simply ignore popular will. To judge by opinion polls, there is as yet no majority in Taiwan for declaring independence (if only because that would certainly provoke a direct Chinese military attack), but there is even less support for unification with the mainland. Contrary to China's expectations, and no doubt to its even greater annoyance, this week's gunfire diplomacy will probably diminish one-China enthusiasm still further.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By contrast, China's leaders, locked in an unnerving--and seemingly never-ending--struggle to succeed Deng Xiaoping, have only China's visceral nationalism to fall back on as their justification for holding on to power. As China's economy has grown, so its armed forces have added new muscle. Although the end of the cold war brought a hope of greater peace in Asia than most countries, including China, have known for a couple of centuries, China has deliberately taken it as an opportunity to press its territorial claims by force.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The opportunity has no doubt looked all the more promising because America, preoccupied with domestic politics, has begun to scale down its military role in Asia. China's row with the Philippines last year over reefs in the South China Sea produced only a belated and barely audible squeak of protest from Washington. So when Taiwan started to push harder and more successfully for a higher profile around the world, China saw no reason not to shove forcefully back.</p><p><b>Drawing dragon claws</b><br>This time, to its credit, America has responded swiftly and prudently. By moving two aircraft carriers close to Taiwan, it has sent an unmistakable signal that it will not allow Taiwan to be toyed with at China's whim. If China steps up the harassment, America could do a lot more, from patrolling the Taiwan Strait to helping Taiwan get hold of more of the equipment, including missile defences, that it needs to protect itself. And if China is bent on war, America could muster enough firepower to disrupt any attempt either to blockade Taiwan or to invade it.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet China may already feel it has achieved a lot. By firing even unarmed missiles close to Taiwan's main ports and forcing ships and aircraft to be rerouted, it has demonstrated the island's vulnerability. Judging by the pusillanimous response from most governments in the region, China may also have concluded that, come the next crisis, America would find even less support for a tough response.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet there is plenty, well short of military action, that others could do to avert such a crisis. China's leaders may be in a mood to set territorial claims above economic needs in part because they calculate that using force against Taiwan would do China no lasting damage. The message therefore needs to be conveyed--and not just by America, but by East Asians and Europeans too--that a lunge for Taiwan or an attempt to strangle its economy would make China an economic as well as political outcast: such loutishness should immediately lose China the trading benefits it now enjoys and bar it from the world's economic and financial clubs.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;East Asia's governments squirm when faced with such plain speaking. Yet helping America to hold China to the rules of peaceable behaviour is the only way to preserve the stability on which the region's continued prosperity depends. In the end, the best solution to the Taiwan problem for all concerned would be a political deal, negotiated between the two governments. But Taiwan points out, reasonably, that it will not negotiate under duress. And China will see the point of talking only if it is convinced that it stands to lose less by talking than by gunfire. By contrast, appeasing China over Taiwan will only feed China's appetite for trouble.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?826927200,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="as1.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&#169; Copyright</a> 1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

<h2>Chinese war games<p></h2>(See <a href="wtw1.gif">chart</a>)<br>In a new threat to <b>Taiwan</b>,China conducted military exercises close to the island using live ammunition. But, as the United States moved two aircraft carriers close to Taiwan, the Chinese were reported to have assured the Americans that they did not plan to invade the island. The Chinese actions have been prompted by fears that Taiwan, regarded by them as a rebel province, may declare independence. Hong Kong's Hang Seng index tumbled.
<p>Popular support for <b>Ryutaro Hashimoto</b>,Japan's new prime minister, has fallen sharply in the two months since he took office as his government remains paralysed. A proposal to use government money to bail out a group of failed mortgage companies has proved deeply unpopular not only with the public but with opposition politicians, some of whom have staged a sit-in at the Diet blocking all progress on the budget, which includes the proposal to rescue the mortgage companies.

<p>Tribesmen in the Indonesian province of <b>Irian Jaya </b>attacked an American-owned copper mine in Timika.
<h2>Europe's future</h2>
The European Union's 15 member countries made <b>opening bids</b> before the inter-governmental conference on Europe's future, due to start in Turin on March 29th. Britain said it wanted no extension of majority voting in the Council of Ministers. Belgium, the Netherlands and Luxembourg want a more federal Union. France called for greater powers for national parliaments to decide European issues. The European Parliament protested at its exclusion from the conference--and demanded more powers.</p>
<p>The British government suffered an embarrassing defeat in the European Court of Justice, which ruled in favour of a plan by the European Union to introduce a maximum <b>48-hour working week</b>. Britain had claimed exemption under the social clause; the court ruled that it came under health and safety.</p>
<p>Carl Bildt, the European Union's representative in <b>Bosnia</b>,said the Dayton peace plan is in danger of unravelling. He suggested that <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s implementation force should stay beyond 1996.</p>
<p>In Britain's worst lone massacre, a gunman in Scotland shot dead <b>16 children </b>aged five and six and their teacher in a primary school, and then shot himself. Another 12 children and two teachers were wounded.</p>
<p></td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>The winner of this month's Spanish general election, <b>Jose Maria Aznar</b>, leader of the conservative People's Party, continues to search for a working majority in parliament. After a meeting with Mr Aznar, the defeated Socialist leader, Felipe Gonzalez, prime minister for more than 13 years, said that he would not seek to keep his opponent from office.</p>

<p>With an eye on monetary union in 1999, the finance ministers of both Germany and France announced further limits on <b>public spending</b>. Sluggish economies have kept tax revenues low and unemployment handouts high.</p>
<p>Felix Habsburg-Lothringen, a son of the last emperor of Austria, provoked a row by secretly visiting the country, from which he is banned because he has not renounced his claim to the throne. "<b>Herr Habsburg</b> is provoking the republic," said a senior member of Austria's ruling Social Democrats.
<h2>Dole steams on</h2>
Senator Bob Dole triumphed in the <b>Super Tuesday </b>primaries, bringing his total of delegates to more than 700. Steve Forbes, the flat-tax candidate, decided to quit the race, but Pat Buchanan, the populists' friend, vowed to keep on fighting. Newt Gingrich, the speaker of the House, urged all Republicans to unite. Mr Dole began to muse aloud about persuading Colin Powell, a retired general, to change his mind and be his running-mate.</p>
<p>Bill Clinton signed into law the Helms-Burton bill tightening <b>trade sanctions on Cuba</b>, and on others investing there. The European Union said it would complain to the World Trade Organisation. Canada and Mexico said they would lodge complaints through <font size=-1>NAFTA</font>. Most of Latin America reacted angrily. Cuba jeered.</p>
<p>Jack Kevorkian, the champion of <b>assisted suicide</b> and inventor of a suicide machine, was acquitted at his second trial of illegally helping patients to kill themselves. A few days earlier, a federal appeals court in San Francisco (whose decisions are binding on nine western states) ruled that there was a constitutional right to die.
<h2>Support for peace</h2>
In a bid to keep the Middle East peace process alive, Bill Clinton and Hosni Mubarak jointly chaired a<b> four-hour summit</b> on peace and terrorism at a Red Sea resort. Nearly 30 countries turned up, including European heads of government and representatives from the Arab Gulf states. Syria and Lebanon were notable absentees. In Israel after the summit, Mr Clinton committed $100m to an American-Israeli fight against terrorism.</p>
<p>Israel continued its tight blockade of the<b> West Bank and Gaza</b>, and said it would deport men directly connected to suicide-bombers.</p>
<p>Kuwait held a conference in London to remind people of the 600 <b>Kuwaiti prisoners </b>taken to Iraq after the 1990 invasion and still unaccounted for. Iraq fuelled new suspicions by temporarily barring <font size=-1>UN</font> inspectors from a building they wanted to see.</p>

<h2>Shares shake</h2>(See <a href="wtw2.gif">chart</a>)<br>Good news on American jobs confirmed <b>Wall Street's worst nightmare</b>--that the American economy was making a comeback. The biggest jump in 13 years in employment in February caused the Dow Jones to plunge by 3%, dragged down by the sharpest drop in Treasury-bond prices since the Gulf war as investors realised that interest rates, far from being cut, could now rise. A 2% jump in the Dow in the next session was the biggest one-day rise in five years, but shares remained jittery, and bond prices proved even more nervous. Asian shares, clipped by Wall Street, continued to react to Chinese war games off the coast of Taiwan.</p>
<p><b>Japan's current account </b>ran into deficit in January, the first in five years and not affected much by a change in the method of calculation. The &#165;1.9 billion ($18m) gap compares with a surplus of &#165;328.2 billion a year earlier. February is expected to be back in the black but the trend now is towards a more modest surplus.</p>
<p><b>Russia's Central Bank </b>said several of the country's big banks were in trouble. They include Natsionalny Kredit, which claimed last year to rank as Russia's 17th-biggest bank by assets; and Avtovazbank, where the central bank has taken temporary control. Sergei Dubinin, the central bank's chairman, said the banking system was caught up in a " long-lasting structural crisis".
<h2>Smoking gun</h2>
Brooke Group's Liggett broke ranks with the rest of America's dismayed <b>tobacco industry </b>and settled its part of a smoking-related lawsuit brought by five states, without either admitting or denying liability. The share prices of other tobacco firms fell.</p>
<p>The day after <b>Netscape </b>struck a deal with <b>America Online </b>to license Netscape Internet software, allowing <font size=-1>AOL</font>'s subscribers to surf the World Wide Web, <font size=-1>AOL</font> also agreed to distribute <b>Microsoft</b>'s Internet browser to 5m subscribers.</p>
<p>Shares in <b>Cable &amp; Wireless</b> rose nearly 7% after it confirmed that it had held merger talks with <b>British Telecom</b>. The talks are thought to have foundered on <font size=-1>BT</font>'s failure to agree a price for the rival telephone company which, before the news, had a stockmarket capitalisation of &#163;10 billion ($15.3 billion).</p>
<p>America's <b>Williamette</b> agreed to pay $1.6 billion for the remaining timber interests of <b>Hanson</b>, a British industrial conglomerate in the process of demerging. The deal includes 440,000 hectares (1.1m acres), mainly in the Pacific north-west region.</p>
<p></td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>South Africa's biggest firm, <b>Anglo American</b>, bought 5.9% of <b>Lonrho</b>, a British conglomerate.</p>

<p><b>Germany's chemicals giants</b> reported record profits in 1995 and big boosts in their dividends. The biggest, Hoechst, produced a net profit up 65% to DM2.25 billion ($1.57 billion)</p>
<p>Bahrain-based Investcorp is poised to sell its 51.8% stake in <b>Gucci</b>, whose latest net profits, for the year to end-January ($81.4m compared with $17.3m a year earlier), suggest that the Italian maker of swanky clothes has returned to form. Since last October's public offering by Investcorp of 48.2% of its stake, the price of Gucci shares has nearly doubled.
<h2>All change</h2>
In a big shake-up at America's largest mutual-funds company, <b>Fidelity Investments</b> shuffled 26 equity-portfolio managers--nearly a third of them--to boost poorly performing portfolios.</p>
<p><b>Unilever</b> announced a far-reaching change in its management structure, designed, it said, to separate strategic leadership from routine business operations. But the Anglo-Dutch consumer group said it had decided against a break-up.</p>
<p>Soci&eacutet&eacute G&eacuten&eacuterale, a French bank, asked the European Court of Justice to block the FFr45 billion ($8.9 billion) <font size=-1>EU</font>-approved rescue plan for <b>Cr&eacutedit Lyonnais</b>, a state-owned rival that landed in trouble after reckless expansion at the end of the 1980s. Soci&eacutet&eacute G&eacuten&eacuterale said that it is willing to drop its case if the aid is limited.</p>
<p>One Cr&eacutedit Lyonnais property is <b>MGM</b>. The reinvigorated Hollywod studio was officially put up for auction with the hope of fetching $1.5 billion-2.5 billion.
<h2>Going nowhere</h2>
<b>Alitalia</b>'s chairman, Renato Riverso, gave up his attempt to restructure the crippled state-owned airline, with a warning that there should be no sell-out to the unions. But his replacement, Fausto Cereti, and the new chief executive, Domenico Cempella, immediately resumed talks with unions as Alitalia confirmed its 1995 losses could come to 250 billion lire ($154m).</p>
<p>General Motors filed an <b>industrial-espionage lawsuit </b>in Detroit against Volkswagen alleging that a former purchasing executive at <font size=-1>GM</font>, Jose Ignacio Lopez, took quantities of secret documents with him when he defected to <font size=-1>VW</font>.</p>
<p>After flagging <b>car sales </b>in the latter half of 1995, new registrations in Western Europe rose nearly 9% in January and February over the same two months last year. Fresh incentives in France brought an 18% increase in car sales in France. Germany also saw a near 11% gain. Britain, with 2%, registered one of the lowest rises.</p>

<h1>Taiwan votes, China thunders</h1>

<p><font size=1>TAIPEI
</font></p><p>THE bomb shelters in Taipei are being cleared of rubbish, and yellow stickers have appeared with directions towards improvised sanctuaries. There is no panic yet in Taiwan, but many Taiwanese are taking the precaution of converting their money into dollars and most flights out of the country are fully booked. The government is propping up the local stockmarket to the tune of $200m a day.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The source of the scare lies offshore in the Taiwan Strait, where China's military exercises reflect the rage of the Communist leadership in Beijing. China regards Taiwan as a rebellious province and fears it is moving towards a declaration of independence. Yet for all the alarm in Taiwan, the island is determinedly pressing ahead with its presidential election on March 23rd and seems likely to elect Lee Teng-hui, the main object of China's fury.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is not only Taiwan that is on edge. Just two months ago America's navy called in to Shanghai, for its first visit to China in seven years. Now it is deploying the largest naval task-force it has assembled in the Pacific since the Vietnam war, including two aircraft carriers, in an effort to deter Chinese threats.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The outside world, and indeed the Taiwanese, have consistently underestimated the lengths to which China is prepared to go in "striving for an early reunification of the motherland". Few thought that China's military exercises would extend to a partial blockade of Taiwan. When they did, calming voices murmured that the fuss would all die down after the Taiwanese election. Now, however, China is promising yet more, unspecified, war games after the election. After all, Mr Lee is odds-on to win.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nobody in authority, on either side of the strait, is willing to suggest that China is close to war with Taiwan, let alone with America. Even China's generals have admitted that their army lacks the means to wage a modern war against Taiwan. China has six times as many men under arms as Taiwan's 400,000, and ten times as many fighter aircraft and submarines. Yet Taiwan has a technological edge.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A quarter of Taiwan's government budget is spent on its armed forces, with their electronic-surveillance devices, anti-aircraft and anti-ship defences, and modern (compared with China's Vietnam-era air force) fighters. It is reckoned that, were it to launch an invasion, China could land only 30,000 troops at a time, and without the benefit of air superiority. An attempted invasion would be horribly bloody.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although Taiwan could probably stave off all but the most determined attack, the costs to the island would be severe. That is why Taiwan has long accompanied its high-tech deterrence with repeated assurances to the mainland that it is not set on a course of independence. Yet no one can be sure that China's actions will not get out of hand. China might choose, not an invasion, but a symbolic land-grab of one of Taiwan's many outlying islands. It might choose to turn a partial blockade into a full one: Taiwan, which relies upon open sea-lanes for its imports of oil, coal and steel, and for its exports of finished goods, would be hobbled overnight. Even a misguided missile, if it fell on Taiwan, could be expected to provoke a military response, with dangerous consequences for the region's peace.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;China insists it has no ulterior motive other than to "struggle against the plot of splittism by some leaders" of Taiwan. Yet China's rhetoric risks boxing in its own leaders as much as it is meant to box in Taiwan's. President Jiang Zemin and his colleagues in Beijing used to assure Taiwan that only if certain unwelcome conditions were met would force be used against it. The two conditions most often cited were foreign intervention in Taiwan, and a declaration of Taiwanese independence. But China has recently begun to emphasise other much more subjective criteria, such as "civil chaos" in Taiwan. Chi Haotian, China's defence minister, even spoke recently of the need for the "liberation" of Taiwan--language not heard from a Chinese official for over a decade.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;China wants to secure its political goals by military threats. But such tactics may backfire. They have already provoked the foreign intervention that China is always warning against. And Chinese efforts to ward off Taiwanese independence may prove even more counter-productive.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;China has branded President Lee the "harlot of history" for his supposedly splittist tendencies. Its leaders appear intent on isolating Mr Lee--much as they earlier isolated Hong Kong's governor, Chris Patten--with the pretence that only he thinks treacherous thoughts. Mr Lee may indeed meet China's splittist criteria, in that he wants more international recognition of Taiwan, including a seat at the <font size=-1>UN</font>. But he does so in response to the desires of the broad mass of Taiwan's electorate. And the more that China bullies Mr Lee, the more the voters are heading for the Lee camp. The greatest risk to regional peace is an Olympian clash between the 500-odd Communist diehards who run China and 21m turbulent free-thinkers in Taiwan.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As it is, the Chinese threat has displaced all other issues in Taiwan's presidential race. Indeed, of the three presidential candidates, only Mr Lee of the ruling Kuomintang speaks of anything other than relations with China and how to extricate Taiwan from the current crisis.
</p><p><b>No rush to go it alone</b></b>
<br>On the China issue, there are three attitudes. Mr Lee argues against making concessions to the mainland, just for the sake of rapprochement. His long-standing foreign minister, Fredrick Chien, put it most forcefully this week. China, he said,<ul><font size=-1>could not care less about world public opinion; that is a sign of a hegemonical power. It tries to dictate foreign policy to us; that's another sign of hegemonical power... The world today must not accommodate such a creature. No government can afford to conduct negotiations under duress.
</font></ul>Even so, Mr Chien argues for Taiwanese self-restraint.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Peng Ming-min, the candidate of the Democratic Progressive Party, the biggest opposition group, is more inclined to give the finger to China and damn the torpedoes, which the party does not believe would be fired even if the island did declare independence. On March 12th Mr Peng's party boss, Shih Ming-teh, led two boatloads out to the rough waters on the edge of China's north-eastern target zone. Two acts of defiance followed. Mr Shih burnt Communist China's flag. And the stomach contents of the assembled members of the world's press rebuked gravity.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lin Yang-kang, a former Kuomintang official, is the most pro-China of the three presidential candidates. Mr Lin and his running-mate, Hau Pei-tsun, once a military man, were booted out of the party last year. They now enjoy the support of the New Party, a splinter-group dedicated to reunification. But not even the New Party expects this to happen soon; its deadline is 50 years. Two parliamentary candidates who campaigned for election last December promoting the only formula that China will consider for reunification--" one country, two systems"--fared poorly, each winning barely 1,000 votes. So Mr Lin is careful to talk of a Chinese commonwealth in which neither side has the upper hand.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Those espousing wholesale independence are also finding it hard to gather votes. The Democratic Progressive Party's leaders have toned down their pro-independence line in recent months. They point out that Taiwan is already <i>de facto</i> independent, if only the rest of the world would recognise it as such. That is, in effect, what Mr Lee's Kuomintang also believes. The only real difference is whether the country should be called the Republic of Taiwan (the opposition party's wish) or the Republic of China.
</p><p><b>Any way out?</b>
<br>Joseph Wu, of the Institute of International Relations in Taipei, reckons that no more than a quarter of Taiwan's electorate is ardently for independence, and at most a quarter is for reunification. The great mass prefer the status quo: <i>de facto</i> independence coupled with a push for greater international recognition. That mass will vote for Mr Lee on March 23rd.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If Mr Lee is indeed victorious, he will face a heavy responsibility. And quite how this private and stubborn man will behave, even his closest supporters dare not guess. Some believe that he will press ahead with his campaign to raise Taiwan's profile, regardless of the reaction on the mainland. But most people think he will have to try to reduce tensions.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How might he achieve that? China's foreign minister, Qian Qichen, says that relations cannot improve unless Taiwan drops its bid for a <font size=-1>UN</font> seat and, by extension, its multi-billion-dollar policy of "pragmatic diplomacy". But it might well be political suicide for Mr Lee to bow to Mr Qian's will. Taiwanese know that China has, in the recent past, given the nod to formulas designed to give Taiwan the space it craves, for example, through its presence at meetings of the Asia-Pacific Economic Co-operation forum. Taiwan simply wants more of the same.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And the Taiwanese have some cards to play. China, even as it waves its fist, still has its other hand out for Taiwanese investment. This strikes many Taiwanese as the height of cheek. Policymakers point out that there are plenty of other places in South-East Asia, and even in Eastern Europe, where Taiwanese could invest.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The growing gap between the two societies, and between governments on either side of the Strait, will make it extremely difficult to restore calm. But it is clear that if the crisis is to be defused the two sides will have to start talking again. Cross-strait talks were rudely broken off by China last year, after Mr Lee made a "private visit" to America, to visit his old university.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet there is a belief, even in Taiwan, that the talks, which had begun a few years earlier, were not being taken seriously enough by the Taiwanese side. They were meant to get down to details on such matters as fishing rights. China hoped they would then encompass bigger issues like sovereignty, but they got nowhere close. Even China's long-demanded "three links"--by air, by sea and by post--were not broached. It is possible that, if Taiwan were to make concessions on the "three links", tensions might ease.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Taiwanese may suspect that nothing short of reunification on China's terms will ever satisfy Beijing. But talking is probably still Taiwan's best option.

<h1>Is Taiwan really part of China?</h1>

<p>ONE sure way to baffle and shock any Chinese citizen is to quote what Mao Zedong had to say about Taiwan in 1936. "The immediate task of China", he said, was "to regain all its lost territories." But he added that that did not include Japanese-occupied Korea, which instead was promised "enthusiastic help in its struggle for independence." He went on: "the same thing applies to Taiwan."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;To many Chinese today, it is unbelievable that such an arch-nationalist should have spoken so cavalierly of independence for what is now an "inalienable part of China's sovereign territory". They have been brought up to regard the "division" of China as an historical accident: the arbitrary ceasefire line in an unfinished civil war, like the demilitarised zone across the Korean peninsula. This illusion is fostered by Taiwan's anomalous control of small islands just off the mainland coast, which prompted two crises in the 1950s, and may yet spark another.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But when Mao spoke, his attitude was consistent with the way China had always dealt with Taiwan: as an afterthought. When, in 1623, China faced a Dutch demand for a trading post to match Portugal's at Macau, the Chinese official who ceded one by pointing at Taiwan thought he had pulled off a crafty ruse. He was fobbing the barbarians off with a disease-ridden haunt of pirates, home to some Chinese settlers, but outside any formal Chinese jurisdiction.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Dutch lost control of Taiwan in 1662, when Koxinga, a half-Japanese general, fled there from China with the military remnants of the Ming dynasty, as it crumbled in the face of the Manchu armies. The government of mainland China gained control of the island only in 1683, when it defeated Koxinga's son.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even after this victory, Taiwan was run more like a colony than a fully integrated part of China. The imperial powers had two main interests on the island: keeping down insurrection and importing its rice and sugar. For military and economic reasons, the authorities in Beijing began paying more attention to Taiwan in the second half of the 19th century, but it was only in 1887 that its status was upgraded to that of a full province. Eight years later, however, it became Japan's first colony. By the time Mao was speaking, Taiwan had been a Japanese colony longer than Korea had.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Chinese sovereignty over Taiwan dates from the 1943 Cairo Declaration, in which the allies decided what to do with Japan's empire after the war. Many Taiwanese, wistful for independence, regarded the nationalists as another occupying army, which was largely consistent with the army's behaviour after the Japanese surrender in 1945. To this day, one of the most significant divisons in Taiwan is between mainlanders who arrived with Chiang and "Taiwanese", most of whose forebears arrived centuries before.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At Cairo, the Americans had assumed that post-war China would be under Chiang Kai-shek's nationalists. When Chiang lost the civil war and was driven into Taiwan in 1949, he, like the Communists, was committed to the ideal of "Chinese reunification". As a result, the nationalists engaged in a war of diplomatic attrition with the Communists for recognition as the government of "China". They gradually lost the support of all their important allies and, in 1971, their seat at the United Nations. As countries switched diplomatic recognition to the mainland, the protocols they signed recognised Taiwan as "part of China".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Chinese conviction that "Taiwan is part of China" may be relatively recent, but is nonetheless visceral. It seems to be based on geographic proximity, which is hardly an argument, ethnic kinship, which is not much stronger (is New Zealand, for example, an "inalienable" part of Britain?), and "international law", which seems to mean other countries' acquiescence in the formulation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Throughout Taiwan's history, its fate has been decided elsewhere. It was handed to the Dutch in talks in Fujian, to Japan after a war in Manchuria, and to China in Cairo. The effrontery of Taiwan's people in recent years has been to suggest they might have a say themselves.

<h1>Knocking knees</h1>

<p><font size=1>BANGKOK</font></p>
<p>IF AMERICA was hoping that its firmness over Taiwan would embolden China's Asian neighbours, it will have been disappointed. The response of most of South-East Asia would make an ostrich seem bold. Only Singapore's elder statesman, Lee Kuan Yew, has discussed the crisis with any frankness, acknowledging its seriousness and suggesting that it might be defused if the Taiwanese drop their bid to join the <font size=-1>UN</font>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No country has criticised China and most of South-East Asia has striven to sound neutral. Thailand's foreign minister, Kasem Kasemsri, went further. "When a country conducts military exercises on its own territory to deter its province from breaking away," he asked, "would you oppose it?" Since its prime minister is making a visit to China later this month, Thailand is particularly keen to preserve good relations. It even took the unusual step on March 13th of trying to block a press conference in Bangkok to launch a report by Amnesty International on human-rights abuses in China.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Indonesia, which like China may fear for its territorial integrity, there has even been some criticism of American actions<i>. Kompas</i>, one of Indonesia's largest newspapers, speculated that the United States might be more inclined to confront China because of disputes over human rights and intellectual property. If so, the paper concluded, "then the <font size=-1>US</font> action is deplorable." 
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But even countries like Vietnam and the Philippines, which have territorial disputes with China in the South China Sea and have attracted pots of investment from Taiwan, refrained from outright condemnation of the exercises. They must hope that, if China ever rounds on them, the rest of Asia will react a little more boldly.

<p><b>Building societies</b></p>
<h1>Dial M for mortgage</h1>

<p>THE effects of the price war between the building societies, the banks and a new breed of telephone mortgage-sellers are beginning to be felt. Banks' share prices fell sharply on March 12th after the telephone-sales offshoot of Bradford &amp; Bingley cut its mortgage rate to just 5.99%, compared with most lenders' standard rate of 7.25%. But this is only the beginning. Among building societies in particular, costs will have to be reduced, branches closed and jobs cut before the war is over.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Earlier this month, the Bank of England said it was worried that this competition was driving banks to accept dangerously thin profits. And a report last month by Bob Pannell, an economist at the Council of Mortgage Lenders, shows that home owners are increasingly fickle. In the two years to September 1995, remortgages (loans that are changed without the borrower moving home) rose from 11% to 28% of all mortgage lending. According to Mr Pannell, home owners increasingly think of mortgages as consumer goods bought on price, not brand loyalty.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With several of the largest building societies about to be floated on the stockmarket or taken over, resulting in handouts worth hundreds of pounds for their customers, many home owners may be staying " loyal" to their present lender only until they collect this bounty. After that, they will transfer to a cheaper lender.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So it is likely to become harder still for the high-street branches of banks and building societies to fend off the new telephone-based mortgage sellers, such as Direct Line, a subsidiary of Royal Bank of Scotland. Direct Line has already cut a swathe through the insurance industry with its cut-price policies. Selling mortgages over the telephone is cheap. An analysis last year by Merrill Lynch, an investment bank, found that Direct Line's staff could each sell 30-40 times as many mortgages as their equivalents in building-society branches.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So far, the telephone-based sellers have a tiny share of the market: Direct Line has lent only about &#163;350m, or less than 0.1% of Britain's total household mortgages. But this share will grow quickly: some building societies, including Bradford &amp; Bingley and Nationwide, have now decided to fight fire with fire and set up their own telephone-sales operations.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unlike the foreign banks which entered the British mortgage market in the 1980s only to get their fingers burnt as bad debts mounted, the new telephone-based sellers are concentrating on poaching the most creditworthy customers. They are also offering savings accounts. That will lessen their dependence on financial markets for funding, and in the process take a slice of the building societies' other main market.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most building societies are highly profitable and have plenty of spare capital. This reduces the pressure on them to close branches in order to remain competitive. But their hands may be forced by the threat of takeover. Management at National &amp; Provincial agreed to takeover talks with Abbey National after realising that, whether they approved of the bid or not, their customers would probably accept the Abbey's terms, worth up to &#163;4,250 each. A new building-societies bill, to be published on March 18th, will not contain the further protection against hostile bidders that societies had campaigned for.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The banks cut around 70,000 jobs between 1989 and 1994, and closed 18% of their branches. Though the building societies closed around 12% of their branches in the same period, their staff numbers continued to rise until 1993 as they entered new areas of business such as estate agency and life assurance. Adrian Coles, director-general of the Building Societies Association, admits that branches and jobs will continue to be cut, though he is unsure by how much. A glance at any of Britain's town centres shows the answer only too clearly: high streets containing a dozen or more branches of banks and building societies are not uncommon. That will change.

<p><b>Small businesses</b></p>
<h1>Don't help us</h1>

<p>IT WAS a bit of an anticlimax. A leaked letter between ministers had suggested that the government was about to abolish the employment rights of the millions of people who work for small firms. When John Major spoke to a gathering of business leaders on March 11th, he announced only a timid set of measures to aid small firms, including a promise that the government will pay its bills more promptly. The prime minister is still said to be wondering whether curbing workers' rights would result in more jobs in small firms (and more votes for the Tory party). If he decides to do more, he faces some difficulties.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The European Court reminded him of one of these on March 12th: the government's power to liberalise Britain's labour laws is checked by its treaty obligations in the European Union. The court overruled Britain's attempt to avoid an <font size=-1>EU</font>-wide rule setting a maximum working week of 48 hours. A more surprising problem is that, whatever the economic merits of labour-law reform, many of its intended beneficiaries seem far from excited at the prospect.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At his meeting with business leaders, Mr Major was given a report on what 800 small firms wanted from the government. They did grumble about employment rights, industrial tribunals and so on. But they did not call for them to be abolished. The government may be mistaking the weight that small firms attach to the issue. Of the 100 or so recommendations in the report, only 16 were calls for deregulation--and there were nine calls for more regulation, such as stricter laws on the disqualification of company directors.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Similarly, Labour's proposed minimum wage is not as unpopular among employers as ministers hoped. Their attempts to stir a fuss over the issue at the Confederation of British Industry's conference last November fell flat. Some security and cleaning firms, for example, want a minimum wage, to stop them being undercut by rivals who pay their workers less. In a study of 174 small firms, carried out last year by Kingston University, 56% said a minimum wage of &#163;4 an hour (probably more than Labour would impose) would not harm them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;David Storey of Warwick University questions claims that cutting workers' rights and other "red tape" would create many new jobs. Mr Storey divides small firms into three categories. First are the "short life" firms--weak businesses, virtually doomed to fail whatever happens. Second are the "trundlers", firms whose owners are happy as things are and have no desire to expand. Finally, there are the "flyers" , the 4% or so of small firms that are both able and willing to grow quickly. This small proportion, says Mr Storey, creates about half of all new jobs. His research finds that these firms rarely complain that labour laws are holding them back.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As for getting the owners of small firms to vote Conservative, the Kingston study brings more gloomy news for Mr Major. Only 14% of owners of small firms thought a Labour government would be bad for their business; 29% said it would help.

<h1>A mess on the Mersey</h1>

<p><font size=1>LIVERPOOL</font></p>
<p>IN THE old days of the hard left, Liverpool appeared to suffer from too many Labour councillors. Now its problem seems to be too few. Labour's slim grip on power in the city is one of the reasons why, on March 10th, the council voted to increase its council-tax bills by 4.5%, making the &#163;1,006 bill for properties worth &#163;68,000-88,000 the highest in the country for the third year running.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Liverpool's councillors say that their tax rate for this property price-range is bound to be higher than other cities because they have fewer high-value, higher tax-paying properties. Some 68% of the city's houses are valued at less than &#163;40,000. But that cannot be the whole story: 64% of neighbouring Knowsley's properties are valued at under &#163;40,000, and although its economy is in as bad a shape as Liverpool's, and its council was in as much of a mess until recently, it set a proud &#163;774 tax rate for the band that gets hit for a grand in Liverpool.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The main difference between Knowsley and Liverpool is that in 1988, Knowsley council's ruling Labour group, after purging the hard left from its ranks, decided that the council needed a new broom. The council appointed a chief executive, David Henshaw, who not only improved services but also persuaded councillors to cut the workforce by a third even though Knowsley's 15% unemployment rate is more than twice the national average.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The ruling Labour group in Liverpool has cut around 20% of the council's workers since 1988, but, because of its own weakness, has found it hard to push the efficiency drive as far as Knowsley's. Whereas Labour holds 63 out of 66 seats in Knowsley, in Liverpool it has only 50 out of 99 seats, to the Lib Dems' 42. With Liverpool's jobless rate at 17%, councillors are understandably reluctant to increase it in case their own jobs are axed by vengeful voters. Even after the high tax rate was announced, crowds were outside city hall protesting at service cuts threatened in some areas.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Divisions in the Labour group make it even harder for the council to take tough decisions. Its leader, Harry Rimmer, survived a recent deselection attempt only after regional party officials intervened.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Councillors would find it easier to streamline local government if the private sector were to create lots of jobs. But the problem is circular. At Knowsley, where Mr Henshaw has reformed the planning department, the council took just three weeks in December last year to give a television-shopping company, <font size=-1>QVC</font>, permission to build a warehouse and telephone-service centre expected to employ 1,100 people. Liverpool's failure to pull in such prizes perpetuates its problems.

<h1><center>Israel's abyss</center></h1>

IS THE Middle East peace process slipping into history? It could be. The bomb that tore bodies apart in the heart of Tel Aviv on March 4th, after similar atrocities in Jerusalem, may have tipped the balance. Any scramble back to sanity will be extraordinarily difficult, even if the outrages stop. Israelis, traumatised by the slaughter of some 60 people, believe they have been cheated in their land-for-peace deal with the Palestinians. But the alternative is bleak: three years of courageous risk-taking undone, a cruel war of attrition, an end to Israel's hopes of normal relations with the Muslim world. The evil men behind the suicide-bombers can congratulate themselves. Seldom, it seems, has terrorism been more effective at achieving its ends.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Palestinian-Israeli negotiation had reached a turning-point, the first interim stage all but completed, the search for a permanent solution about to begin. Most Israelis and most West Bankers and Gazans liked what was happening. Despite the acknowledged obstacles ahead--the status of Jerusalem, for instance--both sides believed that they would probably get there in the end. But now the process, always fragile, is cracking as Israeli public opinion, always volatile, starts to swing vehemently against it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first bus-bombing in Jerusalem on February 25th eliminated Shimon Peres's comfortable lead in the approach to Israel's election on May 29th. The Tel Aviv bomb cast doubt on his ability even to remain prime minister for the next three months (see <a href="ir1.html">page</a>). Another bomb would almost certainly do for him. And Labour's loss of power, whether it comes now or after the election, could spell the end of a peace process that has been identified with Mr Peres and his men since secret talks began in Oslo three years ago. Though Binyamin Netanyahu, the leader of the Likud opposition, now says that he would not reverse what has so far happened, his intention to leave things stuck as they are, allowing Palestinians municipal autonomy within self-contained cantons, makes barely better, or safer, sense.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Striving to protect his people and to save himself politically, Mr Peres is faced with the problem of not knowing where to strike or at whom--an impotence that adds to the national anger. Emergency measures to make Israel's cities more secure are the first, obvious necessity. This means not only more soldiers in the streets but the end, at least for the time being, of Mr Peres's hopes of Israelis and Palestinians living peaceably together: separation is now the ugly rule. Beyond this, Israeli soldiers are swarming into West Bank villages, punishing the families and neighbours of suicide-bombers and suspected terrorists. This has the vengeful smell of collective punishment, but its main purpose is to deter other would-be " martyrs" by showing that while they skip off to paradise their mothers will be homeless.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Though Mr Peres, in a vote-tugging flourish, has given the army freedom to go where it will, it has so far restrained itself from plunging back into the Palestinian cities it withdrew from so recently. It should stick to this self-restraint if it can. Even if the soldiers were to track down their quarry, which they admit is difficult, their return would dilute Palestinian opposition to terrorism--and signal that the clock had been truly turned back from peace to no-peace.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But if Israeli troops hold back, Yasser Arafat's men must do the job for them. Mr Arafat, who no less than Mr Peres stands or falls by the peace process, has outlawed all militia groups, made wide arrests and promised to co-operate fully with Israel "to wipe out terrorism". Yet he is not doing enough to satisfy the Israelis. Is this because he will not, or because he cannot? The statements made in the name of Hamas's military arm, Izzadin al-Qassam, offering conditional ceasefires just before a new bombing, were despicable, not worth a straw. But they do suggest that the movement is split, making its more lethal branches, perhaps protected by outsiders, even harder to get at.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Where Mr Arafat does break ranks with the Israelis is in hesitating to take on Hamas's religious and political structure--though, in answer to Israeli pressure, his police have begun raiding schools and mosques. He would be wise to be careful, even though money for Hamas charities does indeed make its way to the militia, and to the sheikhs who preach martyrdom. It remains vital, in the interests of peace, for Mr Arafat to keep his lines open to Hamas's political leaders.
</p><p><b>No prospect pleases</b>
<br>The Arab-Israeli prospect, which had been smiling, is suddenly grim. But more and more Israelis, earlier opinions turned on their head by the terrorist mayhem, are arguing that "peace" with the Palestinians is the grimmest prospect of all, costing them more lives than the Palestinian uprising ever did. Israelis are giving up land but are not being allowed to live in peace. Moreover, whatever land-for-peace deal is finally struck, most of the world's Palestinians will remain dissatisfied, their eyes fixed on the bits of Israel-proper where their families once lived.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All this is true. Yet the alternative is worse. A frozen peace process will not freeze violence: on the contrary, the collapse of Palestinian hope would cut such restraints as there are. Nor would Israel be able to isolate itself from an area that it would, in effect, be reoccupying: the suicide-bombers who this week crossed into Israel and found their way into the centre of its cities showed the permeability of even sealed frontiers. And though the <i>intifada</i>, the three-year mass uprising in which youngsters armed with stones challenged the military occupiers, will not resume, a new version of Palestinian revolt, and Israeli reprisal, could be much nastier: grown-up men with grown-up arms, killing indiscriminately.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After a horrible two weeks, such a scene is no longer wholly remote. It can be avoided, but only if Israelis and Palestinians reflect clear-eyed on the choices before them. For this they need a period of calm. Let us hope they get one.

<h2>Peace on the rack</h2><p>Islamist suicide-bombers struck again, killing 19 people in Jerusalem and 13 in Tel Aviv, and imperilling the entire <b>Middle East peace process</b>. Fighting for political survival, Shimon Peres responded to widespread anger by sending Israel's army into the West Bank to punish the bombers' relatives, close Islamic institutions and catch as many militants as it could. Yasser Arafat's security forces made widespread arrests in the areas they control.
<p><b>Iranians </b>were due to go to the polls on March 8th to elect a new Majlis (parliament). No genuine challenge to the Islamic republic was allowed but reformists and conservatives, operating within the system, fought each other in an intense week-long campaign.</p>
<p>Muhammad Massari, a leading <b>Saudi dissident </b>living in London, half-won his appeal against the British government's trade-related attempt to deport him to Dominica. The government was ordered to think again.</p>
<p><b>Nelson Mandela</b> was pronounced "in excellent health" by doctors after undergoing medical tests at a clinic. Rumours about the health of the 77-year-old South African president had caused the currency to fall sharply.</p>
<p><b>Benin's</b> election went to a second round after President Nic&eacutephore Soglo almost tied with the former Marxist dictator, Mathieu K&eacuter&eacutekou.</p>
<h2>Spain's right wins</h2>
<p>Jose Maria Aznar, leader of the conservative People's Party, won <b>Spain's</b> <b>general election</b> on March 3rd, ending 13 years of Socialist rule under Felipe Gonzalez. The margin was narrower than expected and 20 seats short of a majority. Mr Aznar is trying to strike a deal with moderate Catalan nationalists to form a government.</p>
<p>Turkey's two main centre-right parties, Mesut Yilmaz's Motherland and Tansu Ciller's True Path, at last agreed to form a <b>coalition government</b>, excluding the Islamic-minded Welfare party, which won the most seats in December's general election. Under the agreement Mr Yilmaz and Mrs Ciller take it in turns to be prime minister.</p>
<p>Heavy fighting was reported around <b>Grozny, </b>the Chechen capital, after rebels launched a new offensive and retook parts of the city.</p>
<p>(<a href="wtw1.gif">See chart</a>)<br>The size of <b>Europe's population </b>is likely to stay the same over the next three decades, but the proportion of people over 60 will go up by a half, according to a study by the European Commission. Europe's median age, 36 today, is likely to hit 45 in 2025.</p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p><b>Austria's</b> two main parties, to the left and right of centre, agreed to renew a coalition government under the present chancellor, Franz Vranitzky.</p>
<p>An opinion poll suggested that the French remain <b>split down the middle</b> over the future of Europe. A single European currency by 2000 is favoured by 49%, with 42% against. Asked if the date set for <font size=-1>EMU</font>--1999--should be postponed, 42% said yes, whereas 43% said "everything should be done" for the single currency to be brought in on time.
<h2>Here comes Bob</h2>
</p>
<p>Senator Bob Dole swept the board in the Republican <b>presidential primaries</b> in South Carolina, Georgia, Massachusetts, Colorado and several smaller states. His total of delegates looked unbeatable, and he was endorsed by the speaker of the House, Newt Gingrich. Lamar Alexander abandoned the race and endorsed Mr Dole but Steve Forbes battled on. So too did Pat Buchanan, determined to keep his populist voice in the campaign, although he called Mr Dole's nomination "inevitable" .</p>
<p>Colombia was listed by the American government as a country not co-operating enough in the fight against <b>drugs</b>. It will forfeit American aid, as will Afghanistan, Myanmar, Iran, Nigeria and Syria. Peru and Bolivia, named last year, were removed from the list.</p>
<p>The American Congress approved a bill tightening sanctions against <b>Cuba</b> by hitting foreign companies doing business there. Canada, the EU and Caribbean countries have protested against the measure.</p>
<h2>Oz turns right</h2>
<p>Australia's Labor Party was crushingly beaten by John Howard's Liberal-National coalition, giving the country its first <b>conservative government </b>for 13 years.</p>
<p>Holders of <b>Hong Kong passports </b>will be able to visit Britain without visas after the British colony is taken over by China next year, said Britain's prime minister, John Major, during a visit to Hong Kong this week.</p>
<p>Singapore has ordered organisations which provide links to the <b>internet</b> to block access to sexually orientated and politically sensitive material.</p>
<p>In a renewed campaign against <b>Taiwan</b>,China proposed to fire missiles in international waters close to the island's main ports. Taiwan appealed for help.</p>

<h2>Green shoots</h2><p>(<a href="wtw2.gif">See chart</a>)<br><b>American factory orders</b> rose 0.5% in January, faster than analysts had expected, after climbing 1.7% in December, an apparent sign that the economy may be returning to quicker growth.
<p><b>Growth in Japan</b> is likely to pick up this year, but only slowly, according to the Tankan survey of business sentiment conducted by the Bank of Japan.</p>
<p>German<b> unemployment </b>rose by 107,000 in February to a new post-war seasonally-adjusted high of 3.97m. The unemployment rate, based on unadjusted figures, climbed from 10.8% to 11.1%.
<h2>Clinched</h2>
Two of Switzerland's leading pharmaceutical firms, Ciba-Geigy and Sandoz, are to merge to create a new company called <b>Novartis</b>. The new giant, the world's second-biggest drugs enterprise, will have a market capitalisation of SFr75 billion ($63 billion). In 1995 the combined sales of the partners amounted to SFr36 billion.</p>
<p>The profits of <b>Glaxo Wellcome</b>, the product of another big drugs merger last year, rose 30% before tax in 1995, to &#163;2.5 billion ($3.8 billion). But sales of its best-selling drug, Zantac, are falling, and its patent protection in America may lapse next year.</p>
<p>Kvaerner, a Norwegian ship builder, agreed to pay &#163;904m ($1.38 billion) for <b>Trafalgar House</b>, a loss-making British construction-to-shipping conglomerate, valuing Trafalgar at a 30% premium to its market value before the takeover.</p>
<p>Gordon and Anita Roddick, founders of <b>Body Shop International</b>, a British cosmetics group, abandoned plans to convert back into a private company, 12 years after they went public. The Roddicks, who disliked the City's " short-termist" attitudes, said that bank borrowings for a share buyback would have hit future growth.</p>
<p>America's Compaq said it was cutting prices on business desktop computers by as much as 20%, prompting Hewlett-Packard and Digital, two other computer manufacturers, to <b>cut prices</b> too. Before these discounts, price competition had largely been limited to the retail sector of the computer market.</p>
<p>Australia's richest man, <b>Kerry Packer</b>, passed the control of Publishing &amp; Broadcasting, his media company, to his 28-year-old son, James. Mr Packer will, however, remain chairman of Consolidated Press, a private company that controls about 45% of Publishing &amp; Broadcasting. In December <b>Rupert Murdoch</b>, boss of News Corp, another media group, appointed his 24-year-old son Lachlan deputy chief executive of the company's Australian operations.</p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>In Germany, <b>Escom</b>, one of Europe's largest computer companies, admitted it was asking shareholders and creditors to stump up DM100m ($68m), after losing DM125m in 1995, nearly three times the company's initial estimate. Escom blamed a sharp fall in prices for computer components such as microprocessors and memory chips, which made its stocks less valuable. Escom's share price fell 17% on the news.</p>
<p>Imperial Chemical Industries, the British chemicals, paint and explosives group, signalled the start of a<b> buying spree</b> by purchasing Bunge Paints, South America's biggest paint company, for $390m.</p>
<p><b>BT</b>, Britain's biggest telecoms company, complained to the Spanish competition authorities about the behaviour of <b>Telefonica</b>, Spain's state operator. <font size=-1>BT</font> accused Telefonica of using confidential information to lure its Spanish customers away with offers of lower prices.
<h2>Gold bears</h2><p>(<a href="wtw3.gif">See chart</a>)<br>After climbing to a six-year high of $415 per ounce in February, the price of <b>gold</b> fell to $393, as speculators abandoned the market to buy shares instead.</p>
<p>The Commodity Futures Trading Commission said it would investigate the activities of <b>broker-group associations</b> in the trading pits of America's futures and commodity exchanges. The associations will be scrutinised for anti-competitive behaviour.
<h2>Networking</h2>
America's United Airlines may merge its computer-reservations system with Worldspan Travel Information Services, a rival system owned by Delta Air Lines, Trans World Airlines and Northwest Airlines. This would create the biggest <b>airline-reservations network</b> in America.</p>
<p>International Lease, an American <b>jet-leasing</b> company, is expected to announce $6 billion in orders for new planes from Airbus and Boeing, two big manufacturers, underlining the recent strength of the world commercial plane market.</p>
<p><b>Russia </b>said that it was planning to raise its import tariffs by an average of 20%. But it has shelved plans to block imports of American poultry, following strong American protests.</p>
<p>An appeals court in America threw out a ruling blocking <i>Business Week </i>magazine from publishing details of <b>sealed court documents</b> relating to a suit between Procter &amp; Gamble, a consumer-products giant, and Bankers Trust, an investment bank that had sold the company loss-making derivatives contracts.</p>

<h1>The peace process at breaking-point</h1><p><font size=1>JERUSALEM</font></p><p>ISRAELI-PALESTINIAN peace, and the political lives both of Shimon Peres and of Yasser Arafat, on which at present it seems to depend, hang together by the slenderest of threads after the latest suicide-bombings in Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Peres is trying to rescue things by waging what he calls " total war" against Islamic militants without, he hopes, sweeping away Mr Arafat's infant self-government. The choice, says Mr Peres, is Mr Arafat's: if he commits his forces to the battle against Hamas and Islamic Jihad, Israel will not send its troops back into the Gaza strip and most West Bank towns. So long as that step is avoided, Mr Peres argues, the peace process can be kept alive and Mr Arafat's rule preserved. Perhaps, but as Palestinian opinion swings from revulsion at the bombings to anger at the new security measures, Mr Arafat is wholly insecure.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Peres himself has not much choice. The Jerusalem bus-bomb on March 3rd, killing 19 people, revived all the Israeli anger of the previous week. Within a day, a Tel Aviv shopping mall was the target, and 14 more people were dead. In rural Palestinian areas, where Israel still has "overall security responsibility", male relatives of suspects were arrested by Israeli troops, and family homes were sealed, to be demolished after a summary legal process. Movement within the West Bank was barred except for a short break on March 7th to allow people to shop, and members of the Palestinian Council to go to Gaza for its first session. Six Islamic colleges and charities have been shut, including the Islamic University in Hebron; ten more institutions may be closed in Jerusalem. The cabinet is considering deporting Hamas activists.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Arafat's Palestinian Authority, for its part, has arrested some 350 Islamist suspects, including four of the 13 men on Israel's "most wanted" list. Its security forces conducted house-to-house searches in Ramallah, Bethlehem and Gaza, where they raided the Islamic University, a Hamas bastion. Mr Arafat had some success in persuading Hamas's civilian leaders that they must call off terror or be outlawed as a political organisation. "In the name of God," said one in Jerusalem, "we implore you to stop these atrocious acts if only to preserve the achievements of the Palestinian people." A March 6th communiqu&eacute from Hamas's military arm, Izzadin al-Qassam, said it was willing to hand in its arms. But communiqu&eacutes have been contradictory--nor do the Israelis believe the bombers came from the mainstream militia.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet Mr Arafat, say the Israelis, is not doing enough. The foreign minister, Ehud Barak, passed him a message, through the visiting president of the European Union's Council of Ministers, that he now had his "last chance" to make a convincing move against Islamic terrorism. Israeli officials feel that, despite all that has happened and the readiness of Mr Arafat's police to work together with Israeli troops, the Palestinian leaders still do not understand the depth of the crisis in Israel or the tenuousness of Mr Peres's authority.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The mood in Israel is so grim that one commentator could write in his newspaper that what Mr Peres needs, if he is to win the election on May 29th, is for Mr Arafat to hang half-a-dozen Hamas terrorists in Gaza's main square. The four suicide-bombings in ten days, taking at least 60 lives, have cast a pall of fear on the country, made worse when reports came out that the man who had driven the Tel Aviv bomber from Gaza was an Arab Israeli. Many people are afraid to take buses. Some are even afraid to drive their cars alongside buses. As a result, a wartime emptiness pervades the streets of Jerusalem and Tel Aviv.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Old-timers hark back to the outbreak of the Yom Kippur war in October 1973, when Egypt and Syria launched a devastating surprise attack. Then too a dearth of intelligence information left Israelis feeling unprotected in the face of deadly blows. In an unvarnished report to the Knesset's defence committee on March 4th, the head of the Shin Bet security service admitted that he did not know where some of the bombers were coming from, and therefore could not strike at the men behind them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the Likud opposition, now soaring ahead in the opinion polls, the admission was electoral manna. Likud leaders have insisted throughout the peace process that withdrawal from Gaza and the big West Bank towns would leave Israel ignorant of what the Islamists were plotting.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Labour government counters that there was terrorism when Israel occupied all the territories. The Palestinian Authority, co-operating with the Israelis, has in fact foiled some attacks, and even the Likud is not advocating a return to Gaza or Nablus. But this logic rings hollow when, day after day, cemeteries are filled with traumatised mourners.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Politically, the question now is not whether Mr Peres will win the election, but whether his government can, or should, survive until then. The historical analogy for many Israelis is again a war: the tense waiting period in 1967 when the prime minister of the day, Levi Eshkol, was seen to be hesitant and began losing public confidence. Mr Peres, then secretary-general of an opposition party, Rafi, manoeuvred for the creation of a government of national unity. Eventually, his party chief, Moshe Dayan, was co-opted by a reluctant Eshkol as minister of defence, and went on to take much of the glory for the six-day war. Now Mr Peres finds himself in Eshkol's role.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His own old role is being played by Ariel Sharon, a former defence minister and Likud hardliner, who is campaigning for "a government of national emergency" to be installed for one year with an overarching mandate to fight terrorism. Mr Sharon has not pleased his party leader, Binyamin Netanyahu, who is loth to see the elections deferred and finds no reason to join Mr Peres's beleaguered government.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Sharon's many enemies, in Labour and the Likud, suspect that the old warrior is hoping for a short-cut back to power for himself (he lost the defence ministry in 1983, after two notorious massacres of Palestinians by Lebanese Christians in Israeli-held parts of Beirut). One more suicide-bomb, it is argued, could generate the kind of outcry that would oblige Mr Peres to step down. Mr Sharon, if he were in the government, might, at a pinch, become a panic-stricken public's choice.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Partly to head off any such thing, senior Labour people are urging Mr Peres to appoint Mr Barak as defence minister, instead of continuing to hold that portfolio himself. Some are even saying, privately, that Mr Peres should stand down in Mr Barak's favour. As a former military man, Mr Barak might be better placed to win the election. But Mr Peres, glummer-looking than ever, is still determined to lead the fight himself: both against terrorists and against the Likud.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?826322400,iss">Search</a>

<p><b>National Health Service</b></p>
<h1>Emergency</h1>


<p>ANY number of complaints from doctors about the problems of the National Health Service can easily be ignored. A dead child cannot. On March 6th, an inquiry into the death of a ten-year-old boy with a brain haemorrhage who had been shuttled between hospitals blamed health-service management; the same day Stephen Dorrell, the health secretary, announced new guidelines to ensure better use of intensive-care beds. The health service's problems will be underlined on March 13th, when the Audit Commission produces what is expected to be a highly critical report on accident and emergency facilities at hospitals.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Public horror at the boy's death reflects a widespread belief that the health service's priority should be to look after people in an emergency. A series of similar failures suggests that this is what the health service is least good at these days.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Part of the problem is that the demand for emergency services has risen unexpectedly. Emergency admissions rose by 13% in 1989-94. The pattern of demand, however, seems uneven. Some hospitals report much sharper rises. Kingston Hospital, for instance, says that if present trends continue, by the end of this year its emergency work will have increased by 50% since 1994.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Doctors have many theories to explain the increase in accident and emergency work. Some blame better drugs and equipment for generating demand: these days, for instance, anybody suspected of a heart tremor will be rushed into hospital for sensitive new tests and treatment. Patients are getting increasingly litigious, too, which may encourage <font size=-1>GP</font>s to get people off their hands by sending them to hospital.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;While demand for emergency services is going up, supply is being squeezed because of several developments in the health service. One is the general--and generally benevolent--pressure to use resources more efficiently.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Accident and emergency patients go into either intensive care or emergency beds. There are only 2,600 intensive-care beds in Britain. They are expensive, because they involve round-the-clock specialist care, so there is pressure on cost-conscious hospitals to keep their number down. A survey last year found that such beds were running at high occupancy levels--about 90%. This leaves little slack to cope with unexpected rises in demand.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most emergency patients are put in what are classified as acute beds. Since 1991, 9,000 of these beds have been cut--7% of the total. The fall is partly an effect of trying to keep costs down, but mostly it is the result of medical advances, such as less invasive surgery, which reduce the need for long stays in hospital. Again, though, one side-effect is that there are higher occupancy rates and less slack.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Normally, if acute beds are full and there is a rush of emergency admissions, beds which would otherwise be used for "elective" surgery, such as varicose veins or hip replacements, get used instead. But this means cancelling elective operations. The sticks and carrots of the internal market include financial rewards for hospitals if they hit certain targets for elective work--meeting the Patients' Charter target of making nobody wait for more than 18 months for surgery, or carrying out certain volumes of work. If they do extra emergency work, then, they may lose those bonuses.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And extra emergency work does not pay for itself. Hospitals are paid for such work either through a block contract--a lump sum based on a fixed number of admissions--or through a contract that covers the full cost of admissions for a certain number, but pays less than the full cost of each extra patient above that. Either way, hospitals make a loss on extra emergency work.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A further problem is the burden placed on the health service by the government's failure to make proper provision for old people under the community-care programme. A survey of geriatricians carried out by the British Medical Association last year found that 77% of doctors reported difficulties in finding nursing-home places for their hospital patients. In January, Aintree Hospital in Merseyside was unable to discharge 56 patients because local authorities had run out of money to fund community care. Since it costs around &#163;135 a night for an acute bed in a hospital, and &#163;40 for a local nursing-home bed, this does not make a lot of sense.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No doubt hospitals could manage their resources better. But it would also help if the government ensured that its policies sent them the right signals.

<p><b>Scottish local government</b></p>
<h1>Cuts both ways</h1><p><font size=1>EDINBURGH</font></p><p>THE government is usually on bad terms with councils, and with Scotland as well, so it is not surprising that the issue of Scottish local-government finance is a wee bit tricky. This year is especially tough, though, because the government has reorganised Scottish councils. So troublesome has the issue become that, on March 7th, Michael Forsyth, the Scottish Secretary, announced an inquiry into the cost of local government in Scotland.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In April, 29 new unitary councils will take over from the 62 two-tier regional and district councils. Although the government gave the new councils 2.9% more than the old councils to spend in this year, the reorganisation, which was supposed to cut costs, threw up some unexpected problems.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Glasgow's new council, for example, found it was getting &#163;750m to cover spending programmes costing &#163;800m because the outgoing Strathclyde Regional Council had favoured Glasgow. A scheme to deal with this by diverting money from councils in the rest of the region to Glasgow reduced the gap from &#163;50m to &#163;20m. But still the Glaswegians complained.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For a former Thatcherite hatchet-man, Mr Forsyth is surprisingly flexible; and he is unwilling to erode his party's modest support in Scotland. So on March 4th he dug out an extra &#163;38m from his budget to subsidise bills and raised council-spending ceilings by &#163;58m. Even so, Glasgow's councillors decided the next day, when they could make themselves heard above bawling protestors, to increase the council tax by 19% and cut 2,000 jobs. Other Scottish councils took similar decisions.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour smirked at the government's embarrassment. But the Tories' current problems with Scottish councils will pale into insignificance beside those Labour will face if it wins the next general election.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Scottish parliament that Labour plans to set up will have to find any extra money for local government (which Labour says was &#163;395m short this year) from the share of public spending (which Labour says will be tightly controlled) that it gets from the Treasury. That implies eating into other parts of the Scottish Office budget, or raising income tax in Scotland.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The parliament, meanwhile, will get no help from Labour local authorities. This year's crisis is happening partly because councils ran down their reserves, built up debts and failed to make staff cuts to finance pay rises. They have passed these problems on to their successors, even though the leaders of the old and new councils are often the same people.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On March 8th the Scottish Labour Party's conference in Edinburgh will revel in Mr Forsyth's discomfort. But some hard thinking will be needed if it is not to be a future target for the same demonstrators who have been barracking the Tories.

<h1>Home cheap home</h1>

GIVEN the number of false starts in the housing market in recent years, it is a rash economist who proclaims that the real thing is here at last. However, the Halifax, Britain's largest mortgage lender, said on March 5th that its house-prices index rose by 0.9% in February, the seventh successive monthly increase. Bank of England figures show that mortgages worth &#163;3.6 billion were arranged in January, up 14% on a year earlier. And there is another good reason for optimism: a forecast by the <font size=-1>TSB</font> bank that by the end of this year, even though prices will continue to rise, houses will be at their most affordable since 1978.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>TSB</font>'s affordability index (see <a href="br1.gif">chart</a>) measures how much of a typical buyer's take-home pay is needed to meet the mortgage repayments on an average-priced home. So it takes into account taxes and interest rates as well as incomes and property prices. The <font size=-1>TSB</font> reckons the current cost is &#163;28.60 for each &#163;100 of a single earner's net pay, and forecasts that the figure will fall to &#163;25.70 this year. In fact, homes may be even more affordable than the index shows because it is based on lenders' standard mortgage rates and does not allow for the huge discounts and cashback deals that many are offering.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But these are only the first signs of spring. Prices are still about 12% below their peak. Around 1m people are reckoned to have negative equity (mortgages larger than the current value of their homes), which makes it difficult for them to move house even if they want to. Estate agents should not crack open the Bollinger just yet.

<p><b>Local government</b></p>
<h1>Sale time</h1>

<p>ONE of Britain's largest local authorities is preparing to hand over its blue-collar services, from cleaning to housing maintenance, to a private company. This huge privatisation, which is likely to be announced in the next month, would be something to notice even if the council in question were deep-blue Conservative. When you consider that it is in fact Lambeth in south London, once a stronghold of far-left Labour politics, and where Labour is still the biggest party, it is little short of revolutionary.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Many councils have hived off services in a piecemeal way following the government's introduction of compulsory competitive tendering (<font size=-1>CCT</font>) for local-authority services from 1980 on. However, <font size=-1>CCT</font> has drawbacks, including bulky paperwork in preparing contracts with suppliers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Lambeth, plagued by inefficiency and corruption, has hit on its novel approach in an attempt to break with the past. The council, with the support of the Department of the Environment, intends to transfer the provision of services to a company in which the authority will retain perhaps a 20% share. It hopes to model its relationship with the new company on the co-operative relationship between Marks and Spencer, a retailer, and its suppliers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The new initiative symbolises the wind of change blowing through the council, now being turned upside down by a new chief executive, Heather Rabbatts. It follows the local elections of 1994, when Labour was rudely shocked to lose its majority. Liberal Democrats made 20 net gains on the council of 64, taking safe Labour seats where tenants on the council's neglected estates vented their frustration on local councillors.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The council remains hung and without a political leader. Committees are chaired by rotation between the parties. Leadership comes from Ms Rabbatts.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ms Rabbatts was recruited at a time when the council had "one of the worst reputations of any in the <font size=-1>UK</font>"--and that was a quotation from the advertisement for her job. "The organisation had ceased to exist. There is a consensus that Lambeth needs to be sorted," she says. Already she has replaced her top management team; taken 120 staff to court charged with benefit fraud; and forced staff to pass competency tests to keep their jobs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Under previous management, the District Auditor who monitors the council had issued 17 public-interest reports on its shortcomings in 12 years. But in January, the auditor's annual management letter noted "a genuine commitment to securing beneficial change."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On March 6th, Lambeth decided to cut its council tax for next year by &#163;2 a week for a mid-range property. That will mean cuts in spending of &#163;33m on a budget of &#163;315m. Meanwhile adverts in local newspapers threaten court summonses, bailiffs and even prison for council-tax defaulters, marking the end of an era in which paying tax in Lambeth was optional--and its council was a national joke.

<p><b>The channel tunnel link</b></p>
<h1>Expensive ride</h1>


<p>IN JUNE 1990 Margaret (now Lady) Thatcher declared that not a penny of public money would go into a 70-mile high-speed rail line linking London with the channel tunnel. On February 29th John Major's government brushed that promise aside and announced that it would provide &#163;1.4 billion towards its &#163;3 billion cost.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And that is only part of the story. The total amount of public subsidy is still unknown because the government has refused, so far, to make available the cost-benefit analysis on which its decision was based. In any case, spectacular <font size=-1>U</font>-turns do not come cheap. London &amp; Continental Railways, the consortium that won the contract to build the line, has also been given the company which runs Eurostar trains between London and Paris and Brussels, as well as a valuable package of railway stations and land in London.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Labour Party estimates that these sweeteners, together with the direct subsidy, are worth &#163;5.7 billion. But this is almost certainly an exaggeration. The assets handed over to the consortium, such as Waterloo International and St Pancras stations, are worth a fraction of the amounts Labour attributes to them. The best proof of this is that the contract to build the line, which included the transfer of assets, was vigorously contested by four big groups of firms. The winning bid was the one which asked for the lowest level of subsidy.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nevertheless, the total subsidy is clearly a lot more than the government cares to admit. Whatever it is, the government justifies heavy subsidies by arguing that the high-speed link will bring &#163;6 billion worth of benefits to the public. But this also looks like an exaggeration. Most of the benefit is said to take the form of quicker journey times, reduced overcrowding and improved reliability of rail travel to the continent. The rest comes from the expected regeneration of decrepit parts of London and benefits to passenger services in the south-east of England.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, the Department of Transport admits that the passenger benefits are based on forecast figures provided by London &amp; Continental. Forecasts have a nasty habit of going wrong. In Eurostar's first year of operation, it carried only 3.5m passengers, barely a third of what it had forecast. And the high-speed link will shave only 30 minutes off the three-hour journey between London and Paris, which is difficult to translate into billions for consumers on even the most generous reckoning.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;David Starkie, a transport economist and adviser to the House of Commons Transport Committee, says that state aid to build the high-speed link raises serious competition issues. How can ministers justify subsidising international rail travel, he asks, when they object to Spain bailing out Iberia, its international airline? Robert Ayling, British Airways' boss, says that his firm will look closely at the rail deal to see whether the subsidies infringe <font size=-1>EU</font> or domestic laws. With so many unhappy voices, the government may be wondering what it is getting for its billions.

<html><head><title>In the mind of the terrorist</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><p align=center><img src="http://www.economist.com/econlogosmall.gif" alt="The Economist"></p><h1><center>In the mind of the terrorist</center></h1>THE bombs that mangled buses and bodies in Jerusalem this week, and in London in recent weeks, are the latest in a long line of terrorist violence. As well as their own local precedents, they follow a huge bomb in January in Sri Lanka's capital, Colombo, the devastation in Oklahoma City last year and the poison gas attack in Tokyo last March. The bombs in Britain and Israel are particular because they have damaged two peace processes--one barely begun, the other, in the Middle East, further advanced--in which democratic governments have been negotiating with people who straddle the murky divide between politics and violence. These bombs pose tricky questions. Does violence make such negotiation more urgent? Or does it disqualify the terrorist, and anyone associated with him, from the negotiating table?<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The apparent position of democratic governments has been simple: we never bargain with terrorists. Simple in rhetoric, muddled in reality. In 1986 America blamed, then bombed, Libya for helping terrorists abroad, but later tried to ransom American hostages by selling arms to Iran. In France, the appeasement of terrorism became an art form as the government negotiated to free French hostages in Lebanon. Even Israel freed more than 700 Lebanese prisoners in 1985 in a not-publicly acknowledged swap for 39 American hostages. And Britain admitted, before the <font size=-1>IRA</font> announced its ceasefire in 1994, that it had been conducting secret talks with the <font size=-1>IRA</font>, which it had sworn never to do. The basic message, it turned out, was " we never, repeat, hardly ever, bargain with terrorists."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Popular opinion, too, is far from simple, for former terrorist groups have often later become respectable. The latest confusion-sowers are the African National Congress and the Palestine Liberation Organisation. This has encouraged what might be called the relativist view of terror: that one man's terrorist is another man's freedom fighter; that what really distinguishes terrorist groups from liberation movements is the outcome. This is what presumably has been in the minds of Americans who have long raised money for the <font size=-1>IRA</font> and of American officials who have allowed Gerry Adams, the leader of Sinn Fein, the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s political wing, to enter America and to raise further money there even though (unlike the <font size=-1>PLO</font>'s Yasser Arafat) he has not renounced violence.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even if, however, you feel clear that you do not want to talk to men of violence, a further complication arises. This is the emergence of apparent moderates who say they are willing to negotiate, on the promise of holding the bombers in check. That has been Mr Arafat's stated position, and it may be Mr Adams's. The <font size=-1>PLO</font> has been arresting and imprisoning leaders of Hamas, the main Islamic fundamentalist group in Israel's occupied territories, while Hamas itself seems to be divided, with most members suggesting that their main goal is not the extermination of Israel but the assertion of Islamic values in a future Palestinian state (<a href="ir2.html">see</a>). Yet many Israelis believe that continuing with peace negotiations will just encourage more bombs. In Northern Ireland the picture is muddier still: Mr Adams, whose influence over the <font size=-1>IRA</font> is as unknown as his membership of it, goes to meetings accompanied by a convicted terrorist, Gerry Kelly, who is thought still to be on the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s main decision-making body. Should respectable governments talk to such a man?<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No democratic government, with elections to win and problems to solve, can find these questions easy. The moral calculations are hazardous; the practical ones even more so. A route map of sorts can, however, be drawn if you return to that basic, surely correct, democratic instinct: not to talk to terrorists. But then ask: why not?</p><p><b>The end, not the means</b><br>Plainly, the first answer is that to do so encourages further violence. Yielding to terrorism risks feeding it. Beyond that, however, the risk is that doing so transforms the government's objective from the examination of grievances towards the mere ending of violence. It establishes an unsustainable and unacceptable test of success: the cessation of killing. The <font size=-1>IRA</font> bombs London; therefore the British government must have failed. Hamas bombs Jerusalem; therefore the Israeli government must be blamed (though whether for moving too fast or too slowly depends on who is doing the blaming). In such thinking lies defeat, but also a terrible misconception.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;An honest government must admit that terrorism often does expose a legitimate grievance (<a href="sf1.html">see</a>). That is not always so--in cases such as Oklahoma City or the Baader-Meinhof gang in Germany in the 1970s terror may be used for no comprehensible rhyme or reason. Terrorism sponsored by another state, as often during the cold war or by Libya or Iran, is also in a different, now less common, category. But often, alas, a grievance does exist, as it certainly did in Northern Ireland in the 1960s, and in Israel.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The misconception, however, is that once a legitimate grievance has been dealt with, the violence will end. It will not. Indeed, the closer a government is to solving the grievance, the worse the terrorist violence may become. Partly, this is because terrorism develops a momentum of its own; some of its practitioners come to define themselves by it; some are driven by a passion that the rational calculations of democracy cannot defuse. But also, it is because a settlement rarely satisfies everyone. Compromises can make the extremists among the men of terror more desperate, not less.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The task for governments is to seek to shift such terrorists from a pigeonhole marked "legitimate grievance, illegitimate means" to one marked simply "criminal" . That is far from simple, as 25 years in Ulster and 50 in the Middle East have shown. The goal of policy, nevertheless, must be to be able to proceed as if the violence were a separate matter. Arguably, Israel and the <font size=-1>PLO</font> are close to that point, although a fearful number of Palestinians in the occupied territories have yet to accept, as Mr Arafat has, Israel's right to exist. The more the division between the two is how well either side manages to marginalise the criminals, rather than what, exactly, is being conceded, the closer true peace has really become.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The situation in Ulster is harder to gauge. There, the current issue is whether or not to include Sinn Fein in all-party talks. This week the British and Irish governments announced that such talks about a constitutional settlement will begin in June, and that any party clearly committed to non-violent methods can take part (<a href="br1.html">see</a>). Sinn Fein's position will remain ambiguous; no one will know for sure whether Mr Adams and his <font size=-1>IRA</font> associates genuinely intend to give up violence. Given that, the only real option is to talk to him on the assumption that he is indeed an ex-terrorist and not an active one, and that bringing him in to the constitutional fold therefore has a point.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The assumption may be proved wrong. No matter: its implications can still be pursued. The aim of the exercise is to win support for the constitutional settlement that Britain and Ireland have already outlined. Violence is a separate matter. If part of the <font size=-1>IRA</font>, or a loyalist group, splits with mainstream republicans or unionists and resumes violence to try to seek something else, then so be it: the basics of the settlement are not negotiable. Terrorism may well not disappear, even once the ink is dry. But that is in its nature.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?825717600,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="sf1.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&#169; Copyright</a> 1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

<h2>The Cuban thorn</h2>
Cuban MiGs shot down two unarmed civilian aircraft belonging to a <b>Cuban exile group</b>. The Cubans said the two had been in Cuban airspace at the time. The United States denied it, and got the <font size=-1>UN</font> Security Council to " strongly deplore" the attack. The <b>Helms-Burton bill</b>, tightening sanctions against both Cuba and others aiding, abetting and doing business there, was put on a fast-track through Congress. A once-reluctant Bill Clinton said he would sign the bill.
<p><b>Steve Forbes</b>, billionaire publisher and flat-tax enthusiast, won the Arizona Republican primary. He now leads the pack with 60 delegates, despite having been left for dead in New Hampshire. Bob Dole came second; Pat Buchanan was a close third.
<p>Mr Dole, trying to <b>revive his campaign</b>, dismissed his campaign pollster and demoted his chief strategist. His staff had divided over whether or not negative advertising was a good idea.<ro>
<h2>A clean sweep</h2>
A special court in India dealing with the country's political corruption scandal issued <b>arrest warrants</b> for ten politicians, including four who have recently resigned from the cabinet. L.K. Advani, a leader of the main opposition party, has also been named in an arrest warrant.</p>
<p>America's Export-Import Bank agreed to hold up <b>loans to China </b>while the State Department investigated reports that the Chinese had supplied Pakistan with nuclear technology.</p>
<p>Thousands of Tibetan farmers faced starvation as the <b>worst winter </b>in memory wiped out their herds of yaks and sheep.<ro>
<h2>Pinning it down</h2>
The British and Irish prime ministers, John Major and John Bruton, announced a formula to reach all-party talks on the future of <b>Northern Ireland</b>, which they promised would begin on June 10th. Hopes rose that the <font size=-1>IRA</font> might now restore its ceasefire. A fixed date for such talks has been a key demand of Sinn Fein, the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s political wing.</p>
<p>Mr Major's government won, by a single vote, a critical division in the House of Commons on the <b>Scott report</b>, which had severely criticised the government for its handling of defence exports to Iraq. No minister resigned over the issue, despite widespread demands for someone to take responsibility.</p>
<p>The <b>Princess of Wales </b>agreed to divorce Prince Charles, and said she would continue to be involved in all decisions concerning her children and would retain her title. Caught by surprise, the queen's spokesman said details "remain to be discussed."</p>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<p>President Jacques Chirac said that <b>France's armed forces </b>must become leaner and all-professional by 2001to be on a par with the "best in the world" . France's arms industry, he said, should be first in the world, or at worst second only to America's.</p>
<p>Germany's chancellor, Helmut Kohl, declared there was no point in discussing a delay in the timetable for European economic and <b>monetary union</b>, let alone a change in the qualifications for joining it.</p>
<p>Negotiations in <b>Turkey</b> for a coalition government that would have brought an Islamic party to the fore collapsed. The two main centre-right parties, led by Tansu Ciller, who still heads Turkey's caretaker government, and Mesut Yilmaz, who failed to strike a deal with the Islamists, insist they are now close to agreeing upon a quite different-looking coalition.</p>
<p>Italy's caretaker prime minister, <b>Lamberto Dini</b>, created his own political party to compete in April's general election and said he will support the main centre-left block.</p>
<p>Opinion polls in Spain predicted that <b>Jose Maria Aznar</b>'s conservative People's Party would beat Felipe Gonzalez and his Socialist party, which has run the country for more than 13 years, in a general election on March 3rd.</p>
<p>Competing claims to jurisdiction over the Estonian church caused Patriarch Alexy II of Russia to suspend relations with the Archbishopric of Constantinople, threatening the Orthodox Church with its <b>worst schism since 1443</b>.</p>
<p>Poland rejected a Russian proposal to build a motorway across <b>northern Poland </b>linking Kaliningrad, a Russian enclave, with Belarus. The plan was mooted during a visit to Moscow by Alexander Lukashenka, president of Belarus, who wants closer ties with Russia. Belarus and Russia agreed to write off some of their debts to one another.<ro>
<h2>Bloody Middle East</h2>
Breaking a six-month respite, Hamas <b>suicide-bombers </b>killed 24 people in Jerusalem (injuring another 60), and one in Ashkelon, injuring 20. Shimon Peres demanded that Yasser Arafat crack down on the political as well as the military wing of Hamas.</p>
<p>Two sons-in-law of <b>Saddam Hussein</b> who had returned to Iraq believing that they had been pardoned for their defection to Jordan, were then murdered, along with other members of their family.</p>
<p>Voters in <b>Sierra Leone</b>'s towns went to the polls to elect a civilian government. Soldiers have run the country since 1985.</p>

Although the gap with Japan narrowed for the first time in five years, dropping nearly 10% to $59 billion, its deficit with China grew by 14.6% to $34 billion, and its surplus of $1.4 billion with Mexico in 1994 turned into a $16.2 billion deficit.</p><p><b>Growth in America </b>last year, at 2.1%, was at its most sluggish since the recession of 1990-91. It slowed in the fourth quarter to an annualised 0.9%, half the expected rate and down from 3.6% in the third quarter. January was better; retail sales fell only 0.3% despite heavy snows, and consumer confidence rose in February.</p><p>For the third year in a row, household spending in <b>Japan </b>declined, falling by 1.1% in 1995. But there was some good news: industrial production rose last year by 3.3%, and in January department-store sales rose 5.4%, the biggest rise in nearly five years.<ro><h2>Networking</h2>In the biggest merger yet between a Baby Bell and a cable-<font size=-1>TV</font> business, <b>US West</b> agreed to pay $5.3 billion for <b>Continental Cablevision</b> and assume $5.5 billion in debt to gain access to more than 4m potential new subscribers across 11 states. The merger is the first of its kind since sweeping changes in the law regulating America's telephone and television markets.</p><p><b>British Petroleum</b> and <b>Mobil</b> are responding to overcapacity in refining and a price war in petrol by merging their lubricants and refining operations in Europe, businesses with combined annual sales of $20 billion.</p><p>In a rare French demerger, <b>Chargeurs</b> is to split itself into two publicly quoted companies, with Path&eacute retaining the film, <font size=-1>TV</font> and newspaper operations, including a 17% stake in <font size=-1>B</font>Sky<font size=-1>B</font>, and Chargeurs International running the textile and distribution businesses.</p><p><b>De Beers</b> strengthened an agreement with Russia to buy its rough diamonds. Previously, loopholes allowed Russia to keep many of the best gems for itself and to sell others direct to the world market, by-passing De Beers; under the new deal Russia could keep more stones, but of a wider quality. In exchange De Beers will pay Russia some $2 billion a year.</p><p><b>Kvaerner</b>, a Norwegian ship builder, is considering a bid for <b>Trafalgar House</b>,a loss-making British construction-to-shipping conglomerate.</p><p>California's <b>Silicon Graphics</b>, under pressure in its <font size=-1>PC</font> business, has decided to push into the higher end of the computer business. It is buying <b>Cray Research</b>, a struggling maker of supercomputers, for a modest $770m or so. This should create the world's leading supercomputer company.</p></td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%><p>A Canadian publishing and travel firm, <b>Thomson</b>, is to pay $3.43 billion for West Publishing to expand its American legal-publishing operations.</p><p>Acquisitive <b>Heineken</b> completed its purchase of <b>Birra Moretti </b>from Belgium's Interbrew for around $170m to give the Dutch brewer the top spot in Italy with nearly 40% of the beer market.<ro><h2>Housekeeping</h2><b>Tokai Bank</b> of Japan will write off its &#165;800 billion ($7.7 billion) or so of bad loans in the current financial year. In the year to end-March it expects to declare a net loss of &#165;350 billion compared with a profit of &#165;21 billion the year before.</p><p>An American court found <b>Daiwa Bank</b> guilty of conspiracy, fraud and obstruction, and imposed a $340m criminal fine. The Japanese bank had originally denied trying to conceal losses of more than $1 billion from regulators. It later changed its plea to guilty.</p><p>Britain's <b>Barclays Bank</b> declared a 12% rise in pre-tax profits last year to &#163;2.08 billion ($3.28 billion). But the markets were disappointed by a 5% drop in operating profits to &#163;2.25 billion, with operating costs up 9.4%. Barclays then spent &#163;306m on buying back 40m of its shares, equal to 2.5% of its total capital; a few months ago it bought back 25m shares.</p><p><b>Groupe Paribas</b>, a French bank holding company, announced losses of FFr4 billion ($802m) last year, compared with a profit of FFr1.7 billion in 1994. The loss was due to provisions against losses in property, industrial holdings and a retail-banking subsidiary.<ro><h2>Air currents</h2>State-owned <b>Sabena </b>of Belgium ousted the chief executive, Pierre Godfroid, and gave the job to Paul Reutlinger of <b>Swissair</b>, which took a 49.5% stake in the airline last summer. Sabena lost BFr530m ($18m) in 1995, after losing BFr1.2 billion the year before.</p><p>Philip Condit is to become the seventh chief executive in <b>Boeing</b>'s 80-year history, replacing Frank Shrontz, who will remain as chairman.</p><p>Germany's biggest shipbuilder won a stay of execution from its creditor banks. Over the next two months <b>Bremer Vulkan</b> will get a modest DM100m ($68m) or so--the group lost around DM1 billion last year--while management comes up with a restructuring plan.</p><p>Italy's <b>Gianni Agnelli</b> retired only two weeks before his 75th birthday as chairman of the Fiat industrial group.</p><p><b>Jimmy Lai</b>, a controversial Hong Kong publisher, sold for $189m his remaining 27% in Giordano, a fast-growing clothing chain he founded in 1980.

<html><head><title>What is terrorism?</title></head><body bgcolor="#FFFFFF"><table width=100%><tr><td align=left valign=top><img src="sf.gif" alt="Section heading"><td align=right valign=top><img src="http://www.economist.com/econlogosmall.gif" alt="The Economist"></td></tr></table><h1>What is terrorism?</h1><p><b>The use of terror is more widespread and effective than is generally recognised</b></p><ro><p>JUNE 1914: a young man in Sarajevo steps up to a carriage and fires his pistol. The Archduke Ferdinand dies. Within weeks, the first world war has begun. The 1940s: the French resistance kill occupying troops when and how they can. June 1944: at Oradour-sur-Glane, in central France, German <font size=-1>SS</font> troops take revenge, massacring 642 villagers. August 1945: the United States Air Force drops the world's first nuclear weapons. Some 190,000 Japanese die, nearly all of them civilians. Within days the second world war has ended.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Which of these four events was an act of terrorism? Which achieved anything? Which, if any, will history judge as justified? And whose history? Terrorism is not the simple, sharp-edged, bad-guy phenomenon we all love to condemn. No clear line marks off politics from the threat of force, threat from use, use from covert or open war. Who is or is not a terrorist? The suicide bomber, the rebel guerrilla, the liberation front, the armed forces of the state?<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In practice, what act or person earns the label depends on who wants to apply it. To Ulster loyalists all <font size=-1>IRA</font> violence is terrorism; to Sinn Fein it is part of a legitimate war. To many Israelis, everyone from the suicide-bombers in Jerusalem or Ashkelon to the Hizbollah grenade-thrower in South Lebanon is a terrorist; to many Arabs during the 1982 Lebanon war, the worst terrorists in the Middle East were the--entirely legitimate, uniformed--Israel Defence Force.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If the concept is not to vanish into all-embracing fudge, two distinctions can be drawn, though habitually they are not. Terrorism is indeed about terror; not just violence, but its use to spread terror. And the violence is aimed specifically at civilians.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Classical terrorism, ideological rather than territorial, reveals the niceties. Recent decades saw West Germany's Baader-Meinhof gang and Red Army Fraction murder prominent businessmen such as Alfred Herrhausen and J&uuml;rgen Ponto (bosses of Germany's two largest banks, Deutsche and Dresdner respectively). Italy's Red Brigades murdered Aldo Moro, a former prime minister. Its far right in 1980 blew up a train in Bologna station, killing 84 people. Which of these was truly terrorism? Arguably, only the last. It was an act of indiscriminate violence to terrorise citizens at large; the others were discriminate assassinations to win publicity and display power.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Likewise, lobbing mortar-bombs into a British army base in South Armagh may have deadly results, but it is guerrilla warfare. Planting a bomb that kills a dozen diners in a restaurant is terrorism. The suicide bomber in Jerusalem was a terrorist; the Hizbollah fighter in South Lebanon attacking Israeli army patrols is not.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even in the distinction between guerrilla warfare and terrorism, there are grey areas. The soldier in a tank is a military target. What about one in a jeep escorting civilian vehicles? Or returning on a bus from leave? A bus that may--and was, when a suicide bomber attacked it in Gaza last April--be carrying civilians too?<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are, in contrast, distinctions often made that ought not to be. What is or is not "terrorism" does not depend on the badness or goodness of the cause, nor on whether those espousing it have the chance to express their demands democratically. When President James Garfield was assassinated in America in the same year, 1881, that a Russian terrorist group blew up Tsar Alexander <font size=-1>II</font>, the Russians wrote an open letter condemning Garfield's killers and arguing that:<ul><font size=-1>In a land where the citizens are free to express their ideas, and where the will of the people does not merely make the law but appoints the person who is to carry the law into effect, political assassination is the manifestation of despotism...Despotism is always blameworthy and force can only be justified when employed to resist force.</font></ul>Yet despotism does not justify throwing bombs into crowds (as the group sometimes did).<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The fact is that a good cause may use terrorism just as a bad one may. South Africa has provided a clear example. The ending of white dominance was a plainly good cause. For the most part, the African National Congress used mass demonstrations and industrial sabotage to advance its cause. But the men who shot up a white church congregation or planted a bomb outside a cinema were terrorists in the purest sense of the word.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor does the terrorists' ultimate success or failure alter the truth. Menachem Begin got to lead a country; Yasser Arafat may do; Velupillai Prabhakaran, who leads the Tamil Tigers, probably will not. None of that changes the fact that Deir Yassin (a massacre of Palestinian villagers by Israelis fighting to establish their state), the killing of 11 Israeli athletes at the Munich Olympics in 1972 and this year's Tamil Tiger bomb in Colombo were all acts of terror.</p><p><b>The terror of the state</b><br><ro>So much for the underdogs. Can there be terrorist governments too? The Americans certainly think so when they accuse Libya or Iran of supporting international terrorism. In the cold war, international terrorists were used to wage war by proxy: the East German regime provided safe houses for Baaders and Meinhofs; the modern era's most notorious terrorist, the gun-for-hire Carlos the Jackal, made his career in this world of state-sponsored terrorism.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All that was diplomacy by terror. Can a recognised government also be guilty of terrorism against its own people?<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yes. Stalin used terror systematically to consolidate his power--random murders of Communist-Party members and army officers in the 1930s, massacres and exiles of smaller ethnic groups throughout his rule. Much of Latin America practised state terrorism in recent decades. The brasshat regimes of the day faced left-wing, sometimes terrorist movements. Many fought back with terror. And not just through paramilitaries or unacknowledged death squads. The infamous massacre at El Mozote in El Salvador in 1981 was the work of that country's regular army. The unit that did it had a cheerful song of its own, <i><ul><font size=-1>" Somos Guerreros"</font>:<br>We are warriors,<br>Warriors all!<br>We are setting out to kill<br>A mountain of terrorists.</font></ul>What in fact they killed was over 500 peasants; probably the worst "official" massacre in Latin America's recent history.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Can regular armies, in regular war, be guilty of terrorism? The answer, surely, is yes. Look at the Japanese rape of Nanking in 1937, when not hundreds or thousands but ten of thousands of civilians were murdered, to terrorise the rest of China. Then go a step further. Can the armies of proud democracies be guilty too? A century ago, the rich world, with the rules of war that it claimed to use, would have called attacking civilians impermissable. The modern world has other ideas. The Allied bombing of Germany was aimed at civilians in the hope of shattering morale: in short, terror. The fire bombing of Tokyo and the atomic weapons that vaporised Hiroshima and Nagasaki were arguably aimed at government morale, not that of Japan's population. Their victims did not notice the difference.</p><p><b>Who kills and how?</b><br><ro>What use, one can ask, is a definition so wide that it can go from Stalin to the American air force? There are two answers.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;First, it is a reminder that terrorism, historically, has been the tool of the strong, not the weak. Medieval armies, having taken a besieged town, would slaughter some or all of the citizens to encourage other towns to surrender faster. During India's struggle for independence, by far the worst terror was the Amritsar massacre in 1919, when British-officered troops shot up a political gathering, and carried on shooting until the bullets ran out; 379 civilians died (and it worked: the rebellious province of Punjab returned to order). In contrast, discriminate assassination was the typical weapon of the 19th-century anarchist and nihilist.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;By and large, true random terrorism has come in the past 30 years, as in the Bologna train bomb, the recent nerve-gassing of the Tokyo metro by a religious cult, or the Oklahoma City bomb; all three crimes were aimed at no matter whom for a purpose so vague or Utopian as to seem irrelevant, except to the deranged. Even in this period most--not all--<font size=-1>IRA</font> killing was aimed at defined targets: soldiers, policemen, individual Protestant farmers in border areas. The Basque violence of <font size=-1>ETA</font> has often followed this pattern. Peru's Shining Path guerrillas are truer terrorists, but even they (mostly) prefer the tactics, honed by the Vietcong, of killing officials, not just (as in some infamous massacres) everyone in sight. Algeria's and Sri Lanka's terrorists today probably have the strongest claim to be called spreaders of true random terror.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The second thing one can learn from the wide definition of terrorism is that the phenomenon is neither uniquely wicked, nor--still less--uniquely deadly. People fight with the weapons they have: knives, Semtex, rifles, fighter-bombers. All their users are alike convinced of their own righteousness, all kill and all their victims are equally dead. What they are not is equal in number. The Munich terrorists killed 11 Israelis; Israel's retaliation against the Lebanese town of Nabatiyeh, however justified, killed about 100 Arabs. The State Department has totted up the deaths due to international terrorism from 1968 through 1995. Its total, and it defines terrorism broadly, is 8,700 (<a href="sf1.gif">see chart</a> for other figures). Twenty-four hours of air raids killed six times as many civilians at Dresden in 1945. One is a crime, says international law, the other a legitimate act of war.</p><p><b>The response</b><br><ro>Is all this mere word-play? It is not. It crucially affects responses to terrorism.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One true difference between a terrorist group and a government is that the group is almost impossible to smash. You can destroy or seize a government's ability to make conventional war; you will never get every terrorist's last stick of dynamite or timing mechanism, and it requires wonderfully few terrorists to keep a civilised society on edge.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But many other imagined differences are less great than they might appear. It is a common error to suppose that because terrorism is not war, and because its weapons are not the full panoply of war, then the psychology of terrorists must be different too. Of course, there are plenty of curious specimens among terrorism's ranks: Carlos the Jackal, now in French hands, was not just any old gunman; or consider Abimael Guzman, an academic who until his capture in 1992 led Peru's Shining Path movement. Every terrorist must have personal devotion to the cause--he is, after all, risking his liberty, and often his life; not many reluctant army conscripts, drafted by a legitimate government, are likely feel the same way. And plainly, say those who know them, the <font size=-1>IRA</font> and other groups include people who enjoy violence for its own sake.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But so do most armies. And most governments, once at war, can produce remarkable devotion to the national cause. In its own terms, a warring terrorist group, like a warring government, is "pursuing diplomacy by other means", even if its means of war are different. It too is subject to highs and lows, to war fatigue and collapses of morale, to premature celebration of a battle won as if it had been the war. It too can be threatened with a heavy hand; some of its members may be wooed with a lighter one.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Terrorists, like governments, may be rational: they are pursuing a policy they hope will succeed. And the more it works, the more vigorously they will pursue it.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is always hard, when terrorism is just one element in a complex pattern of events, to identify its impact. But the world is manifestly a different place because of acts of terror. In 1948, the Israelis blew up the King David hotel, the administrative centre of the British rulers of Palestine. The atrocity helped persuade the British to leave.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Often, terrorists help advance a general cause, but not their own particular aims. That may be the case with the <font size=-1>IRA</font>. Irish Republican terrorism helped dramatise the nationalist cause throughout periods of discriminatory Protestant rule. And Britain has made concessions to the nationalists. In the Anglo-Irish agreement of 1985, the British accepted the right of the Irish Republic to a say in a province of the United Kingdom; in the two governments' Downing Street declaration of 1993 Britain said it had "no selfish strategic or economic interest in Northern Ireland" . It is hard to imagine any other government saying such things of its own accord. Yet whether it was the <font size=-1>IRA</font> that brought this about, or persistent pressure from the Irish government and peaceful nationalists in the north, is debatable. The leader of the biggest nationalist party in Northern Ireland, John Hume, argues that <font size=-1>IRA</font> terrorism has been the main obstacle to a peaceful settlement in Ulster. If so, the <font size=-1>IRA</font> may also have harmed the nationalist cause.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And sometimes, terrorists can advance both a general cause and themselves. The <font size=-1>PLO</font>'s campaigns in the 1970s made the organisation the dominant representative of the Palestinians. They also helped solidify the Palestinians' own sense of their distinct identity, which until then had been relatively weak.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Just as terrorists make a difference to the world, so changes in the world make a difference to terrorists. It was not just their own weakness that led the British to quit India, or later Cyprus (whose <font size=-1>EOKA</font> gunmen, though damned as terrorists, were more like guerrilla fighters), or later still Kenya (where they faced a genuinely terrorist liberation movement). Weakness played its part, but so did a world view that said colonial empires had had their day. Much the same was true in South Africa. F.W. de Klerk, probably the last white president there, may not have been a more virtuous man than the architects of apartheid who preceded him. But he was and is a realist, who lived in different days and under different pressures.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In that case, a just cause plainly helped the terrorists. For Muslim countries the Palestinian cause was no less just. Western countries, guiltily aware of the horrors of Jewish history, disagreed, and it took 20 years of Israeli occupation and the <i>intifada</i>, the Palestinian uprising of 1987-90, to persuade them that the <font size=-1>PLO</font> too had a case. It is still not one that much impresses Americans; and though other westerners may have sympathy with Palestinian dreams of statehood, any movement that still seeks a quite different thing, the destruction of Israel, on top will--very rightly--find that its bombers face a western world united behind the Jewish state.</p><p><b>Like the rest of us--mostly</b><br><ro>In all this, what is different about dealing with terrorism? The answer, perhaps unsurprisingly, is not very much.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Any government has its own interests, its own pressures, its concessions it can make and those it cannot. It fights its conventional wars with tanks and aircraft, its small-scale wars--partly terrorist, mostly not--with intelligence men and small arms. It cannot, usually, zap the terrorists' territory as it could that of a hostile state. But its psychology will be much the same in the two cases--and so will that of its enemies. The terrorist or suicide bomber or gunman or fighter or liberation hero is not different from other men (men, <i>sic</i>; rarely have women played any notable part, any more than they have in old-fashioned war).<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;With one notable exception: the nutters, whether with a cause or no evident cause at all. The American way-out redneck who thinks he has to plant a bomb, when he could vote for Pat Buchanan, is beyond any but a psychiatrist's reach. So too elitist solipsists like the Baader-Meinhof mob, convinced that murder was justified because they knew all the answers and it was society that was out of step. Among the almost causeless, Italy's far right may have sought instability, but for what? That was never clear. And no known concession could have led Japan's Aum Shinrikyo cult to put aside its chemistry set.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Is it coincidence that three of these four groups seem to specialise in the true terrorism, the random murder of civilians for terror's sake? Perhaps it is not.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?825717600,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="ir1.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&#169; Copyright</a> 1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

<h1>After the bombs</h1>
<p><b>The revival of Islamist terrorism leaves Israel buffeted and Palestinians trapped. Our correspondents report; first, from Jerusalem </b></p>

<p>AS VICTIMS of Sunday's suicide-bomb attack in Jerusalem were being buried the next day, the wailing of sirens drowned the eulogies. A Palestinian driver, had deliberately run his car into a crowd of hitch-hikers in the north of the city and had been shot dead by passers-by. Or had it all been an accident? Police evidence, backed by a less-than-reliable statement from Hamas's military wing, strongly suggests that he had indeed meant to do what he did. But the confusion seemed to symbolise Israel's distraught condition as Islamist terrorism returned after a six-month respite. Twenty-four people had been killed by the bus-bomber in Jerusalem; one by another suicide-bomber in Ashkelon the same day.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;During the 1994-95 bombings, the question after each incident was whether negotiations with the Palestinians could go on. This time, the negotiations, having produced an interim result, are on hold anyway, pending Israel's election on May 29th. The question now is the electoral impact of renewed terrorism. The prospects for the peace process depend on this. The right-wing Likud, while grudgingly accepting the present arrangements, remains implacably opposed to eventual Palestinian independence. The governing Labour Party is moving steadily towards a " two-state solution".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In an opinion poll conducted within hours of the two bombings, the lead of Labour's Shimon Peres over the Likud's Binyamin Netanyahu swung from a previous nine points to just two. Maybe the pendulum will swing back, if there are no further attacks. But how far? One pollster, Mina Tsemach, points to a key block of what she calls "emotional voters" who had switched from Likud to Labour after the murder of Yitzhak Rabin last November. Now they seem to have switched back.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet one group, she notes, appears to be more constant than others: first-time voters, who have been politically galvanised by Rabin's assassination. "For them, peace is more important than anything," says Ms Tsemach. "Terrorism will not shift them."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In another way Israeli reaction is different from that provoked by earlier bombings. Then, thousands of people were ready to gather at the site, cursing the prime minister and his peace policy. Opposition politicians made a point of being photographed among the angry crowds. This time the demonstrators were few in number, and the politicians stayed away. "Now is a time for unity in mourning and unity in strength," said a newly statesmanlike Mr Netanyahu. Raucous recrimination no longer fits the national mood.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The superficial moderation of the public debate should not, however, give Mr Peres and his party cause for confidence. The fear and the fury engendered by earlier mass-killings are present again, albeit in more silent, sullen form. Instant polls cannot take the full measure of the emotional storm buffeting the soul of the nation. It is almost as if the shooting of Yitzhak Rabin and this week's bus-bombings were vying with each other for Israeli hearts.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The new terrorism has freed some right-leaning voters from the inhibitions that evolved after Rabin's murder by a far-right religious fanatic. It has also brought a dramatic closing of ranks. David Levy, a former foreign minister who left the Likud last year to form his own party, is now negotiating his way back. This deal, concluded in principle though still to be signed, comes after a similar pact between the Likud and Tsomet, another right-wing party, led by a former army commander, Rafael Eitan.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Netanyahu is having to pay a heavy price in terms of safe slots on Likud's list of Knesset candidates. His reward is that Mr Eitan, and now Mr Levy, will not stand for the prime ministership, leaving him and Mr Peres to slug it out alone. There will be no later run-off, as there would have been in a multiple-horse race. Mr Netanyahu regards this as critical to his chances. The group that so often holds the key to Israeli elections, the ultra-orthodox, will turn out on May 29th to vote for their own Knesset candidates, and some will take the opportunity to vote for Mr Netanyahu at the same time. But would they bother to turn out a second time? Probably not.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For Mr Peres, the bombings and their political fall-out have been a nightmare come true. His opinion-poll ratings had slipped slightly in recent weeks, but the gap opened up by the Rabin murder had been so wide that he remained confident of victory. His strategy had been to follow as centrist and uncontroversial a course as possible. Now he has to demonstrate toughness, partly in order to convince middle-of-the-road Israelis that Yasser Arafat is a dependable partner in peace. In pursuit of this, he sent the army chief of staff, Lieut-General Amnon Shahak, to demand that the Palestinian Authority arrest a string of known Islamic activists in the Gaza Strip.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The two suicide-bombers themselves, young Hamas supporters, came from the Hebron region, which is still under Israeli military rule--awkward for those who want to blame all outrages on Mr Arafat's incompetence or bad faith. But Israel insists, credibly enough, that the explosives, the orders and the religious inspiration all came from inside Gaza. So Mr Peres threatens to postpone the handover of most of Hebron to Palestinian rule, due at the end of March, unless Mr Arafat co-operates. Meanwhile, he has reimposed an indefinite closure of the border between Israel and the West Bank and Gaza. He will be under strong pressure from his election managers to keep it closed until polling day.

His immediate response was to arrest 150 people for suspected links with Hamas's military wing,Izzadin el-Qassam. His police chief then ordered all Palestinians in the self-rule areas to hand in unlicensed weapons. But he has so far resisted Israeli and American pressure to go after Hamas, root and branch: to dismantle the Islamists' infrastructure of schools and charities which, says the Israeli government, camouflage their military operations.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;"We want more stick and less carrot from Arafat. The process of co-opting has failed," says Martin Indyk, the American ambassador to Israel. Mr Arafat's stick-and-carrot policy towards Hamas has indeed been sabotaged by the new outrages. It had been showing slow, incremental results. For nearly a year, the Palestinian leader has been acting forcefully against Islamist activists. In Gaza, his security forces have arrested several hundreds of suspects, earning stern rebukes from Palestinian, international, even Israeli human-rights organisations in the process. In the West Bank, Palestinian police forces have worked with Israeli security services, a liaison that led to the destruction of Qassam cells in Jenin, Jerusalem and Hebron.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Hamas is much more than its military arm. It is a social and religious organisation, running an array of civic institutions. Mr Arafat has left these institutions intact--and initiated a quiet dialogue with Hamas's civilian leaders, attempting to co-opt them into the political process. He did not convince all of them, but his efforts produced a more pragmatic Hamas leadership, particularly in Gaza. These are men whose aim is less to scupper the peace process than to exist politically within it.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In December officials from Mr Arafat's Palestinian Authority (<font size=-1>PA</font>) met Hamas representatives, both from Jordan (where a harder line predominates) and from the self-rule territories, for "reconciliation" talks in Cairo. Hamas promised "a ceasefire with the occupation" on condition that the <font size=-1>PA</font> used its offices with Israel to "protect" Islamist military fugitives from the Israelis. Mr Arafat demanded an unconditional ceasefire. Hamas broke up the talks, saying it would boycott the Palestinian elections but still promising not to embarrass the <font size=-1>PA</font> in its commitments to Israel. But then, a month later, an Israeli booby-trap killed Yehya Ayyash, a Hamas bomb-maker who was Israel's number-one target, the biggest fugitive of all, in Gaza.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even so, some Hamas leaders stuck to the pragmatic line. The group's Gazan spokesman, Mahmoud Zahar, said it would take part in June's municipal elections. Another senior man, Ghazi Hamad, said publicly that "the majority of Hamas members are now ready to give up--temporarily--the armed struggle against Israel and turn to political activity."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A minority, clearly, are not. These, it is said, are Qassam activists based mainly in the West Bank, for whom an unconditional reconciliation could spell their own obituaries. Their return to the politics of terror was, they say, to avenge the killing of Ayyash and other Islamist activists. But it was also a message--to Israel, to Mr Arafat and to their own political leaders--that any rapprochement or truce must include them. The day Israel "stops terrorism against Hamas and releases our prisoners ... we will reach an historic position ... not to shed blood in Palestine," said a Hamas statement after Sunday's bombings.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Arafat's dilemma is acute. His instinct tells him that the way to neutralise Qassam is through Hamas's political leadership, perhaps by prising the two apart. But Israel and America are telling him to crush Hamas, military and political wings alike. Polls show that the overwhelming majority of local Palestinians oppose terrorist operations; Hamas's own support among them is down to 10%. But if Mr Arafat acts against the group in the way that the Israelis are urging, the whole organisation could become an outlawed, and even more murderous, religious militia.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?825717600,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="br1.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&#169; Copyright</a> 1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

And none too soon.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;If John Major and John Bruton, the British and Irish prime ministers, had not been able to agree on a way forward on February 28th, hours before both men left for a Europe-Asia summit in Bangkok, the peace process might well have died. Both governments had agreed, at another hastily arranged summit in November, that the end of February should be the target date for all-party talks. But the <font size=-1>IRA</font> had ended its ceasefire early in February and bombed London, saying it believed such talks would never happen. Pressure to do something was intense.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At their summit, the two leaders agreed that consultations with the political parties in Northern Ireland would begin on March 4th. They will cover the form of elections to lead "directly and without preconditions" to all-party negotiations. The consultations will also examine the possibility of holding referendums on both sides of the border asking people to repudiate violence and support talks. These consultations will end on March 13th. Whether or not there is agreement, the British government will pass the legislation needed to hold the elections--"based on a judgment on what seems most broadly acceptable"--some time in May, and then all-party negotiations will begin on June 10th.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Attention will now shift to the <font size=-1>IRA</font>, and its political wing, Sinn Fein. When it called off its ceasefire on February 9th, the <font size=-1>IRA</font> said that it was doing so because the British had failed, for the 17 months of its ceasefire, to move towards an "inclusive negotiated settlement". Again and again Sinn Fein leaders have said that this was a demand for all-party talks "without preconditions". Irish republicans now have a British promise, endorsed by Dublin, that all-party talks will begin at a fixed date.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The immediate reaction from Sinn Fein was cautious. Gerry Adams, the party's president, said that many republicans would be sceptical in the face of "consistent British bad faith and stalling". Martin McGuinness, another Sinn Fein leader, said that his party needed "more clarity" before asking the <font size=-1>IRA</font> for a new ceasefire. But both men also said that their party would look at the proposals "positively".<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More significantly, Sinn Fein announced the following day that, hours after Mr Major and Mr Bruton unveiled their deal, Mr Adams and John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (<font size=-1>SDLP</font>), Northern Ireland's largest nationalist party, had met <font size=-1>IRA</font> leaders and "reiterated their commitment to restoring the peace process". It was Mr Hume who persuaded Mr Adams, after years of talks, to lead the <font size=-1>IRA</font> to their first ceasefire.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed, it is difficult to see how the <font size=-1>IRA</font> can now justify, even to its own supporters, refusing to call a second ceasefire. The only hurdle between Sinn Fein and all-party talks, an election, also applies to all other parties, and has been accepted by Dublin and the <font size=-1>SDLP</font>. Sinn Fein knows that it can win its customary 10% of the vote in such an election. In interviews Mr Major also said that the government could not bar Sinn Fein from running in the election even in the absence of a new <font size=-1>IRA</font> ceasefire. But with no ceasefire, Sinn Fein will not be allowed to take its place at the negotiating table. The <font size=-1>IRA</font> might decide to see this as a precondition. But this would be absurd. Taken at its word, the <font size=-1>IRA</font> would then be bombing and killing solely to get the British government to drop its demand for a ceasefire.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The deal announced by the two prime ministers has something bitter, as well as pleasing, for everyone, not just Sinn Fein. Both the Irish government and the <font size=-1>SDLP</font>, like Sinn Fein, have sought a firm date for talks. But both have also had to accept elections, which they have opposed as divisive and obstructive.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The two largest unionist parties--the Ulster Unionists and the Democratic Unionists--get the elections they demanded, but not the assembly or "body" they wanted, and which they would have dominated. Nor will the <font size=-1>IRA</font> be required to make a gesture on decommissioning weapons before Sinn Fein is allowed into talks, as the unionists have long demanded, though decommissioning will be near the top of the agenda once the talks begin.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most of all, unionists will be unable to delay all-party talks. Both governments have said that, if the <font size=-1>IRA</font> calls a new ceasefire, they will expect the unionist parties to sit down with Sinn Fein on June 10th. If the unionist parties refuse to do this, they will be the ones who thereby exclude themselves from negotiations--and it is they who will be blamed for wrecking the talks. Neither unionist party was overjoyed at this, but neither rejected the package.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first argument will be about the form of the election. The Ulster Unionists, the largest unionist party, wants the election to be based on the province's 18 parliamentary constituencies, which would play to its organisational strength. Ian Paisley's Democratic Unionists and the <font size=-1>SDLP</font>, in a surprising alliance, want a province-wide, party-list system, which will benefit both of them. The British government is likely to opt for the party-list system. Not only does it have support across the sectarian divide, but it will also make it easier for fringe loyalist parties to win a seat at the negotiating table.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So have the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s London bombs achieved their purpose--a firm date for all-party talks? Mr Major and Mr Bruton insisted that they were not responding to <font size=-1>IRA</font> violence and that the peace process was proceeding as they had promised back in November. Unfortunately, no one believes this. One Tory backbencher, David Wilshire, lambasted the deal as "another Munich". Few go that far. And yet talks looked a distant prospect before the bombs went off. They have clearly concentrated minds on how to get talks going.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nevertheless the <font size=-1>IRA</font> is deluding itself if it now believes that it can turn violence off and on once Sinn Fein is into talks. Its bombs have alienated Sinn Fein sympathisers in America, alarmed the White House, enraged Dublin and filled many in the <font size=-1>SDLP</font> with disgust. The vast majority of people north and south of the border, nationalists and unionists, want both talks and peace. Sinn Fein leaders have repeatedly claimed that they will accept the outcome of all-party talks. Once such talks begin, more <font size=-1>IRA</font> bombs would split the republican movement wide open, or shatter Sinn Fein's credibility once and for all.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?825717600,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="br2.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&#169; Copyright</a> 1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

They persuaded civil servants to include the length of a council's coastline among the factors used to determine how much its fire service should get. The rationale? That areas with lots of coastline had fewer neighbouring fire services to call on in time of difficulty. This decision has given hope to West Yorkshire, which is arguing that hilly areas should get similarly favourable treatment.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is local-government season again. In the first half of March, councils tell local residents how much council tax they will have to pay during the current year. Some councils have been threatening huge rises: Southwark, for instance, suggested its bills might have to go up by 94%. Actual increases will be lower, probably up to 25%.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;During April, after the council-tax bills have been sent to residents, the run-up to local-government elections starts. Central government points to high increases and accuses (mostly Labour-run) councils of being profligate, while the councils accuse central government of failing to finance services properly. At the elections in May, the electorate gets the chance to vote. But voters will, as usual, stay away from the polls in droves.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The voters' apathy is rational. Local government has little discretion over spending, and less over money-raising. These days, 80% of local government's money comes from central government, and its total spending is capped. The important battles are not about the council tax, but the backroom battles of the sort that Cornwall and the Isle of Wight have recently won.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some &#163;40 billion (13% of government spending and 5.5% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>) is allocated by a nine-month process. It starts in the first week of March to determine the Standard Spending Assessments (<font size=-1>SSA</font>s), the government's estimate of how much a council needs to spend. (<a href="br1.gif">See chart</a>).<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Needs are assessed according to an area's social, demographic and geographical characteristics. The more children an area has, for instance, the higher its educational needs will be. Equalisation, however, does not stop there. Some children appear to be more expensive to educate than others. Using past spending patterns, civil servants try to work out why this is so. Their conclusion is that more poor, unemployed, lone parents, ethnic minorities and a thinly-spread population put the bills up; so Tower Hamlets' <font size=-1>SSA</font> per head for education in 1996-97 is &#163;720 and Kensington and Chelsea's is &#163;226. Whitehall goes even further in its pursuit of fairness. The mathematics show that children "at risk" in some areas cost more than others; so a child "at risk" in Lambeth will have more money allocated to it than one in Cambridge.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such conclusions worry some: does past spending really say much about an area's need, or is it picking up other factors? In other words, does the higher cost of educating a child in a poorer area tell you that the child has greater needs or that its local authority is inefficient? Is the system rewarding failure?<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The capping of local-authority spending, which started in the mid-1980s, complicates such calculations even further. These assume that past spending is an expression of an area's needs; but, increasingly, past spending has been determined by central-government fiat, which limits its usefulness as an indicator.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As well as being flawed, the system is obscure. It is, according to the Audit Commission, the most complex in the world, save possibly that used in Australia. Nobody knows how many variables it employs. Civil servants admit that the struggle to make it comprehensible has been lost.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It gets worse as time goes by. Councils argue constantly for extra factors to be taken into account that might shift cash in their direction; and they all employ consultants to make their case to ministers. Local authorities gang up to put a common case. A band of councils in South Yorkshire and Lancashire have won a long campaign to include a long-term sickness indicator to shift cash in their direction. Some pretty areas have managed to get a National Park indicator included in the calculations.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The biggest recent battle has been that between the south-east and the rest of England about what level of compensation the region should get to make up for its higher costs. The government has now set up a commission to settle the argument. The level of distrust between the two English camps is such that the commission is staffed by Scotsmen and one Ulsterman. It sounds a small matter, but the argument is about &#163;1.5 billion.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The more variables are fed into the system, the more unmanageable it becomes. Once every few years, the system's minders admit that it has imploded. They then throw it away and start again, trying to build something that they can cope with. The system was last rebuilt in 1989. The current one is, true to form, showing signs of breaking down.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Civil servants justify the system's complexity by arguing that to be fair, it must be sensitive; and to be sensitive, it must be complex. To count the heads of school-age children, the argument goes, is to ignore the greater needs of some. Yet the "fairness" of the system seems somewhat arbitrary. Wales calculates its <font size=-1>SSA</font>s differently to England; when the Audit Commission recalculated English <font size=-1>SSA</font>s on the Welsh basis, it got results of up to 27% more and 36% less than the councils' actual allocations.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Anyway, handing out more money per child to a county whose average incomes are low does not necessarily help poor children as much as Whitehall mandarins claim. As the illustration from Berkshire's education spending shows (on the previous page), local authorities tend to spend similar amounts on educating all their children, rich and poor alike, ignoring central government's careful calculations of need.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some argue that the problem is philosophical rather than practical: that the struggle to create a mathematical model of fairness is misconceived, because it cannot be objectively measured. "We have," says Martin Pilgrim of the Association of Metropolitan Authorities, "an immensely sophisticated system to measure something which is not measurable."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The struggle for fairness has combined with the government's centralising tendencies to produce a system that looks nothing like democracy. Tony Travers, a local government specialist at the London School of Economics, points out the irony that this bureaucratic, egalitarian system should have triumphed under a Conservative government. "It is," he says, "as centralised as anything Eastern Europe ever produced."<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The government is bothered enough about the system's problems to have asked the Institute for Fiscal Studies to examine its mathematics. But--as Labour accepts--bolder reform is needed: radical simplification to make the system understandable and a shift of money-raising powers back to local government to make it accountable. Until then, Britain's system of local-authority finance will stand as a monument to bad government and will contribute little to local democracy.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?825717600,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="br3.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&#169; Copyright</a> 1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

<h1>Welshing on devolution</h1>

<p>IT WOULD be nice to think that the new powers for local government in Wales announced by William Hague, the Welsh secretary, in a Commons debate on February 29th, represented a belated Tory conversion to the merits of local democracy. It would be nice but it would be wrong. Mr Hague's proposals are really aimed at embarrassing Labour over its plans for a new Welsh assembly.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In his speech, Mr Hague proposed to transfer &#163;35m of funds for miscellaneous economic and social-development projects from his Welsh Office to local government. Local councils will also get control of &#163;364m of <font size=-1>EU</font> structural funds going to Wales. In future this will be handled by an independent executive controlled by the local authorities, rather than the Welsh Office.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These measures follow his announcement in November of a bigger role for the Welsh grand committee of <font size=-1>MP</font>s. It will be able to question ministers and will hold half its meetings in Wales.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Both measures are designed to take the steam out of Labour's commitment to Welsh devolution. In Scotland, where most attention on Labour's devolution plans has been focused, most Labour <font size=-1>MP</font>s are strongly for an assembly. But Labour's 27 Welsh <font size=-1>MP</font>s range between enthusiasts for a powerful Welsh assembly and those who would rather not have one at all.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Recently Labour has built a fragile unity around a plan devised by Ron Davies, the shadow Welsh secretary. He proposes an assembly that would not have legislative or tax-raising powers, but to which the Welsh Office and Welsh quangos would be accountable.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In opposing those plans, Mr Hague hopes to make an ally of Welsh local councils. The most powerful of these, including Cardiff, are Labour-controlled. Local councillors are nervous that a new Welsh assembly would erode their responsibilities. By giving councils more power, Mr Hague hopes to convince them to criticise Labour's plans, rekindling the dissent in Labour's ranks.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Tory share of the Welsh vote has halved since the 1992 general election, according to recent public-opinion surveys by <font size=-1>MORI</font>, a polling firm. All six Tory seats in the province are at risk. As Welsh opinion is divided about devolution, opposing it may be a clever political move.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Still, with only one in seven Welsh voters now saying they will vote Tory--even fewer than in Scotland--the Tories face a difficulty. How much longer can they project themselves as the party of the union, when they have almost disappeared as a political force in three of the United Kingdom's four countries?

<p><b>Policing</b></p>
<h1>Downbeat</h1>


<p>SICK leave is a reasonable indicator of unhappiness with a job. So it is fair to conclude that, with sick leave among police forces ranging up to 20 days per officer per year, and patrol officers the sickest of the lot, that the bobby on the beat is none too happy these days.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is one of the central problems of modern policing. Patrol policing is what the public wants; it satisfies some of the fastest-growing demands on police forces; it fits in with modern trends in crime-prevention. But policemen do not like it. A report published by the Audit Commission on February 29th, and one by the Police Federation a week earlier, both address the problem, but offer different solutions.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Around 60% of police officers are patrol constables. The gloom that pervades their ranks was illustrated by a survey in 1995. Nearly two-thirds described their morale as "not very" or "not at all" high; only a third wanted to go on being a patrol officer. Part of the problem is that the work is out of doors, around the clock and physically risky. But it is also one of those ancient institutional facts that other policemen look down on patrol officers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The public, by contrast, cannot get enough of them. On balance, people are satisfied with almost everything the police do, according to polls: from responding to emergencies (68% net satisfaction; that is, satisfied minus dissatisfied) to preventing crime (18% net satisfaction). But they are not at all satisfied with the number of patrol officers (net satisfaction: minus 20%).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Police forces have justified failing to satisfy this demand for more bobbies on the beat by arguing that patrols contribute little to the police's main job, which is catching criminals. But both strands of this argument are questionable.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Catching criminals is nowadays a smaller part of what people ask the police to do. Increasingly, the police are summoned to deal with neighbourhood disputes of the sort that tighter communities once settled for themselves. Patrol officers who know their areas are better-equipped to do this than are emergency response teams. Also, police forces are nowadays trying new ways to tackle crime--and officers on patrol may make these methods work better. In London, for instance, the Metropolitan Police's successful Operation Bumblebee (against burglars) and Eagle Eye (against muggers) relied on intelligence. Patrol officers who know their beats are good intelligence-collectors.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unfortunately, as the Audit Commission points out, patrolling is held in such low esteem that forces fail to make the best of it. Officers are shifted around so quickly that they never become familiar with their beat. Too often, they are not provided with the information they need to deal with recurring problems. Giving patrol officers the support they need and time to get to know an area, argues the commission, will help the police in their ambition to prevent crime rather than just react to it. And what does the Police Federation recommend? You guessed it: more policemen.

Measured as a proportion of the economy's total output (<a href="br2.gif">see chart</a>), investment has been on a downward trend since 1989. Part of the fall is explained by cuts in the public sector's spending on infrastructure, and by individuals' reluctance to buy houses. But investment by businesses is also weak, as figures published on February 23rd showed. Manufacturing firms' investment during the fourth quarter of 1995 was 9% lower than in the previous quarter and 5% lower than in the same period in 1994.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;At present this reluctance to plough money into new equipment, offices and factories is all the more puzzling, because incentives to invest seem unusually strong. In principle, investments ought to be worth making when their cost is outweighed by the stockmarket valuation of the extra profits resulting from the investment. According to the Bank of England's estimates, the ratio between these two numbers has been favourable since the end of 1991, and has recently soared to its highest level for more than 25 years.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However, the Bank suggests that the weakness of business investment is not as worrying as it might appear. First, investment is now close to its long-run average following a boom in spending--especially on property--in the late 1980s. Second, Britain's statistics seem to be underestimating the speed at which the cost of investing in computing power is decreasing, as Howard Davies, the Bank's deputy governor, pointed out in a speech on February 21st.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On this, a comparison with America is striking. Its investment statistics are based on a detailed analysis of changes in the efficiency and capacity of computers. They show that between 1985 and 1992 the underlying cost of computers fell by 55%. Britain's official figures, less sophisticated in this area, recorded a fall of only 25%. Britain's investment statistics also fail to record purchases of software bought separately from computer hardware (a shortcoming that will be corrected once Britain adopts new European standards for national accounts some time in the next two years).<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The increasing use of information technology to organise production and to predict sales may also be helping firms to make better use of existing capacity, reducing their need to splash out on new equipment. Andrew Sentance of the London Business School points to surveys by the Confederation of British Industry which suggest that manufacturers are now comfortable with much lower margins of spare capacity than they were in the early 1980s.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?825717600,iss">Search</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="index.html">Contents</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="br6.html">Next article</a></p><p align=center><font size=-1><a href="http://www.economist.com/copyright.html">&#169; Copyright</a> 1996 <i>The Economist</i> Newspaper Limited.

<h1><center>Voice of America?</center></h1>

THE peasants are coming with pitchforks!" cried Pat Buchanan on the eve of the New Hampshire vote. Peasants? Pitchforks? Why not? Mr Buchanan's America is a medieval land where honest workers toil for pitiful wages, where castles of virtue are besieged by the forces of Tinseltown, where borders must be defended with armed guards, and where foreigners poison the wells. And this Republican candidate has won the New Hampshire primary with 28% of the vote.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is still highly unlikely that he will be the party's nominee. Political parties wish to preserve themselves. The Republicans have only to whisper the name " Goldwater"--just as the Democrats have only to whisper the name "McGovern"--to remember that nominees from the wild fringes of the party spell death at the general election. Failing a late eruption by a party idol, it is likely to be either Bob Dole (second, with 27%) or Lamar Alexander (third, with 23%) who will lead the Republicans against Bill Clinton in November.
</p><p><b>Tapping insecurity</b>
<br><ro>On the other hand, nothing is certain. The race is now wide open. And if the organisation is on Mr Dole's side, and a bit of momentum on Mr Alexander's, all the passion is on Pat's. He is a natural orator. His supporters adore him. He runs a clever grass-roots campaign based on small contributors and free radio time. He taps deep into some dismayingly widespread and long-lived American opinions--isolationism, protectionism, thinly-veiled racism; and into some more reasonable, and more widespread, anxieties. That is what makes him dangerous. In Mr Buchanan's topsy-turvy world, the right is so far right that it becomes the left: government once again becomes the arbiter of both morals and markets. But that philosophy has its attractions in eras of unsettling change. He plays them for all they are worth.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In doing so, Mr Buchanan has opened with axe-blows the cracks which the Republican party, for eight years, has been delicately papering over. Is the party the voice of the religious right, stoutly opposed to abortion, homosexuality and all that could be called "liberal"? Or can it speak for the confused but tolerant majority? Is it the party of free-trade, or tariffs? Internationalist, or vowing to keep American boys and American aid safely at home? And, most important of all, is it a forward-looking party of reform, limited government and faith in the market, or one that, in the name of conservatism, demands a stronger and more intrusive state?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Buchanan's share of the vote was not large. More than 70% of New Hampshire's registered Republicans, who are a particularly rebellious and conservative lot, preferred somebody else. But it was a victory, all the same, and not simply the by-product of Mr Dole's failings. Mr Buchanan's appeal runs deep and the Buchananite side of the party should not be underrated. It includes, potentially, everyone who feels battered by the new economy, baffled by the Internet, nostalgic for Main Street, resentful of foreigners. According to opinion polls, fully one-third of American workers are worried that someone in their family will be laid off next year, and half are worried that their income will not meet expenses.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The economic indicators, to be sure, should put these worries in perspective. America created nearly 8m jobs last year, and the "misery index"--inflation (2.5%) plus unemployment (5.8%)--is at its lowest for almost three decades. But ordinary workers seem more impressed by the fact that the actual purchasing power of wages has stayed flat for 10-15 years; and that flagship corporations such as <font size=-1>AT&T</font> have recently laid off workers in the tens of thousands.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Some of these people voted for Ross Perot four years ago, although Mr Perot's eccentric authoritarianism took the form of a war on lobbyists and big government. Some of them voted for Bill Clinton, who always understood economic insecurity better than George Bush did. The Republicans need all these voters back in order to win in November. Here lies Mr Buchanan's threat: he can get their attention better than anyone else can. And, in the process, he can tug the whole campaign in his direction. It has happened already. The debate over tax reform, a good thing in itself, was quickly turned into a competition among the candidates to offer the largest tax cut, in airy disregard for the effect this would have on the deficit. And the debate over economic policy soon foundered in a morass of populist rhetoric against big corporations, with even Mr Dole declaring at last that the Republicans would henceforth be "the party of Main Street, not Wall Street"--whatever that meant.
</p><p><b>Fear of change</b>
<br><ro>This does not sound like the brave new Republican Party that was meant to have swept the country in November 1994, bringing with it irresistible notions of leaner government, citizen empowerment and a new high-tech American century. And it is not. That election was a revolution in the minds of a few, who erroneously read a mandate in it for full-scale reform of government. The mass of voters meant merely to send an anti-establishment, anti-Washington message. That message can also be heard in Mr Buchanan's speeches, half-buried in passionate cant.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Newt Gingrich and his followers have yet to persuade the mass of Republican voters that economic change, and the freer operation of the market, can be exciting rather than frightening. And although the desirability of smaller, more efficient government is generally accepted, the loss of a particular federal pay-cheque or safety net is not. The Gingrich wing of the party, in fact, may be even less representative of the mass of Republican voters than the Buchanan wing. No candidate this year has even mentioned the "Contract with America" , or indeed made the case for a balanced budget. The candidates sense that this year Republican voters want no one so much as Ronald Reagan: charm, effortless leadership, low taxes, a full complement of federal services, and a budget deficit into the trillions of dollars.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Who will be brave enough to puncture the Reaganite dream, while blocking the Buchanan nightmare? Mr Dole has the courage, and the battlefield experience in Congress; but he has no new ideas, and none of that essential confidence in the future that used to typify his party. Mr Alexander is light on both experience and personality, but, alone among the candidates, he has kept some of the flame of 1994 alive; he believes in the devolution of power from Washington to the states, the downsizing of government and the central importance of education in getting and keeping jobs. All this has been fuzzily expressed so far. Sharpened up, it could be an antidote to Mr Buchanan. The Republicans certainly need to find one, and fast.

<h2>Impasse</h2>
<p>The <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s <b>bombing campaign </b>continued with an explosion that destroyed a double-decker bus in central London, killing the bomber and injuring eight other people. The British and Irish governments failed to agree on a formula for starting all-party political talks over Northern Ireland's future.<p>About a million people in Madrid, together with the prime minister, Felipe Gonzalez, and other politicians, demonstrated against violence by terrorists of the <b>Basque nationalist group</b>, <font size=-1>ETA</font>, who have carried out several murders in the run-up to a general election being held on March 3rd.<p>President Jacques Chirac proposed a drastic shake-up of France's mainly <b>conscript armed forces</b>, which may become all-voluntary by 2001.<p><b>Bosnia's Serbs </b>agreedafter talks in Rome to restore relations with <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s peace implementation force, Ifor. Days later, progress was slow, and the Bosnian city of Mostar stayed divided between Croats and Muslims, despite an agreement in Rome that the division would end.<p>The <font size=-1>IMF</font> gave a vote of confidence in <b>Russia's reforms</b> by agreeing to a $10 billion loan. It will be disbursed over three years; $4 billion could be paid this year alone. But the Fund's conditions are tough: monthly inflation below 1% by the end of 1996, and a budget deficit no<p>bigger than 4% of <font size=-1>GDP</font>.<p>A coalition <b>government in Turkey</b> seemed increasingly likely as leaders of the pro-Islamic Welfare Party and the secular, right-wing Motherland Party sorted out who would be prime minister first. Haggling continued over how the other ministries should be shared out.<p>After six days stranded off the west coast of Wales, the <i>Sea Empress</i> was at last towed off the rocks. But the <b>oil tanker </b>had already leaked half its 135,000-tonne load of crude oil, one of the half-dozen worst spillages ever.<p><ro>
<h2>Feeling high</h2>
<p><b>Pat Buchanan</b>, fire-breathing populist, won the New Hampshire Republicans' primary; ex-top-dog Bob Dole came second; Lamar Alexander, would-be new top dog, third. Mr Alexander said Mr Dole should quit the race because he was out of ideas; Mr Dole said Mr Alexander should quit because he was out of money. Bill Clinton easily won the Democrats' vote. Now on to Arizona and the South.<p>A survey of <b>illicit</b> <b>drugs</b> showed that their use among American teenagers is rising; that only 36% of teenagers admit to being frightened of drugs (47% last year); and that an increasing number say " being high feels good".<p>In <b>Cuba</b>, the government banned a planned meeting of the pro-democracy Concilio Cubano and arrested many activists.<p><ro>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<h2>Back to the fold</h2>
<b>Saddam Hussein's</b> two sons-in-law returned with their wives to Iraq from their brief self-exile in Jordan. Iraq's opposition-in-exile had decided the men had too much blood on their hands to be acceptable; and Mr Hussein had offered pardon.<p>Iraqi and <font size=-1>UN</font> envoys finished their first technical negotiation on an <b>oil-for-food deal</b>.Mr Hussein now has to decide whether to press on.<p>Israel's Labour Party narrowly defeated a Likud proposal that would have made a change to <b>Jerusalem's</b> current status virtually impossible. This did not mean, insisted Labour, that it would actually allow any change.<p><b>Qatar</b> said it had foiled an armed bid to reinstate its ex-ruler, ousted by his son, the present ruler, while he was on a visit to Switzerland last June.<p>Saudi Arabia's <b>King Fahd</b> took back the powers he had passed to Prince Abdullah.<p><b>Zaire's</b> government said it would take fresh steps to get rid of Rwandan refugees, accusing Rwanda's government of reluctance to help.<p>The <font size=-1>UN</font> tribunal on genocide has indicted two <b>Rwandan Hutus</b>. The two, a former militia leader and a mayor, have been held in Zambian jails since their arrest last year at the request of the tribunal.<p>The <font size=-1>UN</font> expressed alarm at goings-on in <b>Somalia</b>. New food shortages look likely and politics remains chaotic.<p><ro>
<h2>More ministers go</h2>
As <b>India's bribery scandal </b>continued to widen, four more government ministers resigned; three others had quit earlier. They are among more than 100 government and opposition politicians and civil servants whose names appear in the diary of a currency dealer charged with money-laundering.<p>The Philippine government claimed that <b>Chinese navy maps </b>were found in a pirate ship after a gun battle. Piracy in the South China Sea has been blamed on "rogue units" of the Chinese navy.<p>The ruling <b>Bangladesh </b>Nationalist Party won most parliamentary seats in a general election. But, deterred by an opposition boycott and a general strike, only about 15% of the electorate voted.<p>America is offering to move part of its air base in <b>Okinawa </b>to another site in Japan. Okinawa's local government had asked the Americans to leave, following the rape of a Japanese girl by American soldiers.<p><ro>
<h2>Happy holidays</h2>
<p>A coincidence of Chinese new year (it's the year of the rat), Carnival, and the end of Ramadan probably meant that a record number of people were on <b>holiday </b>at some point this week. A rough <i>Economist </i>estimate puts the figure at at least 3 billion.<p><p>

<h2>Togetherness</h2>
<p>(<a href="wtwimg1.gif">See chart</a>)<br>The French government has asked <b>Dassault Aviation</b>, which makes defence aircraft, and <b>A&eacuterospatiale</b>, a partner in Airbus Industrie, to create a single aerospace group within two years. The government also said it would privatise <b>Thomson</b>, a consumer and defence-electronics group; Marcel Roulet, ex-head of France T&eacutel&eacutecom, is to replace Alain Gomez as Thomson's chairman.<p>Britain's <b>Thorn EMI</b> announced that it would split its music and rental operations into two quoted companies. It said that in the nine months to December pre-tax profits, minus exceptionals, rose 29% to &#163;429m ($680m). The music side, largely <font size=-1>EMI</font>, a big record company, is valued after the demerger at &#163;5.8 billion; Thorn, which includes America's Rent-a-Center network and Britain's Radio Rentals, at &#163;1.8 billion.<p><b>CompuServe</b>'s parent is to spin off the successful on-line computer service mainly to shareholders, with less than 20% being offered to the public. Some of <font size=-1>H&R</font> Block's shareholders reckon the value of CompuServe--4.3m subscribers and growing--is not showing up in its parent's share price.<p><b>CUC International</b>, a big American consumer marketing group, is broadening its range in the electronic marketplace, where last year it launched Shoppers Advantage on the Internet, to include education and games. Now it is spending $2.2 billion to buy Davidson &amp; Associates, a maker of educational and entertainment software, and Sierra On-Line, a computer-games software firm.<p>Britain's <b>Grand Metropolitan </b>is bringing in an American to take charge of its poorly performing drinks division. John Keenan, who is retiring from the food division of Philip Morris, is the first outsider to be brought in at board level for 20 years.<p><p><b>BET</b>, a business-services firm, rejected a &#163;1.8 billion ($2.8 billion) hostile bid from <b>Rentokil</b>, a rival pest-control and office-services group, saying that Rentokil's plans were muddled. Most analysts nevertheless expect the bid to succeed, though Rentokil may have to raise its offer.<p><b>WPP Group</b> became the first company in the marketing-services industry to declare what looks likely to be a series of record profits for 1995. Exceeding the market's expectations, pre-tax profits rose by a third to &#163;113.7m ($179.5m), with revenues up 9% to &#163;1.6 billion.<p>America lodged an appeal against a ruling from the <b>World Trade Organisation</b> that had accused it of unfair discrimination against petrol imports from Brazil and Venezuela.<p>Russia dismissed its top <b>diamond-trade</b> official, Yevgeny Bychkov, just as he was reopening talks with De Beers Consolidated Mines of South Africa about the terms on which Russia supplies the De Beers cartel that dominates the world diamond market.<p><ro>
</td><td width=5%></td><td valign=top width=30%>
<h2>State aids</h2>
<p>Germany's largest shipbuilder, <b>Bremer Vulkan</b>, which is likely to declare a loss of DM1 billion ($700m) for 1995, sought protection from creditors in order to avoid bankruptcy. Its woes mounted when the European Commission found that DM600m meant for improving Bremer Vulkan's east German yards had been used elsewhere in the group, and demanded that the money be returned to its original purpose. Around 23,000 jobs are at risk.<p>In a shake-up at a leading Swedish bank controlled by the powerful Wallenberg family, Peter Wallenberg and two other directors are to step down from <b>Skandinaviska Enskilda Banken</b> in April. The bank is still recovering from massive losses run up in the 1980s.<p>There were ructions at <b>Fiat</b> on the eve of the expected departure of its chairman, Gianni Agnelli. The chief operating officer of the Italian car maker, Giorgio Garuzzo, was removed, apparently after falling out with Cesare Romiti, the firm's chief executive.<p><ro>
<h2>Fragile rand</h2>
Despite central-bank intervention, the <b>South African rand </b>plunged to a record low of 4.03 to the dollar before pulling back slightly. Panic began after unfounded rumours circulated about Nelson Mandela's health and about an easing of foreign-exchange controls.<p>Britain's <b>National Westminster Bank</b> is to pay the financially embarrassed Indosuez of France &#163;472m ($729m) for its 75% stake in <b>Gartmore</b>, a leading British fund manager with &#163;25 billion under its control. The combined firm would be Britain's fourth-largest fund manager, with some &#163;83 billion under management.<p>NatWest also declared pre-tax profits for 1995 up 10% to &#163;1.75 billion ($2.76 billion). But with <b>Eurotunnel </b>poised to renegotiate its vast burden of debt, the bank, which has some &#163;250m in outstanding loans to the Channel tunnel operator, took a &#163;101m bad-debt provision, widely assumed to relate to loans to Eurotunnel.<p><p>(<a href="wtwimg2.gif">See chart</a>)<br>Two French mammoths returned to profit. <b>Groupe Bull</b>, a computer maker, made money for the first time in years, recording a net profit of FFr306m ($61.4m) in 1995 after a 1994 loss of FFr1.96 billion.

<h1>Fresh light on primary colours</h1>
<p><b>Pat Buchanan, a right-wing populist, won the New Hampshire primary. Is the system of presidential primaries good for American democracy?</b></p>

EVERY four years, candidates hoping to stand for the American presidency can be found shivering outside factory gates in the New Hampshire snow, fondling pigs in Iowa or joining old folks' singalongs in Florida. By performing such antics, state by wearying state, they hope to attract delegates to their cause and hence earn the Republican or Democratic presidential nomination at a party convention in August.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;America's primary season, which began this week in New Hampshire, is a bizarre ritual to brave in preparation for the most powerful job in the world. No other country has anything like it. A British Conservative is chosen to lead his party by an old-boy club of other members of parliament. Candidates for the German chancellery are picked before each election by a conference of party members, but there are no elections to the conference nor are delegates mandated to vote for particular candidates. The French and Russian candidates must win some support from voters first: in France they need the backing of 500 elected officials (such as mayors); in Russia, they must collect a million signatures; otherwise, candidates choose themselves by offering their candidacy directly to the electorate.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No big democracy has America's combination of mass voting and a party slate. (Last year, France's Gaullist party thought about holding primaries but abandoned the idea because it could not decide who should vote, or who would foot the bill.) No big democracy forces incumbents to defend themselves so vigorously against rivals in their own party. No other country permits waves of popular opinion to determine who represents parties to voters.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The features which make the American primary system so distinctive are controversial. Critics condemn the primaries as a chaotic and degrading way of winnowing out candidates; so degrading, they claim, that it puts off well-qualified people. The process, they add, pushes peculiar states such as New Hampshire to prominence while ignoring larger, more representative ones. It undermines the moderating influence of party elders and, because of low turnouts, leaves politics vulnerable to extremists, producing presidential candidates supported by sectional interests rather than the mass of ordinary voters.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor, say critics, is the system as democratic as it once was; big money plays an increasing (and, in their view, distorting) role. The sheer number of primaries means the election campaign drags on and on, producing voter fatigue long before the poll that really matters in November. Above all, the critics claim, the primary system damages the eventual nominee because he must endure months of bitter public criticism from his own side before he ever faces opponents from the other. This not only weakens him as a candidate but also damages his party by magnifying divisions that might otherwise lie dormant.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Supporters of the primary system reply that this supposedly chaotic and degrading system goes with the grain of American democracy, with all its populism and egalitarianism. It allows ordinary Americans to pick not just their representatives but their candidates, too. And not just to pick them: to talk to them, impress their worries on them, see them break a sweat.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Moreover, say the system's supporters, primaries work better than you might expect. Though they appear, at the early stages, to be vulnerable to extremists, they usually deliver, at the end of a long procedure, nominees who are widely known and widely approved of. The primary ritual means that voters judge candidates on performance; so, while money matters, it is not everything. Primaries are less corrupt than their alternatives. If they are exhausting (which they are), then that is no bad way to discern which candidates have the stamina to do the world's most demanding job. And if they are chaotic and parochial (which they also are), that is the nature of democracy in a country as sprawling and headstrong as America.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So who is right? Are primaries, on balance, helping or harming American democracy? And are they getting better or worse at what they do? The trail of discovery is as long and winding as the campaign trail itself.
</p><p><b>Against conventional wisdom</b></b>
<br>The primary system was set up in response to dissatisfaction with the smoke-filled rooms of old. Before the early years of this century, you cultivated party bosses and their friends in big business; they pushed you, if you were lucky, to the presidency. Deals were done in back rooms; no need to consult the plebs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first modern-looking primary was held in Oregon in 1910. By 1916, after Teddy Roosevelt and his Bull Moose Party had challenged the Republican establishment (in an uprising which eventually earned Roosevelt the largest number of votes for a third party until Ross Perot in 1992), 26 states had introduced primaries.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the next half century, there was little change. In 1968, more than half the votes cast by delegates at the famously anarchic Democratic convention in Chicago were still controlled by party bosses. But now 39 states have primaries, and they have become the essential first stage in the American electoral process. Even unopposed incumbents, such as Bill Clinton this year, must dutifully slog through them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The first effect of the extension of the primary system has been to reduce the role of the party convention, once the crucial first step in the election campaign. In the past, party conventions were places where delegates were (sometimes literally) fought over. Now, the primaries produce the nominee, and the convention merely crowns him. Bill Clinton attracted 2,511 delegates during the 1992 primary season, 366 more than he needed. George Bush, for the Republicans, got 80% of the delegates.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Actually, conventions may not always be redundant even now. In 1980 there was a wild attempt to draft Senator Edward Kennedy at the Democratic convention, even though he had lost to Jimmy Carter in the primaries. And many a Republican has been dreaming of a scene this year in which Bob Dole, Pat Buchanan and Lamar Alexander go to the convention with equal numbers of delegates, and the deadlock is broken by the arrival of the <font size=-1>US</font> cavalry in the form of General Colin Powell, riding triumphantly to nomination. But even in such a case, the primaries would still have served a purpose, showing that, in the end, no candidate was sufficiently appealing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For the most part, however, the days of arm-twisting brokered conventions are gone. No longer are groups of delegates " floating" or "for sale". No longer will conventions go on, as did the 1924 Democratic one, for 17 days and an amazing 103 ballots. The disappearance of such spectacles, though reducing the entertainment value of politics, has made the process of picking candidates more open and democratic, and somewhat more predictable. Whatever else might be said against the primary system, this achievement at least should be chalked up to its credit.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But, say the system's critics, even if the convention system was bad, it is still wrong to pretend that it has been replaced by a nationwide campaign of 39 primaries. In reality, conventions have been largely replaced by just one or two primary polls--and pretty peculiar ones at that.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Think back over the careers of America's most famous modern politicians, and a surprising number will be found to have been made, or broken, in a couple of cold weeks at the beginning of February. In the 1952 New Hampshire primary, Dwight Eisenhower defeated Robert Taft, marking the first time a primary had shown its potential to upset a candidate anointed by party bosses; in the Democratic poll that same day, Harry Truman was defeated, and decided not to stand for re-election.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1968, Lyndon Johnson abandoned hopes of re-election after almost losing the 1968 New Hampshire primary to Eugene McCarthy, an anti-Vietnam campaigner. In the same state in 1972, Ed Muskie stood weeping on a flat-bed truck with the snow whitening his hair; his defeat led directly to the rise of George McGovern, another anti-Vietnam-war candidate whose radical programme alienated voters and returned Nixon to power. In 1968, the Republicans suffered a comparable fate when Barry Goldwater came from the far right of the party to capture the nomination after doing unexpectedly well in New Hampshire. In short, as "Primary Colours", the anonymous novel that is now Washington <font size=-1>DC</font>'s favourite bedside reading, puts it: "Folks up here [New Hampshire] don't mess around. They think it's their patriotic duty to choose a president for all the rest of us pathetic redneck shitheels."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The extraordinary influence of New Hampshire is controversial. No state may be called typical of America, but New Hampshire seems even less representative than most. It is small-town and relatively rural; it is strongly conservative, and has fewer taxes than almost any other state. Issues that catch fire there (this year, the flat tax) may give no thrill to westerners or southerners. And the state has a strong rebellious streak: it likes to make up its mind late, confound the wise, and go for outsiders. Party leaders view it with trepidation. Is this a good place to invest with such influence?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Actually, its power is overstated. Defeat there will not necessarily sink a well-prepared candidate with a good track record. Mr Clinton was beaten in New Hampshire by Paul Tsongas, a senator from Massachusetts; but because he clung on despite revelations of dalliance and draft-dodging, he did well enough to sweep his native South in the next set of primaries.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Conversely, a candidate who has not done his homework, has not raised enough money, is lackadaisical or prone to gaffes, will find his weakness glaringly exposed. This would happen anywhere, and is not connected with any issues or ideology that New Hampshire happens to favour. It is a matter of organisation and a man's internal fortitude: that "fire in the belly" that candidates love to talk about.
</p><p><b>Vote early, vote often</b>
<br><ro>That said, in so far as New Hampshire gets the campaign off to a peculiar start, the peculiarity is growing. Ironically, this is occurring as a result of attempts by other states to share New Hampshire's limelight.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Because early votes are vital, Arizona and Delaware have moved their primaries up to February, though New Hampshire has kept pole position. "Caucuses" (soundings of party members, as in Louisiana on February 6th), or "straw polls" (presidential preference votes, not attached to winning delegates, as in Alaska on January 29th) have been invented to steal a march on New Hampshire. Victory in both votes helped give Mr Buchanan momentum.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;More significantly, other states have advanced the dates of their primaries to follow soon after New Hampshire's and this so-called "front-loading" of the calendar is the most important single change to the American primary system in recent years. It has so compressed the primary schedule--at least in the biggest and delegate-heavy states--that, by April Fool's Day, almost all the delegates will have been selected. The vital primaries now come so thick and fast that there is no chance to pause or regroup between them. So if you do badly in New Hampshire, there is less time to recoup lost ground. Just as important, the influence of money has grown.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Traditionally, the joy of New Hampshire was that it required "retail politics": knocking on doors, talking to the people. This sort of campaigning is relatively inexpensive and allows lesser-known, poorer candidates to perform on an equal footing with better-known, richer ones. The bigger, money-devouring states (especially California, where campaigning has to be done on television), used to be further down the calendar, allowing more chance for underdogs to gather funds on the back of respectable performances elsewhere. Now California (on March 26th) comes barely a month after New Hampshire; and a man without at least $5m to spend simply cannot make the running there.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This reduction in the role of "retail politics" seems a discouraging development because it is a step away from the face-to-face characteristics that admirers of primaries claim to be one of the system's main virtues. It might also prevent poor candidates from entering the race at all.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet the first argument is odd. Face-to-face meetings are a way of getting information about candidates. Now, television is usurping that role. Television may provide different sorts of information and may be susceptible to manipulation, but it surely adds hugely to the volume of information about candidates. The second worry seems not to be justified either. This year's Republican field is as big as ever. There were ten hopefuls at the start, including six no-hopers. The compression of the primaries may have put off more cerebral types--Bill Bennett, Jack Kemp and conceivably Colin Powell; but the truth seems to be that if people really want the job, they will run despite the indignities.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The real importance of money in the primaries is, in any case, debatable. To get that vital early boost, Steve Forbes, a billionaire, spent $15m of his own money. To counter him, Mr Dole diverted $1.8m from campaigning funds for the south and west. Both did badly in New Hampshire.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A large wad of money is clearly vital. But a deluge of money for advertising does not seem to be cost-effective. That said, the ever-larger sums spent on primaries may hurt the system in one way. Every candidate this year has been drawn into a spiral of early spending. This means that some will fall out sooner than they might otherwise have done and the survivor will limp, short of cash, into the main election campaign.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What about the final accusation: that primaries are liable to throw up candidates who cannot win a nationwide election? Mr Buchanan's success gives Republican managers cause to worry for just this reason.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Primaries generally get a low (and declining) turnout. In 1992, the average for all primaries was 30% of registered voters. Among that low share will be disproportionate numbers of single-issue or fringe voters. The religious right has dogged the Republican primary trial this year, hence the surge for Mr Buchanan, even though his message--anti-immigrant, protectionist, anti-abortion, anti-gay--is not one most "ordinary" Republicans support. Hence, too, the drift to the right among moderate rivals chasing him for delegates.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Embarrassing as this may be for party bosses, they are not powerless in the face of it. The Democrats, especially, have fiddled with the rules since the 1970s in an attempt to avoid the nomination of unelectable "liberals" such as Mr McGovern or Walter Mondale, Jimmy Carter's vice-president. In 1984 they changed many of their primaries to caucuses, which are easier for party elders to control. In 1992, when they had a more moderate candidate in Mr Clinton, they changed the rules back again.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Tinkering does not always work. In 1988 southern Democrats invented (and the Republicans quickly copied) the idea of a southern regional primary, "Super Tuesday", which was meant to block the path of a liberal north-easterner (Michael Dukakis, governor of Massachusetts) in favour of a southern conservative, Al Gore of Tennessee. In the event, Mr Gore failed, and Mr Dukakis went on to lose the general election. But though the intervention of party elders can backfire, the front-loading of the primary calendar has helped them in their struggle to influence the primaries. The system now demands ever-earlier and better organisation, so the anointing power of parties has become more important. Mr Clinton in 1992 and (for what it is worth) Mr Dole in 1996 both went into the primary season with the weight of their parties behind them. In previous seasons, such backing would have waited until the convention. Now the elders dare not wait so long.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In San Diego in August, during the party convention, the Republican National Committee has promised to review this year's primary season to see if it can be "improved"--presumably in ways the elders approve of. What might these improvements be? Regional primaries have become popular: not only Super Tuesday (this year, on March 12th) but also a "Yankee primary" of the New England states (New Hampshire excepted) on March 5th. Regional primaries might help the party give a favourite son a boost on his home turf (though, as Mr Gore found, there is no guarantee of this).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One last suggestion is sometimes heard: a national primary, in which registered voters of all parties could vote on a single day. Such a primary would require an orgy of nationwide televised advertising by all candidates lasting for months. And, since the sums available from public finances would not go far in such conditions, a national primary would tie the fates of candidates to the party bosses almost as tightly as in the old days.
</p><p><b>In their primary?</b></b>
<br>In the end, then, the primary system looks likely to survive in something like its current form. States like it; potent myths of democracy surround it. Nor are these merely myths. Primaries force candidates to give an account of themselves in the flesh, to listen to what worries voters (which is not always what politicians think) and to see the country they wish to represent.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As a way of picking candidates, primaries may be less efficient than the smoke-filled chambers of old. But because they are less corruptible, the result is more likely to be accepted. Even if they produce a maverick--if, say, they deliver Mr Buchanan to the hustings--that would not necessarily be reason for saying the system is rotten; rather, it is grounds for saying the system is reflecting a substantial part of public opinion and that those who disapprove need to respond with their own voting power. It is their very democratic qualities that make the primaries such a struggle, torment and mess. And this uncomfortable trade-off, in primary elections as in so much else, is one America will simply have to live with.

<h1>Digesting New Hampshire</h1>
<p><font size=1>MANCHESTER</font></p>BOB LEVINE and Craig Benson are a classic American success story. They started their computer-networking business in a garage 13 years ago. Since then, Cabletron Systems has grown into a company with 5,600 employees and an annual revenue of more than $1 billion, 29% of it earned abroad. " Free trade is the best thing that ever happened to this company," Mr Benson told a rally for Bob Dole at Cabletron's factory in Rochester on the day before the New Hampshire primary. "We're not afraid to kick anybody's ass around the world."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What better setting for Mr Dole to contrast his view of the economy with Pat Buchanan's protectionism? But he blew it. "I didn't realise that jobs and trade and what makes America work would become a big issue in the last few days of this campaign," the Senate majority leader admitted.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The impression that Mr Dole is hopelessly out of touch with the real world helps to explain his failure in New Hampshire on February 20th. Not only was he unable to squash the challenge from Lamar Alexander, the ex-governor from Tennessee, who won 23% of the vote, just four points behind him. He also lost to Mr Buchanan, despite support from almost the entire New Hampshire Republican establishment. The Dole people blame the damage done by millions of dollars of negative advertisements from Steve Forbes, who hurt Mr Dole without helping himself (the flat-tax fanatic finished fourth, with 12% of the vote). But the bigger problem was Mr Dole's inability to generate any real enthusiasm about his candidacy--in stark contrast to the raw energy of the Buchanan campaign.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Buchanan has few assets save his fame as a televised political pugilist and the fire of his words. He writes his own advertisements, his sister manages his campaign, an army of volunteers man his phone banks. He visibly loves every minute of it, as well he might. In the past three weeks he has won in Alaska, won in Louisiana, come a strong second in Iowa and now stormed to victory in New Hampshire, with 28% of the vote. The barons of the Republican establishment are in a panic, he told a rally in Nashua last Sunday; the peasants are coming.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;However far the Buchanan insurgency goes, it has already shown that many Americans are still anxious and angry, even in successful New Hampshire, where unemployment is down to 3.3%. Mr Buchanan's hatred of trade agreements such as <font size=-1>NAFTA</font> and <font size=-1>GATT</font>, and his fusillades against transnational corporations "with no loyalty to our country", resonate with blue-collar workers and, especially, with those earning under $30,000 a year. He excites nationalists with his rhetoric about America's sovereignty. Add to that his Catholic fundamentalism, and you have a potent mix.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His devoted followers give the impression that they would jump over a cliff for Pat. Unlike the other candidates, they explain, he is honest and speaks from the heart, a real leader. At their packed victory celebration, amid the chanting, the drinking and the rocking-and-rolling, a construction worker called Eric, wearing Barry Goldwater and George Wallace buttons as well as his "Buchanan for President" badge, describes how he is sick of being told that if you were blue-collar you had to be a Democrat. Jack, an out-of-work pipe-fitter, stressed jobs. "If Japan wants to send a car over here, they've got to buy one. One for one. It's as simple as that."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In short, the populist Mr Buchanan stands for something. He is the only one among the three candidates now seriously in the chase who can plausibly lend his name to an "-ism". "This is a victory for a cause," he told his supporters on Tuesday night, after his out-of-tune rendition of "God Bless America".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But is it really a Republican cause? Mr Buchanan's design for a wall round America's economy is at odds with the free-trade mainstream of the party, and closer to the ideas of the Democratic left. His intolerance scares people. If he won the nomination, Republican big-wigs fear they would lose not only the presidential election but the House of Representatives as well.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Buchanan will almost certainly not win. True, since 1952 the Republican winner in New Hampshire has gone on to the nomination every time except in 1964, when Henry Cabot Lodge took the primary but Barry Goldwater became the Republican nominee. But Mr Buchanan will have trouble expanding much beyond his devoted base of supporters--his share of the vote in New Hampshire was nine points below the 37% he won against President George Bush there four years ago. The stop-Buchanan majority in the party seems certain to prevail in the end.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The trouble is that the majority forces are split. Had Senator Richard Lugar not taken his 5% of the vote in New Hampshire, for example, Mr Dole would probably have won. As it is, although a couple of minor candidates are now withdrawing, the race is turning into a Republican nightmare, with the divisive Mr Buchanan attracting the headlines and the anti-Buchananites fighting among themselves.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;How long will the nightmare last? From now on, the nature of the race changes, as it moves on from small-state retail politics to an expensive contest in more than 30 primaries within a month. Going into this frenzy of voting, all three of the main contenders have serious weaknesses.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Buchanan lacks money, he no longer enjoys the element of surprise and, his opponents claim, he has "no end-game". He will also face a surge of media scrutiny and attacks from his rivals. Already, a couple of senior people on his campaign have had their connections to racist groups exposed. In his commentaries over the years Mr Buchanan himself has left a trail of bigotry that invites exploration.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;According to Mr Buchanan, for example, Martin Luther King was "one of the most divisive men in contemporary history". The only people wanting the Gulf war were "the Israeli defence ministry and its amen corner in the United States". The central objection to the flood of illegal immigrants is that "they are not English-speaking white people from Western Europe". Promiscuous homosexuals "appear literally hell-bent on Satanism and suicide". Women are "simply not endowed by nature" with capitalist ambition.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Alexander will repeat ad nauseam the contrast between Mr Buchanan's "wrong ideas", Mr Dole's absence of ideas and his own "fresh ideas" (see <A HREF="am3.html">Lexington</a>). But he has emptied his coffers and needs to persuade Republican money-givers to cough up several million dollars in a hurry. His name is not even on the ballot in New York, Pennsylvania and parts of Illinois, making his quest for a majority of delegates that much harder.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All of which leaves the damaged, derided Mr Dole still--just--the likeliest eventual Republican winner. He has stumbled in New Hampshire, as he did in 1988. But the logistics of the next stage of the campaign favour him. He has $6.5m in the bank and a formidable number of governors working for him in the mainly winner-take-all primaries ahead.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even if Mr Dole does win by attrition, it will not remove the Buchanan problem for the Republicans. Mr Buchanan is already influencing their agenda and he will be a force to be reckoned with at the party's convention in San Diego. He has once again shown that there is a market in America for populist politics, a market third parties under the likes of Ross Perot and Ralph Nader are eyeing eagerly. All the more reason for one person to be almost as delighted as Mr Buchanan himself with the outcome in New Hampshire: Bill Clinton

<p><b>Mobility in America</b></p>
<h2>Up, down and standing still</h2>


<p>ONE of America's most cherished ideas about itself is that, with enough pluck and hard work, anyone can achieve the ranch-style house with the two-car garage. A whole literature, starting with the Horatio Alger stories, spells out this belief. Yet now Pat Buchanan wins votes by claiming that for ordinary folks this notion of progress is over. Is he right?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Americans move both up and down the income ladder about as fast as they have in the past. Think of the country as being divided by income into five groups of equal size, with the poorest in the first group and the richest in the fifth. If you keep track of people of working age (between 25 and 55), within five years almost half will have moved up or down by at least one group, according to research by economists at Syracuse University. (<a href="amimg2.gif">See chart</a>).<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Syracuse trio have charted these economic mobility rates back to 1970: the results have barely budged. And with a million immigrants a year taking predominantly lower-paid work, those settled in the United States are likely to move up, while newcomers fill the bottom quintile--for a time. Newer figures from the Census Bureau extend the findings into the 1990s. Measuring year-to-year mobility between 1984 and 1992, the agency found that only once, in the recession year of 1990-91, did more families see their incomes fall than see them rise.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mobility seems to be highest among middle-income Americans, but it is brisk for poorer ones, too. According to the Census Bureau, only 5% of people were below the poverty line (roughly the bottom 15% of Americans, measured by income) for each month of 1991 and 1992. Almost none of those employed full-time stayed poor for the whole period, a hint that those who get into work are likely to be able to pull themselves up and out of poverty.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nor is it true that the "baby-boomers" (those born between 1946 and 1961) are worse off than their parents were at the same age. A study by the Urban Institute found that in 1989 pre-tax incomes for now-adult baby-boomers were half as high again, adjusted for inflation, as their parents' incomes in 1960. Consumption was 27% higher, and rates of home ownership and unemployment were much the same.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So what are Americans so grumpy about? "I don't know," says Douglas Holtz-Eakin, one of the Syracuse researchers. "The statistical measures look good but the mood of the people is not."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One concern may be inequality. In 1979, America's richest 1% held 22% of the nation's wealth, according to Edward Wolff, an economist at New York University and author of "Top Heavy". By 1992, they held 42%. If you use a different measure that includes the value of consumer durables, pensions and benefits, the difference shrinks considerably, but the trend is still striking--and increasing. At the beginning of the Clinton presidency, the top 5% of earners took in 18.1% of income; now they take in more than 21%, an unprecedented rate of increase. The fact that inequality is increasing and mobility is not explains some of the current unAmerican angst.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;So does another figure. Few Americans resent the rich: most want to join them, if they get the chance. But median income, adjusted for inflation, grew only slightly during the 1980s, and fell every year between 1989 and 1993. The median household income is a bit less than it was in 1986. Mobility softens the blow for some: even if median wages are not rising, many individuals have seen their pay packets bulge. But remember that even in the most active quintiles, about 40% stay still.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even here, though, the reality may not be not quite so dismal. Although household income has scarcely risen, the number of households has grown sharply as students, singles and merry widows increasingly choose to live alone. Because families are smaller, the same income per family means more cash per head. And non-wage compensation, which includes pensions, health care and other benefits, has also increased steadily in real terms. Total compensation has therefore risen; but that is not the same as having cash in hand.
</p><p><b>The poverty trap</b></b>
<br>And, even when they work, some Americans cannot keep the wolf from the door. In 1977, 5.9% of workers were poor; by 1993 it was up to 7.4%. The percentage of poor families with children has risen by half, to 12%.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There are two reasons for this. One is the increase in single-parent households. Lone mums, and their children, are the most likely to be poor, and they stay poor longer. This is not a problem the federal government can do much about: if mothers were better at picking fathers, and fathers better at taking care of their children, America would have many fewer children living in poverty. The other reason for the rise in working poverty is that the average hourly wage for the lowest-paid 10% of workers has fallen, in real terms, since 1979. That pushes more into poverty; arguably, it is the price America pays to find jobs, and a start on the ladder, for people with few or no skills. The earned-income tax credit, now under threat from Republicans, means that low-wage workers with children receive more income, but they are still far from joining the middle class.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Buchanan may be right to suspect that climbing into the middle class is getting harder. The University of Michigan's Panel Study of Income Dynamics, which has tracked the same families since 1968, has found that although 65% of white American men who turned 21 before 1980 had reached middle-class earnings (defined as twice the poverty level) by the age of 30, only 47% of those who turned 21 after 1980 had managed to do so. For blacks, the respective percentages were 29% and 19%.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The less educated, it is clear, are finding well-paid jobs harder to come by. For younger people with a high-school diploma or less, only 32% reached the <font size=-1>PSID</font> middle-class standard by the time they were 30; for those who turned 21 before 1980, almost half did. Also using the <font size=-1>PSID</font> data, Greg Duncan of the University of Michigan found that before 1980 more than a third of low-income families joined the middle class over a five-year period; after 1980, only a quarter did.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;White-collar insecurity is another new concern. The effect of corporate "down-sizing" may have been exaggerated, but many middle managers have been hurt. If they wish to re-enter the market, these people generally have to accept lower pay. The average worker re-entering the job market between 1990 and 1992 took a pay cut of around 20%. No feel-good factor there.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Even if things are not getting worse for Americans, they are, at best, improving much more slowly than in the past. Because Americans love progress, this can feel like failure. The chief reason is that the education premium in America is getting bigger, widening income distribution and feeding blue-collar anxiety. America still has its Horatio Alger stories--but these days the heroes start by going to college.

<p><b>LEXINGTON</b></p><table border=6><tr><td>


<h2>The man who keeps on going</h2>

<p>IN THE summer of 1994 Lamar Alexander explained over a quiet dinner in Portland, Maine, how he was putting together the basis for a presidential bid. It was a methodical approach. The former education secretary and two-term Tennessee governor was driving across America to take the national pulse. Once a month he was hosting a televised " Republican Neighbourhood Meeting", narrowcast to party activists nationwide, to build a network of supporters and test his ideas. He sensed that, come 1996, Republicans would be looking for someone of Bill Clinton's generation who was not a Washington insider.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He spent the next 18 months doggedly following his plan--raising money, building an organisation, shaking hands in Iowa and New Hampshire--even though most of the time he was little more than a blip in the polls. Better-known candidates fell by the wayside, but Mr Alexander kept going, like the indefatigable bunny in battery advertisements. Then, this month, the long-promised surge started to happen.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Having scrambled into the front-running threesome in the Iowa caucuses, this week he found himself surrounded by cameras in New Hampshire, talking to overflowing audiences and emerging with 23% of the votes, only four points behind Bob Dole. Suddenly, the plaid persona who was in danger of becoming a joke is a canny candidate with a plausible chance of becoming president. How has he done it?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It has been a triumph of Lamarketing. Mr Alexander identified his niche and packaged himself to perfection. If Lamar were a product on a supermarket shelf, with "NEW!" stamped all over its folksy red-and-black wrapping, it would be the safe-looking brand you turn to after rejecting the stale or risky alternatives. He advertises himself as "a little bit different", an outsider from the "real world", fit (unlike old Bob Dole) to be "the first president of the next century" and capable (unlike any other Republican) of besting slick Bill Clinton in debate. Remember your ABC, he tells voters in his soothing voice and with his telegenic ease: Alexander Beats Clinton.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;He has a good story to tell of his record as Tennessee's governor; his success in attracting Japanese investment offers a cheerful antidote to Buchananite protectionism. Mr Alexander lacks the spark to fire his audiences, but he warms them with talk of a "rising, shining America", with country music and with his renditions at the piano of "Alexander's Ragtime Band" and "The Tennessee Waltz". As he talks to voters--right hand reaching out, left hand casually in pocket, microphone clipped to his tie, head tilted to express concern and ever ready to smile--he has one underlying message: "Meet Mr Feelgood."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Look inside the packaging, however, and you discover a Lamar who is not quite as advertised. His outsider image, to start with, is phoney. A lawyer, Mr Alexander went to Washington as legislative assistant to Senator Howard Baker, graduated to the Nixon White House and later worked in the Bush cabinet. Now he blasts Washington and calls for the abolition of the Education Department; he was strangely silent on such themes when he was in Washington and running the department he now wants to kill.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;His connections helped Mr Alexander to raise his family's net worth from $151,000 in 1978 to perhaps $3m now. With his surge to serious status has come a surge of reporters' interest in his family finances. His wife, Honey, seems to share with Hillary Clinton a talent for turning small investments into large profits--a $320,000 profit, for example, on the $10,000 paid for shares in Whittle Communications. "If anything distinguishes Lamar Alexander's career as a public official," writes Charles Lewis in his gloriously detailed account of the 1996 candidates' finances and friendships, "The Buying of the President" (Avon), "it is how much that career has benefited Lamar Alexander."
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Alexander prides himself on running a positive campaign even while he politely trashes Mr Dole. He beams that he is the candidate with new ideas without offering any beyond a broad appeal for a return to civic virtue ("we should demand less from Washington, more from ourselves" ) and a handful of specific proposals that can generously be described as half-baked. He would substitute charitable giving for state welfare, set up a special branch of the armed services to patrol America's borders, agree with America's allies on burden-sharing around the world. But he offers few details. His crispest idea is the one that has the least chance of being approved by any Congress: returning to a citizen-legislature by cutting lawmakers' pay and sending them home to cool their heels for six months of the year.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;All this explains why nice Mr Alexander has his enemies. Journalists now subject him to the scrutiny he avoided in his stealthy rise. The Christian right thinks him a liberal. The libertarian right thinks the revolution is not safe in his slippery hands. Many Republicans want to see Ronald Reagan in their presidential nominee, but in Mr Alexander they see George Bush. Indeed, the Bush network is looming large in the race for the nomination. Texas, where George W. Bush is governor, is up for grabs now that Phil Gramm is out, and brother Jeb runs the party in Florida.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Like him or not, Mr Alexander is no longer underestimated. His formidable drive and strategic canniness have already taken him further than most people thought he would go. But, to go even further, he needs to raise big money, fast, and he must start winning primaries rather than coming in a feisty third. In the words of a song performed by a Nashville artist at Mr Alexander's rally in Derry last Sunday:<ul><font size=-1>It's a long, long way from the tips of my fingers
To the love hidden deep in your heart.</font></ul>

<p><b>The poor</b></p>
<h2>Consumers like the rest of us</h2>



<p>THE most wounding accusation made against Britain's Conservative era is that, while yuppies have benefited from rising salaries and cheaper cappuccino, poorer Britons have seen their standard of living deteriorate. Critics claim that social and economic disparities are greater in Britain than anywhere else in the European Union. Today, among similarly prosperous nations, Britain is uniquely harsh on its less-fortunate citizens.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is simply not the case, according to an analysis of household statistics in six western countries (America, Belgium, Britain, Germany, the Netherlands and Sweden) by the Luxembourg Income Study (<font size=-1>LIS</font>), an independent research organisation. The 20% of households in Britain with the lowest income fit well within the European fold.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In 1991, for example, the average working British household in the lowest fifth earned the equivalent of $14,773, or &#163;8,349 (before tax, after benefits, and based on purchasing power parity, which adjusts for exchange-rate distortions). This put poor Britons ahead of their counterparts in Sweden and America (calculating the same way); those in the Netherlands had the highest incomes, at $15,932. Non-working households had an income of $9,126, placing them ahead of those in Germany and Sweden, and close to those in America.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Overall, government policy makes no difference to the rankings. Poor Britons pay a lot of tax (the third-highest burden for working households, second-highest for non-working); but they also receive generous benefits. More than 90% of British homes in the lowest fifth received some kind of income-replacement benefit, more than in any other country except Sweden. On every basis--working households, non-working households, pre-tax earnings, post-tax earnings, with or without benefits--Britain's poor come third out of six in the <font size=-1>LIS</font> ranking.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Life has grown more comfortable for the bottom fifth in visible ways. There is enough disposable income to make televisions universal, washing machines ubiquitous and home computers not uncommon. Rates of ownership for all the items in the table have increased markedly during the Tory era. Housing standards have also improved. In each of 36 deprived areas of Britain surveyed by the London-based Policy Studies Institute, a think-tank, the percentage of households with more than one person to a room fell between 1981 and 1991 in all but one area, London's Tower Hamlets.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Finally, "mobility" is high: the members of the lowest fifth (and, indeed, the lowest tenth) change a lot each year. Climbing out of the lowest income quintile is not only possible, but a routine event. In January the Research Centre on Micro-Social Change, a group sponsored by the Economic and Social Research Council (<font size=-1>ESRC</font>), published a study entitled "Do the Poor Stay Poor?". It found that, of those in the bottom fifth in 1991, almost four out of ten had moved up to a higher income by 1992.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As you might expect, most of those moving out of the lowest level did not climb far. Also, the children of the lowest fifth are less likely than average to make it into the top ranks when they grow up. According to another study published last month, by the Institute for Fiscal Studies (<font size=-1>IFS</font>), 12% of the children born into the lowest fifth made it into the top fifth by the time they were 33; of those born in the top fifth, 34% managed to stay there. This is unfair, but hardly a portrait of a hopeless underclass. (<a href="brimg1.gif">See table</a>). <br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That is the good news. The bad news is that several trends are pushing gently in the wrong direction. Although the physical wretchedness of poverty may be declining--poorer Britons, remember, have nicer, better-equipped homes than ever--the spatial concentration of poverty is accelerating. When rules of entry to council estates changed in the 1970s, with need becoming the primary criterion, social indicators worsened. The estates have become more different from the rest of Britain than before: younger, poorer, more racially segregated, with twice the rate of unemployed and three times the proportion of lone parents. The middle class has moved out. As late as 1974, one in three Britons with incomes in the top 40% lived on a council estate. That figure is now next to nothing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This matters because, as the examples of America's inner cities and France's <i>banlieues</i> indicate, such areas tend to become self-perpetuating. Stigma means that business is reluctant to move in; working people move out as soon as they can. Public services suffer. Defeatism deepens.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Although there is considerable movement up (and therefore down) the income ladder, an increasingly intractable group is stuck at the bottom. One reason for this is the growing number of one-parent families, which account for 7% of Britain's households but more than a third of the lowest fifth. Six years after beginning to receive benefits, 78% of Britain's lone mothers are still on social assistance, compared with 24% of Americans, 20% of Germans and 58% of Canadians. The longer people are out of work, the less likely they are to find a job. So these women are not going to find it easy to find work even when their kids grow up.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The same problem afflicts the long-term unemployed. Britain has one of the <font size=-1>EU</font>'s lower unemployment rates. But almost four out of every ten unemployed Britons has been without a job for a year or more. Of the six countries surveyed by the Luxembourg Income Study, Britain (73.6%) and Belgium (76.5%) had, by far, the highest percentage of non-earners in the lowest 20%.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Evidently, the way out of the lowest fifth is through work: employment enables even the poorest of the poor to escape. Figures on what happens to the unemployed in the lower half of the bottom fifth prove the point. Households in that unfortunate position in 1991 accounted for a fifth of those who had escaped poverty altogether by 1992--someone in the household had found a job, or married someone in work. Doing neither means staying stuck.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Worse, the effect may stretch across generations. According to the <font size=-1>IFS</font>, sons of men who were unemployed for a week or more in the year their boys turned 16 were twice as likely to end up on the dole themselves. Other research shows that daughters from fatherless homes are more likely to become lone mothers. Although the growth of both groups seems to have stopped, they remain large (2.2m unemployed, 1.5m lone parents) and include many who, at best, are only intermittently connected to the world of work. And Britain has a greater proportion of children in the lowest fifth than any other country in the Luxembourg research.
</p><p><b>More or less equal</b></b>
<br>Moreover, inequality is increasing. In 1978, the bottom fifth took home almost 10% of the national income. By 1990 that was down to 7%, according to the <font size=-1>OECD</font>. Inequality in the 1980s increased faster in Britain than anywhere in Europe, though not as fast as in America. Tories say it is ridiculous to call the poor worse off because the rest of society grew richer. On the other hand, harsher forms of poverty, such as homelessness and temporary shelter, are more common. Real incomes in the bottom fifth have risen only 6% since 1979, less than for any other quintile--and that is before taking housing costs, which have risen in real terms, into account. Incomes actually fell for those likeliest to be in work (couples and childless single people) due to higher unemployment, fewer full-time jobs and higher housing costs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is a bleak picture--but perhaps an exaggerated one. Consumption among lower-income households is often considerably higher than reported income; the lowest fifth say they spend about &#163;23 a week more than they take in. That explains what many would regard as an extraordinary finding by Eurostat, the <font size=-1>EU</font>'s statistical agency: that Britain has narrowed the consumption gap between the top and bottom quarters of the population faster than any <font size=-1>EU</font> country (except Greece), even as inequality measured by incomes was rising. The link between income statistics and the standard of living is unreliable: transfers between family members, and the shadow economy, make a big difference.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;That is unlikely to calm those who see growing inequality as the scandalous failure of the Tory years. Services for the poor tend to decline into poor services, it is often said--which is why the Labour Party has long opposed selection in schools. Frank Field, a prominent Labour <font size=-1>MP</font> whom Tony Blair appears to heed, admits that there is "no general groundswell amongst middle-class groups for redistribution of wealth to the poor". Nevertheless, it is also true that the apparent growth of inequality has made many Britons uneasy. It is this uneasiness which Mr Blair has tried to address with his idea of the "stakeholder society". Finding policies which can reconcile concern over inequality with suspicion of the means to reduce it will be far more difficult.

<p><b>The economy</b></p>
<h2>January sales</h2>


TIPPED to be the "year of the consumer", 1996 is off to a slow start. January's inflation figures revealed the biggest monthly falls in the prices of clothes and shoes (5.6%) since 1921, and in household goods (3%) since records began in 1956. This provoked much talk of frantic price-cutting. The impression of empty shops and stationary merchandise seemed confirmed on February 21st when new figures showed that seasonally-adjusted retail sales were 0.6% lower in volume terms in January than in December.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Retailers need not despair. January's fall in sales followed a strong fourth quarter of 1995, when sales surged at an annual rate of 3.4%. Compared with January 1995, this January's retail sales were 2.3% higher. And, says David Mackie, an economist at J.P. Morgan, retail sales in January were hit by the two "roll-over" weeks on the National Lottery--the extra money gambled may have shaved as much as four-tenths of a percentage point off retail sales during the month, as consumers switched cash from small purchases. Very cold weather was a problem too: strikingly, sales did rise in "non-store retailing and repair", much of which is mail order.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The impression of widespread price-cutting is also wrong. Despite the falls in the prices of clothing and household goods, inflation excluding mortgage interest and indirect taxes was unchanged in January. The prices of personal goods, leisure services and motoring all rose.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is also less to the much-hyped supermarket wars than meets the eye. J. Sainsbury, for instance, launched its "January savers" with much fanfare: a mixture of discounts of up to 50% and buy-two-and-get-one-free deals on 100 basic items. However, according to Mike Conolly, Sainsbury's director of operational marketing, the cost was small because it merely concentrated the firm's usual discounts on fewer items.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Talk of fierce price competition due to the launch of various loyalty cards, such as the "Clubcard" introduced by Tesco last year, is also mistaken. These do reward the customer, perhaps by as much as 1% a year for a regular shopper. But many customers will receive less. And retailers reckon to regain much of the lost revenue by using the information generated by the card to aim special offers at likely takers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;There is no sign of a fall in retail profit margins: gross margins have risen from 14% to 18% over the past ten years. Such healthy margins may be the result of a lack of competition. A paper to be published on February 28th by London Economics, a consultancy (whose research has been sponsored by Tesco), disputes this, arguing that high margins reflect the need to pay for heavy capital investment which has raised the quality of service. Possibly. But if spending does accelerate this year, retailers may be able to push prices up, and the margins will be healthier still.

<p><b>Tanker disaster</b></p>
<h2>Sinking feelings</h2>

<p>BRITAIN may no longer rule the waves, but it leads the world in oil-tanker disasters. This week it increased its lead when the Liberian-registered <i>Sea Empress</i> spilled 65,000 tonnes of crude into the sea as it lay on the rocks off Milford Haven in Dyfed, Wales. Three of the world's six biggest tanker-spills have now occurred around the rocky coasts of Britain: France, America and Tobago have had one each. This has nothing to do with being a big oil producer in the North Sea; the wrecks were all delivering or passing through. Bad luck and geography matter more. The real debate is now over how Britain handles such spills.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Britain was introduced to this modern form of environmental disaster in 1967 when the <i>Torrey Canyon</i> ran aground off Land's End. Three years ago, off the Shetlands, the <i>Braer</i> broke up, spilling 85,000 tonnes of oil. On February 15th, the <i>Sea Empress</i> hit the rocks. Six days later, after repeated attempts to dislodge her in winds of up to 40 knots, she was refloated--but not before leaking twice as much oil as the <i>Exxon Valdez</i> did in 1989, causing $15 billion worth of damage to the Alaskan coast.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The fact that another tanker recently ran aground close to where the <i>Sea Empress </i>hit the rocks has added to the usual row that blows up after each wreck. The first tanker was one of the new double-hulled vessels, whereas the <i>Sea Empress</i> is one of the last single-hulled vessels to be built. The <i>Sea Empress</i> appears to have taken a wrong turn, but the real controversy is about what happened, or failed to happen, next.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The government is being criticised for not implementing the findings of the inquiry which followed the <i>Braer</i> disaster. It recommended that more big tugs should be laid on, to stop every tanker crisis turning into a disaster. The government did follow this recommendation to the extent of laying on one such tug in Shetland, and another in the south-west, close to the sites of previous disasters.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Critics say that this has been inadequate, and that tugs did not get to the stricken <i>Sea Empress</i> quickly enough. The longer a holed tanker sits on the bottom, the more difficult it becomes to dislodge it. Seawater fills the gap left by spilt oil, making it harder to get the vessel off the rocks. The government denies any lack of tugs.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Milford Haven is in a sheltered area, and is a refuge for rare birds and dolphins. Yet the <i>Braer</i> spill was less disastrous than first predicted. Strong winds dispersed its cargo of light oil, with little damage to wildlife. The <i>Sea Empress</i> was also carrying a light grade of oil. With luck, nature will quickly clean up humanity's mess.

<p><b>Higher-education inquiry</b></p>
<h2>Learning to pay</h2>

<p>AN INDEPENDENT inquiry into the future of the universities, announced in the House of Commons on February 19th, gets both the government and the Labour Party off a nasty hook. Neither of them wants to be first to admit that the only sensible way to meet the increasing cost of higher education is for students to stump up something themselves. The Liberal Democrats did just that, in a policy paper published the next day. But the two larger parties prefer to let the inquiry reach this conclusion for them, safely after the next election. The inquiry will look into all aspects of higher education. Yet its most pressing task is to find the fairest way to make students pay. Progress has already been made towards finding an answer.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The most promising proposal is to let students borrow to cover their living expenses and tuition from a " learning bank". On graduation, they would repay the loans through extra national-insurance contributions of perhaps 3-5% of their earnings. Interest would be charged on the loans at, say, a few percentage points above inflation.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Ideally, private investors would finance the loans, minimising the burden on public-sector borrowing. The banks refused to take part in the current, smaller-scale scheme for student loans, fearing the costs and the bad publicity incurred in chasing thousands of graduates for fairly small amounts of money. Using the national-insurance system would overcome this problem. Employers are obliged to deduct contributions from their workers' pay. Even self-employed people think twice about evading national-insurance payments because doing so also deprives them of their entitlement to some benefits.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Iain Crawford and Nicholas Barr of the London School of Economics, who are preparing detailed proposals for a graduate-repayment scheme, say it is not the banks but the life-assurance and pension funds who are the most suitable investors to finance student loans. These funds are designed to make long-term investments, and they are accustomed to making complex calculations such as the likely earnings, credit risks and life expectancies of graduates. There is already a market for securitised credit-card debts; student loans, in which the repayments are taken directly from pay packets, would be much less risky.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Messrs Crawford and Barr suggest that the learning bank could invite investors to make competitive bids for packages of, say, &#163;10m of student loans. Since a few graduates would never earn enough to repay their loans, or would try to dodge paying them, the investors would bid at a discount. The government would make up the shortfall, but would then face no further liability. The investors would get the rights to repayments on the whole &#163;10m in return for taking on the risks of non-payment.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For a market in student loans to succeed, says David Sutherland of Scottish Amicable Investment Managers, the repayments would have to be spread typically over 15 years. This would make the securitised loans similar to the long-dated gilts which funds like his are already used to buying in large quantities.

<p><b>Bang to rights</b> &nbsp;
The European Court of Human Rights said that the power exercised by British home secretaries to overrule court recommendations on how long young offenders should stay in jail was a violation of human rights.</p>
<p><b>Double standards</b> &nbsp;
A letter written by Andrew Smith, a shadow treasury minister, appeared to admit that the government's plans to cut the annual cost of the social-security system by &#163;1 billion were feasible, even though Labour had publicly denounced the cuts.</p>
<p><b>Less majesty</b> &nbsp;

<p><b>Deflated</b> &nbsp;
British Gas announced 1995 pre-tax profits of &#163;986m--down from &#163;1.3 billion in 1994--and admitted "a deterioration" in customer services. Labour attacked Richard Giordano, its chairman, for taking half his &#163;500,000 salary in dollars to avoid tax.</p>

<p><b>Careless</b> &nbsp;
The government dropped the term "care in the community" following repeated criticism that it meant abandoning the mentally ill. Its new policy slogan is "the spectrum of care" , emphasising that some patients will continue to be kept in mental hospitals.</p>
<p><b>Down the plughole</b> &nbsp;
It emerged that South West Water, many of whose customers have endured months of drought restrictions, allowed a billion gallons of water to pour into the sea, because of poor forecasting of demand.</p>
<p><b>Interesting</b> &nbsp;
Minutes of the January 17th meeting between Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, and Eddie George, governor of the Bank of England, showed that Mr George had preferred to wait a month before cutting interest rates. Mr Clarke cut them the next day.

<h2 align=center>Still hope for Ulster's peace</h2>

BOMBS bring a dreadful sort of clarity. The message behind the Irish Republican Army's bombing of London was unmistakable. When it unilaterally called an open-ended ceasefire 17 months ago, the <font size=-1>IRA</font> assumed that in return Sinn Fein, its political wing, would obtain a seat in all-party negotiations on Northern Ireland's future. Persuaded by a year of stalemate that the British did not intend to let Sinn Fein into all-party talks, the <font size=-1>IRA</font> set off a bomb in London on February 9th and then, six days later, it planted more bombs, paralysing much of central London. We are still here, the <font size=-1>IRA</font> was saying; and we can still be violent.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Indeed; the surprise is that anyone had ever doubted it. Yet they had; and that, in the end, could be the point that the bombs highlight most clearly. At the heart of the British government's policy since the 1994 ceasefire has lain the idea that terrorism in Northern Ireland had lost its energy, and with it the will to fight. The advantage thus gained could be pressed home by British and unionist demands that the terrorists must begin to hand over their weapons before Sinn Fein could be admitted to all-party talks. Although they did not share those demands, the Irish and American governments did share the basic assumption behind them. But that assumption was wrong. One way or another, terrorism will lurk in Ulster's shadows even if a political settlement is eventually reached. The task is to deprive it of popular support and thus to isolate it. And the resumption of the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s bombing campaign may have made that task easier.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most of all, the bombs have damaged Sinn Fein. Nationalists in Ireland, north and south of the border, share Sinn Fein's frustration with the intransigence of Ulster's unionists, and the British government's reluctance to over-ride them. But those same Irish nationalists are horrified at the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s bombing of London. " I was willing to believe that the <font size=-1>IRA</font> had ended the killing for good," John Bruton, Ireland's prime minister, told his parliament. "That act of faith has now been thrown back in my face." Ireland and Britain promptly cut off ministerial contacts with Sinn Fein, and demanded a restoration of the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s ceasefire.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;No one knows what the <font size=-1>IRA</font> intends. The London bombs could easily lead to a full-scale resumption of Ulster's 25-year-long conflict. But even if that is not the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s intention, its resort to violence is short-sighted. It demonstrates that the <font size=-1>IRA</font> is still willing to disregard the will of the vast majority of people in Northern Ireland, nationalist and unionist alike, who want the violence to end. The bombs also seem to confirm unionist accusations that, if Sinn Fein does not get its way at the negotiating table, the <font size=-1>IRA</font> will use bombs and bullets.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;And unionists are not the only ones who will now wonder whether dealing with Sinn Fein makes sense. Democratic politics is always complicated, and often slow. Mr Major may well have been delaying all-party talks, as Sinn Fein charges, in exchange for unionist support in the House of Commons, where the Conservative Party's slim majority has got even slimmer in recent months. But that does not justify the resumption of a war that Sinn Fein's own leaders have admitted that the <font size=-1>IRA</font> cannot win. In that war, Irish republicans have always taken the longest of views. The fact that their patience ran out after only 17 months of diplomacy contradicts their professed commitment to democratic change. True democrats, despairing of Mr Major, would have chosen simply to wait a further 15 months (at most) for a British general election. Nor are republican fears realistic. Britain does not want, nor would Ireland or the United States tolerate, the reimposition of a Protestant unionist hegemony in Ulster.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nevertheless, it would be a mistake to shut the door entirely on Sinn Fein, as the British, Irish and American governments all recognised after the first bomb. Those governments will maintain contact with the party through officials. The biggest reason to do this is that, as even some unionists admit, most Irish republicans in Ulster want a permanent end to the conflict. Belfast's Falls Road greeted the news of the first London bomb with gloom and dread, not celebration. Revealingly, loyalist terrorists did not retaliate and called for Sinn Fein to be given time to restore the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s ceasefire.</p><p><b>Breaking the stalemate</b><br><ro>The peace process can still be salvaged. But to do that, all sides to the conflict will have to re-examine their attitudes. The political settlements now in place in South Africa, the Middle East and even Bosnia, make it all the more incredible that a settlement in Ulster is so elusive.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nationalists of all stripes need to understand Britain's concerns. Although Mr Major's efforts to keep his own government in office may not be an edifying sight, they are understandable in a democracy. Nevertheless, Mr Major also has a responsibility to try harder to get all-party talks going, and to draw people from both sides who have supported terrorism into the democratic mainstream. To talk secretly to Sinn Fein before the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s ceasefire, as Mr Major's government did, and then to deny the party a place at the negotiating table for 17 months after the ceasefire, has been perverse. To give the impression that he was brushing aside the views of the Irish government was a grievous blunder.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Among democratic politicians, it is the unionists who most need to learn the art of compromise. Happy with the status quo, they have seen no need to negotiate. But nationalists, even the peaceful variety, will never settle for the status quo. Northern Ireland will never enjoy stability unless unionists compromise. Unionist fears of being pushed into a united Ireland are as unrealistic as those of Irish republicans. The best guarantor of Ulster's link with Britain is not London, but Dublin, where there is no support for ending the partition of Ireland as long as Ulster's majority remains opposed to it. Despite the London bombs, the unionist refusal to talk to Sinn Fein has also been misplaced. Britain and Ireland have proved for the past 25 years that they are not going to let the <font size=-1>IRA</font>, through Sinn Fein, dictate the terms of a final settlement.<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The British and Irish governments have spent the week following the first London bomb searching for a formula to get talks going. But they cannot concoct one on their own. With realism and a spirit of compromise from the parties in Ulster, any formula could work. Without them, none will.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?824508000,iss">Search</a>

<h3>End of a ceasefire</h3>The British and Irish governments broke off ministerial contacts with Sinn Fein after the <b>IRA</b> ended a 17-month ceasefire by detonating a 1,000lb bomb at Canary Wharf in London, which killed two people and caused damage estimated at up to &#163;100m ($155m). As attempts were made to keep the peace process on track, the British government sent more troops to Northern Ireland.<br>
<p><b>Boris Yeltsin</b> offered himself for re-election to Russia's presidency in June. His main rivals, so far, are the Communist leader, Gennady Zyuganov, whom opinion polls put well in the lead, the extreme nationalist, Vladimir Zhirinovsky, Grigory Yavlinsky, a liberal, and Alexander Lebed, a former general.<br>
<p>Bosnia's <b>peace was threatened</b> by a row between the Bosnian Serbs and <font size=-1>NATO</font>'s implementation force, Ifor, after it had sent two Bosnian Serb suspects to The Hague, where the <font size=-1>UN</font> war-crimes tribunal will hold its first trial on May 7th. Since then, the Bosnian Serb government has refused to talk to <font size=-1>NATO</font> officials. The presidents of Bosnia, Croatia and Serbia will be pressed to honour their peace-deal commitments when they meet Russian and western officials in Rome this weekend.<br>

<h3>A far horizon</h3>Hans Tietmeyer, president of the Bundesbank, added to speculation about the postponement of a single currency in Europe. He said that a delay in implementing economic and <b>monetary union</b> would create fewer problems than a derailment after the launch.<br>
<p>The European Parliament voted to tighten limits on the number of <b>foreign films </b>shown on television. The present rule, in which schedules should have at least 51% European content " where practicable", should no longer be discretionary, said the legislature. This pleased France, which is desperate to keep Hollywood at bay. But, this being Europe, the parliament's vote is unlikely to lead to a real change in any government's policy.<br>
<p>America is taking a complaint over <b>recorded-music rights </b>to the World Trade Organisation in an effort to force Japan to extend its copyright-protection laws, which came into force last month. The new rules protect recordings only back to 1971, leaving Bob Dylan and the Beatles among many others $500m a year short of royalties; the Americans want a 50-year rule.<br>
<h3>Industrial relic</h3>Edzard Reuter</b>, who as head of Daimler-Benz in 1987-95 took the German industrial group on a course of expansion that his successor, J&uuml;rgen Schrempp, is now reversing, is to step down from the supervisory board. He had said last May that the group's problems were largely over; but Mr Schrempp disclosed last month that Daimler-Benz would record a 1995 loss of DM6 billion ($4 billion).<br>
<p>America's <b>Trans World Airlines</b> announced its first operating profit since 1989. It made $25.1m in 1995, following a loss of $279.5m in 1994.<br>
<p>America's Time Warner, a big entertainment group, and <font size=-1>MAI</font>, a British broadcasting group that last week unveiled a &#163;3 billion merger with United News and Media, will together build a &#163;225m ($346m) combined <b>theme park and film studio</b> to the west of London.<br>
<p><b>Reuters</b> reported pre-tax profits up 17% to &#163;599m ($946m) last year. The cash-rich news and information group expects double-digit growth again this year and hopes to launch a share buy-back before the end of the year.<br>

<p>At a time when hugely expensive semiconductor factories are springing up everywhere, a <b>chip mountain</b> looms. The industry's measure of growth in North American chip sales plunged to its lowest point since allegations of Japanese chip-dumping in the 1980s. The "book-to-bill" ratio slid to 0.93 in January, as supply outstripped orders. Chip makers claim that this is no more than a blip.<br>

<p>At the request of <b>Eurotunnel</b>, a French court named two former leading politicians, one French, one British, to mediate with 225 creditor banks on restructuring the firm's FFr65 billion ($13 billion) debt. The company suspended interest payments last September. Revenue last year climbed rapidly but still amounted to only FFr2.27 billion.<br>
<p>America's <b>Mobil</b> launched a hostile A$1.24 billion ($940m) takeover for Ampolex, an Australian energy group. The bid added a 34% premium; Ampolex's shares rose 33%.<br>
<p>The man headhunted from Procter &amp; Gamble, America's consumer-products leader, to revive slumping profits at Italy's largest pasta maker unveiled his strategy. Edwin Artzt will cut prices by an average of 12% at <b>Barilla</b>, which produces a third of the country's pasta, half its ready-made sauces and 40% of bakery products.<br>
<p><b>Unilever</b>, an Anglo-Dutch consumer-products group,is to pay $770m for all outstanding shares in <b>Helene Curtis</b>, an American company making hair-care and skin-care products owned by the Gidwitz family of Chicago.<br>
<h3>Dizzy</h3>Four days after pushing through 5,500, the <b>Dow Jones </b>industrial average continued to break records to breach 5,600. The drop finally came after seven straight highs.<br>
<p><b>Lloyd's of London</b>, the troubled insurance market, outlined its planned allocation of a &#163;2.8 billion ($4.3 billion) settlement offer to loss-making names (the market's capital providers) who are suing for negligence. The settlement will be biased towards the strongest legal cases; a big chunk will also be used to fix a cap of &#163;100,000 on losses beyond any name's deposit at Lloyd's. Most names say the &#163;2.8 billion must be increased before they accept the plan.<br>
<p>Trading opened on the <b>Nouveau March&eacute</b>, France's new stock exchange for small companies.<br>
<p>Albania, once Europe's hardest-line communist state, is to open the <b>Tirana stock exchange </b>next month. The bourse will start modestly, trading government treasury bonds, privatisation vouchers and foreign currencies. Shares will come at a second stage; a British company, <font size=-1>GMA</font> Capital Markets, is training brokers for the big day.<br>
<p>(<a href="wwchart2.gif">See chart</a>)<br>
<p>Warren Buffett will at last allow shareholders in his <b>Berkshire Hathaway </b>investment group to split their holdings if they wish. With shares costing around $33,000 each, new investors of more modest means have been denied a stake in Mr Buffett's money-making machine. One existing "<font size=-1>A</font>" share will be convertible into 30 "<font size=-1>B</font>" shares, to be traded, though, in ten-share batches--and with fewer voting rights.

<h1>Why peace broke down </h1>

<p><b>The Irish Republican Army's bomb in London's Docklands on February 9th brought a shattering end to the 17-month-long ceasefire in Northern Ireland. On February 15th, the police defused a bomb in the British capital's West End. Why has the IRA returned to violence? And is this the end of the peace process?</b></p>

<p>IN RETROSPECT, there were plenty of warning signs that Northern Ireland's peace process was in jeopardy. Exasperated by the failure to start all-party talks, leaders of Sinn Fein, the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s political wing, had been saying since last summer that the peace process was under threat. In this, they were reflecting grass-roots opinion: for the past few months, republican supporters in the province had grown ever more despondent and angry at the lack of political progress to the decades-old dispute.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yet when the <font size=-1>IRA</font> called off its ceasefire late on the afternoon of February 9th, it still came as a shock. The <font size=-1>IRA</font> sent a coded message to <font size=-1>RTE</font>, Ireland's state-owned broadcaster: it was greeted with disbelief. The <font size=-1>IRA</font> had to make a second call to ask why the news had not been broadcast. Earlier that same week, British security sources had said they did not expect an early resumption of <font size=-1>IRA</font> violence.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Peace had transformed everyday life in Northern Ireland. It had been embraced with enthusiasm across the province's deep political divide. Most republican and loyalist activists, who had supported the gunmen on both sides, had said that the war was over, and that securing a political settlement through dialogue had become their goal. Perhaps the most visible sign of this commitment to peace was the euphoric reaction to President Clinton's visit to the province on November 30th: crowds of nationalists and unionists welcomed the president with joyous rallies.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Then, at 7:01 pm on February 9th, a 1,000-pound bomb ripped through London's Docklands, east of the City, smashing windows in office blocks, injuring 43 people and killing two. Abruptly, the mood in Ulster shifted from optimism to despair. The mood darkened further with the discovery of a bomb in London's West End. At best, the <font size=-1>IRA</font> was signalling its frustration in failing get Sinn Fein into talks. At worst, it was resuming full-bloodied " armed struggle" against British rule in Northern Ireland. What was beyond doubt was that the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s ceasefire had ended.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;What went wrong? A whirl of meetings between politicians of every stripe, trumpeted "breakthroughs", Anglo-Irish summits, visits to the White House by party leaders, and endless television interviews all gave the impression of political progress. But this was misleading. After 17 months of politicking, Ulster was not much closer to a political settlement before the bomb--or even to negotiations leading to such a settlement--than it had been when the <font size=-1>IRA</font> announced its ceasefire.
</p><p><b>The unspeakable and the intractable</b>
<br><ro>To understand why the peace process has proved so hard to maintain, it is necessary to recall the history of the conflict in Northern Ireland, one of the longest and most intractable in Western Europe. Irish nationalists, who account for 40% of Northern Ireland's population and are mainly Catholic, have always thought that the province was an artificial creation, gerrymandered in 1920 to give mainly-Protestant unionists a permanent majority. Nearly 50 years of discrimination under the unionist-dominated parliament at Stormont Castle, a palace near Belfast, persuaded most nationalists that an "internal settlement" (ie, one that excludes Ireland) would be unacceptable because it would leave them permanently under the unionist thumb.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;On the other side, unionists have always said there is no reason why Ireland should be a political unit just because it is a geographic one. They argue that those who wish to remain part of the United Kingdom should have the right to do so. Today, most unionists admit that a return to rule by a local assembly in Stormont is neither possible nor desirable. But they adamantly refuse to consider joining a united Ireland, in which they would be a permanent minority, and see any moves to forge links with the Irish government as the beginning of a slide towards unification.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Such conflicting aspirations and fears have nurtured nationalist virulence alien to the rest of Britain and Ireland (<a href="sfchart1.gif">see chart</a>). When Catholic civil-rights protesters marched under the Stormont regime at the end of the 1960s, Protestant police and counter-protesters responded by attacking them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Out of the civil strife which followed, the <font size=-1>IRA</font>, whose roots lay in the revolution that had established the Irish Free State 50 years earlier, was reborn--and so was a "republican", anti-British ideology. This viewed Britain's presence anywhere in Ireland as colonial and Ulster unionists as British stooges. On the unionist side, loyalist terrorists, who viewed all Catholics as subversives, sprang back into action.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;These attitudes, legacies of 25 years of conflict, have dogged the current peace process from the start. But they are not the only ones in the province. After 25 years of stalemate, most people want peace. This was why hopes rose so high when the latest peace efforts began.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Among the nationalists, the main figure arguing for accommodation is John Hume, the leader of the Social Democratic and Labour Party (<font size=-1>SDLP</font>), which is the largest nationalist party in the province. After years of discussion with Gerry Adams, Sinn Fein's president, Mr Hume seemed to have persuaded him of the view held by most people in the Irish Republic: that <font size=-1>IRA</font> violence, not the British government, had become the biggest obstacle to a settlement, and that the unionists would never be persuaded to compromise, let alone join a united Ireland, by bombs or bullets. Sinn Fein moderated its rhetoric, and established secret contacts with the British and Irish governments.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the Downing Street Declaration of 1993 both governments tried to reassure everyone in Ulster that their concerns would be taken into account and no settlement imposed. When the <font size=-1>IRA</font> announced an open-ended ceasefire at the end of August 1994 (followed by a loyalist ceasefire six weeks later), Northern Ireland seemed at least on the brink of a durable peace.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Almost immediately old suspicions resurfaced. Sinn Fein's leaders were all too aware that their party's share of the vote, about 10% in Northern Ireland and a mere 2% in the south, would not give it much clout on its own. So they persuaded the <font size=-1>IRA</font> to stop its violent campaign only after winning promises from Mr Hume and Albert Reynolds, Ireland's then prime minister, that the <font size=-1>SDLP</font> and the Irish government would help ease Sinn Fein's way to the negotiating table. Together, the party's leaders told their supporters, nationalists across Ireland could get Britain and the unionists to accept a change. The help of Mr Clinton's White House would also be relied upon to press for an equitable settlement.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unionist leaders saw this "pan-nationalist" front as a conspiracy to bully the British into accepting a slow-motion unification of Ireland. They bitterly resented the meddling of the Americans. Why, they asked, should we believe that the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s ceasefire is anything but tactical? Why should we talk to Sinn Fein while the <font size=-1>IRA</font> retains its weapons? Sinn Fein, claimed unionist leaders, had to establish its democratic credentials before unionists would negotiate with it.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The British government tried to assuage unionist concerns. First it refused to meet Sinn Fein for three months, to ensure that the <font size=-1>IRA</font> ceasefire was genuine. Then it demanded that the <font size=-1>IRA</font> declare its ceasefire "permanent". And then it demanded that the <font size=-1>IRA</font> make a gesture to bolster the confidence of unionists by decommissioning some of its weapons before Sinn Fein could meet British ministers.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The trouble was that neither side sees the British as honest brokers. Nationalists, even the majority who oppose the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s campaign, have long believed that when push comes to shove, the British will invariably side with the unionists. Ironically, the unionists do not trust the British any more than the nationalists. With some justification, unionists suspect that most people on mainland Britain would be happy to settle for any resolution of the conflict, even a united Ireland. British efforts over the past 20 years to meet nationalist demands by involving the Irish government in a settlement have fuelled unionist fears that Britain wants to wash its hands of Ulster.
</p><p><b>Towards the bomb</b>
<br><ro>Britain's attempts to steer through this sea of suspicion were unsuccessful. Eventually, the government abandoned its demands that Sinn Fein declare the ceasefire permanent; nor did the <font size=-1>IRA</font> hand in any weapons. But British ministers met Sinn Fein leaders. In February 1995, the British even went so far as to publish, together with the Irish government, a "framework" document sketching an outline political settlement. This involved a power-sharing assembly in Northern Ireland, which would remain part of the United Kingdom but would be linked through cross-border government bodies with the Irish Republic. Such a formula (similar to an attempt, called the Sunningdale agreement of 1973, to end an earlier round of fighting) may well be the only way to reconcile the demands of both nationalists and unionists.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But Sunningdale foundered on the rock of unionist opposition--and so did John Major's negotiations. Unionists were enraged, arguing that the British prime minister had misled them, and that he was trying to impose a settlement against the wishes of Ulster's majority. Meanwhile Sinn Fein's leaders seemed at first confused, then angered by the British.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For years they had been told by the British that the alternative to <font size=-1>IRA</font> terrorism was dialogue. They believed this meant that, once the <font size=-1>IRA</font> had abandoned its violent campaign, Sinn Fein would be allowed a place at the negotiating table where a political settlement would be hammered out.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sinn Fein's supporters felt that unionist leaders and the British government were out to humiliate them, that their demands for weapons handovers and delays would only increase, and that the <font size=-1>IRA</font> was no longer being asked simply to stop waging war, but to surrender. This, they believed, was the prelude to the internal settlement they dreaded. Despite its connections with, and support for, the <font size=-1>IRA</font>, Sinn Fein also has scores of elected local councillors. Its leaders demanded that its electoral mandate be recognised, and that talks without "pre-conditions" begin.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When the British insisted on the idea of some form of weapons disposal before any all-party talks, the Irish government and the <font size=-1>SDLP</font> were dismayed. Like Sinn Fein, they had assumed that the terrorist ceasefires would allow all sides to come to the negotiating table. As months of stalemate dragged on, spirits sagged.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Nationalists in Ireland, and not just republicans, came to believe that unionist leaders would negotiate only if the British called all-party talks over their objections, but that the British had no intention of doing this. Mr Major's dwindling majority in the House of Commons made it likely that he would need to rely on the support of the nine <font size=-1>MP</font>s of the Ulster Unionist Party to stay in office. Nationalists noted this, but gave Mr Major little credit for trying to pursue peace negotiations anyway. Instead, they accused the British government of trimming its support for the peace process because of parliamentary arithmetic and argued that Northern Ireland should take precedence over "party politics" at Westminster.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;For their part, British ministers argued that without the unionists at the table, talks were pointless. They insisted that unionist demands for an <font size=-1>IRA</font> gesture on weapons as a "confidence building" measure were reasonable given the ferocity and length of the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s campaign. This was not a demand for surrender. If the <font size=-1>IRA</font> truly wanted peace, asked the British, why could it not make this simple gesture?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;After an ominous summer of sectarian marches and rioting, the deadlock became unmistakable when, by late autumn, the British and Irish governments had failed to agree on a way forward. Then, on the eve of Mr Clinton's visit to the British Isles in November, the two governments hastily announced a compromise--a "twin track" approach. Along one track would proceed discussions leading to all-party talks by the end of February. Along another, a three-man international commission examined ways to break the impasse over arms. The commission was headed by George Mitchell, a former American senator.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;When the commission reported on January 24th, it recommended another compromise: instead of talks before disarmament, or disarmament before talks, both should proceed at the same time. Barely consulting the Irish government, Mr Major immediately rejected this proposal, and repeated his demand that the <font size=-1>IRA</font> disarm before talks. If Sinn Fein would not accept this, he said, he proposed instead an alternative of his own: special elections to choose delegates to all-party talks before disarmament. Make a gesture over weapons, he told Sinn Fein, or win a democratic mandate to talks--take your pick.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Unionists were delighted. The idea had been theirs. It also sounded reasonable to British officials--how can democrats oppose elections? But it confirmed many of the worst fears of nationalists. After months of stalling, Britain seemed to be brushing aside the Irish government and the Anglo-Irish partnership that had formed the bedrock of the peace process. It had hastily rejected an international effort to offer a way forward. It had adopted the unionists' agenda, conjuring fears of a purely internal settlement. It had erected another hurdle in the way of Sinn Fein's entrance into talks. Sixteen days later, the bomb went off in Docklands. Mr Major's response to the Mitchell commission, Mr Adams speculated, had been the "last straw".
</p><p><b>Examining the wreckage</b>
<br><ro>The bomb has left all sides pessimistic, but it has set back, rather than stopped, the search for a settlement. Unionist leaders predictably claimed that the bomb confirmed the suspicions they had held of Sinn Fein and the <font size=-1>IRA</font> all along. But few others tried to make political capital out of the attack and neither the British nor Irish government, despite the bloodshed, seems ready to slam the door on Sinn Fein.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;True, the bombing provoked a bout of finger-pointing between London and Dublin about who was to blame for the political stalemate. A few days later, however, both adopted a more conciliatory tone and scrambled to work out a new route to all-party talks. Both governments broke off ministerial, though not official, contacts with Sinn Fein. Both also demanded an immediate restoration of the <font size=-1>IRA</font> ceasefire.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Major still called for elections. But, in a subdued House of Commons, also said he was open to other ideas. The <font size=-1>SDLP</font>'s Mr Hume proposed referendums in both parts of Ireland to ask people to repudiate violence and to back all-party talks. Mr Major was unenthusiastic about this but refrained from ruling it out. Ireland's prime minister, John Bruton, said he was willing to discuss elections, but only if "proximity" talks (like those held in Dayton, Ohio, to reach an accord in Bosnia) were also considered. The Irish had proposed such talks before the bombing. Both governments seem to realise that, whatever the <font size=-1>IRA</font> now does, the only way to salvage the peace process is to restore their partnership. A meeting between the two prime ministers is expected next week.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The bomb has left the strategies of both the <font size=-1>IRA</font> and Sinn Fein unclear. Sinn Fein's top leaders denied prior knowledge of the bomb. They expressed sympathy for its victims, but refused to condemn it. Instead, they explained it as the inevitable response to British and unionist intransigence, and the delay in starting all-party talks.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The bombing seemed to cause as much gloom among Sinn Fein's supporters in Northern Ireland as among anyone else. Yet, mindful of bloody divisions that have riven their movement in the past, republicans were determined not to split. Mr Adams and other top Sinn Fein leaders may not have been told the precise timing of the bomb, but they surely must have known that the <font size=-1>IRA</font> was about to call off its ceasefire. The most likely explanation is that they lost an internal argument over whether to return to violence and, to avoid a split, went along with the decision.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As for the <font size=-1>IRA</font> itself, its return to violence was the more surprising because few could see any persuasive political logic to its decision. Even if the upshot is that all sides think again and act more flexibly, the <font size=-1>IRA</font> will pay a high price for the bombing. It will now be more difficult, not easier, for the two governments to get unionists to the same table as Sinn Fein. The bombing has also increased doubts about whether the republicans are genuinely committed to democracy, and whether they have the patience for the slow pace and compromises that the democratic process entails.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Gloom and fear have returned to Ulster. Yet a political settlement, even peace, should still be possible. Ordinary people's attitudes really do seem to have changed. After the bombing, demonstrators poured on to the streets of Belfast and Londonderry to show their support for peace.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;An unexpected bright spot was the behaviour of the fringe parties representing loyalist terrorist groups, the <font size=-1>IRA</font>'s bitterest foes. They called for restraint, ruling out a renewal of hostilities unless the <font size=-1>IRA</font> launched an all-out campaign in the north. One loyalist leader argued that Mr Adams had to be given time to restore the <font size=-1>IRA</font> ceasefire. Loyalist prisoners even issued a statement accusing mainstream unionist leaders of "gloating" at the bloody end of the <font size=-1>IRA</font> ceasefire. Such a response would have been unimaginable 17 months ago.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;It is clear that the people of Northern Ireland want a peaceful resolution of their conflict. But what compromises they are willing to make to obtain it, and how their politicians can lead them to that goal, remain obscure. Ulster, like so many other troubled places on earth, now needs statesmen, not mere politicians.<br><p align=center><a href="http://www.economist.com/index.html"><i>The Economist</i> Home Page</a> &nbsp; - &nbsp; <a href="http://www.economist.com/cgi-bin/search_form.cgi?824508000,iss">Search</a>

<p><b>Rail privatisation</b></p>
<h2>More trouble on the track</h2>


<p>A NEW obstacle has appeared on the track of rail privatisation: the National Audit Office (<font size=-1>NAO</font>) has decided to launch an inquiry into the sell-off after opposition claims that the taxpayer is being cheated and that public assets are being sold for a song. Officials say there will probably be a series of individual reports on the sales of the 60 separate businesses into which British Rail is being split.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The auditors have already started looking into a number of sales, including that of the London-Tilbury-Southend line. The sale of the line was aborted after it was discovered that ticket sales were being fraudulently shuffled between stations in order to increase its revenues at the expense of London Underground's.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The <font size=-1>NAO</font>'s belief that the government has cut corners in its rush to privatise the railways was fuelled by the leak on February 12th of a Department of Transport memo which sought to conceal irregularities in the sale of a British Rail maintenance depot at Eastleigh. Written by a senior official in the rail-privatisation directorate, it gave a warning that the sale of the depot to a management buy-out team may have been financed by cash reserves which competing bidders had not been told about. The civil servants had marked the document "Restricted--not for <font size=-1>NAO</font> eyes", thus arousing the suspicion of the sharp-eyed auditors. The department claims this to be agreed practice for documents responding to proposals for investigations by the <font size=-1>NAO</font>.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The memo, from Mike Fuhr, the civil servant with the job of monitoring rail privatisation, to the department's permanent secretary, Nick Montagu, quoted a report by a firm of accountants, Price Waterhouse. The report found that the management had bought the depot for &#163;7m even though it had cash balances of &#163;5.4m and a net worth of &#163;18.7m. Mr Fuhr described his concerns about the question of hidden cash balances, then listed a series of official omissions in the conduct of the Eastleigh sale, notably the lack of detailed documentation. He asked whether there were "any similar skeletons in other completed sales".
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Officials dismiss the memo as "foolishly worded" and "out of date" . They say that a further study of the Eastleigh sale, by another accountancy firm, Ernst and Young, will clear all parties of wrongdoing.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The imminent privatisation of Railtrack, the company that owns the country's track and stations, is causing the opposite embarrassment. In order to avoid accusations that it is selling Railtrack too cheaply, the government is insisting that the company carry with it a debt of &#163;1 billion. Railtrack's directors, however, say that it cannot support so much borrowing. The argument needs to be resolved within the next fortnight if the privatisation is to happen as planned.

<h2>Golden goals</h2>
<p>FAUSTINO ASPRILLA is reputed to earn &#163;30,000 a week. This juicy salary has not prevented the Colombian soccer star from becoming the latest hero of Newcastle United fans. His match-winning debut on February 10th maintained the team's lead in the English premier league. Were Mr Asprilla instead earning a similar salary as managing director of a British widget manufacturer, those same fans would regard him as an over-paid fat-cat. Is there a rational explanation for such an apparently contradictory attitude to top pay?
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Stefan Szymanski, an economist at Imperial College Management School in London, reckons so. People are happy to accept rates of pay that are fairly set. The procedure for determining the rate for a job should be just; pay needs to be seen to reward effort and skill; and the rate should reflect a worker's perceived worth. Footballers pass all these tests, he claims, better than senior executives.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Executives' pay is seen to be set by their peers, rather than in a market. Footballers' salaries are determined by a fiercely competitive transfer market. Club managers and players--the buyers and sellers--have opposing interests, the manager to keep pay low, the player to push it up, so wages are set by the normal market forces of supply and demand. In contrast, company directors, many of whom are buyers (as well as sellers) by dint of sitting on remuneration committees at other firms, have an incentive to bid up the going rate for the job.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;As for testing whether pay accurately reflects effort and skill, that is much easier in the case of players than company bosses. If two directors are watching a football match, it is impossible to tell whether they are cementing a deal or having a nice time. But, says Mr Szymanski, not only is the performance of each footballer easily observed; 70% of the explanation for the position of a club in Britain's Premier League arises from the relative size of its pay bill. A company's profits may soar because of a growing economy, or its share price rise simply because the stockmarket has risen, rather than because its managers are doing a good job.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;But here's the rub. The pay of Britain's top footballers rose by around 60% between 1991-92 and 1994-95--far more than the pay of Britain's company directors. Yet in that period, Britain's economy has grown faster than that of any other big European country, and its exports have risen to record levels. Not since 1984 has a British club won Europe's top honour, the Champions' Cup.

<p><b>Constitutional reform</b></p>
<h2>Grand ideas</h2>
<font size=1>EDINBURGH</font>
<p>LIKE his predecessors as Scottish secretary, Michael Forsyth has campaigned incessantly against Labour's plans for a devolved Scottish parliament. But unlike previous Tory Scottish secretaries, Mr Forsyth has a new ploy. A Labour government, he says, would not need to create a Scottish parliament because he has already done it for them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Most people, including Labour <font size=-1>MP</font>s, seem to have missed this, which is not surprising. Mr Forsyth is talking about changes he has made to the Scottish Grand Committee, a hitherto obscure part of the parliamentary apparatus on which Scotland's 72 <font size=-1>MP</font>s sit. Until recently, the committee's 12 annual meetings to discuss Scottish affairs were mostly ignored by the Scottish media even though they were held in Edinburgh.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Mr Forsyth wants to change that. First, he has turned the committee into a travelling circus. Some 200 people turned up for a meeting on February 5th in Inverness where Mr Forsyth handed out goodies, including giving state-owned land to crofters.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Second, ministers now appear before the committee. In Aberdeen on February 19th Kenneth Clarke, the chancellor, will be grilled on how his policies affect Scotland. Next month John Major, the prime minister, will undergo a similar ordeal.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The power to quiz non-Scottish Office ministers was part of a package of reforms grudgingly accepted by opposition parties last December. Similar changes to the Welsh Grand Committee proposed by William Hague, the Welsh secretary, have divided Welsh Labour <font size=-1>MP</font>s who are so far refusing to implement them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thirdly, Mr Forsyth has given the committee power to take votes on some legislation. As there are only ten Scottish Tory <font size=-1>MP</font>s, this law-making power will be exercised only on non-controversial matters, such as legal reform. More controversial measures, even those applying only to Scotland, will still go through Westminster, where the Tories can rely on their marjority.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This shows, says Labour, that Mr Forsyth's scheme is a sham compared to Labour's plan for real devolution. Mr Forsyth, however, says that a Labour government would not need to set up a Scottish parliament as it could leave all its Scottish legislation to the Scottish Grand Committee where it would have a majority (Labour has 49 Scottish <font size=-1>MP</font>s at present).
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;This is a transparent political gimmick which is most unlikely to persuade Tony Blair to drop devolution. But that is not Mr Forsyth's plan. He wants to convince Scottish voters that the government is interested in their grievances and that they do not need a Scottish parliament to do something about them.
<br>&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Labour, riding high on polls which give it the support of more than half of the Scottish electorate, has been slow to counter Mr Forsyth's agile campaigning. This complacency may yet cost the party dearly. Polls show that the Scots are overwhelmingly in favour of devolution, but they give it a lower priority than having a job and good hospitals. As for paying more tax--which Labour's devolution plans allow--they fancy that not at all. Like the rest of Britain's shambolic constitution, Mr Forsyth's scheme may not look much in theory. But unless Labour takes steps to counter it, it might yet work well enough to salvage a few Tory seats north of the border.

<b>Just the job</b><br>
The official unemployment count fell by an unexpectedly sharp 29,300 to 2.2m in January. But construction firms said they expected to cut 45,000 jobs in 1996, despite figures showing that their new orders in December were the highest for two years.<p>
<b>Rentamum</b><br>
A London hospital said it was arranging the first surrogate birth on the National Health Service. An unnamed woman will get expenses of up to &#163;10,000 for having a baby on behalf of another who has lost her womb.
<p><b>King's shilling</b><br>
Faced with a shortage of 2,500 troops, the army offered serving soldiers a &#163;250 bonus for persuading their friends to join up.
<p><b>Wages of sin</b><br>
More prisoners will be allowed to do paid work while serving their sentences, the government said. But they will have to contribute towards their keep and give money to crime-prevention and victim-support schemes.

<b>A fine decision</b><br>
Michael Howard, the home secretary, announced that people will no longer be jailed for failing to pay fines. In 1994 22,500 fine-defaulters were jailed.

<p><b>God not Tory--official</b><br>
The Church of England is no longer a male-dominated " Conservative Party at prayer"; it is increasingly left-wing and women are winning more influence, a survey of 500 General Synod members found.
