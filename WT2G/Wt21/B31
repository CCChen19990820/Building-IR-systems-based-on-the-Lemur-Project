<H3>SEC. 551. PARENTAL CHOICE IN TELEVISION PROGRAMMING.
</H3><P>
<UL><P>(a) FINDINGS- The Congress makes the following findings:
</UL><P>
<UL><UL><P>(1) Television influences children's perception of the values
and behavior that are common and acceptable in society.
</UL></UL><P>
<UL><UL><P>(2) Television station operators, cable television system operators,
and video programmers should follow practices in connection with video
programming that take into consideration that television broadcast and cable
programming has established a uniquely pervasive presence in the lives of
American children.
</UL></UL><P>
<UL><UL><P>(3) The average American child is exposed to 25 hours of television
each week and some children are exposed to as much as 11 hours of television
a day.
</UL></UL><P>
<UL><UL><P>(4) Studies have shown that children exposed to violent video
programming at a young age have a higher tendency for violent and aggressive
behavior later in life than children not so exposed, and that children exposed
to violent video programming are prone to assume that acts of violence are
acceptable behavior.
</UL></UL><P>
<UL><UL><P>(5) Children in the United States are, on average, exposed to
an estimated 8,000 murders and 100,000 acts of violence on television by
the time the child completes elementary school.
</UL></UL><P>
<UL><UL><P>(6) Studies indicate that children are affected by the pervasiveness
and casual treatment of sexual material on television, eroding the ability
of parents to develop responsible attitudes and behavior in their children.
</UL></UL><P>
<UL><UL><P>(7) Parents express grave concern over violent and sexual video
programming and strongly support technology that would give them greater
control to block video programming in the home that they consider harmful
to their children.
</UL></UL><P>
<UL><UL><P>(8) There is a compelling governmental interest in empowering
parents to limit the negative influences of video programming that is harmful
to children.
</UL></UL><P>
<UL><UL><P>(9) Providing parents with timely information about the nature
of upcoming video programming and with the technological tools that allow
them easily to block violent, sexual, or other programming that they believe
harmful to their children is a nonintrusive and narrowly tailored means of
achieving that compelling governmental interest.
</UL></UL><P>
<UL><P>(b) ESTABLISHMENT OF TELEVISION RATING CODE-
</UL><P>
<UL><UL><P>(1) AMENDMENT- Section 303 (47 U.S.C. 303) is amended by adding
at the end the following:
</UL></UL><P>
<UL><P>`(w) Prescribe--
</UL><P>
<UL><UL><P>`(1) on the basis of recommendations from an advisory committee
established by the Commission in accordance with section 551(b)(2) of the
Telecommunications Act of 1996, guidelines and recommended procedures for
the identification and rating of video programming that contains sexual,
violent, or other indecent material about which parents should be informed
before it is displayed to children: <EM>Provided, </EM>That nothing in this

the Commission shall--

<UL><UL><UL><P>(A) ensure that such committee is composed of parents, television

which such company would be liable under this section.

<p>			       PAUL, BISHOP

<p>			SERVANT OF THE SERVANTS OF

<p>
		 	 FOR EVERLASTING MEMORY

<p>

			      [NOSTRA AETATE]

<p>

				DECLARATION
<p>
			   ON THE RELATION OF THE
<p>
			  CHURCH TO NON-CHRISTIAN
<p>
				 RELIGIONS
</center>
<p>



  In our time, when day by day mankind is being drawn closer together,

and the ties between different peoples are becoming stronger, the

Church examines more closely her relationship to non-Christian

religions.  In her tasks of promoting unity and love among men, indeed

among nations, she considers above all in this declaration what men

have in common and what draws them to fellowship.
<p>


  One is the community of all peoples, one their origin, for God made

the whole human race to live over the face of the earth (1).  One also

is their final goal, God.  His providence, His manifestations of

goodness, His saving design extend to all men (2), until that time

when the elect will be united in the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000001300135"></a><a href="h.htm#_ICONOVEX_HOLYCITY"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Holy City, the city ablaze with

the glory of God, where the nations will walk in His light (3).


<p>
  Men expect from the various religions answers to the unsolved

riddles of the human condition, which today, even as in former times,

deeply stir the hearts of men: What is man?  What is the meaning, the

aim of our life?  What is moral good, what sin?  Whence suffering and

what purpose does it serve?  Which is the road to true happiness?

What are death, judgement and retribution after death?  What, finally

is the ultimate <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000001400169"></a><a href="i.htm#_ICONOVEX_INEXPRESSIBLEMYSTERY"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>inexpressible mystery which encompasses our existence:

whence do we come, and where are we going?

<p>

  2. From ancient times down to the present, there is found among

various peoples a certain perception of that hidden power which hovers

over the course of things and over the events of human history; at

times some indeed have come to the recognition of a Supreme Being, or

even of a Father.  This perception and recognition penetrates their

lives with a profound <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000001500138"></a><a href="r.htm#_ICONOVEX_RELIGIOUSSENSE"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>religious sense.

<p>

  Religions, however, that are bound up with an advanced culture have

struggled to answer the same questions by means of more refined

concepts and a more developed language.  Thus in <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000001600067"></a><a href="h.htm#_ICONOVEX_HINDUISM"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Hinduism, men

contemplate the divine mystery and express it through an inexhaustible

abundance of myths and through searching <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000001600107"></a><a href="p.htm#_ICONOVEX_PHILOSOPHICALINQUIRY"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>philosophical inquiry.  They

seek freedom from the anguish of our human condition either through

ascetical practices or profound <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000001600147"></a><a href="m.htm#_ICONOVEX_MEDITATION"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>meditation or a flight to God with

love and trust.  Again, <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000001600173"></a><a href="b.htm#_ICONOVEX_BUDDHISM"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Buddhism, in its various forms, realizes the

radical insufficiency of this changeable world; it teaches a way by

which men, in a devout and confident spirit, may be able either to

acquire the state of perfect liberation, or attain, by their own

efforts or through higher help, supreme illumination.  Likewise, other

religions found everywhere try to counter the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000001600305"></a><a href="r.htm#_ICONOVEX_RESTLESSNESSOFHUMANHEART"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>restlessness of the

human heart, each in its own manner, by proposing "ways," comprising

teachings, rules of life, and sacred rites.

<p>

  The <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000001700004"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000012800104"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Catholic Church rejects nothing that is true and holy in these

religions.  She regards with sincere reverence those ways of conduct

and of life, those precepts and teachings which, though differing in

many aspects from the ones she holds and sets forth, nonetheless often

reflect a ray of that Truth which enlightens all men.   Indeed, she

proclaims, and ever must proclaim <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000001700139"></a><a href="v-2.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000002200084"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ, "the way the truth, and the

life" (John 14, 6), in whom men may find the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000001700183"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000022500078"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>fullness of religious

life, in whom God has reconciled all things to Himself (4).

<p>

  The Church therefore, exhorts her sons, that through dialogue and

collaboration with the followers of other religions, carried out with

prudence and love and in witness to the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000001800063"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CHRISTIANFAITH"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christian faith and life,

they recognize, preserve and promote the good things, spiritual and

moral, as well as the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000001800108"></a><a href="s.htm#_ICONOVEX_SOCIOCULTURALVALUES"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>socio-cultural values found among these men.
<p>


  3.  The Church regards with esteem also the Moslems.  They adore  the

one God, living and subsisting in Himself, merciful and all-powerful,

the Creator of heaven and earth (5), who has spoken to men; they take

pains to submit wholeheartedly to even His <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000001900101"></a><a href="i.htm#_ICONOVEX_INSCRUTABLEDECREESFAITHOFISLAM"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>inscrutable decrees, just as

Abraham, with whom the faith of Islam takes great pleasure in linking

itself, submitted to God.  Though they do not acknowledge <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000001900158"></a><a href="v2-1.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000005300246"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Jesus as

God, they revere Him as a prophet.  They also honor Mary, His virgin

mother; at times they even call on her with devotion.  In addition,

they await the day of judgement when God will render their deserts to

all those who have been raised up from the dead.  Finally, they value

the moral life and worship God especially through prayer, almsgiving

and fasting.

<p>

  Since in the course of centuries not a few quarrels and hostilities

have arisen between Christians and Moslems, this Sacred Synod urges

all to forget the past and to work sincerely for mutual understanding

and to preserve as well as to promote together for the benefit of all

mankind social justice and moral welfare, as well as peace and

freedom.

<p>

  4.  As the Sacred Synod searches into the mystery of the Church, it

remembers the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000002100035"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000018600234"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>bond that spiritually ties the people of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000002100052"></a><a href="n.htm#_ICONOVEX_NEWCOVENANT"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>New

Covenant to <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000002100060"></a><a href="index.htm#_ICONOVEX_ABRAHAMSSTOCK"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Abraham's stock.

<p>

  Thus the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000002200006"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000012900182"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Church of Christ acknowledges that, according to God's

saving design, the beginnings of her faith and her election are found

already among the Patriarchs, Moses and the prophets.  She professes

that all who believe in <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000002200084"></a><a href="v-2.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000002200309"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ -- Abraham's sons according to faith

(6) -- are included in the same <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000002200116"></a><a href="p.htm#_ICONOVEX_PATRIARCHSCALL"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Patriarch's call, and likewise that

the salvation of the Church is mysteriously foreshadowed by the chosen

people's exodus from the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000002200160"></a><a href="l.htm#_ICONOVEX_LANDOFBONDAGE"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>land of bondage.  The Church, therefore,

cannot forget that she received the revelation of the Old Testament

through the people with whom God in His inexpressible mercy concluded

the Ancient Covenant.  Nor can she forget that she draws sustenance

from the root of that well-cultivated <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000002200259"></a><a href="o.htm#_ICONOVEX_OLIVETREE"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>olive tree onto which have been

grafted the wild shoots, the Gentiles (7).  Indeed, the Church

believes that by His cross <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000002200309"></a><a href="v-2.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000002700135"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ Our Peace reconciled Jews and

Gentiles, making both one in Himself (8).

<p>

  The Church keeps ever in mind the words of the Apostle about his

kinsmen: "There is the sonship and the glory and the covenants and

the law and the worship and the promises; theirs are the fathers and

from them is the Christ according to the flesh" (Rom. 8, 4-5), the Son

of the Virgin Mary.  She also recalls that the Apostles, the Church's

main-stay and pillars, as well as most of the early disciples who

proclaimed <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000002300174"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CHRISTSGOSPEL"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ's Gospel to the world, sprang from the Jewish

people.


<p>
  As Holy Scripture testifies, <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000002400010"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000013200420"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Jerusalem did not recognize the time of

her visitation (9), nor did the Jews, in large number, accept the

Gospel; indeed not a few opposed its spreading (10).  Nevertheless God

holds the Jews most dear for the sake of their Fathers; He does not

repent of the gifts He makes or of the calls He issues -- such is the

witness of the Apostle (11).  In company with the Prophets and the

same Apostle, the Church awaits that day, known to God alone, on which

all peoples will address the Lord in a single voice and "serve him

shoulder to shoulder" (Soph. 3, 9) (12).

<p>

  Since the spiritual patrimony common to Christians and Jews is thus

so great, this <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000002500032"></a><a href="s.htm#_ICONOVEX_SACREDSYNODWANTS"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Sacred Synod wants to foster and recommend that <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000002500049"></a><a href="m.htm#_ICONOVEX_MUTUALUNDERSTANDING"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>mutual

understanding and respect which is the fruit, above all, of biblical

and theological studies as well as fraternal dialogues.

<p>

  True, the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000002600007"></a><a href="j.htm#_ICONOVEX_JEWISHAUTHORITIES"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Jewish authorities and those who followed their lead

pressed for the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000002600031"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CHRISTDEATHOF"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>death of Christ (13); still, what happened in His

passion cannot be charged against all the Jews, without distinction,

then alive, nor against the Jews of today.  Although the Church is the

new <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000002600109"></a><a href="v2-1.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000009500283"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>People of God, the Jews should not be presented as rejected or

accursed by God, as if this followed from the Holy Scriptures.  All

should see to it, then, that in catechetical work or in the preaching

of the Word of God they do not teach anything that does not conform to

the truth of the Gospel and the spirit of Christ.

<p>

  Furthermore, in her rejection of every persecution against any man,

the Church, mindful of the patrimony she shares with the Jews and

moved not by political reasons but by the Gospel's spiritual love,

decries hatred, persecutions, displays of anti-Semitism, directed

against Jews at any time and by anyone.



  Besides, as the Church has always held and holds now, <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000002700135"></a><a href="v-2.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000002700223"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ

underwent His passion and death freely, because of the sins of men and

out of infinite love, in order that all may reach salvation.  It is,

therefore, the burden of the Church's preaching to proclaim the cross

of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000002700223"></a><a href="v-2.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000003200065"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ as the sign of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000002700234"></a><a href="g.htm#_ICONOVEX_GODSALLEMBRACINGLOVE"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>God's all-embracing love and as the fountain

from which every grace flows.

<p>

  5.  We cannot truly call on God, the Father of all, if we refuse to

treat in a brotherly way any man, created as he is in the image of

God.  Man's relation to God the Father and his relation to men his

brothers are so linked together that Scripture says: "He who does not

love does not know God" (1 John 4, 8).

<p>

  No foundation therefore remains for any theory or practice that

leads to discrimination between man and the man or people and people,

so far as their human dignity and the rights flowing from it are

concerned.

<p>

  The Church reproves, as foreign to the mind of Christ, any

discrimination against men or harassment of them because of their

race, color, condition of life, or religion.  On the contrary,

following in the footsteps of the holy Apostles Peter and Paul, this

<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000003000100"></a><a href="s.htm#_ICONOVEX_SACREDSYNOD"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Sacred Synod ardently implores the Christian faithful to "maintain good

fellowship among the nations" (1 Peter 2, 12), and, if possible to

live for their part in peace with all men (14), so that they many

truly be sons of the Father who is in heaven (15).

Vatican II Decree on Ecumenism (Unitatis Redintegratio), 21 November 1964
<p>


<center>

			      <h3>INTRODUCTION</h3>
</center>


  1. The <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000011300010"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000011500077"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>restoration of unity among all Christians is one of the

principal concerns of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000011300040"></a><a href="s.htm#_ICONOVEX_SECONDVATICANCOUNCIL"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Second Vatican Council.  <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000011300048"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000011300150"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ the Lord

founded one Church and one Church only.  However, many <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000011300076"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CHRISTIANCOMMUNIONS"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christian

communions present themselves to men as the true inheritors of Jesus

Christ; all indeed profess to be followers of the Lord but they differ

in mind and go their different ways, as if <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000011300150"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000012300200"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ himself were divided

[1].  Certainly, such division openly contradicts the will of Christ,

scandalizes the world, and damages the most holy cause, the preaching

of the Gospel to every creature.

<p>

  The <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000011400004"></a><a href="l.htm#_ICONOVEX_LORDOFAGES"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Lord of Ages nevertheless wisely and patiently follows out the

plan of his grace on our behalf, sinners that we are.  In recent times

he has begun to bestow more generously upon divided <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000011400075"></a><a href="r.htm#_ICONOVEX_REMORSECHRISTIANS"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christians remorse

over their divisions and longing for unity.
<p>


  Everywhere large numbers have felt the impulse of this grace, and

among our separated brethren also there increases from day to day a

movement, fostered by the grace of the Holy Spirit, for the

<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000011500077"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000017900047"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>restoration of unity among all Christians.  Taking part in this

movement, which is called ecumenical, are those who invoke the Triune

God and confess Jesus as Lord and Saviour.  They do this not merely as

individuals but also as members of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000011500169"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CORPORATEGROUPS"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>corporate groups in which they

have heard the Gospel, and which each regards as his Church and indeed

God's.  And yet, almost everyone, though in different ways, longs for

the one visible Church of God, a Church truly universal and sent forth

to the whole world that the world may be converted to the Gospel and

so be saved, to the glory of God.
<p>


  The sacred Council gladly notes all this.  It has already declared

its teachings on the Church, and now, moved by a desire for the

restoration of unity among all the followers of Christ, it wishes to

set before all Catholics guidelines, helps and methods, by which they

too can respond to the grace of this divine call.

  2. What has been revealed the love of God among us is that the

only-begotten <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000012200039"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000020400104"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Son of God has been sent by the Father into the world,

so that, being made man, he might by his <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000012200086"></a><a href="r.htm#_ICONOVEX_REDEMPTIONOFENTIREHUMANRACE"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>redemption of the entire

human race give new life to it and unify it [2].  Before offering

himself up as a spotless victim upon the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000012200142"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CRESSALTAROF"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>altar of the cress, he prayed

to his Father for those who believe: "that all may be one, as you,

Father, are in me, and I in you; pray that they may be one in us, that

the world may believe that you sent me" (Jn. 17:21).  In his Church he

instituted the wonderful sacrament of the Eucharist by which the unity

of the Church is both signified and brought about.  He gave his

followers a new commandment to love one another [3], and promised the

Spirit, their Advocate [4], who, as the Lord and life-giver, should

remain with them forever.

<p>

  After being lifted up on the cross and glorified, the Lord Jesus

poured forth the Spirit whom he had promised, and through whom he has

called and gathered together the people of the New Covenant, which is

the Church, into a unity of faith, hope and charity, as the Apostle

teaches us: "There is one body and one Spirit, just as you were called

to the one hope of your calling; one Lord, one faith, one baptism"

(Eph. 4:4-5).  For "all you who have been baptized into <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000012300200"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000012300210"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ have

put on <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000012300210"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000012300316"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ ... for you are all one in Christ Jesus" (Gal. 3:27-28).

It is the Holy Spirit, dwelling in those who believe and pervading and

ruling over the entire Church, who brings about that wonderful

communion of the faithful and joins them together so intimately in

<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000012300316"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000012300425"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ that he is the principle of the Church's unity.  By

distributing various kinds of spiritual gifts and ministries [5], he

enriches the Church of Jesus Christ with different functions "in order

to equip the saints for the work of service, so as to build up the

body of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000012300425"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000012400038"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ" (Eph. 4:12).

<p>

  In order to establish this his holy Church everywhere in the world

till the end of time, <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000012400038"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000012700028"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ entrusted to the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000012400047"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_COLLEGEOFTWELVE"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>College of the Twelve

the task of teaching, ruling and sanctifying [6].  Among their number

he chose Peter.  And after Peter's confession of faith, he determined

that on him he would build his Church; to him he promised the keys of

the kingdom of heaven [7], and after his profession of love, entrusted

all his <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000012400174"></a><a href="s.htm#_ICONOVEX_SHEEP"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>sheep to him to be confirmed in faith [8] and shepherded in

perfect unity [9], with himself, Christ Jesus, forever remaining the

chief <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000012400230"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CORNERSTONE10"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>corner-stone [10] and shepherd of our souls [11].
<p>


  It is through the faithful preaching of the Gospel by the Apostles

and their successors -- the bishops with Peter's successor at their

head -- through their administering the sacraments, and through their

governing in love, that Jesus Christ wishes his people to increase,

under the action of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000012500108"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000012700044"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Holy Spirit; and he perfects its fellowship in

unity: in the confession of one faith, in the common celebration of

divine worship, and in the fraternal harmony of the family of God.


<p>
  The Church, then, God's only flock, like the standard lifted on high

for the nations to see it [12], ministers the Gospel of peace to all

mankind [13], as it makes its pilgrim way in hope toward its goal, the

fatherland above [14].
<p>


  This is the sacred mystery of the unity of the Church, in <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000012700028"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000012700036"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ and

through <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000012700036"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000012800198"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ, with the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000012700044"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000014100024"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Holy Spirit energizing its various functions.

The highest <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000012700063"></a><a href="e.htm#_ICONOVEX_EXEMPLAR"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>exemplar and source of this mystery is the unity, in the

<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000012700088"></a><a href="t.htm#_ICONOVEX_TRINITYOFPERSONSOFONEGOD"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Trinity of Persons, of one God, the Father and the Son in the Holy

Spirit.

<p>

  3. In this one and only <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000012800015"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CHURCHOFGOD"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Church of God from its very beginnings there

arose certain rifts [15], which the Apostle strongly censures as

damnable [16].  But in subsequent centuries much more serious

dissensions appeared and large communities became separated from full

communion with the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000012800104"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000012800206"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Catholic Church -- for which, often enough, men on

both sides were to blame.  However, one cannot charge with the sin of

the separation those who at present are born into these communities

and in them are brought up in the faith of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000012800198"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000012900155"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ, and the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000012800206"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000012800273"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Catholic

Church accepts them with respect and affection as brothers.  For men

who believe in Christ and have been properly baptized are put in some,

though imperfect, communion with the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000012800273"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000012800308"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Catholic Church.  Without doubt,

the differences that exist in varying degrees between them and the

<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000012800308"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000013100146"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Catholic Church -- whether in doctrine and sometimes in discipline, or

concerning the structure of the Church -- do indeed create many

obstacles, sometimes serious ones, to full ecclesiastical communion.

The <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000012800378"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000013400007"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>ecumenical movement is striving to overcome these obstacles.  But

even in spite of them it remains true that all who have been justified

by faith in baptism are incorporated into <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000012800442"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CHRIST17"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ [17]; they therefore

have a right to be called Christians, and with good reason are

accepted as brothers by the children of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000012800497"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CATHOLICCHURCH18"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Catholic Church [18].

<p>

  Moreover, some, even very many, of the most significant elements and

endowments which together go to build up and give life to the Church

itself, can exist outside the visible boundaries of the Catholic

Church: the written Word of God; the life of grace; faith, hope and

charity, with the other interior gifts of the Holy Spirit, as well as

visible elements.  All of these, which come from <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000012900155"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000013200359"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ and lead back

to him, belong by right to the one <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000012900182"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000023000147"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Church of Christ.

<p>

  The brethren divided from us also carry out many <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000013000020"></a><a href="r.htm#_ICONOVEX_RELIGIONLITURGICALACTIONSOFCHRISTIAN"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>liturgical actions

of the Christian religion.  In ways that vary according to the

condition of each Church or community, these liturgical actions most

certainly can truly engender a life of grace, and, one must say, can

aptly give access to the communion of salvation.

<p>

  It follows that the separated Churches [19] and communities as such,

though we believe they suffer from the defects already mentioned, have

been by no means deprived of significance and importance in the

mystery of salvation.  For the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000013100086"></a><a href="s.htm#_ICONOVEX_SPIRITOFCHRIST"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Spirit of Christ has not refrained from

using them as means of salvation which derive their efficacy from the

very <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000013100129"></a><a href="f.htm#_ICONOVEX_FULLNESSOFGRACE"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>fullness of grace and truth entrusted to the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000013100146"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000013800008"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Catholic Church.

<p>

  Nevertheless, our separated brethren, whether considered as

individuals or as communities and Churches, are not blessed with that

unity which Jesus Christ wished to bestow on all those to whom he has

given new birth into one body, and whom he has quickened to newness of

life -- that unity which the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000013200114"></a><a href="h.htm#_ICONOVEX_HOLYSCRIPTURES"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Holy Scriptures and the ancient <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000013200125"></a><a href="t.htm#_ICONOVEX_TRADITIONOFCHURCH"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Tradition

of the Church proclaim.  For it is through <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000013200146"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CHRISTSCATHOLICCHURCH"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ's Catholic Church

alone, which is the universal help towards salvation, that the

<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000013200177"></a><a href="f.htm#_ICONOVEX_FULLNESSOFMEANSOFSALVATION"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>fullness of the means of salvation can be obtained.  It was to the

apostolic college alone, of which Peter is the head, that we believe

that Our Lord entrusted all the blessings of the New Covenant, in

order to establish on earth the one <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000013200273"></a><a href="b.htm#_ICONOVEX_BODYOFCHRIST"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Body of Christ into which all

those should be fully incorporated who belong in any way to the people

of God.  During its pilgrimage on earth, this people, though still in

its members liable to sin, is growing in <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000013200359"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000013400382"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ and is guided by <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000013200370"></a><a href="g.htm#_ICONOVEX_GODSWISDOM"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>God's

gentle wisdom, according to his hidden designs, until it shall happily

arrive at the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000013200405"></a><a href="f.htm#_ICONOVEX_FULLNESSOFETERNALGLORY"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>fullness of eternal glory in the heavenly <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000013200420"></a><a href="j.htm#_ICONOVEX_JERUSALEM"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Jerusalem.

<p>

  4. Today, in many parts of the world, under the influence of the

grace of the Holy Spirit, many efforts are being made in prayer, word

and action to attain that <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000013300071"></a><a href="f.htm#_ICONOVEX_FULLNESSOFUNITY"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>fullness of unity which Jesus Christ

desires.  The sacred Council exhorts, therefore, all the Catholic

faithful to recognize the signs of the times and to take an active and

intelligent part in the work of ecumenism.

<p>

  The term "<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000013400007"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000018300071"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>ecumenical movement" indicates the initiatives and

activities encouraged and organized, according to the various needs of

the Church and as opportunities offer, to promote Christian unity.

These are: first, every effort to avoid expressions, judgements and

actions which do not represent the condition of our separated brethren

with truth and fairness and so make <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000013400128"></a><a href="m.htm#_ICONOVEX_MUTUALRELATIONS"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>mutual relations with them more

difficult.  Then, "dialogue" between competent experts from different

Churches and communities; in their meetings, which are organized in a

religious spirit, each explains the teaching of his communion in

greater depth and brings out clearly its distinctive features.

Through such dialogue everyone gains a truer knowledge and more just

appreciation of the teaching and religious life of both communions.

In addition, these communions engage in that more <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000013400290"></a><a href="i.htm#_ICONOVEX_INTENSIVECOOPERATION"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>intensive

cooperation in carrying out any duties for the common good of humanity

which are demanded by every <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000013400329"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CHRISTIANCONSCIENCE"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christian conscience.  They also come

together for common prayer, where this is permitted.  Finally, all are

led to examine their own faithfulness to <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000013400382"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000013500176"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ's will for the Church

and, wherever necessary, undertake with vigor the task of renewal and

reform.

<p>

  Such actions, when they are carried out by the Catholic faithful

with prudent patience and under the attentive guidance of their

bishops, promote justice and truth, concord and collaboration, as well

as the spirit of brotherly love and unity.  The results will be that,

little by little, as the obstacles to perfect ecclesiastical communion

are overcome, all Christians will be gathered, in a common celebration

of the Eucharist, into the unity of the one and only Church, which

<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000013500176"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000013700164"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ bestowed on his Church from the beginning.  This unity, we

believe, subsists in the Catholic Church as something she can never

lose, and we hope that it will continue to increase until the end of

time.

<p>

  However, it is evident that the work of preparing and reconciling

those individuals who wish for full <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000013600038"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CATHOLICCOMMUNIONOFNATURE"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Catholic communion is of its

nature distinct from <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000013600056"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000019500163"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>ecumenical action.  But there is no opposition

between the two, since both proceed from the marvelous ways of God.

<p>

  In ecumenical work, Catholics must assuredly be concerned for their

separated brethren, praying for them, keeping them informed about the

Church, making the first approaches toward them.  But their primary

duty is to make careful and honest <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000013700084"></a><a href="index.htm#_ICONOVEX_APPRAISALOFWHATEVERNEEDS"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>appraisal of whatever needs to be

renewed and done in the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000013700108"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CATHOLICHOUSEHOLD"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Catholic household itself, in order that its

life may bear witness more clearly and faithfully to the teachings and

institutions which have been handed down from <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000013700164"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000013800254"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ through the

apostles.

<p>

  For although the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000013800008"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000018000285"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Catholic Church has been endowed with all divinely

revealed truth and with all means of grace, yet its members fail to

live by them with all the fervor that they should.  As a result the

radiance of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000013800090"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CHURCHSFACE"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Church's face shines less brightly in the eyes of our

separated brethren and of the world at large, and the growth of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000013800137"></a><a href="g.htm#_ICONOVEX_GODSKINGDOM"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>God's

kingdom is retarded.  Every Catholic must therefore aim at <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000013800160"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CHRISTIANPERFECTION20"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christian

perfection [20] and, each according to his station, play his part,

that the Church, which bears in her own body the humility and dying of

<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000013800222"></a><a href="j.htm#_ICONOVEX_JESUS21"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Jesus [21], may daily be more purified and renewed, against the day

when <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000013800254"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000014000082"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ will present her to himself in all her glory without spot

or wrinkle [22].

<p>

  While preserving unity in essentials, let everyone in the Church,

according to the office entrusted to him, preserve a proper freedom in

the various forms of spiritual life and discipline, in the variety of

<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000013900077"></a><a href="l.htm#_ICONOVEX_LITURGICALRITES"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>liturgical rites, and even in the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000013900091"></a><a href="t.htm#_ICONOVEX_THEOLOGICALELABORATIONSOFREVEALEDTRUTH"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>theological elaborations of revealed

truth.  In all things let charity prevail.  If they are true to this

course of action, they will be giving ever richer expression to the

authentic catholicity and apostolicity of the Church.

<p>

  On the other hand, Catholics must gladly acknowledge and esteem the

truly <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000014000028"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CHRISTIANENDOWMENTS"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christian endowments for our common heritage which are to be

found among our separated brethren.  It is right and salutary to

recognize the riches of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000014000082"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000014000112"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ and virtuous works in the lives of

others who are bearing witness to <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000014000112"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000017100002"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ, sometimes even to the

shedding of their blood.  For God is always wonderful in his works and

worthy of all praise.

<p>

  Nor should we forget that anything wrought by grace of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000014100024"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000023000087"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Holy

Spirit in the hearts of our separated brethren can contribute to our

own edification.  Whatever is truly Christian is never contrary to

what genuinely belongs to the the faith; indeed, it can always bring a

more perfect realization of the very mystery of Christ and the Church.



  Nevertheless, the divisions among Christians prevent the Church from

realizing the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000014100156"></a><a href="f.htm#_ICONOVEX_FULLNESSOFCATHOLICITY"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>fullness of catholicity proper to her in those of her

sons who, though joined to her by baptism, are yet separated from full

communion with her.  Furthermore, the Church herself finds it more

difficult to express in actual life her full catholicity in all its

aspects.

<p>

  This sacred Council is gratified to note that the participation by

the Catholic faithful in <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000014200033"></a><a href="e.htm#_ICONOVEX_ECUMENICALWORK"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>ecumenical work is growing daily.  It

commends this work to the bishops everywhere in the world for their

diligent promotion and prudent guidance.

				<h3>Chapter 2

			THE PRACTICE OF ECUMENISM</h3>

</center>



  5. The concern for restoring unity involves the whole Church,

faithful and clergy alike.  It extends to everyone, according to the

talents of each, whether it be exercised in daily Christian living or

in theological and historical studies.  This concern itself already

reveals to some extent the bond of brotherhood existing among all

Christians and it leads toward full and prefect unity, in accordance

with what God in his kindness wills.


<p>
  6. Every renewal of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000017000012"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CHURCH23"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Church [23] essentially consists in an

increase of fidelity to her own calling.  Undoubtedly this explains

the dynamism of the movement toward unity.

<p>

  <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000017100002"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000017300330"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ summons the Church, as she goes her pilgrim way, to that

continual reformation of which she always has need, insofar as she is

an institution of men here on earth.  Consequently, if, in various

times and circumstances, there have been deficiencies in moral conduct

or in Church discipline, or even in the way that Church teaching has

been formulated -- to be carefully distinguished from the deposit of

faith itself -- these should be set right at the opportune moment and

in the proper way.

<p>

  Church renewal therefore has notable <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000017200012"></a><a href="e.htm#_ICONOVEX_ECUMENICALIMPORTANCE"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>ecumenical importance.  Already

this renewal is taking place in various spheres of the Church's life:

the biblical and liturgical movements, the preaching of the Word of

God and catechetics, the apostolate of the laity, new forms of

religious life and the spirituality of married life, and the Church's

social teaching and activity.  All these should be considered as

promises and guarantees for the future progress of ecumenism.

<p>

  7. There can be no ecumenism worthy of the name without interior

conversion.  For it is from newness of attitudes of mind [24], from

self-denial and unstinted love, that desires of unity take their rise

and develop in a mature way.  We should therefore pray to the Holy

Spirit for the grace to be genuinely self-denying, humble, gently in

the service of others and to have an attitude of brotherly generosity

toward them.  The Apostle to the Gentiles says: "I, therefore, a

prisoner for the Lord, beg you to lead a life worthy of the calling to

which you have been called, with all humility and meekness, with

patience, forbearing one another in love, eager to maintain the unity

of the spirit in the bond of peace" (Eph. 4:1-3).  This exhortation is

directed especially to those raised to sacred orders in order that the

mission of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000017300330"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000018600514"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ may be continued.  He came among us "not to be

served but to serve" (Mt. 20:28).

<p>

  St. John has testified: "If we say we have not sinned, we make him a

liar, and his word is not in us" (1 Jn. 1:10).  This holds good for

sins against unity.  Thus, in humble prayer we beg pardon of God and

of our separated brethren, just as we forgive them that offend us.

<p>

  The faithful should remember that they promote union among

Christians better, that indeed they live it better, when they try to

live holier lives according to the Gospel.  For the closer their union

with the Father, the Word, and the Spirit, the more deeply and easily

will they be able to grow in mutual brotherly love.

<p>

  8. This change of heart and holiness of life, along with public and

private prayer for the unity of Christians, should be regarded as the

soul of the whole ecumenical movement, and merits the name, "spiritual

ecumenism."
<p>


  It is a recognized custom for Catholics to meet for frequent

recourse to that prayer for the unity of the Church with which the

Saviour himself on the eve of his death so fervently appealed to his

Father: "That they may all be one" (Jn. 17:20>

<p>

  In certain circumstances, such as in prayer services "for unity" and

during ecumenical gatherings, it is allowable, indeed desirable that

Catholics should join in prayer with their separated brethren.  Such

prayers in common are certainly a very effective means of petitioning

for the grace of unity, and they are a genuine expression of the ties

which still bind Catholics to their separated brethren. "For where two

or three are gathered together in my name, there am I in the midst of

them" (Mt. 18:20).

<p>

  Yet worship in common (communicatio in sacris) is not to be

considered as a means to be used indiscriminately for the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000017900047"></a><a href="r.htm#_ICONOVEX_RESTORATIONOFUNITY"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>restoration

of unity among Christians.  There are two main principles upon which

the practice of such common worship depends: first, that of the unity

of the Church which ought to be expressed; and second, that the

sharing in the means of trace.  The expression of unity very generally

forbids common worship.  Grace to be obtained sometimes commends it.

The concrete course to be adopted, when all circumstances of time,

place and persons have been duly considered, is left to the prudent

decision of the local episcopal authority, unless the bishops'

conference according to its own statutes, or the Holy See, has

determined otherwise.

<p>

  9. We must become familiar with the outlook of our separated

brethren.  Study is absolutely required for this, and it should be

pursued in fidelity to the truth and with a spirit of good will.

Catholics who already have a proper grounding need to acquire a more

adequate understanding of the respective doctrines of our separated

brethren, their history, their spiritual and liturgical life, their

religious psychology and cultural background.  Most valuable for this

purpose are meetings of the two sides -- especially for the discussion

of theological problems -- where each can treat with the other on an

equal footing, provided that those who take part in them under the

guidance of the authorities are truly competent.  Form such dialogue

will emerge still more clearly what the situation of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000018000285"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000018200077"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Catholic

Church really is.  In this way, too, we will better understand the

outlook of our separated brethren and more aptly present our own belief.

<p>

  10. Sacred <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000018100007"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000018200027"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>theology and other branches of knowledge, especially

those of a historical nature, must be taught with due regard for the

ecumenical point of view, so that they may correspond as exactly as

possible with the facts.

<p>

  It is important that future pastors and priests should have mastered

a <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000018200027"></a><a href="t.htm#_ICONOVEX_THEOLOGY"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>theology that has been carefully elaborated in this way and not

polemically, especially in what concerns the relations of separated

brethren with the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000018200077"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000020200072"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Catholic Church.  For it is upon the formation which

priests receive that so largely depends the necessary instruction and

spiritual formation of the faithful and of the religious.


<p>
  Moreover, Catholics engaged in missionary work in the same

territories as other Christians ought to know, particularly in these

times, the problems and the benefits which affect their apostolate

because of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000018300071"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000021600005"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>ecumenical movement.


<p>
  11. The manner and order in which <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000018400016"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CATHOLICBELIEF"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Catholic belief is expressed

should in no way become an obstacle to dialogue with our brethren.  It

is, of course, essential that the doctrine be clearly presented in its

entirety.  Nothing is so foreign to the spirit of ecumenism as a false

<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000018400109"></a><a href="i.htm#_ICONOVEX_IRENICISM"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>irenicism which harms the purity of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000018400122"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000018500110"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Catholic doctrine and obscures its

genuine and certain meaning.

<p>

  Furthermore, in ecumenical dialogue, Catholic theologians, standing

fast by the teaching of the Church yet searching together with

separated brethren into the divine mysteries, should do so with love

for the truth, with charity, and with humility.  When comparing

doctrines with one another, they should remember that in <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000018500110"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CATHOLICDOCTRINE"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Catholic

doctrine there exists an order or "hierarchy" of truths, since they

vary in their relation to the foundation of the Christian faith.  Thus

the way will be opened whereby this kind of "fraternal rivalry" will

incite all to a deeper realization and a clearer expression of the

unfathomable riches of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000018500224"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CHRIST25"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ [25].
<p>


  12. Before the whole world let all Christians confess their faith in

God, one and three, in the incarnate Son of God, our Redeemer and

Lord.  United in their efforts, and with mutual respect, let them bear

witness to our common hope which does not play us false.  Since

cooperation in social matters is so widespread today, all men without

exception are called to work together; with much greater reason is

this true of all who believe in God, but most of all, it is especially

true of all Christians, since they bear the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000018600211"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CHRISTSNAMESEALOF"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>seal of Christ's name.

Cooperation among Christians vividly expresses that <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000018600234"></a><a href="b.htm#_ICONOVEX_BOND"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>bond which already

unites them, and it sets in clearer relief the features of Christ the

Servant.  Such cooperation, which has already begun in many countries,

should be developed more and more, particularly in regions where

social and <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000018600320"></a><a href="t.htm#_ICONOVEX_TECHNOLOGICALEVOLUTION"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>technological evolution is taking place.  It should

contribute to a just appreciation of the dignity of the human person,

to the promotion of the blessings of peace, the application of the

Gospel principle to social life, and the advancement of the arts and

sciences in a truly Christian spirit.  It should use every possible

means to relieve the afflictions of our times, such as famine and

natural disasters, illiteracy and poverty, lack of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000018600481"></a><a href="h.htm#_ICONOVEX_HOUSING"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>housing, and the

unequal <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000018600492"></a><a href="d.htm#_ICONOVEX_DISTRIBUTIONOFWEALTH"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>distribution of wealth.  Through such cooperation, all

believers in <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000018600514"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000019400047"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ are able to learn easily how they can understand

each other better and esteem each other more, and how the road to the

unity of Christians may be made smooth.

  13. We now turn our attention to the two principal types of division

which affect the seamless robe of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000019400047"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000020400087"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ.  The first divisions

occurred in the East, either because of the dispute over the dogmatic

formulae of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000019400090"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_COUNCILSOFEPHESUS"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Councils of Ephesus and <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000019400099"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CHALCEDON"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Chalcedon, or later by the

dissolving of ecclesiastical communion between the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000019400124"></a><a href="e.htm#_ICONOVEX_EASTERNPATRIARCHATES"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Eastern

Patriarchates and the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000019400134"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000020200146"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Roman See.  Still other divisions arose in the

West more than four centuries later.  These stemmed from the events

which are commonly referred to as the Reformation.  As a result, many

communions, national or confessional, were separated from the Roman

See.  Among those in which <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000019400236"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CATHOLICTRADITIONS"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Catholic traditions and institutions in

part continue to exist, the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000019400259"></a><a href="index.htm#_ICONOVEX_ANGLICANCOMMUNION"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Anglican communion occupies a special

place.

<p>

  These various divisions, however, differ greatly from one another

not only by reason of their origin, place and time, but still more by

reason of the nature and seriousness of questions concerning faith and

Church order.  Therefore, without minimizing the differences between

the various <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000019500100"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CHRISTIANBODIES"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christian bodies, and without overlooking the bonds which

continue to exist among them in spite of the division, the Council has

decided to propose the following considerations for prudent <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000019500163"></a><a href="e.htm#_ICONOVEX_ECUMENICALACTION"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>ecumenical

action.


<p>


I. The Special Position of the Eastern Churches
<p>
-----------------------------------------------
<p>


  14. For many centuries the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000019800014"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000020000011"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Churches of the East and of the West went

their own ways, though a brotherly communion of faith and sacramental

life bound them together.  If disagreements in faith and discipline

arose among them, the Roman See acted by common consent as moderator.

<p>

  This Council gladly reminds everyone of one highly significant fact

among others: in the East there flourish many particular local

Churches; among them the Patriarchal Churches hold first place, and of

them many glory in taking their origins from the apostles themselves.

Hence, of primary concern and care among the Orientals has been, and

still is, the preservation in a communion of faith and <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000019900142"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CHARITYOFFAMILYTIES"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>charity of

those family ties which ought to exist between local Churches, as

between sisters.


<p>
  From their very origins the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000020000011"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000020200109"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Churches of the East have had a treasury

from which the Church or <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000020000039"></a><a href="t.htm#_ICONOVEX_THWEST"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>th West has drawn largely for its liturgy,

spiritual tradition and jurisprudence.  Nor must we underestimate the

fact that the basic <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000020000086"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CHRISTIANFAITHDOGMASOF"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>dogmas of the Christian faith concerning the

Trinity and the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000020000108"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000022000060"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Word of God made flesh from the Virgin Mary were

defined in <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000020000134"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000020800056"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Ecumenical Councils held in the East.  To preserve this

faith, these Churches have suffered, and still suffer much.

<p>

  However, the heritage handed down by the apostles was received

differently and in different forms, so that from the very beginnings

of the Church its development varied from region to region and also

because of differing mentalities and ways of life.  These reasons,

plus external causes, as well as a lack of charity and mutual

understanding, left the way open to divisions.

<p>

  For this reason the Council urges all, but especially those who

commit themselves to the work for the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000020200040"></a><a href="r.htm#_ICONOVEX_RESTORATIONOFFULLCOMMUNION"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>restoration of the full

communion that is desired between the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000020200062"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000020700053"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Eastern Churches and the

<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000020200072"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000021100220"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Catholic Church, to give due consideration to this special feature of

the origin and growth of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000020200109"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000020800014"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Churches of the East, and to the

character of the relations which obtained between them and the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000020200146"></a><a href="r.htm#_ICONOVEX_ROMANSEE"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Roman

See before the separation, and to form for themselves a correct

evaluation of these facts.  The careful observation of this will

greatly contribute to the dialogue in view.

<p>

  15. Everyone knows with what love the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000020300017"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000020400013"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Eastern Christians celebrate

the sacred liturgy, especially the eucharistic mystery, source of the

Church's life and pledge of future glory.  In this mystery the

faithful, united with their bishops, have access to God the Father

through the Son, the Word made flesh who suffered and was glorified,

in the outpouring of the Holy Spirit.  And so, made "sharers of the

divine nature" (2 Pet. 1:4), they enter into communion with the most

holy Trinity.  Hence, through the celebration of the Eucharist of the

Lord in each of these Churches, the Church of God is built up and

grows in stature [26], and through concelebration, their communion

with one another is made manifest.

<p>

  In this liturgical worship, the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000020400013"></a><a href="e.htm#_ICONOVEX_EASTERNCHRISTIANS"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Eastern Christians pay high tribute,

in beautiful hymns of praise, to <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000020400039"></a><a href="m.htm#_ICONOVEX_MARYVIRGIN"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Mary ever Virgin, whom the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000020400051"></a><a href="s.htm#_ICONOVEX_SYNODOFEPHESUSECUMENICAL"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>ecumenical

Synod of Ephesus solemnly proclaimed to be the holy <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000020400073"></a><a href="m.htm#_ICONOVEX_MOTHEROFGOD"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Mother of God in

order that <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000020400087"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000021800253"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ might be truly and properly acknowledged as <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000020400104"></a><a href="s.htm#_ICONOVEX_SONOFGOD"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Son of

God and <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000020400114"></a><a href="s.htm#_ICONOVEX_SONOFMAN"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Son of Man, according to the scriptures.  They also give

homage to the saints, among them the Fathers of the universal Church.

<p>

  These Churches, although separated from us, yet possess true

sacraments, above all -- by apostolic succession -- the priesthood and

the Eucharist, whereby they are still joined to us in closest

intimacy.  Therefore some worship in common (communicatio in sacris),

given suitable circumstances and approval of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000020500106"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CHURCHAUTHORITY"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Church authority, is not

merely possible but is encouraged.

<p>

  Moreover, in the East are to be found the riches of those spiritual

traditions which are given expression in monastic life especially.

>From the glorious times of the holy <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000020600065"></a><a href="f.htm#_ICONOVEX_FATHERSMONASTICSPIRITUALITY"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Fathers, that monastic

spirituality flourished in the East which alter flowed over to the

<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000020600097"></a><a href="w.htm#_ICONOVEX_WESTERNWORLD"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Western world, and there provided a source from which Latin monastic

life took its rise and has often drawn fresh vigor ever since.

Therefore, it is earnestly recommended that Catholics avail themselves

more often of the spiritual riches of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000020600184"></a><a href="e.htm#_ICONOVEX_EASTERNFATHERS"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Eastern Fathers which lift

up the whole man to the contemplation of divine mysteries.
<p>


  Everyone should realize that it is of supreme importance to

understand, venerate, preserve and foster the rich liturgical and

spiritual heritage of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000020700053"></a><a href="e.htm#_ICONOVEX_EASTERNCHURCHES"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Eastern Churches in order to faithfully

preserve the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000020700071"></a><a href="f.htm#_ICONOVEX_FULLNESSOFCHRISTIANTRADITION"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>fullness of Christian tradition, and to bring about

reconciliation between Eastern and <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000020700098"></a><a href="w.htm#_ICONOVEX_WESTERNCHRISTIANS"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Western Christians.


<p>
  16. From the earliest times the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000020800014"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000020800166"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Churches of the East followed their

own disciplines, sanctioned by the holy Fathers, by Synods, and even

by <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000020800056"></a><a href="e.htm#_ICONOVEX_ECUMENICALCOUNCILS"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Ecumenical Councils.  Far from being an obstacle to the Church's

unity, such <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000020800084"></a><a href="d.htm#_ICONOVEX_DIVERSITYOFCUSTOMS"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>diversity of customs and observances only adds to her

beauty and contributes greatly to carrying out her mission, as has

already been stated.  To remove all shadow of doubt, then, this holy

Synod solemnly declares that the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000020800166"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CHURCHESOFEAST"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Churches of the East, while keeping

in mind the necessary unity of the whole Church, have the power to

govern themselves according to their own disciplines, since these are

better suited to the character of their faithful and better adapted to

foster the good of souls.  The perfect observance of this traditional

principle -- which indeed has not always been observed -- is a

prerequisite for any restoration of union.

<p>

  17. What has already been said about legitimate variety we are

pleased to apply to differences in theological expressions of

doctrine.  In the study of revealed truth East and West have used

different methods and approaches in understanding and confessing

divine things.  It is hardly surprising, then, if sometimes one

tradition can come nearer to a full appreciation of some aspects of a

mystery of revelation than the other, or has expressed them better.

In such cases, these various <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000020900175"></a><a href="t.htm#_ICONOVEX_THEOLOGICALFORMULATIONS"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>theological formulations are often to be

considered complementary rather than conflicting.  With regard to the

authentic theological traditions of the Orientals, we must recognize

that they are admirably rooted in Holy Scripture, are fostered and

given expression in liturgical life, are nourished by the living

tradition of the apostles and by the works of the Fathers and

spiritual writers of the East; they are directed toward a right

ordering of life, indeed, toward a full contemplation of Christian

truth.

<p>

  This sacred Council thanks God that many Eastern children of the

<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000021000025"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CATHOLICCHURCHPRESERVE"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Catholic Church preserve this heritage and wish to express it more

faithfully and completely in their lives, and are already living in

full communion with their brethren who follow the tradition of the

West.  But it declares that this entire heritage of spirituality and

liturgy, of discipline and theology, in the various traditions,

belongs to the full catholic and apostolic character of the Church.

<p>

  18. After taking all these factors into consideration, this sacred

Council confirms what previous Councils and <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000021100037"></a><a href="r.htm#_ICONOVEX_ROMANPONTIFFS"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Roman Pontiffs have

proclaimed: in order to restore communion and unity or preserve them,

one must "impose no burden beyond what is indispensable" (Acts 15:28).

It is the Council's urgent desire that every effort should be made

toward the gradual realization of this unity in the various

organizations and living activities of the Church, especially by

prayer and by fraternal dialogue on points of doctrine and the more

pressing pastoral problems of our time.  Similarly, to the pastors and

faithful of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000021100220"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000021400091"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Catholic Church, it commends close relations with

those no longer living in the East but far from their homeland, so

that friendly collaboration with them may increase in a spirit of

love, without bickering or rivalry.  If this task is carried on

wholeheartedly, the Council hopes that with the removal of the wall

dividing the Eastern and <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000021100345"></a><a href="w.htm#_ICONOVEX_WESTERNCHURCH"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Western Church there may be but one dwelling,

firmly established on the cornerstone, Christ Jesus, who will make

both one [27].

II. The Separated Churches and Ecclesial Communities in the West
<p>
----------------------------------------------------------------
<p>


  19. The Churches and <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000021400012"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000021500012"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>ecclesial communities which were separated from

West at the end of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000021400068"></a><a href="m.htm#_ICONOVEX_MIDDLEAGES"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Middle Ages or in later times, are bound to the

<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000021400091"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000021600025"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Catholic Church by a specially close relationship as a result of the

long span of earlier centuries when the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000021400131"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CHRISTIANPEOPLE"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christian people had lived in

ecclesiastical communion.

<p>

  But since these Churches and <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000021500012"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000021700032"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>ecclesial communities differ

considerably not only from us, but also among themselves, due to their

different origins and convictions in doctrine and spiritual life, the

task of describing them adequately is extremely difficult; we do not

propose to do it here.


<p>
  Although the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000021600005"></a><a href="e.htm#_ICONOVEX_ECUMENICALMOVEMENT"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>ecumenical movement and the desire for peace with the

<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000021600025"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000021700051"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Catholic Church have not yet taken hold everywhere, it is nevertheless

our hope that the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000021600058"></a><a href="e.htm#_ICONOVEX_ECUMENICALSPIRIT"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>ecumenical spirit and <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000021600065"></a><a href="m.htm#_ICONOVEX_MUTUALESTEEM"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>mutual esteem will gradually

increase among all men.
<p>


  At the same time, however, one should recognize that between these

Churches and <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000021700032"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000022500006"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>ecclesial communities, on the one hand, and the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000021700051"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000021800124"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Catholic

Church on the other, there are very weighty differences not only of a

historical, sociological, psychological and cultural character, but

especially in interpretation of revealed truth.  To facilitate

entering into the ecumenical dialogue in spite of these differences,

we wish to set down in what follows some considerations which can, and

indeed should serve as a basis and encouragement for such dialogue.

<p>

  20. Our thoughts are concerned first of all with those Christians

who openly confess Jesus Christ as God and Lord and the only Mediator

between God and man for the glory of the one God, the Father, the Son

and the Holy Spirit.  We are indeed aware that there exist

considerable differences from the doctrine of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000021800124"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000022900203"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Catholic Church even

concerning <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000021800134"></a><a href="w.htm#_ICONOVEX_WORDOFGODCHRIST"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ the Word of God made flesh and the work of

redemption, and thus concerning the mystery and <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000021800173"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CHURCHMINISTRYOF"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>ministry of the Church

and the role of Mary in the work of salvation.  But we rejoice that

our separated brethren look to Christ as the source and center of

ecclesiastical communion.  Their longing for union with <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000021800253"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000022000040"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ impels

them ever more to seek unity, and also to bear witness to their faith

among the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000021800293"></a><a href="p.htm#_ICONOVEX_PEOPLESOFEARTH"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>peoples of the earth.
<p>


  21. A love and reverence -- almost a cult -- of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000021900026"></a><a href="h.htm#_ICONOVEX_HOLYSCRIPTURE"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Holy Scripture leads

our brethren to a constant and diligent study of the sacred text.  For

the Gospel "is the power of God for salvation to everyone who has

faith, to the Jew first and then to the Greek" (Rom. 1:16).

<p>

  While invoking the Holy Spirit, they seek in these very scriptures

God as he speaks to them in <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000022000040"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000022000093"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ, the one whom the prophets

foretold, the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000022000060"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000022100125"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Word of God made flesh for us.  In the scriptures they

contemplate the life of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000022000093"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000022300076"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ, as well as the teachings and the

actions of the Divine Master for the salvation of men, in particular

the mysteries of his death and resurrection.

<p>

  But when Christians separated from us affirm the divine authority of

the sacred books, they think differently from us -- different ones in

different ways -- about the relationship between the scriptures and

the Church.  For in the Church, according to Catholic belief, its

authentic teaching office has a special place in expounding and

preaching the written <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000022100125"></a><a href="w.htm#_ICONOVEX_WORDOFGOD"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Word of God.


<p>
  Nevertheless, in the dialogue itself, the sacred Word is a precious

instrument in the mighty hand of God for attaining to that unity which

the Saviour holds out to all men.

<p>

  22. By the sacrament of Baptism, whenever it is properly conferred

in the way the Lord determined and received with the proper

disposition of soul, man becomes truly incorporated into the crucified

and glorified <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000022300076"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000022400142"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ and is reborn to a sharing of the divine life, as

the Apostle says: "For you were buried together with him in baptism,

and in him also rose again through faith in the working of God who

raised him from the dead" [28].

<p>

  Baptism, therefore, constitutes the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000022400012"></a><a href="b.htm#_ICONOVEX_BONDOFUNITYSACRAMENTAL"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>sacramental bond of unity

existing among all who through it are reborn.  But baptism, of itself,

is only a beginning, a point of departure, for it is wholly directed

toward the acquiring of fullness of life in Christ.  Baptism is thus

ordained toward a complete profession of faith, a complete

<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000022400125"></a><a href="i.htm#_ICONOVEX_INCORPORATION"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>incorporation into the system of salvation such as <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000022400142"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000022500151"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ himself

willed it to be, and finally, toward a complete integration into

eucharistic communion.

<p>

  Although the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000022500006"></a><a href="e.htm#_ICONOVEX_ECCLESIALCOMMUNITIES"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>ecclesial communities separated from us lack the

fullness of unity with us which flows from baptism, and although we

believe they have not preserved the proper reality of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000022500068"></a><a href="e.htm#_ICONOVEX_EUCHARISTICMYSTERY"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>eucharistic

mystery in its <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000022500078"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000022900232"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>fullness, especially because of the absence of the

sacrament of Orders, nevertheless when they commemorate the Lord's

death and resurrection in the Holy Supper, they profess that it

signifies life in communion with <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000022500151"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000022600033"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ and await his coming in glory.

For these reasons, the doctrine about the Lord's Supper, about the

other sacraments, worship, and ministry in the Church, should form

subjects of dialogue.

<p>

  23. The <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000022600007"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CHRISTIANWAY"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christian way of life of these brethren is nourished by

faith in <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000022600033"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CHRIST"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ.  It is strengthened by the grace of baptism and the

hearing of the Word of God.  This way of life expresses itself in

private prayer, in mediation on the scriptures, in the life of a

<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000022600113"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CHRISTIANFAMILY"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christian family, and in the worship of the community gathered

together to praise God.  Furthermore, their worship sometimes displays

notable features of a liturgy once shared in common.

<p>

  The faith by which they believe in Christ bears fruit in praise and

thanksgiving for the benefits received from the hands of God.  Joined

to it is a lively sense of justice and a true charity towards others.

This active faith has been responsible for many organizations for the

relief of spiritual and material distress, the furtherance of

education of youth, the improvement of social conditions of life, and

the promotion of peace throughout the world.
<p>


  And if in moral matters there are many Christians who do not always

understand the Gospel in the same way as Catholics, and do not admit

the same solutions for the more difficult problems of modern society,

they nevertheless want to cling to <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000022800094"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CHRISTSWORD"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ's word as the source of

<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000022800108"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CHRISTIANVIRTUE"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christian virtue and to obey the command of the Apostle: "Whatever you

do in word or in work, do all in the name of the Lord Jesus, giving

thanks to God the Father through him: (Col. 3:17).  Hence, the

<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000022800200"></a><a href="e.htm#_ICONOVEX_ECUMENICALDIALOGUE"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>ecumenical dialogue could start with the moral application of the

Gospel.

<p>

  24. Now, after this brief exposition of the conditions under which

<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000022900027"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000022900131"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>ecumenical activity may be practiced, and of the principles by which

it is to be guided, we confidently look to the future.  This sacred

Council urges the faithful to abstain from any frivolous or imprudent

zeal, for these can cause harm to true progress toward unity.  Their

<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000022900131"></a><a href="e.htm#_ICONOVEX_ECUMENICALACTIVITY"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>ecumenical activity cannot be other than fully and sincerely Catholic,

that is, loyal to the truth we have received from the Apostles and the

Fathers, and in harmony with the faith which the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000022900203"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000023000029"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Catholic Church has

always professed, and at the same time tending toward that <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000022900232"></a><a href="f.htm#_ICONOVEX_FULLNESS"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>fullness in

which our Lord wants his Body to grow in the course of time.

<p>

  This sacred Council firmly hopes that the initiatives of the sons of

the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000023000029"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CATHOLICCHURCH"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Catholic Church, joined with those of the separated brethren, will

go forward obstructing the ways of divine Providence, and without

prejudging the future inspirations of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000023000087"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000023000271"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Holy Spirit.  Further, this

Council declares that it realizes that this holy objective -- the

reconciliation of all Christians in the unity of the one and only

<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000023000147"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CHURCHOFCHRIST"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Church of Christ -- transcends human powers and gifts.  It therefore

places its hope entirely in the prayer of Christ for the Church, in

the love of the Father for us, and in the power of the Holy Spirit.

"And hope does not disappoint, because <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000023000247"></a><a href="g.htm#_ICONOVEX_GODSLOVE"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>God's love has been poured

forth in our hearts through the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000023000271"></a><a href="h.htm#_ICONOVEX_HOLYSPIRIT"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Holy Spirit who has been given to us"

(Rom. 5:5).

objectives are, <i>inter alia:</i> national security requirements; the
prevention of deceptive practices; protection of human <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000193300153"></a><a href="16.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000193300171"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>health or safety,

procedures are prepared, adopted and applied so as to grant access for
suppliers of like products originating in the territories of other Members
under conditions no less favorable than those accorded to suppliers of like

conformity assessment procedure is published or that the anticipated
processing period is communicated to the applicant upon request; when
receiving an application, the competent body promptly examines the
completeness of the documentation and informs the applicant in a precise and

possible the results of the assessment in a precise and complete manner to
the applicant so that corrective action may be taken if necessary; even when

practicable with the conformity assessment if the applicant so requests; and

a way which facilitates active and representative participation of relevant
bodies in all Members, taking into account the special problems of developing
country Members.<p>12.6    Members shall take such reasonable measures as may
be available to them to ensure that international standardizing bodies, upon
request of developing country Members, examine the possibility of, and, if
practicable, prepare international standards concerning products of special

accordance with the provisions of Article&#160;11, provide <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000208400026"></a><a href="19.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000270300023"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>technical

the terms and conditions of the technical assistance, account shall be taken
of the stage of development of the requesting Members and in particular of
the least-developed country Members.<p>12.8    It is recognized that
developing country Members may face special problems, including institutional
and infrastructural problems, in the field of preparation and application of

further recognized that the special development and trade needs of developing
country Members, as well as their stage of technological development, may
hinder their ability to discharge fully their obligations under this
Agreement. Members, therefore, shall take this fact fully into account.
Accordingly, with a view to ensuring that developing country Members are able
to comply with this Agreement, the Committee on <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000208500205"></a><a href="16.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000209300012"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Technical Barriers to Trade
provided for in Article&#160;13 (referred to in this Agreement as the "Committee")

whole or in part from obligations under this Agreement. When considering such
requests the Committee shall take into account the special problems, in the
field of preparation and application of technical regulations, standards and
conformity assessment procedures, and the special development and trade needs
of the developing country Member, as well as its stage of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000208500382"></a><a href="26.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000464500080"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>technological
development, which may hinder its ability to discharge fully its obligations
under this Agreement. The Committee shall, in particular, take into account
the special problems of the least-developed country Members. <p>12.9
During consultations, developed country Members shall bear in mind the
special difficulties experienced by developing country Members in formulating
and implementing standards and <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000208600049"></a><a href="16.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000212900039"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>technical regulations and conformity
assessment procedures, and in their desire to assist developing country
Members with their efforts in this direction, developed country Members shall take account of the special
needs of the former in regard to financing, trade and development.<p>

serve on a technical expert group. Members of technical expert groups shall
serve in their individual capacities and not as government representatives,
nor as representatives of any organization. Governments or organizations
shall therefore not give them instructions with regard to matters before a
technical expert group.<p>4.    Technical expert groups may consult and seek
information and <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000215300021"></a><a href="27.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000548200021"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>technical advice from any source they deem appropriate.
Before a technical expert group seeks such information or advice from a
source within the jurisdiction of a Member, it shall inform the government of
that Member. Any Member shall respond promptly and fully to any request by a
technical expert group for such information as the technical expert group
considers necessary and appropriate.<p>5.      The parties to a dispute shall
have access to all relevant information provided to a technical expert group,
unless it is of a confidential nature. Confidential information provided to
the technical expert group shall not be released without formal authorization
from the government, organization or person providing the information. Where
such information is requested from the technical expert group but release of
such information by the technical expert group is not authorized, a
non-confidential summary of the information will be provided by the
government, organization or person supplying the information.<p> 6.    The
technical expert group shall submit a draft report to the Members concerned
with a view to obtaining their comments, and taking them into account, as
appropriate, in the final report, which shall also be circulated to the
Members concerned when it is submitted to the panel.<p>

adopting a standard, the standardizing body shall allow a period of at least
60 days for the submission of comments on the draft standard by interested
parties within the territory of a <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000217400070"></a><a href="29a.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000624300011"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Member of the WTO. This period may,
however, be shortened in cases where urgent problems of safety, health or
environment arise or threaten to arise. No later than at the start of the
comment period, the standardizing body shall publish a notice announcing the
period for commenting in the publication referred to in paragraph&#160;<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000217400185"></a><a href="j.htm#_ICONOVEX_JSUCHNOTIFICATION"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>J.
Such notification shall include, as far as practicable, whether the draft
standard deviates from relevant <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000217400221"></a><a href="20.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000295000079"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>international standards.<p>M.    On the
request of any interested party within the territory of a Member of the WTO,
the standardizing body shall promptly provide, or arrange to provide, a copy
of a draft standard which it has submitted for comments. Any fees charged for
this service shall, apart from the real cost of delivery, be the same for
foreign and domestic parties.<p>N.    The standardizing body shall take into
account, in the further processing of the standard, the comments received
during the period for commenting. Comments received through standardizing
bodies that have accepted this Code of Good Practice shall, if so requested,
be replied to as promptly as possible. The reply shall include an explanation
why a deviation from relevant international standards is necessary.<p>O.
Once the standard has been adopted, it shall be promptly published.<p>P.
On the request of any interested party within the territory of a Member of
the WTO, the standardizing body shall promptly provide, or arrange to
provide, a copy of its most recent work program or of a standard which it
produced. Any fees charged for this service shall, apart from the real cost
of delivery, be the same for foreign and domestic parties.<p>Q.    The
standardizing body shall afford sympathetic consideration to, and adequate
opportunity for, consultation regarding representations with respect to the
operation of this Code presented by standardizing bodies that have accepted
this <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000217900067"></a><a href="37.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000673000144"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Code of Good Practice. It shall make an objective effort to solve any

<h1>
AGREEMENT ON IMPLEMENTATION OF ARTICLE&#160;VII OF THE GENERAL AGREEMENT ON
TARIFFS AND TRADE&#160;1994 </h1>
<p>


<i>General Introductory Commentary </i><p>


1.    The primary basis for customs value under this Agreement is
"transaction value" as defined in Article&#160;1. Article&#160;1 is to be read
together with Article&#160;8 which provides, <i>inter-alia</i>, for
adjustments to the price actually paid or payable in cases where certain
specific elements which are considered to form a part of the value for
customs purposes are incurred by the buyer but are not included in the price
actually paid or payable for the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000253000165"></a><a href="19.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000253100202"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>imported goods. Article&#160;8 also provides for
the inclusion in the transaction value of certain considerations which may
pass from the buyer to the seller in the form of specified goods or services
rather than in the form of money.  Articles&#160;2 through&#160;7 provide methods of
determining the customs value whenever it cannot be determined under the
provisions of Article&#160;1. <p>2.    Where the customs value cannot be
determined under the provisions of Article&#160;1 there should normally be a
process of consultation between the customs administration and importer with
a view to arriving at a basis of value under the provisions of Article&#160;2 or
3. It may occur, for example, that the importer has information about the
customs value of identical or similar imported goods which is not immediately
available to the customs administration in the port of importation. On the
other hand, the customs administration may have information about the
customs value of identical or similar <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000253100202"></a><a href="19.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000256600022"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>imported goods which is not readily
available to the importer.  A process of consultation between the two parties
will enable information to be exchanged, subject to the requirements of
commercial confidentiality, with a view to determining a proper basis of
value for customs purposes. <p>3.    Articles&#160;5 and&#160;6 provide two bases for
determining the customs value where it cannot be determined on the basis of
the transaction value of the imported goods or of identical or similar
imported goods. Under paragraph&#160;1 of Article&#160;5 the customs value is
determined on the basis of the price at which the goods are sold in the
condition as imported to an unrelated buyer in the country of importation.
The importer also has the right to have goods which are further processed
after importation valued under the provisions of Article&#160;5 if the importer so requests. Under Article
6 the customs value is determined on the basis of the computed value. Both
these methods present certain difficulties and because of this the importer
is given the right, under the provisions of Article&#160;4, to choose the order of
application of the two methods. <p> 4.    Article 7 sets out how to determine
the customs value in cases where it cannot be determined under the provisions

RULES ON CUSTOMS VALUATION </h2>

<h3>
Article 1 </h3>


1.    The customs value of imported goods shall be the transaction value,
that is the price actually paid or payable for the goods when sold for export
to the country of importation adjusted in accordance with the provisions of
Article&#160;8, provided: <p> (a)    that there are no restrictions as to the
disposition or use of the goods by the buyer other than restrictions which:
<p> (i)    are imposed or required by law or by the public authorities in the
country of importation; <p> (ii)    limit the geographical area in which the
goods may be resold; or <p> (iii)    do not substantially affect the value of
the goods; <p> (b)    that the sale or price is not subject to some condition
or consideration for which a value cannot be determined with respect to the
goods being valued; <p> (c)    that no part of the proceeds of any subsequent
resale, disposal or use of the goods by the buyer will accrue directly or
indirectly to the seller, unless an appropriate adjustment can be made in
accordance with the provisions of Article&#160;8; and <p> (d)    that the buyer
and seller are not related, or where the buyer and seller are related, that
the transaction value is acceptable for customs purposes under the provisions
of paragraph&#160;2. <p> 2.    (a)    In determining whether the transaction value
is acceptable for the purposes of paragraph&#160;1, the fact that the buyer
and the seller are related within the meaning of Article&#160;15 shall not in
itself be grounds for regarding the transaction value as unacceptable. In
such case the circumstances surrounding the sale shall be examined and the
transaction value shall be accepted provided that the relationship did not
influence the price. If, in the light of information provided by the importer
or otherwise, the customs administration has grounds for considering that the
relationship influenced the price, it shall communicate its grounds to the
importer and the importer shall be given a reasonable opportunity to respond.
If the importer so requests, the communication of the grounds shall be in
writing. <p> (b)    In a sale between related persons, the transaction value
shall be accepted and the goods valued in accordance with the provisions of
paragraph&#160;1 whenever the importer demonstrates that such value closely
approximates to one of the following occurring at or about the same time: <p>
(i)    the transaction value in sales to unrelated buyers of identical or
similar goods for export to the same country of importation; <p> (ii)    the
customs value of identical or similar goods as determined under the
provisions of Article&#160;5; <p> (iii)    the customs value of identical or
similar goods as determined under the provisions of Article&#160;6; <p> In
applying the foregoing tests, due account shall be taken of demonstrated
differences in <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000256200030"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_COMMERCIALLEVELS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>commercial levels, quantity levels, the elements enumerated in
Article&#160;8 and costs incurred by the seller in sales in which the seller
and the buyer are not related that are not incurred by the seller in sales in
which the seller and the buyer are related. <p> (c)    The tests set forth in
paragraph&#160;2(b) are to be used at the initiative of the importer and only for
comparison purposes. Substitute values may not be established under the
provisions of paragraph&#160;2(b). <p>

<h3>
Article 2  </h3>


1.    (a)    If the customs value of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000256600022"></a><a href="19.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000256800079"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>imported goods cannot be determined
under the provisions of Article&#160;1, the customs value shall be the
transaction value of identical goods sold for export to the same country of
importation and exported at or about the same time as the goods being valued.
<p> (b)    In applying this Article, the transaction value of identical goods
in a sale at the same commercial level and in substantially the same quantity
as the goods being valued shall be used to determine the customs value. Where
no such sale is found, the transaction value of identical goods sold at a
different <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000256700114"></a><a href="19.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000257300114"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>commercial level and/or in different quantities, adjusted to take
account of differences attributable to commercial level and/or to quantity,
shall be used, provided that such adjustments can be made on the basis of
demonstrated evidence which clearly establishes the reasonableness and
accuracy of the adjustment, whether the adjustment leads to an increase or a
decrease in the value. <p> 2.    Where the costs and charges referred to in
paragraph&#160;2 of Article&#160;8 are included in the transaction value, an
adjustment shall be made to take account of significant differences in such
costs and charges between the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000256800079"></a><a href="19.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000257200022"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>imported goods and the identical goods in
question arising from differences in distances and modes of transport. <p>3.
If, in applying this Article, more than one transaction value of identical
goods is found, the lowest such value shall be used to determine the customs
value of the imported goods. <p>

under the provisions of Articles&#160;1 and&#160;2, the customs value shall be the
transaction value of similar goods sold for export to the same country of
importation and exported at or about the same time as the goods being valued.
<p> (b)    In applying this Article, the transaction value of similar goods
in a sale at the same commercial level and in substantially the same quantity
as the goods being valued shall be used to determine the customs value. Where
no such sale is found, the transaction value of similar goods sold at a
different <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000257300114"></a><a href="19.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000276500045"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>commercial level and/or in different quantities, adjusted to take
account of differences attributable to commercial level and/or to quantity,
shall be used, provided that such adjustments can be made on the basis of
demonstrated evidence which clearly establishes the reasonableness and
accuracy of the adjustment, whether the adjustment leads to an increase or a
decrease in the value. <p> 2.    Where the costs and charges referred to in
paragraph&#160;2 of Article&#160;8 are included in the transaction value, an
adjustment shall be made to take account of significant differences in such
costs and charges between the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000257400079"></a><a href="19.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000257800015"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>imported goods and the similar goods in
question arising from differences in distances and modes of transport. <p>3.
If, in applying this Article, more than one transaction value of similar
goods is found, the lowest such value shall be used to determine the customs
value of the imported goods. <p>

quality and reputation. Minor differences in appearance would not preclude
goods otherwise conforming to the definition from being regarded as
identical; <p> (b)    "similar goods" means goods which, although not alike
in all respects, have like characteristics and like component materials which
enable them to perform the same functions and to be commercially
interchangeable. The quality of the goods, their reputation and the existence
of a <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000265600097"></a><a href="26.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000469900023"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>trademark are among the factors to be considered in determining whether
goods are similar; <p> (c)    the terms "identical goods" and "similar goods"
do not include, as the case may be, goods which incorporate or reflect
engineering, development, artwork, design work, and plans and sketches for
which no adjustment has been made under  paragraph&#160;1(b)(iv) of
Article&#160;8 because such elements were undertaken in the country of
importation; <p> (d)    goods shall not be regarded as "identical goods" or
"similar goods" unless they were produced in the same country as the goods
being valued;<p> (e)    goods produced by a different person shall be taken
into account only when there are no identical goods or similar goods, as the
case may be, produced by the same person as the goods being valued. <p> 3.

(b)    they are legally recognized partners in business; <p>
(c)    they are employer and employee; <p>

<h2>
    ANNEX I  <br>
INTERPRETATIVE NOTES  </h2>


<i>General Note </i><p>
<i>Sequential Application of Valuation Methods</i> <p>
1.    Articles&#160;1 through&#160;7 define how the customs value of imported goods is
to be determined under the provisions of this Agreement. The methods of
valuation are set out in a sequential order of application. The primary
method for customs valuation is defined in <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000273400094"></a><a href="index.htm#_ICONOVEX_ARTICLE1"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Article 1 and imported goods are
to be valued in accordance with the provisions of this Article whenever the
conditions prescribed therein are fulfilled. <p> 2.    Where the customs
value cannot be determined under the provisions of Article&#160;1, it is to be
determined by proceeding sequentially through the succeeding Articles to the
first such Article under which the customs value can be determined. Except as
provided in Article&#160;4, it is only when the customs value cannot be determined
under the provisions of a particular Article that the provisions of the next
Article in the sequence can be used. <p>3.    If the importer does not
request that the order of Articles&#160;5 and&#160;6 be reversed, the normal order of
the sequence is to be followed. If the importer does so request but it then
proves impossible to determine the customs value under the provisions of
Article&#160;6, the customs value is to be determined under the provisions of
Article&#160;5, if it can be so determined. <p>4.    Where the customs value
cannot be determined under the provisions of Articles&#160;1 through&#160;6 it is to be
determined under the provisions of Article&#160;7. <p> <i>Use of Generally
Accepted Accounting Principles</i> <p> 1.    "Generally accepted <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000273900009"></a><a href="19.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000274000052"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>accounting
principles" refers to the recognized consensus or substantial authoritative
support within a country at a particular time as to which <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000273900053"></a><a href="e.htm#_ICONOVEX_ECONOMICRESOURCES"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>economic resources
and obligations should be recorded as assets and liabilities, which changes
in assets and liabilities should be recorded, how the assets and liabilities
and changes in them should be measured, what information should be disclosed
and how it should be disclosed, and which financial statements should be
prepared. These standards may be broad guidelines of general application as
well as detailed practices and procedures. <p> 2.     For the purposes of
this Agreement, the customs <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000274000021"></a><a href="m.htm#_ICONOVEX_MEMBERADMINISTRATIONOFEACH"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>administration of each Member shall utilize
information prepared in a manner consistent with generally accepted
<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000274000052"></a><a href="19.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000283200145"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>accounting principles in the country which is appropriate for the Article in
question. For example, the determination of usual profit and general expenses
under the provisions of Article&#160;5 would be carried out utilizing information
prepared in a manner consistent with generally accepted <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000274000141"></a><a href="index.htm#_ICONOVEX_ACCOUNTINGPRINCIPLESOFCOUNTRYOFIMPORTATION"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>accounting principles
of the country of importation. On the other hand, the determination of usual
profit and general expenses under the provisions of Article&#160;6 would be
carried out utilizing information prepared in a manner consistent with
generally accepted <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000274000222"></a><a href="index.htm#_ICONOVEX_ACCOUNTINGPRINCIPLESOFCOUNTRYOFPRODUCTION"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>accounting principles of the country of production. As a
further example, the determination of an element provided for in
paragraph&#160;1(b)(ii) of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000274000275"></a><a href="24.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000397400077"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Article 8 undertaken in the country of importation would be carried out utilizing
information in a manner consistent with the generally accepted <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000274000320"></a><a href="index.htm#_ICONOVEX_ACCOUNTINGPRINCIPLESOFCOUNTRY"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>accounting
principles of that country. <p> <i>Note to Article 1</i> <p> <i>Price
Actually Paid or Payable</i> <p> 1.    The price actually paid or payable is
the total payment made or to be made by the buyer to or for the benefit of
the seller for the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000274300060"></a><a href="19.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000274900073"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>imported goods. The payment need not necessarily take the
form of a transfer of money. Payment may be made by way of letters of credit
or negotiable instruments. Payment may be made directly or indirectly. An
example of an indirect payment would be the settlement by the buyer, whether
in whole or in part, of a debt owed by the seller. <p> 2.    Activities
undertaken by the buyer on the buyer's own account, other than those for
which an adjustment is provided in Article 8, are not considered to be an
indirect payment to the seller, even though they might be regarded as of
benefit to the seller. The costs of such activities shall not, therefore, be
added to the price actually paid or payable in determining the customs value.
<p> 3.    The customs value shall not include the following charges or costs,
provided that they are distinguished from the price actually paid or payable
for the imported goods: <p> (a)    charges for construction, erection,
assembly, maintenance or technical assistance, undertaken after importation
on imported goods such as industrial plant, machinery or equipment; <p> (b)
the cost of transport after importation; <p> (c)    duties and taxes of the
country of importation. <p> 4.    The price actually paid or payable refers
to the price for the imported goods. Thus the flow of dividends or other
payments from the buyer to the seller that do not relate to the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000274900073"></a><a href="19.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000275500013"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>imported
goods are not part of the customs value. <p> <i>Paragraph 1(a)(iii</i>) <p>
    Among restrictions which would not render a price actually paid or
    payable unacceptable are restrictions which do not substantially affect
the value of the goods. An example of such restrictions would be the case
where a seller requires a buyer of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000275100084"></a><a href="index.htm#_ICONOVEX_AUTOMOBILES"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>automobiles not to sell or exhibit them
prior to a fixed date which represents the beginning of a model year. <p>
<i>Paragraph 1(b</i>) <p>
1.    If the sale or price is subject to some condition or consideration for
which a value cannot be determined with respect to the goods being valued,
the transaction value shall not be acceptable for customs purposes. Some
examples of this include: <p> (a)    the seller establishes the price of the
imported goods on condition that the buyer will also buy other goods in
specified quantities; <p> (b)    the price of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000275500013"></a><a href="19.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000275500044"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>imported goods is dependent
upon the price or prices at which the buyer of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000275500044"></a><a href="19.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000275500065"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>imported goods sells other
goods to the seller of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000275500065"></a><a href="19.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000275600035"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>imported goods; <p> (c)    the price is
established on the basis of a form of payment extraneous to the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000275600035"></a><a href="19.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000277400026"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>imported
goods, such as where the imported goods are semi-finished goods which have
been provided by the seller on condition that the seller will receive a
specified quantity of the finished goods. <p> 2.    However, conditions or
considerations relating to the production or marketing of the imported goods
shall not result in rejection of the transaction value. For example, the fact
that the buyer furnishes the seller with engineering and plans undertaken in
the country of importation shall not result in rejection of the transaction
value for the purposes of Article&#160;1. Likewise, if the buyer undertakes on the
buyer's own account, even though by agreement with the seller, activities
relating to the marketing of the imported goods, the value of these
activities is not part of the customs value nor shall such activities result
in rejection of the transaction value.  <i>Paragraph 2 </i><p> 1.
Paragraphs&#160;2(a) and&#160;2(b) provide different means of establishing the
acceptability of a transaction value. <p> 2.    Paragraph 2(a) provides that
where the buyer and the seller are related, the circumstances surrounding the
sale shall be examined and the transaction value shall be accepted as the
customs value provided that the relationship did not influence the price. It
is not intended that there should be an examination of the circumstances in
all cases where the buyer and the seller are related. Such examination will
only be required where there are doubts about the acceptability of the price.
Where the customs administration have no doubts about the acceptability of
the price, it should be accepted without requesting further information from
the importer. For example, the customs administration may have previously
examined the relationship, or it may already have detailed information
concerning the buyer and the seller, and may already be satisfied from such
examination or information that the relationship did not influence the price.
<p>3.    Where the customs administration is unable to accept the transaction
value without further inquiry, it should give the importer an opportunity to
supply such further detailed information as may be necessary to enable it to
examine the circumstances surrounding the sale. In this context, the customs
administration should be prepared to examine relevant aspects of the
transaction, including the way in which the buyer and seller organize their
commercial relations and the way in which the price in question was arrived
at, in order to determine whether the relationship influenced the price.
Where it can be shown that the buyer and seller, although related under the
provisions of Article&#160;15, buy from and sell to each other as if they were not
related, this would demonstrate that the price had not been influenced by the
relationship. As an example of this, if the price had been settled in a
manner consistent with the normal pricing practices of the industry in
question or with the way the seller settles prices for sales to buyers who
are not related to the seller, this would demonstrate that the price had not
been influenced by the relationship. As a further example, where it is shown
that the price is adequate to ensure recovery of all costs plus a profit
which is representative of the firm's overall profit realized over a
representative period of time (e.g. on an annual basis) in sales of goods of
the same class or kind, this would demonstrate that the price had not been
influenced. <p>4.    Paragraph&#160;2(b) provides an opportunity for the importer
to demonstrate that the transaction value closely approximates to a "test"
value previously accepted by the customs administration and is therefore
acceptable under the provisions of Article&#160;1. Where a test under
paragraph&#160;2(b) is met, it is not necessary to examine the question of
influence under paragraph 2(a). If the customs administration has already
sufficient information to be satisfied, without further detailed inquiries,
that one of the tests provided in paragraph&#160;2(b) has been met, there is no
reason for it to require the importer to demonstrate that the test can be
met. In paragraph&#160;2(b) the term "unrelated buyers" means buyers who are not
related to the seller in any particular case. <p> <i>Paragraph 2(b</i>) <p> A
    number of factors must be taken into consideration in determining whether
    one value "closely approximates" to another value. These factors include
the nature of the imported goods, the nature of the industry itself, the
season in which the goods are imported, and, whether the difference in values
is commercially significant. Since these factors may vary from case to case,
it would be impossible to apply a uniform standard such as a fixed
percentage, in each case. For example, a small difference in value in a case
involving one type of goods could be unacceptable while a large difference in
a case involving another type of goods might be acceptable in determining
whether the transaction value closely approximates to the "test" values set
forth in paragraph&#160;2(b) of Article&#160;1. <p> <i>Note to Article 2</i>
<p> 1.    In applying Article&#160;2, the customs administration shall, wherever
possible, use a sale of identical goods at the same <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000276500045"></a><a href="19.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000277700045"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>commercial level and in
substantially the same quantities as the goods being valued.  Where no such
sale is found, a sale of identical goods that takes place under any one of
the following three conditions may be used: <p> (a)    a sale at the same
commercial level but in different quantities; <p> (b)    a sale at a
different commercial level but in substantially the same quantities; or <p>
(c)    a sale at a different commercial level and in different quantities.
<p> 2.    Having found a sale under any one of these three conditions
adjustments will then be made, as the case may be, for: <p> (a)    quantity
factors only; <p> (b)    commercial level factors only; or <p> (c)    both
commercial level and quantity factors. <p> 3.    The expression "and/or"
allows the flexibility to use the sales and make the necessary adjustments in
any one of the three conditions described above. <p>4.    For the purposes of
Article&#160;2, the transaction value of identical <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000277400026"></a><a href="19.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000277500145"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>imported goods means a customs
value, adjusted as provided for in paragraphs&#160;1(b) and&#160;2, which has already
been accepted under Article&#160;1.<p>5.    A condition for adjustment
because of different commercial levels or different quantities is that such
adjustment, whether it leads to an increase or a decrease in the value, be
made only on the basis of demonstrated evidence that clearly establishes the
reasonableness and accuracy of the adjustments, e.g. valid price lists
containing prices referring to different levels or different quantities. As
an example of this, if the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000277500145"></a><a href="19.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000277500176"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>imported goods being valued consist of a shipment

value exists involved a sale of 500 units, and it is recognized that the
seller grants quantity discounts, the required adjustment may be accomplished
by resorting to the seller's price list and using that price applicable to a
sale of 10 units. This does not require that a sale had to have been made in
quantities of 10 as long as the price list has been established as being
bona-fide through sales at other quantities. In the absence of such an
objective measure, however, the determination of a customs value under the
provisions of Article&#160;2 is not appropriate. <p> <i>Note to Article 3</i> <p>
1.    In applying Article 3, the customs administration shall, wherever
possible, use a sale of similar goods at the same <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000277700045"></a><a href="20.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000298600081"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>commercial level and in

value, adjusted as provided for in paragraphs&#160;1(b) and&#160;2, which has already
been accepted under Article&#160;1.<p>5.    A condition for adjustment
because of different commercial levels or different quantities is that such

1.    The term "unit price at which ... goods are sold in the greatest
aggregate quantity" means the price at which the greatest number of units is
sold in sales to persons who are not related to the persons from whom they
buy such goods at the first commercial level after importation at which such
sales take place. <p>2.    As an example of this, goods are sold from a price
list which grants favorable unit prices for purchases made in larger
quantities. <p><p>

<p>
    The greatest number of units sold at a price is 80; therefore, the unit
price in the greatest aggregate quantity is 90. <p>3.    As another example
of this, two sales occur. In the first sale 500 units are sold at a price of
95 <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000279900047"></a><a href="19.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000279900081"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>currency units each. In the second sale 400 units are sold at a price of

a particular price is 500; therefore, the unit price in the greatest
aggregate quantity is 95. <p> 4.    A third example would be the following

<p>    In this example, the greatest number of units sold at a particular
price is 65; therefore, the unit price in the greatest aggregate quantity is
90. <p>5.    Any sale in the importing country, as described in
paragraph&#160;1 above, to a person who supplies directly or indirectly free
of charge or at reduced cost for use in connection with the production and
sale for export of the imported goods any of the elements specified in
paragraph&#160;1(b) of Article&#160;8, should not be taken into account in
establishing the unit price for the purposes of Article&#160;5. <p>6.    It
should be noted that "profit and general expenses" referred to in
paragraph&#160;1 of Article&#160;5 should be taken as a whole. The figure for
the purposes of this deduction should be determined on the basis of
information supplied by or on behalf of the importer unless the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000280500104"></a><a href="i.htm#_ICONOVEX_IMPORTERSFIGURES"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>importer's
figures are inconsistent with those obtained in sales in the country of
<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000280500131"></a><a href="i.htm#_ICONOVEX_IMPORTATIONOFIMPORTEDGOODSOFSAMECLASS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>importation of imported goods of the same class or kind. Where the importer's
figures are inconsistent with such figures, the amount for profit and general
expenses may be based upon relevant information other than that supplied by
or on behalf of the importer. <p>7.    The "general expenses" include the
direct and indirect costs of marketing the goods in question. <p>8.    Local
taxes payable by reason of the sale of the goods for which a deduction is not
made under the provisions of paragraph&#160;1(a)(iv) of Article&#160;5 shall
be deducted under the provisions of paragraph&#160;1(a)(i) of
Article&#160;5.<p>9.    In determining either the commissions or the usual
profits and general expenses under the provisions of paragraph&#160;1 of
Article&#160;5, the question whether certain goods are "of the same class or kind"
as other goods must be determined on a case-by-case basis by reference to the circumstances involved.
Sales in the country of importation of the narrowest group or range of
imported goods of the same class or kind, which includes the goods being
valued, for which the necessary information can be provided, should be
examined. For the purposes of Article&#160;5, "goods of the same class or kind"
includes goods imported from the same country as the goods being valued as
well as goods imported from other countries. <p>10.    For the purposes of
paragraph&#160;1(b) of Article&#160;5, the "earliest date" shall be the date by
which sales of the imported goods or of identical or similar imported goods
are made in sufficient quantity to establish the unit price. <p>11.    Where
the method in paragraph&#160;2 of Article&#160;5 is used, deductions made for the
value added by further processing shall be based on objective and
quantifiable data relating to the cost of such work.  Accepted <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000281000077"></a><a href="i.htm#_ICONOVEX_INDUSTRYFORMULAS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>industry
formulas, recipes, methods of construction, and other <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000281000097"></a><a href="i.htm#_ICONOVEX_INDUSTRYPRACTICES"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>industry practices
would form the basis of the calculations. <p>12.    It is recognized that the
method of valuation provided for in paragraph&#160;2 of Article&#160;5 would
normally not be applicable when, as a result of the further processing, the
imported goods lose their identity.  However, there can be instances where,
although the identity of the imported goods is lost, the value added by the
processing can be determined accurately without unreasonable difficulty. On
the other hand, there can also be instances where the imported goods maintain
their identity but form such a minor element in the goods sold in the country
of importation that the use of this valuation method would be unjustified. In
view of the above, each situation of this type must be considered on a
case-by-case basis. <p> <i>Note to Article 6</i> <p> 1.    As a general rule,
customs value is determined under this Agreement on the basis of information
readily available in the country of importation. In order to determine a
computed value, however, it may be necessary to examine the costs of
producing the goods being valued and other information which has to be
obtained from outside the country of importation. Furthermore, in most cases
the producer of the goods will be outside the jurisdiction of the authorities
of the country of importation. The use of the computed value method will
generally be limited to those cases where the buyer and seller are related,
and the producer is prepared to supply to the authorities of the country of
importation the necessary cost and to provide facilities for any
subsequent verification which may be necessary. <p> 2.    The "cost or value"
referred to in paragraph&#160;1(a) of Article&#160;6 is to be determined on
the basis of information relating to the production of the goods being valued
supplied by or on behalf of the producer. It is to be based upon the
commercial accounts of the producer, provided that such accounts are
consistent with the generally accepted accounting principles applied in the
country where the goods are produced. <p>3.    The "cost or value" shall
include the cost of elements specified in paragraphs&#160;1(a)(ii) and (iii)
of Article&#160;8. It shall also include the value, apportioned as
appropriate under the provisions of the relevant note to Article&#160;8, of
any element specified in paragraph&#160;1(b) of Article&#160;8 which has been
supplied directly or indirectly by the buyer for use in connection with the
production of the imported goods. The value of the elements specified in
paragraph&#160;1(b)(iv) of Article&#160;8 which are undertaken in the country of
importation shall be included only to the extent that such elements are
charged to the producer. It is to be understood that no cost or value of the
elements referred to in this paragraph shall be counted twice in determining
the computed value. <p>4.    The "amount for profit and general expenses"
referred to in paragraph&#160;1(b) of Article&#160;6 is to be determined on
the basis of information supplied by or on behalf of the producer unless the
producer's figures are inconsistent with those usually reflected in <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000281600094"></a><a href="19.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000281700129"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>sales of
goods of the same class or kind as the goods being valued which are made by
producers in the country of exportation for export to the country of
importation. <p>5.    It should be noted in this context that the "amount for profit and general expenses" has to be taken
as a whole. It follows that if, in any particular case, the producer's profit figure is low and the producer's
general expenses are high, the producer's profit and general expenses taken
together may nevertheless be consistent with that usually reflected in <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000281700129"></a><a href="19.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000281700479"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>sales
of goods of the same class or kind. Such a situation might occur, for
example, if a product were being launched in the country of importation and
the producer accepted a nil or low profit to offset high general expenses
associated with the launch. Where the producer can demonstrate a low profit
on <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000281700242"></a><a href="s.htm#_ICONOVEX_SALESOFIMPORTEDGOODS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>sales of the imported goods because of particular <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000281700259"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_COMMERCIALCIRCUMSTANCES"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>commercial circum
stances, the producer's actual profit figures should be taken into account
provided that the producer has valid <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000281700299"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_COMMERCIALREASONS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>commercial reasons to justify them and
the producer's pricing policy reflects usual pricing policies in the branch
of industry concerned. Such a situation might occur, for example, where
producers have been forced to lower prices temporarily because of an
unforeseeable drop in demand, or where they sell goods to complement a range
of goods being produced in the country of importation and accept a low profit
to maintain competitivity. Where the producer's own figures for profit and
general expenses are not consistent with those usually reflected in <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000281700479"></a><a href="s.htm#_ICONOVEX_SALESOFGOODSOFSAMECLASS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>sales of
goods of the same class or kind as the goods being valued which are made by
producers in the country of exportation for export to the country of
importation, the amount for profit and general expenses may be based upon
relevant information other than that supplied by or on behalf of the producer
of the goods. <p>6.    Where information other than that supplied by or on
behalf of the producer is used for the purposes of determining a computed
value, the authorities of the importing country shall inform the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000281800068"></a><a href="i.htm#_ICONOVEX_IMPORTEROFSOURCEOFINFORMATION"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>importer, if
the latter so requests, of the source of such information, the data used and
the calculations based upon such data, subject to the provisions of
Article&#160;10. <p>7.    The "general expenses" referred to in
paragraph&#160;1(b) of Article&#160;6 covers the direct and indirect costs of
producing and selling the goods for export which are not included under
paragraph&#160;1(a) of Article&#160;6. <p>8.    Whether certain goods are "of the
same class or kind" as other goods must be determined on a case-by-case basis
with reference to the circumstances involved. In determining the usual
profits and general expenses under the provisions of Article&#160;6, sales for
export to the country of importation of the narrowest group or range of
goods, which includes the goods being valued, for which the necessary
information can be provided, should be examined. For the purposes of Article
6, "goods of the same class or kind" must be from the same country as the
goods being valued. <p> <i>Note to Article 7</i> <p> 1.    Customs values
determined under the provisions of Article&#160;7 should, to the greatest extent
possible, be based on previously determined customs values. <p>
2.    The methods of valuation to be employed under Article&#160;7 should be
those laid down in Articles&#160;1 through&#160;6 but a reasonable flexibility in
the application of such methods would be in conformity with the aims and
provisions of Article&#160;7. <p> 3.    Some examples of reasonable
flexibility are as follows: <p> (a)    <i>Identical goods -</i> the
requirement that the identical goods should be exported at or about the same
time as the goods being valued could be flexibly interpreted; identical

Articles&#160;5 and&#160;6 could be used. <p> (b)    <i>Similar-goods</i> -
the requirement that the similar goods should be exported at or about the
same time as the goods being valued could be flexibly interpreted; similar

Articles&#160;5 and&#160;6 could be used. <p> (c)    <i>Deductive-method</i>
- the requirement that the goods shall have been sold in the "condition as
imported" in paragraph&#160;1(a) of Article&#160;5 could be flexibly
interpreted; the "90 days" requirement could be administered flexibly. <p>
<i>Note to Article&#160;8</i> <p>
<i>Paragraph&#160;1(a)(i</i>) <p>
    The term "buying commissions" means fees paid by an importer to the
importer's agent for the service of representing the importer abroad in the
purchase of the goods being valued. <p> <i>Paragraph&#160;1(b)(ii</i>) <p> 1.
There are two factors involved in the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000283200018"></a><a href="19.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000283200102"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>apportionment of the elements specified
in paragraph&#160;1(b)(ii)-of Article&#160;8 to the imported goods - the
value of the element itself and the way in which that value is to be
apportioned to the imported goods. The <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000283200102"></a><a href="index.htm#_ICONOVEX_APPORTIONMENTOFELEMENTS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>apportionment of these elements should
be made in a reasonable manner appropriate to the circumstances and in
accordance with generally accepted <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000283200145"></a><a href="index.htm#_ICONOVEX_ACCOUNTINGPRINCIPLES"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>accounting principles. <p> 2.
Concerning the value of the element, if the importer acquires the element
from a seller not related to the importer at a given cost, the value of the
element is that cost. If the element was produced by the importer or by a
person related to the importer, its value would be the cost of producing it.
If the element had been previously used by the importer, regardless of
whether it had been acquired or produced by such importer, the original cost
of acquisition or production would have to be adjusted downward to reflect
its use in order to arrive at the value of the element. <p>3.    Once a value
has been determined for the element, it is necessary to apportion that value
to the imported goods. Various possibilities exist. For example, the value
might be apportioned to the first shipment if the importer wishes to pay duty
on the entire value at one time. As another example, the importer may request
that the value be apportioned over the number of units produced up to the
time of the first shipment. As a further example, the importer may request
that the value be apportioned over the entire anticipated production where
contracts or firm commitments exist for that production. The method of
apportionment used will depend upon the documentation provided by the
importer. <p>4.    As an illustration of the above, an importer provides the
producer with a mold to be used in the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000283500042"></a><a href="p.htm#_ICONOVEX_PRODUCTIONOFIMPORTEDGOODS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>production of the imported goods and
contracts with the producer to buy 10,000 units. By the time of arrival of
the first shipment of 1,000 units, the producer has already produced 4,000
units. The importer may request the customs administration to apportion the
value of the mold over 1,000-units, 4,000 units or 10,000 units. <p>
<i>Paragraph 1(b)(iv</i>) <p>
1.    Additions for the elements specified in paragraph&#160;1(b)(iv) of
Article&#160;8 should be based on objective and quantifiable data. In order
to minimize the burden for both the importer and customs administration in
determining the values to be added, data readily available in the buyer's
commercial record system should be used in so far as possible. <p> 2.    For
those elements supplied by the buyer which were purchased or leased by the
buyer, the addition would be the cost of the purchase or the lease. No
addition shall be made for those elements available in the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000283800082"></a><a href="26.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000510200061"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>public domain,
other than the cost of obtaining copies of them. <p>3.    The ease with which
it may be possible to calculate the values to be added will depend on a
particular firm's structure and management practice, as well as its
accounting methods. <p>4.    For example, it is possible that a firm which
imports a variety of products from several countries maintains the records of
its design center outside the country of importation in such a way as to show
accurately the costs attributable to a given product. In such cases, a direct adjustment may appropriately
be made under the provisions of Article&#160;8. <p>5.    In another case, a
firm may carry the cost of the design center outside the country of
importation as a general overhead expense without allocation to specific
products. In this instance, an appropriate adjustment could be made under the
provisions of Article&#160;8 with respect to the imported goods by apportioning
total design center costs over total production benefiting from the design
center and adding such apportioned cost on a unit basis to imports.  <p>6.
Variations in the above circumstances will, of course, require different
factors to be considered in determining the proper method of allocation.
<p>7.    In cases where the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000284300011"></a><a href="p.htm#_ICONOVEX_PRODUCTIONOFELEMENT"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>production of the element in question involves a
number of countries and over a period of time, the adjustment should be
limited to the value actually added to that element outside the country of
importation. <p> <i>Paragraph&#160;1(c</i>) <p> 1.    The royalties and <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000284500010"></a><a href="l.htm#_ICONOVEX_LICENSEFEES"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>license

payments are not a condition of the sale for export to the country of
<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000284600098"></a><a href="i.htm#_ICONOVEX_IMPORTATIONOFIMPORTEDGOODS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>importation of the imported goods. <p> <i>Paragraph&#160;3</i> <p> Where objective
and quantifiable data do not exist with regard to the additions required to
    be made under the provisions of Article&#160;8, the transaction value cannot
be determined under the provisions of Article&#160;1. As an illustration of this,
a royalty is paid on the basis of the price in a sale in the importing
country of a liter of a particular product that was imported by the kilogram
and made up into a solution after importation. If the royalty is based
partially on the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000284800177"></a><a href="19.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000284800334"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>imported goods and partially on other factors which have
nothing to do with the imported goods (such as when the imported goods are
mixed with domestic ingredients and are no longer separately identifiable, or
when the royalty cannot be distinguished from special financial arrangements
between the buyer and the seller), it would be inappropriate to attempt to
make an addition for the royalty. However, if the amount of this royalty is
based only on the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000284800334"></a><a href="19.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000291200047"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>imported goods and can be readily quantified, an addition
to the price actually paid or payable can be made. <p> <i>Note to Article&#160;9</i> <p> For the purposes of Article 9, "time of importation" may
    include the time of entry for customs purposes.<p> <i>Note to Article&#160;11</i> <p> 1.    Article 11 provides the importer with the right to appeal
against a valuation determination made by the customs administration for the
goods being valued. Appeal may first be to a higher level in the customs
administration, but the importer shall have the right in the final instance
to appeal to the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000285200108"></a><a href="j.htm#_ICONOVEX_JUDICIARY"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>judiciary.<p> 2.    "Without penalty" means that the
importer shall not be subject to a fine or threat of fine merely because the
importer chose to exercise the right of appeal. Payment of normal court costs
and lawyers' fees shall not be considered to be a fine. <p> 3.    However,
nothing in Article&#160;11 shall prevent a Member from requiring full payment of
assessed customs duties prior to an appeal. <p> <i>Note to Article&#160;15</i> <p>
<i>Paragraph&#160;4</i> <p>
    For the purposes of Article&#160;15, the term "persons" includes a legal
person, where appropriate.<p> <i>Paragraph&#160;4(e) </i><p> For the purposes of
    this Agreement, one person shall be deemed to control another when the
former is legally or operationally in a position to exercise restraint or
direction over the latter. <p>

1.    The five-year delay in the application of the provisions of the
Agreement by developing country Members provided for in paragraph&#160;1 of
Article&#160;20 may, in practice, be insufficient for certain developing

being understood that the Members will give sympathetic consideration to such
a request in cases where the developing country Member in question can show
good cause.<p> 2.    Developing countries which currently value goods on the

Article&#160;4 in the following terms: <p> "The Government of ............
reserves the right to provide that the relevant provision of Article&#160;4 of the
Agreement shall apply only when the customs authorities agree to the request
to reverse the order of Articles&#160;5 and&#160;6." <p> If developing countries make
such a reservation, the Members shall consent to it under Article&#160;21 of the
Agreement.<p>4.    Developing countries may wish to make a reservation with
respect to paragraph&#160;2 of Article&#160;5 of the Agreement in the following terms:
<p> "The Government of ............ reserves the right to provide that
paragraph&#160;2 of Article&#160;5 of the Agreement shall be applied in accordance with

acknowledges that enquiries may be made which are, for example, aimed at
verifying that the elements of value declared or presented to customs in
connection with a determination of customs value are complete and correct.
Members, subject to their national laws and procedures, have the right to
expect the full cooperation of importers in these enquiries.<p>7.    The

<h1>
AGREEMENT ON IMPLEMENTATION OF ARTICLE&#160;VI OF THE GENERAL AGREEMENT ON
TARIFFS AND TRADE&#160;1994  </h1>


<p>
<i>Members </i>hereby <i>agree</i> as follows:<p>

<h2>
PART I </h2>

<h3>
Article&#160;1 </h3>

<h3>
Principles </h3>


    An anti-dumping measure shall be applied only under the circumstances
provided for in Article&#160;VI of GATT&#160;1994 and pursuant to
investigations initiated The term "initiated" as used in this Agreement means
the procedural action by which a Member formally commences an investigation
as provided in Article&#160;5 and conducted in accordance with the provisions of
this Agreement. The following provisions govern the application of Article&#160;VI
of GATT&#160;1994 in so far as action is taken under anti-dumping legislation or
regulations.<p>

<h3>
Article&#160;2 </h3>

<h3>
Determination of Dumping </h3>


2.1    For the purpose of this Agreement, a product is to be considered as
being dumped, i.e. introduced into the commerce of another country at less
than its normal value, if the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000227400073"></a><a href="e.htm#_ICONOVEX_EXPORTPRICEOFPRODUCT"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>export price of the product exported from one
country to another is less than the comparable price, in the ordinary course
of trade, for the like product when destined for consumption in the exporting
country.<p> 2.2    When there are no sales of the like product in the
ordinary course of trade in the domestic market of the exporting country or
when, because of the particular market situation or the low volume of the
sales in the domestic market of the exporting country Sales of the like
product destined for consumption in the domestic market of the exporting
country shall normally be considered a sufficient quantity for the
determination of the normal value if such sales constitute 5 per cent or more
of the sales of the product under consideration to the importing Member,
provided that a lower ratio should be acceptable where the evidence
demonstrates that domestic sales at such lower ratio are nonetheless of
sufficient magnitude to provide for a proper comparison.  Such sales do not
permit a proper comparison, the margin of dumping shall be determined by
comparison with a comparable price of the like product when exported to an
appropriate third country, provided that this price is representative, or
with the cost of production in the country of origin plus a reasonable amount
for administrative, selling and general costs and for profits.  <p> 2.2.1
    Sales of the like product in the domestic market of the exporting country
or sales to a third country at prices below per unit (fixed and variable)
costs of production plus administrative, selling and general costs may be
treated as not being in the ordinary course of trade by reason of price and
may be disregarded in determining normal value only if the authorities When
in this Agreement the term "authorities" is used, it shall be interpreted as
meaning authorities at an appropriate senior level. Determine that such
sales are made within an extended period of time The extended period of time
should normally be one year but shall in no case be less than six months.  in
 substantial quantities Sales below per unit costs are made in substantial
quantities when the authorities establish that the weighted average selling
price of the transactions under consideration for the determination of the
normal value is below the weighted average per unit costs, or that the volume
of sales below per unit costs represents not less than 20 per cent of the
volume sold in transactions under consideration for the determination of the
normal value. And are at prices which do not provide for the recovery of all
costs within a reasonable period of time. If prices which are below per unit
costs at the time of sale are above weighted average per unit costs for the
period of investigation, such prices shall be considered to provide for
recovery of costs within a reasonable period of time.<p> 2.2.1.1    For the
purpose of paragraph&#160;2, costs shall normally be calculated on the basis of
records kept by the exporter or producer under investigation, provided that
such records are in accordance with the generally accepted accounting
principles of the exporting country and reasonably reflect the costs
associated with the production and sale of the product under consideration.
Authorities shall consider all available evidence on the proper allocation of
costs, including that which is made available by the exporter or producer in
the course of the investigation provided that such allocations have been
historically utilized by the exporter or  producer, in particular in relation
to establishing appropriate amortization and <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000227700224"></a><a href="d.htm#_ICONOVEX_DEPRECIATIONPERIODS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>depreciation periods and
allowances for <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000227700235"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CAPITALEXPENDITURES"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>capital expenditures and other development costs. Unless
already reflected in the cost allocations under this sub-paragraph, costs
shall be adjusted appropriately for those non-recurring items of cost which
benefit future and/or current production, or for circum stances in which
costs during the period of investigation are affected by start-up operations.
The adjustment made for start-up operations shall reflect the costs at the
end of the start-up period or, if that period extends beyond the period of
investigation, the most recent costs which can reasonably be taken into
account by the authorities during the investigation.  <p> 2.2.2    For the
purpose of paragraph 2, the amounts for administrative, selling and general
costs and for profits shall be based on actual data pertaining to production
and sales in the ordinary course of trade of the like product by the exporter
or producer under investigation. When such amounts cannot be determined on
this basis, the amounts may be determined on the basis of:<p> (i)    the
actual amounts incurred and realized by the exporter or producer in question
in respect of production and sales in the domestic <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000227900049"></a><a href="m.htm#_ICONOVEX_MARKETOFCOUNTRYOFORIGINOFSAMEGENERALCATEGORYOFPRODUCTS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>market of the country of
origin of the same general category of products; <p> (ii)    the weighted
average of the actual amounts incurred and realized by other exporters or
producers subject to investigation in respect of production and sales of the
like product in the domestic market of the country of origin; <p> (iii)
any other reasonable method, provided that the amount for profit so
established shall not exceed the profit normally realized by other exporters
or producers on sales of products of the same general category in the
domestic market of the country of origin.<p> 2.3 In cases where there is no
export price or where it appears to the authorities concerned that the export
price is unreliable because of association or a compensatory arrangement
between the exporter and the importer or a third party, the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000228200084"></a><a href="18.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000228300018"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>export price may
be constructed on the basis of the price at which the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000228200113"></a><a href="18.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000229400197"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>imported products are
first resold to an independent buyer, or if the products are not resold to an
independent buyer, or not resold in the condition as imported, on such
reasonable basis as the authorities may determine.<p>2.4    A fair comparison
shall be made between the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000228300018"></a><a href="18.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000239300136"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>export price and the normal value. This comparison
shall be made at the same level of trade, normally at the ex-factory level,
and in respect of sales made at as nearly as possible the same time. Due
allowance shall be made in each case, on its merits, for differences which
affect price comparability, including differences in conditions and terms of
sale, taxation, levels of trade, quantities, <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000228300162"></a><a href="19.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000265500032"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>physical characteristics, and
any other differences which are also demonstrated to affect price
comparability.  It is understood that some of the above factors may overlap,
and authorities shall ensure that they do not duplicate adjustments that have
been already made under this provision.  In the cases referred to in
paragraph&#160;3, allowances for costs, including duties and taxes, incurred
between importation and resale, and for profits accruing, should also be
made. If in these cases price comparability has been affected, the
authorities shall establish the normal value at a level of trade equivalent
to the level of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000228300368"></a><a href="t.htm#_ICONOVEX_TRADEOFCONSTRUCTEDEXPORTPRICE"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>trade of the constructed export price, or shall make due
allowance as warranted under this paragraph. The authorities shall indicate
to the parties in question what information is necessary to ensure a fair
comparison and shall not impose an unreasonable burden of proof on those
parties.<p> 2.4.1 When the comparison under paragraph 4 requires a <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000228400019"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CONVERSIONOFCURRENCIES"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>conversion
of currencies, such conversion should be made using the rate of exchange on
the date of sale Normally, the date of sale would be the date of contract,
purchase order, order confirmation, or invoice, whichever establishes the
material terms of sale. Provided that when a sale of foreign currency on
forward markets is directly linked to the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000228400143"></a><a href="e.htm#_ICONOVEX_EXPORTSALE"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>export sale involved, the rate of
exchange in the forward sale shall be used. Fluctuations in exchange rates
shall be ignored and in an investigation the authorities shall allow
exporters at least 60-days to have adjusted their <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000228400222"></a><a href="18.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000228500116"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>export prices to reflect
sustained movements in exchange rates during the period of investigation.<p>
2.4.2 Subject to the provisions governing fair comparison in paragraph&#160;4, the
existence of margins of dumping during the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000228500040"></a><a href="i.htm#_ICONOVEX_INVESTIGATIONPHASE"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>investigation phase shall normally
be established on the basis of a comparison of a weighted average normal
value with a weighted average of prices of all comparable <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000228500095"></a><a href="18.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000228500162"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>export transactions
or by a comparison of normal value and <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000228500116"></a><a href="18.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000228500181"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>export prices on a
transaction-to-transaction basis. A normal value established on a weighted
average basis may be compared to prices of individual <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000228500162"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000379500251"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>export transactions if
the authorities find a pattern of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000228500181"></a><a href="18.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000232300144"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>export prices which differ significantly
among different purchasers, regions or time periods, and if an explanation is
provided as to why such differences cannot be taken into account
appropriately by the use of a weighted average-to-weighted average or
transaction-to-transaction comparison.<p> 2.5    In the case where products
are not imported directly from the country of origin but are exported to the
<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000228600041"></a><a href="18.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000228600085"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>importing Member from an intermediate country, the price at which the
products are sold from the country of export to the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000228600085"></a><a href="18.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000229300161"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>importing Member shall
normally be compared with the comparable price in the country of export.
However, comparison may be made with the price in the country of origin, if,
for example, the products are merely transshipped through the country of
export, or such products are not produced in the country of export, or there
is no comparable price for them in the country of export.<p>2.6    Throughout
this Agreement the term "like product" ("produit similaire") shall be
interpreted to mean a product which is identical, i.e. alike in all respects
to the product under consideration, or in the absence of such a product,
another product which, although not alike in all respects, has
characteristics closely resembling those of the product under
consideration.<p> 2.7    This Article is without prejudice to the second
<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000228800019"></a><a href="s.htm#_ICONOVEX_SUPPLEMENTARYPROVISION"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Supplementary Provision to paragraph&#160;1 of Article&#160;VI in
Annex&#160;I to GATT&#160;1994.<p>

<h3>
Article&#160;3 <br>

Determination of Injury</h3>
Under this Agreement the term "injury" shall, unless otherwise specified, be
taken to mean material injury to a domestic industry, threat of material
injury to a domestic industry or material <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000229200066"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000356600075"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>retardation of the establishment of
such an industry and shall be interpreted in accordance with the provisions
of this Article.

3.1    A determination of injury for purposes of Article&#160;VI of
GATT&#160;1994 shall be based on positive evidence and involve an objective
examination of both <i>(a)</i>-the volume of the dumped imports and the
effect of the dumped imports on prices in the domestic market for like
products, and <i>(b)</i>-the consequent impact of these imports on
domestic producers of such products.<p> 3.2    With regard to the volume of
the dumped imports, the investigating authorities shall consider whether
there has been a significant increase in dumped imports, either in absolute
terms or relative to production or consumption in the importing Member.  With
regard to the effect of the dumped imports on prices, the investigating
authorities shall consider whether there has been a significant price
undercutting by the dumped imports as compared with the price of a like
product of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000229300161"></a><a href="18.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000231200185"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>importing Member, or whether the effect of such imports is
otherwise to depress prices to a significant degree or prevent price
increases, which otherwise would have occurred, to a significant degree. No
one or several of these factors can necessarily give decisive guidance.<p>3.3
Where imports of a product from more than one country are simultaneously
subject to anti-dumping investigations, the investigating authorities may
cumulatively assess the effects of such imports only if they determine that
<i>(a)</i> the margin of dumping established in relation to the imports from
each country is more than <i>de minimis</i> as defined in paragraph&#160;8 of
Article&#160;5 and the volume of imports from each country is not negligible
and <i>(b)</i> a cumulative assessment of the effects of the imports is
appropriate in light of the conditions of competition between the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000229400197"></a><a href="18.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000229400216"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>imported
products and the conditions of competition between the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000229400216"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000357000200"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>imported products and
the like domestic product.<p>3.4    The examination of the impact of the
dumped imports on the domestic industry concerned shall include an evaluation
of all relevant <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000229500044"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000357100043"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>economic factors and indices having a bearing on the state of
the industry, including actual and potential decline in sales, profits,
output, market share, productivity, return on investments, or utilization of
capacity; factors affecting domestic prices; the magnitude of the margin of
dumping; actual and potential negative effects on cash flow, inventories,
employment, wages, growth, ability to raise capital or investments. This list
is not exhaustive, nor can one or several of these factors necessarily give
decisive guidance.<p>3.5    It must be demonstrated that the dumped imports
are, through the effects of dumping, as set forth in paragraphs&#160;2
and&#160;4, causing injury within the meaning of this Agreement. The
demonstration of a causal relationship between the dumped imports and the
injury to the domestic industry shall be based on an examination of all
relevant evidence before the authorities. The authorities shall also examine
any known factors other than the dumped imports which at the same time are
injuring the domestic industry, and the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000229600178"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000357200179"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>injuries caused by these other
factors must not be attributed to the dumped imports. Factors which may be
relevant in this respect include, <i> inter-alia</i>, the volume and
prices of imports not sold at dumping prices, contraction in demand or
changes in the patterns of consumption, trade-restrictive practices of and
competition between the foreign and domestic producers, developments in
technology and the export performance and productivity of the domestic
industry.<p>3.6    The effect of the dumped imports shall be assessed in
relation to the domestic production of the like product when available data
permit the separate identification of that production on the basis of such
criteria as the production process, producers' sales and profits. If such
separate identification of that production is not possible, the effects of
the dumped imports shall be assessed by the examination of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000229700140"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000357300142"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>production of
the narrowest group or range of products, which includes the like product,
for which the necessary information can be provided.<p>3.7    A determination
of a threat of material injury shall be based on facts and not merely on
allegation, conjecture or remote possibility. The change in circumstances
which would create a situation in which the dumping would cause injury must
be clearly foreseen and imminent.  One example, though not an exclusive one,
is that there is convincing reason to believe that there will be, in the near
future, substantially increased <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000229800147"></a><a href="i.htm#_ICONOVEX_IMPORTATIONOFPRODUCT"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>importation of the product at dumped prices.
In making a determination regarding the existence of a threat of material
injury, the authorities should consider, <i>inter-alia</i>, such factors
as:<p> (i)    a significant rate of increase of dumped imports into the
domestic market indicating the likelihood of substantially increased
importation;<p> (ii)    sufficient freely disposable, or an imminent,
substantial increase in, capacity of the exporter indicating the likelihood
of substantially increased dumped exports to the importing Member's market,
taking into account the availability of other export markets to absorb any
additional exports;<p> (iii)    whether imports are entering at prices that
will have a significant depressing or suppressing effect on domestic prices,
and would likely increase demand for further imports; and<p> (iv)
inventories of the product being investigated.<p> No one of these factors by
itself can necessarily give decisive guidance but the totality of the factors
considered must lead to the conclusion that further dumped exports are
imminent and that, unless protective action is taken, material injury would
occur.<p> 3.8    With respect to cases where injury is threatened by dumped
imports, the application of anti-dumping measures shall be considered and
decided with special care.<p>

Article&#160;4 </h3>

<h3>
Definition of Domestic Industry </h3>


4.1    For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "domestic industry"
shall be interpreted as referring to the domestic producers as a whole of the
like products or to those of them whose collective output of the products
constitutes a major proportion of the total domestic <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000230900098"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000358600112"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>production of those
products, except that:<p> (i)    when producers are related For the purpose
of this paragraph, producers shall be deemed to be related to exporters or
importers only if <i>(a)</i>-one of them directly or indirectly controls the other; or <i>(b)</i>-both of them are
directly or indirectly controlled by a third person; or
<i>(c)</i>-together they directly or indirectly control a third person,
provided that there are grounds for believing or suspecting that the effect
of the relationship is such as to cause the producer concerned to behave
differently from non-related producers. For the purpose of this paragraph,
one shall be deemed to control another when the former is legally or
operationally in a position to exercise restraint or direction over the
latter.

 to the exporters or importers or are themselves importers of the
allegedly dumped product, the term "domestic industry" may be interpreted as
referring to the rest of the producers;<p> (ii)    in exceptional
circumstances the territory of a Member may, for the production in question,
be divided into two or more competitive markets and the producers within each
market may be regarded as a separate industry if <i>(a)</i>-the
producers within such market sell all or almost all of their <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000231100109"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000382500047"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>production of
the product in question in that market, and <i>(b)-</i>the demand in
that market is not to any substantial degree supplied by producers of the
product in question located elsewhere in the territory. In such
circumstances, injury may be found to exist even where a major portion of the
total domestic industry is not injured, provided there is a concentration of
dumped imports into such an isolated market and provided further that the
dumped imports are causing injury to the producers of all or almost all of
the production within such market.<p> 4.2    When the domestic industry has
been interpreted as referring to the producers in a certain area, i.e. a
market as defined in paragraph&#160;1(ii), anti-dumping duties shall be
levied As used in this Agreement "levy" shall mean the definitive or final
legal assessment or collection of a duty or tax.  Only on the products in
question consigned for final consumption to that area. When the
<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000231200145"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000358800097"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>constitutional law of the importing Member does not permit the levying of
anti-dumping duties on such a basis, the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000231200185"></a><a href="18.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000232300195"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>importing Member may levy the
anti-dumping duties without limitation only if <i>(a)</i>-the exporters
shall have been given an opportunity to cease exporting at dumped prices to
the area concerned or otherwise give assurances pursuant to Article&#160;8
and adequate assurances in this regard have not been promptly given, and
<i>(b)</i>-such duties cannot be levied only on products of specific
producers which supply the area in question.<p> 4.3    Where two or more
countries have reached under the provisions of paragraph&#160;8(a) of
Article&#160;XXIV of GATT&#160;1994 such a level of integration that they
have the characteristics of a single, unified market, the industry in the
entire area of integration shall be taken to be the domestic industry
referred to in paragraph&#160;1.<p> 4.4    The provisions of paragraph&#160;6
of Article&#160;3 shall be applicable to this Article.<p>

Article 5 </h3>

<h3>
Initiation and Subsequent Investigation </h3>


5.1    Except as provided for in paragraph&#160;6, an investigation to
determine the existence, degree and effect of any alleged dumping shall be
initiated upon a written application by or on behalf of the domestic
industry.<p> 5.2    An application under paragraph&#160;1 shall include
evidence of <i>(a)</i>-dumping, <i>(b)</i>-injury within the
meaning of Article&#160;VI of GATT&#160;1994 as interpreted by this Agreement
and <i>(c)</i>-a causal link between the dumped imports and the alleged
injury. Simple assertion, unsubstantiated by relevant evidence, cannot be
considered sufficient to meet the requirements of this paragraph. The
application shall contain such information as is reasonably available to the
applicant on the following:<p> (i)    the identity of the applicant and a
description of the volume and value of the domestic production of the like
product by the applicant. Where a written application is made on behalf of
the domestic industry, the application shall identify the industry on behalf
of which the application is made by a list of all known domestic producers
of the like product (or associations of domestic producers of the like
product) and, to the extent possible, a description of the volume and value
of domestic production of the like product accounted for by such
producers;<p> (ii)    a complete description of the allegedly dumped product,
the names of the country or countries of origin or export in question, the
identity of each known exporter or foreign producer and a list of known
persons importing the product in question;<p> (iii)    information on prices
at which the product in question is sold when destined for consumption in the
domestic markets of the country or countries of origin or export (or, where
appropriate, information on the prices at which the product is sold from the
country or countries of origin or export to a third country or countries, or
on the constructed value of the product) and information on <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000232300144"></a><a href="e.htm#_ICONOVEX_EXPORTPRICES"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>export prices or,
where appropriate, on the prices at which the product is first resold to an
independent buyer in the territory of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000232300195"></a><a href="18.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000237900034"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>importing Member;<p> (iv)
information on the evolution of the volume of the allegedly dumped imports,
the effect of these imports on prices of the like product in the domestic
market and the consequent impact of the imports on the domestic industry, as
demonstrated by relevant factors and indices having a bearing on the state of
the domestic industry, such as those listed in paragraphs&#160;2 and&#160;4 of
Article&#160;3.<p>
5.3    The authorities shall examine the accuracy and adequacy of the
evidence provided in the application to determine whether there is sufficient
evidence to justify the initiation of an investigation.<p> 5.4    An
investigation shall not be initiated pursuant to paragraph-1 unless the
authorities have determined, on the basis of an examination of the degree of
support for, or opposition to, the application expressed In the case of
fragmented industries involving an exceptionally large number of producers,
authorities may determine support and opposition by using statistically valid sampling
techniques.
By domestic producers of the like product, that the application has been made
by or on behalf of the domestic industry.  Members are aware that in the
territory of certain Members employees of domestic producers of the like
product or representatives of those employees may make or support an
application for an investigation under paragraph&#160;1.  The application shall be
considered to have been made "by or on behalf-of-the-domestic-industry" if it
is supported by those domestic producers whose collective output constitutes
more than 50-per cent of the total production of the like product
produced by that portion of the domestic industry expressing either support
for or opposition to the application. However, no investigation shall be
initiated when domestic producers expressly supporting the application
account for less than 25-per cent of total production of the like
product produced by the domestic industry.<p> 5.5    The authorities shall
 avoid, unless a decision has been made to initiate an investigation, any
 publicizing of the application for the initiation of an investigation.
However, after receipt of a properly documented application and before
proceeding to initiate an investigation, the authorities shall notify the
<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000232700098"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000360800007"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>government of the exporting Member concerned.<p>5.6    If, in special
circumstances, the authorities concerned decide to initiate an investigation
without having received a written application by or on behalf of a domestic
industry for the initiation of such investigation, they shall proceed only if
they have sufficient evidence of dumping, injury and a causal link, as
described in paragraph&#160;2, to justify the initiation of an
investigation.<p>5.7    The evidence of both dumping and injury shall be
considered simultaneously <i>(a)</i>-in the decision whether or not to
initiate an investigation, and <i>(b)</i>-thereafter, during the course
of the investigation, starting on a date not later than the earliest date on
which in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement provisional
measures may be applied.<p>5.8    An application under paragraph&#160;1 shall be rejected and an investigation shall be terminated promptly as
soon as the authorities concerned are satisfied that there is not sufficient
evidence of either dumping or of injury to justify proceeding with the case.
There shall be immediate termination in cases where the authorities determine
that the margin of dumping is <i> de-minimis</i>, or that the volume of
dumped imports, actual or potential, or the injury, is negligible. The margin
of dumping shall be considered to be <i>de-minimis</i> if this margin is
less than 2-per cent, expressed as a percentage of the export price. The
volume of dumped imports shall normally be regarded as negligible if the
volume of dumped imports from a particular country is found to account for
less than 3-per-cent of imports of the like product in the
importing Member, unless countries which individually account for less than
3-per-cent of the imports of the like product in the importing
Member collectively account for more than 7-per cent of imports of the
like product in the importing Member.<p>5.9    An anti-dumping proceeding
shall not hinder the procedures of customs clearance.<p> 5.10
Investigations shall, except in special circumstances, be concluded within
one year, and in no case more than 18 months, after their initiation.<p>

Article 6 </h3>

<h3>
Evidence </h3>


6.1    All interested parties in an anti-dumping investigation shall be given notice of the information which the
authorities require and ample opportunity to present in writing all evidence
which they consider relevant in respect of the investigation in question. <p>
6.1.1    Exporters or foreign producers receiving questionnaires used in an
anti-dumping investigation shall be given at least 30 days for reply.  As a
general rule, the time-limit for exporters shall be counted from the date of
receipt of the questionnaire, which for this purpose shall be deemed to have
been received one week from the date on which it was sent to the respondent
or transmitted to the appropriate diplomatic representative of the exporting
Member or, in the case of a separate customs territory Member of the WTO, an
official representative of the exporting territory.  Due consideration should
 be given to any request for an extension of the 30-day period and, upon
cause shown, such an extension should be granted whenever practicable.<p>
6.1.2    Subject to the requirement to protect confidential information,
evidence presented in writing by one interested party shall be made
available promptly to other interested parties participating in the
investigation.<p> 6.1.3    As soon as an investigation has been initiated,
the authorities shall provide the full text of the written application
received under paragraph&#160;1 of Article&#160;5 to the known exporters It
being understood that, where the number of exporters involved is particularly
high, the full text of the written application should instead be provided
only to the authorities of the exporting Member or to the relevant trade
association. And to the authorities of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000234000155"></a><a href="18.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000250600025"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>exporting Member and shall make
it available, upon request, to other interested parties involved. Due regard
shall be paid to the requirement for the protection of confidential
information, as provided for in paragraph&#160;5.<p> 6.2    Throughout the
anti-dumping investigation all interested parties shall have a full
opportunity for the defence of their interests. To this end, the authorities
shall, on request, provide opportunities for all interested parties to meet
those parties with adverse interests, so that opposing views may be
presented and rebuttal arguments offered. Provision of such opportunities
must take account of the need to preserve confidentiality and of the
convenience to the parties. There shall be no obligation on any party to
attend a meeting, and failure to do so shall not be prejudicial to that
party's case.  Interested parties shall also have the right, on
justification, to present other information orally.<p>6.3    <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000234200002"></a><a href="o.htm#_ICONOVEX_ORALINFORMATION"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Oral information
provided under paragraph&#160;2 shall be taken into account by the
authorities only in so far as it is subsequently reproduced in writing and
made available to other interested parties, as provided for in
subparagraph&#160;1.2.<p>6.4    The authorities shall whenever practicable
provide timely opportunities for all interested parties to see all
information that is relevant to the presentation of their cases, that is not
confidential as defined in paragraph&#160;5, and that is used by the
authorities in an anti-dumping investigation, and to prepare presentations on
the basis of this information.<p>6.5    Any information which is by nature
confidential (for example, because its disclosure would be of significant
competitive advantage to a competitor or because its disclosure would have a
significantly adverse effect upon a person supplying the information or upon
a person from whom that person acquired the information), or which is
provided on a confidential basis by parties to an investigation shall, upon
good cause shown, be treated as such by the authorities. Such information
shall not be disclosed without specific permission of the party submitting
it.  Members are aware that in the territory of certain <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000234400202"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000353400202"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Members disclosure
pursuant to a narrowly-drawn protective order may be required.  <p> 6.5.1
The authorities shall require interested parties providing confidential
information to furnish non-confidential summaries thereof. These summaries
shall be in sufficient detail to permit a reasonable understanding of the
substance of the information submitted in confidence. In exceptional
circumstances, such parties may indicate that such information is not
susceptible of summary. In such exceptional circumstances, a statement of the
reasons why summarization is not possible must be provided.<p> 6.5.2    If
the authorities find that a request for confidentiality is not warranted and
if the  supplier of the information is either unwilling to make the
information public or to authorize its disclosure in generalized or summary
form, the authorities may disregard such information unless it can be
demonstrated to their satisfaction from appropriate sources that the
information is correct.  Members agree that requests for confidentiality
should not be arbitrarily rejected.  <p> 6.6    Except in circumstances
provided for in paragraph&#160;8, the authorities shall during the course of
an investigation satisfy themselves as to the accuracy of the information
supplied by interested parties upon which their findings are based.<p>6.7
In order to verify information provided or to obtain further details, the
authorities may carry out investigations in the territory of other Members as
required, provided they obtain the agreement of the firms concerned and
notify the representatives of the government of the Member in question, and
unless that Member objects to the investigation. The procedures described in
Annex&#160;I shall apply to investigations carried out in the territory of
other Members. Subject to the requirement to protect confidential
information, the authorities shall make the results of any such
investigations available, or shall provide disclosure thereof pursuant to
paragraph&#160;9, to the firms to which they pertain and may make such
results available to the applicants.<p>6.8    In cases in which any
interested party refuses access to, or otherwise does not provide, necessary
information within a reasonable period or significantly impedes the
investigation, preliminary and final determinations, affirmative or negative,
may be made on the basis of the facts available. The provisions of
Annex&#160;II shall be observed in the application of this paragraph.<p>6.9    The authorities shall, before a final determination is made, inform all interested parties of the essential
facts under consideration which form the basis for the decision whether to
apply definitive measures. Such disclosure should take place in sufficient
time for the parties to defend their interests.<p>6.10    The authorities
shall, as a rule, determine an individual margin of dumping for each known
exporter or producer concerned of the product under investigation. In cases
where the number of exporters, producers, importers or types of products
involved is so large as to make such a determination impracticable, the
authorities may limit their examination either to a reasonable number of
interested parties or products by using samples which are statistically valid
on the basis of information available to the authorities at the time of the
selection, or to the largest percentage of the volume of the exports from the country in question which can
reasonably be investigated.<p>
6.10.1    Any selection of exporters, producers, importers or types of
products made under this paragraph-shall preferably be chosen in
consultation with and with the consent of the exporters, producers or
importers concerned.<p> 6.10.2    In cases where the authorities have limited
their examination, as provided for in this paragraph, they shall nevertheless
determine an individual margin of dumping for any exporter or producer not
initially selected who submits the necessary information in time for that
information to be considered during the course of the investigation, except
where the number of exporters or producers is so large that individual
examinations would be unduly burdensome to the authorities and prevent the
timely completion of the investigation. Voluntary responses shall not be
discouraged.<p> 6.11    For the purposes of this Agreement, "interested
parties" shall include:<p> (i)    an exporter or foreign producer or the

preclude Members from allowing domestic or foreign parties other than those
mentioned above to be included as interested parties.<p> 6.12    The
authorities shall provide opportunities for industrial users of the product
under investigation, and for representative <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000235900036"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000354500035"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>consumer organizations in cases

information which is relevant to the investigation regarding dumping, injury
and causality.<p> 6.13    The authorities shall take due account of any
difficulties experienced by interested parties, in particular small
companies, in supplying information requested, and shall provide any
assistance practicable.<p> 6.14    The procedures set out above are not
intended to prevent the authorities of a Member from proceeding expeditiously
with regard to initiating an investigation, reaching preliminary or final
determinations, whether affirmative or negative, or from applying provisional
or final measures, in accordance with relevant provisions of this
Agreement.<p>

Provisional Measures </h3>


7.1    Provisional measures may be applied only if:<p>

a security -- by cash deposit or bond -- equal to the amount of the
anti-dumping duty provisionally estimated, being not greater than the
provisionally estimated margin of dumping. Withholding of appraisement is an  appropriate provisional
measure, provided that the normal duty and the estimated amount of the
anti-dumping duty be indicated and as long as the withholding of appraisement
is subject to the same conditions as other provisional measures.<p>7.3
Provisional measures shall not be applied sooner than 60 days from the date
of initiation of the investigation.<p>7.4    The application of provisional
measures shall be limited to as short a period as possible, not exceeding
four months or, on decision of the authorities concerned, upon request by
exporters representing a significant percentage of the trade involved, to a
period not exceeding six months. When authorities, in the course of an
investigation, examine whether a duty lower than the margin of dumping would
be sufficient to remove injury, these periods may be six and nine months,

The word "may" shall not be interpreted to allow the simultaneous
continuation of proceedings with the implementation of price undertakings
except as provided in paragraph&#160;4.

 be suspended or terminated without the imposition of provisional measures
or anti-dumping duties upon receipt of satisfactory voluntary undertakings
from any exporter to revise its prices or to cease exports to the area in
question at dumped prices so that the authorities are satisfied that the
injurious effect of the dumping is eliminated. Price increases under such
undertakings shall not be higher than necessary to eliminate the margin of
dumping. It is desirable that the price increases be less than the margin of
dumping if such increases would be adequate to remove the injury to the
domestic industry.<p> 8.2    <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000237900003"></a><a href="18.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000238200002"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Price undertakings shall not be sought or

authorities consider their acceptance impractical, for example, if the number
of actual or potential exporters is too great, or for other reasons,
including reasons of general policy. Should the case arise and where
practicable, the authorities shall provide to the exporter the reasons which
have led them to consider acceptance of an undertaking as inappropriate, and
shall, to the extent possible, give the exporter an opportunity to make
comments thereon.<p>8.4    If an undertaking is accepted, the investigation
of dumping and injury shall nevertheless be completed if the exporter so
desires or the authorities so decide. In such a case, if a negative
determination of dumping or injury is made, the undertaking shall
automatically lapse, except in cases where such a determination is due in
large part to the existence of a price undertaking. In such cases, the
authorities may require that an undertaking be maintained for a reasonable
period consistent with the provisions of this Agreement. In the event that an
affirmative determination of dumping and injury is made, the undertaking
shall continue consistent with its terms and the provisions of this
Agreement.<p>8.5    <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000238200002"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000361300003"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Price undertakings may be suggested by the authorities of

undertakings. The fact that exporters do not offer such undertakings, or do
not accept an invitation to do so, shall in no way prejudice the
consideration of the case. However, the authorities are free to determine

    Article 9 </h3>

<h3>
Imposition and Collection of Anti-Dumping Duties </h3>


9.1    The decision whether or not to impose an anti-dumping duty in cases
where all requirements for the imposition have been fulfilled, and the
decision whether the amount of the anti-dumping duty to be imposed shall be
the full margin of dumping or less, are decisions to be made by the
authorities of the importing Member. It is desirable that the imposition be
permissive in the territory of all Members, and that the duty be less than
the margin if such lesser duty would be adequate to remove the injury to the
domestic industry.<p> 9.2    When an anti-dumping duty is imposed in respect
of any product, such anti-dumping duty shall be collected in the appropriate
amounts in each case, on a <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000238900057"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000362100057"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>non-discriminatory basis on <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000238900064"></a><a href="18.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000241000019"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>imports of such
product from all sources found to be dumped and causing injury, except as to
imports from those sources from which price undertakings under the terms of
this Agreement have been accepted. The authorities shall name the supplier or
suppliers of the product concerned. If, however, several suppliers from the
same country are involved, and it is impracticable to name all these
suppliers, the authorities may  name the supplying country concerned. If
several suppliers from more than one country are involved, the authorities
may name either all the suppliers involved, or, if this is impracticable, all
the supplying countries involved.<p>9.3    The amount of the anti-dumping
duty shall not exceed the margin of dumping as established under
Article&#160;2.<p>
9.3.1    When the amount of the anti-dumping duty is assessed on a
retrospective basis, the determination of the final liability for payment of
anti-dumping duties shall take place as soon as possible, normally within
12-months, and in no case more than 18-months, after the date on
which a request for a final assessment of the amount of the anti-dumping duty has been
made.
It is understood that the observance of the time-limits mentioned in this
subparagraph and in subparagraph 3.2 may not be possible where the product in
question is subject to judicial review proceedings.  Any refund shall be made
 promptly and normally in not more  than 90-days following the
determination of final liability made pursuant to this subparagraph. In any
case, where a refund is not made within 90-days, the authorities shall
provide an explanation if so requested.<p> 9.3.2    When the amount of the
anti-dumping duty is assessed on a prospective basis, provision shall be made
for a prompt refund, upon request, of any duty paid in excess of the margin
of dumping. A refund of any such duty paid in excess of the actual margin of
dumping shall normally take place within 12-months, and in no case more
than  18-months, after the date on which a request for a refund, duly
supported by evidence, has been made by an <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000239200177"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000354200019"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>importer of the product subject to
the anti-dumping duty. The refund authorized should normally be made within
90-days of the above-noted  decision.<p>
9.3.3    In determining whether and to what extent a reimbursement should be
made when the export price is constructed in accordance with paragraph&#160;3
of Article&#160;2, authorities should take account of any change in normal
value, any change in costs incurred between importation and resale, and any
movement in the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000239300106"></a><a href="r.htm#_ICONOVEX_RESALEPRICE"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>resale price which is duly reflected in subsequent selling

amount of anti-dumping duties paid when conclusive evidence of the above is
provided.<p> 9.4    When the authorities have limited their examination in
accordance with the second sentence of paragraph&#160;10 of Article&#160;6,
any anti-dumping duty applied to imports from exporters or producers not
included in the examination shall not exceed:<p> (i)    the weighted average
margin of dumping established with respect to the selected exporters or
producers or,<p>
(ii)    where the liability for payment of anti-dumping duties is calculated
on the basis of a prospective normal value, the difference between the
weighted average normal value of the selected exporters or producers and the
<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000239600074"></a><a href="e.htm#_ICONOVEX_EXPORTERSEXPORTPRICESOF"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>export prices of exporters or producers not individually examined,<p>
provided that the authorities shall disregard for the purpose of this
paragraph any zero and <i>de-minimis</i> margins and margins established
under the circumstances referred to in paragraph&#160;8 of Article&#160;6.
The authorities shall apply individual duties or normal values to imports
from any exporter or producer not included in the examination who has
provided the necessary information during the course of the investigation,
as provided for in subparagraph&#160;10.2 of Article&#160;6.<p> 9.5    If a
product is subject to anti-dumping duties in an <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000239800023"></a><a href="18.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000239800101"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>importing Member, the
authorities shall promptly carry out a review for the purpose of determining
individual margins of dumping for any exporters or producers in the exporting
country in question who have not exported the product to the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000239800101"></a><a href="18.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000239800233"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>importing Member
during the period of investigation, provided that these exporters or
producers can show that they are not related to any of the exporters or
producers in the exporting country who are subject to the anti-dumping
duties on the product.  Such a review shall be initiated and carried out on
an accelerated basis, compared to normal duty assessment and review
proceedings in the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000239800233"></a><a href="18.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000248000074"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>importing Member. No anti-dumping duties shall be levied
on imports from such exporters or producers while the review is being carried
out. The authorities may, however, withhold appraisement and/or request
guarantees to ensure that, should such a review result in a determination of
dumping in respect of such producers or exporters, anti-dumping duties can be levied retroactively to the date
of the initiation of the review.<p>

Retroactivity </h3>


10.1    <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000240300005"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000359900003"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Provisional measures and anti-dumping duties shall only be applied to products which enter for
consumption after the time when the decision taken under paragraph&#160;1 of
Article&#160;7 and paragraph&#160;1 of Article&#160;9, respectively, enters
into force, subject to the exceptions set out in this Article.<p> 10.2
Where a final determination of injury (but not of a threat thereof or of a
material retardation of the establishment of an industry) is made or, in the
case of a final determination of a threat of injury, where the effect of the
dumped imports would, in the absence of the provisional measures, have led to
a determination of injury, anti-dumping duties may be levied retroactively
for the period for which provisional measures, if any, have been
applied.<p>10.3    If the definitive anti-dumping duty is higher than the
provisional duty paid or payable, or the amount estimated for the purpose of
the security, the difference shall not be collected. If the definitive duty
is lower than the provisional duty paid or payable, or the amount estimated
for the purpose of the security, the difference shall be reimbursed or the
duty recalculated, as the case may be.<p>10.4    Except as provided in
paragraph&#160;2, where a determination of threat of injury or material
retardation is made (but no injury has yet occurred) a definitive
anti-dumping duty may be imposed only from the date of the determination of
threat of injury or material retardation, and any cash deposit  made during
the period of the application of provisional measures shall be refunded and
any bonds released in an expeditious manner.<p>10.5    Where a final
determination is negative, any cash deposit made during the period of the
application of provisional measures shall be refunded and any bonds released
in an expeditious manner.<p> 10.6    A definitive anti-dumping duty may be
levied on products which were entered for consumption not more than 90 days
prior to the date of application of provisional measures, when the
authorities determine for the dumped product in question that:<p> (i)
there is a history of dumping which caused injury or that the importer was,
or should have been, aware that the exporter practices dumping and that such
dumping would cause injury, and<p> (ii)    the injury is caused by massive
dumped <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000241000019"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000362100064"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>imports of a product in a relatively short time which in light of the
timing and the volume of the dumped imports and other circumstances (such as
a rapid build-up of inventories of the imported product) is likely to
seriously undermine the remedial effect of the definitive anti-dumping duty
to be applied, provided that the importers concerned have been given an
opportunity to comment.<p> 10.7    The authorities may, after initiating an
investigation, take such measures as the withholding of appraisement or
assessment as may be necessary to collect anti-dumping duties retroactively,
as provided for in paragraph&#160;6, once they have sufficient evidence that
the conditions set forth in that paragraph are satisfied.<p> 10.8    <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000241200003"></a><a href="n.htm#_ICONOVEX_NODUTIES"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>No

Article 11 </h3>

<h3>
Duration and Review of Anti-Dumping Duties and Price Undertakings </h3>


11.1    An anti-dumping duty shall remain in force only as long as and to the extent necessary to counteract
dumping which is causing injury.<p>
11.2    The authorities shall review the need for the continued imposition of the duty, where warranted, on their
own initiative or, provided that a reasonable period of time has elapsed
since the imposition of the definitive anti-dumping duty, upon request by any
interested party which submits positive information substantiating the need
for a review.  A determination of final liability for payment of anti-dumping
duties, as provided for in paragraph&#160;3 of Article&#160;9, does not by
itself constitute a review within the meaning of this Article.  Interested
parties shall have the right to request the authorities to examine whether the continued imposition of the duty is necessary to offset dumping, whether
the injury would be likely to continue or recur if the duty were removed or
varied, or both. If, as a result of the review under this paragraph, the
authorities determine that the anti-dumping duty is no longer warranted, it
shall be terminated immediately.<p>11.3    Notwithstanding the provisions of
paragraphs&#160;1 and&#160;2, any definitive anti-dumping duty shall be terminated
on a date not later than five years from its imposition (or from the date of
the most recent review under paragraph&#160;2 if that review has covered both
dumping and injury, or under this paragraph), unless the authorities
determine, in a review initiated before that date on their own initiative or
upon a duly substantiated request made by or on behalf of the domestic
industry within a reasonable period of time prior to that date, that the
<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000241900195"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000363900196"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>expiry of the duty would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence  of
dumping and injury.  When the amount of the anti-dumping duty is assessed on
a retrospective basis, a finding in the most recent assessment proceeding
under subparagraph&#160;3.1 of Article&#160;9 that no duty is to be levied
shall not by itself require the authorities to terminate the definitive duty.
 The duty
may remain in force pending the outcome of such a review.<p>11.4    The
 provisions of Article&#160;6 regarding evidence and procedure shall apply to
 any review carried out under this Article. Any such review shall be carried
out expeditiously and shall normally be concluded within 12 months of the
date of initiation of the review.<p> 11.5    The provisions of this Article
shall apply <i>mutatis-mutandis</i> to price undertakings accepted under
Article&#160;8.<p>

indirectly, under this Agreement has been nullified or impaired, or that the
achieving of the objectives of the Agreement is being impeded, and    <p>
(ii)    the facts made available in conformity with appropriate domestic
procedures to the authorities of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000248300035"></a><a href="18.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000251100066"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>importing Member.<p> 17.6    In
examining the matter referred to in paragraph&#160;5:<p> (i)    in its
    assessment of the facts of the matter, the panel shall determine whether
    the authorities' establishment of the facts was proper and whether their
evaluation of those facts was unbiased and objective. If the establishment of
the facts was proper and the evaluation was unbiased and objective, even
though the panel might have reached a different conclusion, the evaluation
shall not be overturned;<p> (ii)    the panel shall interpret the relevant
    provisions of the Agreement in accordance with customary rules of
interpretation of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000248600041"></a><a href="l.htm#_ICONOVEX_LAWPUBLICINTERNATIONAL"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>public international law. Where the panel finds that a
relevant provision of the Agreement admits of more than one permissible
interpretation, the panel shall find the authorities' measure to be in
conformity with the Agreement if it rests upon one of those permissible
interpretations.<p> 17.7    <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000248700003"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CONFIDENTIALINFORMATION"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Confidential information provided to the panel
shall not be disclosed without formal authorization from the person, body or

from the panel but release of such information by the panel is not
authorized, a non-confidential summary of the information, authorized by the
person, body or authority providing the information, shall be provided.<p>

<h2>
ANNEX&#160;I <br>
PROCEDURES FOR ON-THE-SPOT INVESTIGATIONS PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH 7 OF
ARTICLE 6 </h2>


1.    Upon initiation of an investigation, the authorities of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000250600025"></a><a href="18.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000250800033"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>exporting
Member and the firms known to be concerned should be informed of the
intention to carry out on-the-spot investigations.<p> 2.    If in exceptional
circumstances it is intended to include non-governmental experts in the
investigating team, the firms and the authorities of the exporting Member
should be so informed. Such non-governmental experts should be subject to
effective sanctions for breach of confidentiality requirements.<p>3.    It
should be standard practice to obtain explicit agreement of the firms
concerned in the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000250800033"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000353100170"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>exporting Member before the visit is finally scheduled.<p>4.
As soon as the agreement of the firms concerned has been obtained, the
investigating authorities should notify the authorities of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000250900046"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000386000046"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>exporting
Member of the names and addresses of the firms to be visited and the dates
agreed.<p>5.    Sufficient advance notice should be given to the firms in
question before the visit is made.<p>6.    Visits to explain the
questionnaire should only be made at the request of an exporting firm. Such a
visit may only be made if <i>(a)</i> the authorities of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000251100066"></a><a href="22.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000325300118"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>importing Member
notify the representatives of the Member in question and <i>(b)</i> the
latter do not object to the visit.<p>7.    As the main purpose of the
on-the-spot investigation is to verify information provided or to obtain
further details, it should be carried out after the response to the
questionnaire has been received unless the firm agrees to the contrary and
the government of the exporting Member is informed by the investigating
authorities of the anticipated visit and does not object to it; further, it
should be standard practice prior to the visit to advise the firms concerned
of the general nature of the information to be verified and of any further
information which needs to be provided, though this should not preclude
requests to be made on the spot for further details to be provided in the
light of information obtained.<p> 8.    Enquiries or questions put by the
authorities or firms of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000251300026"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000386400026"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>exporting Members and essential to a successful
on-the-spot investigation should, whenever possible, be answered before the
visit is made.<p>

<h2>
ANNEX&#160;II <br>
BEST INFORMATION AVAILABLE IN TERMS OF PARAGRAPH&#160;8 OF ARTICLE&#160;6
</h2>


1.    As soon as possible after the initiation of the investigation, the
investigating authorities should specify in detail the information required
from any interested party, and the manner in which that information should be
structured by the interested party in its response. The authorities should
also ensure that the party is aware that if information is not supplied
within a reasonable time, the authorities will be free to make determinations
on the basis of the facts available, including those contained in the
application for the initiation of the investigation by the domestic
industry.<p> 2.    The authorities may also request that an interested party
provide its response in a particular medium (e.g. computer tape) or <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000251800049"></a><a href="18.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000251800104"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>computer
language. Where such a request is made, the authorities should consider the
reasonable ability of the interested party to respond in the preferred medium
or <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000251800104"></a><a href="18.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000251800283"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>computer language, and should not request the party to use for its
response a <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000251800134"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_COMPUTERSYSTEM"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>computer system other than that used by the party. The authority
should not maintain a request for a computerized response if the interested
party does not maintain computerized accounts and if presenting the response
as requested would result in an unreasonable extra burden on the interested
party, e.g. it would entail unreasonable additional cost and trouble. The
authorities should not maintain a request for a response in a particular
medium or <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000251800283"></a><a href="18.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000251800316"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>computer language if the interested party does not maintain its
computerized accounts in such medium or <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000251800316"></a><a href="18.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000251900138"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>computer language and if presenting
the response as requested would result in an unreasonable extra burden on the interested party, e.g. it would
entail unreasonable additional cost and trouble.<p>3.    All information
which is verifiable, which is appropriately submitted so that it can be used
in the investigation without undue difficulties, which is supplied in a
timely fashion, and, where applicable, which is supplied in a medium or
computer language requested by the authorities, should be taken into account
when determinations are made. If a party does not respond in the preferred
medium or <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000251900138"></a><a href="18.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000251900192"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>computer language but the authorities find that the circumstances
set out in paragraph&#160;2 have been satisfied, the failure to respond in
the preferred medium or <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000251900192"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_COMPUTERLANGUAGE"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>computer language should not be considered to
significantly impede the investigation.<p>4.    Where the authorities do not
have the ability to process information if provided in a particular medium
(e.g. computer tape), the information should be supplied in the form of
written material or any other form acceptable to the authorities.<p>5.
Even though the information provided may not be ideal in all respects, this
should not justify the authorities from disregarding it, provided the
interested party has acted to the best of its ability.<p>6.    If evidence or
information is not accepted, the supplying party should be informed forthwith
of the reasons therefor, and should have an opportunity to provide further
explanations within a reasonable period, due account being taken of the
time-limits of the investigation. If the  explanations are considered by the
authorities as not being satisfactory, the reasons for the rejection of such
evidence or information should be given in any published determinations.<p>7.
If the authorities have to base their findings, including those with respect
to normal value, on information from a secondary source, including the
information supplied in the application for the initiation of the
investigation, they should do so with special circumspection. In such cases,
the authorities should, where practicable, check the information from other
independent sources at their disposal, such as published price lists,
official <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000252300143"></a><a href="i.htm#_ICONOVEX_IMPORTSTATISTICS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>import statistics and customs returns, and from the information
obtained from other interested parties during the investigation. It is clear,
however, that if an interested party does not cooperate and thus relevant
information is being withheld from the authorities, this situation could lead
to a result which is less favorable to the party than if the party did
cooperate.

effective at the beginning of any agreement year during the transition
period, provided the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000099300068"></a><a href="18.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000234000155"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>exporting Member concerned and the TMB are notified at
least three months prior to the elimination coming into effect. The period
for prior notification may be shortened to 30-days with the agreement of
the restrained Member. The TMB shall circulate such notifications to all
Members. In considering the elimination of restrictions as envisaged in this
paragraph, the Members concerned shall take into account the treatment of
similar exports from other Members.<p>16.    Flexibility provisions,
i.e.-swing, carryover and carry forward, applicable to all restrictions
maintained pursuant to this Article, shall be the same as those provided for
in MFA bilateral agreements for the 12-month period prior to the entry into
force of the WTO Agreement. No quantitative limits shall be placed or
maintained on the combined use of swing, carryover and carry forward.<p>17.

advancement by one stage of the growth rates set out in paragraphs&#160;13
and 14, or through at least equivalent changes as may be mutually agreed with
respect to a different mix of base levels, growth and flexibility provisions.
Such improvements shall be notified to the TMB.<p>19.    In any case, during
the duration of this Agreement, in which a safeguard measure is initiated by
a Member under Article&#160;XIX of GATT&#160;1994 in respect of a particular
product during a period of one year immediately following the integration of
that product into GATT&#160;1994 in accordance with the provisions of this
Article, the provisions of Article&#160;XIX, as interpreted by the Agreement
on Safeguards, will apply, save as set out in paragraph&#160;20.<p>20.
Where such a measure is applied using non-tariff means, the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000099800024"></a><a href="15.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000103200083"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>importing Member
concerned shall apply the measure in a manner as set forth in
paragraph&#160;2(d) of Article&#160;XIII of GATT&#160;1994 at the request of any
exporting Member whose <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000099800088"></a><a href="e.htm#_ICONOVEX_EXPORTSOFPRODUCTS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>exports of such products were subject to restrictions
under this Agreement at any time in the one-year period immediately prior to
the initiation of the safeguard measure. The exporting Member concerned shall
administer such a measure. The applicable level shall not reduce the relevant exports below the level of a recent
representative period, which shall normally be the average of exports from
the Member concerned in the last three representative years for which
statistics are available. Furthermore, when the safeguard measure is applied
for more than one year, the applicable level shall be progressively
liberalized at regular intervals during the period of application. In such
cases the exporting Member concerned shall not exercise the right of
suspending substantially equivalent concessions or other obligations under
paragraph&#160;3(a) of Article&#160;XIX of GATT&#160;1994.<p> 21.    The TMB shall keep
under review the implementation of this Article. It shall, at the request of
any Member, review any particular matter with reference to the implementation
of the provisions of this Article. It shall make appropriate recommendations
or findings within 30-days to the Member or Members concerned, after
inviting the participation of such Members.<p><h2> Article 3 </h2> 1.

except those justified under a GATT 1994 provision, shall either:<p> (a)
bring them into conformity with <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000100400015"></a><a href="15.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000101700077"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>GATT 1994 within one year following the entry

information;  or<p> (b)    phase them out progressively according to a
program to be presented to the TMB by the Member maintaining the
restrictions not later than six months after the date of entry into force of
the WTO Agreement. This program shall provide for all restrictions to be
phased out within a period not exceeding the duration of this Agreement. The
TMB may make recommendations to the Member concerned with respect to such a
program.<p> 3.    During the duration of this Agreement, Members shall
provide to the TMB, for its information, notifications submitted to any other

to this Article to all Members for their information. <p><h2> Article 4 </h2>
1.    Restrictions referred to in Article&#160;2, and those applied under
Article&#160;6, shall be administered by the exporting Members. Importing
Members shall not be obliged to accept shipments in excess of the
restrictions notified under Article&#160;2, or of restrictions applied
pursuant to Article&#160;6.<p> 2.    Members agree that the introduction of
changes, such as changes in practices, rules, procedures and categorization
of textile and clothing products, including those changes relating to the
Harmonized System, in the implementation or <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000101200075"></a><a href="index.htm#_ICONOVEX_ADMINISTRATIONOFRESTRICTIONS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>administration of those
restrictions notified or applied under this Agreement should not: upset the
balance of rights and obligations between the Members concerned under this
Agreement;  adversely affect the access available to a  Member;  impede the
full utilization of such access;  or disrupt trade under this Agreement.<p>3.
If a product which constitutes only part of a restriction is notified for
integration pursuant to the provisions of Article&#160;2, Members agree that
any change in the level of that restriction shall not upset the balance of
rights and obligations between the Members concerned under this Agreement.<p>
4.    When changes mentioned in paragraphs&#160;2 and 3 are necessary, however,
Members agree that the Member initiating such changes shall inform and,
wherever possible, initiate consultations with the affected Member or Members
prior to the implementation of such changes, with a view to reaching a
mutually acceptable solution regarding appropriate and equitable adjustment.
Members further agree that where consultation prior to implementation is not
feasible, the Member initiating such changes will, at the request of the
affected Member, consult, within 60 days if possible, with the Members
concerned with a view to reaching a mutually satisfactory solution regarding
appropriate and equitable adjustments. If a mutually satisfactory solution
is not reached, any Member involved may refer the matter to the TMB for
recommendations as provided in Article&#160;8. Should the TSB not have had
the opportunity to review a dispute concerning such changes introduced prior
to the entry into force of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000101400320"></a><a href="15.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000102500165"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>WTO Agreement, it shall be reviewed by the TMB
in accordance with the rules and procedures of the MFA applicable for such a
review.<p><h2> Article 5 </h2> 1.    Members agree that circumvention by
transshipment, re-routing, false declaration concerning country or place of
origin, and falsification of official documents, frustrates the
implementation of this Agreement to integrate the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000101700066"></a><a href="15.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000103300087"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>textiles and clothing

legal provisions and/or <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000101700102"></a><a href="18.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000249900083"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>administrative procedures to address and take action
against such circumvention. Members further agree that, consistent with their
domestic laws and procedures, they will cooperate fully to address problems
arising from circumvention.<p>
2.    Should any Member believe that this Agreement is being circumvented by
transshipment, re-routing, false declaration concerning country or place of
origin, or falsification of official documents, and that no, or inadequate,
measures are being applied to address and/or to take action against such
circumvention, that Member should consult with the Member or Members
concerned with a view to seeking a mutually satisfactory solution. Such
consultations should be held promptly, and within 30-days when possible. If a mutually satisfactory solution is not
reached, the matter may be referred by any Member involved to the TMB for
recommendations.<p>3.    Members agree to take necessary action, consistent
with their domestic laws and procedures, to prevent, to investigate and,
where appropriate, to take legal and/or <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000101900056"></a><a href="26.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000474900226"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>administrative action against
circumvention practices within their territory. Members agree to cooperate
fully, consistent with their domestic laws and procedures, in instances of
circumvention or alleged circumvention of this Agreement, to establish the
relevant facts in the places of import, export and, where applicable,
transshipment. It is agreed that such cooperation, consistent with domestic
laws and procedures, will include: investigation of circumvention practices
which increase restrained exports to the Member maintaining such restraints;
exchange of documents, correspondence, reports and other relevant information
to the extent available;  and facilitation of plant visits and contacts, upon
request and on a case-by-case basis. Members should endeavor to clarify the
circumstances of any such instances of circumvention or alleged
circumvention, including the respective roles of the exporters or importers
involved.<p>4.    Where, as a result of investigation, there is sufficient
evidence that circumvention has occurred (e.g. where evidence is available
concerning the country or place of true origin, and the circumstances of such
circumvention), Members agree that appropriate action, to the extent
necessary to address the problem, should be taken. Such action may include
the denial of entry of goods or, where goods have entered, having due regard
to the actual circumstances and the involvement of the country or place of
true origin, the adjustment of charges to restraint levels to reflect the
true country or place of origin. Also, where there is evidence of the
involvement of the territories of the Members through which the goods have
been transshipped, such action may include the introduction of restraints
with respect to such Members. Any such actions, together with their timing
and scope, may be taken after consultations held with a view to arriving at a
mutually satisfactory solution between the concerned Members and shall be
notified to the TMB with full justification. The Members concerned may agree
on other remedies in consultation. Any such agreement shall also be notified
to the TMB, and the TMB may make such recommendations to the Members
concerned as it deems appropriate. If a mutually satisfactory solution is not
reached, any Member concerned may refer the matter to the TMB for prompt
review and recommendations.<p>5.    Members note that some cases of
circumvention may involve shipments transiting through countries or places
with no changes or alterations made to the goods contained in such shipments
in the places of transit. They note that it may not be generally practicable
for such places of transit to exercise control over such shipments.<p> 6.
Members agree that false declaration concerning fiber content, quantities,
description or classification of merchandise also frustrates the objective
of this Agreement. Where there is evidence that any such false declaration
has been made for purposes of circumvention, Members agree that appropriate
measures, consistent with domestic laws and procedures, should be taken
against the exporters or importers involved. Should any Member believe that
this Agreement is being circumvented by such false declaration and that no,
or inadequate, administrative measures are being applied to address and/or
to take action against such circumvention, that Member should consult
promptly with the Member involved with a view to seeking a mutually
satisfactory solution. If such a solution is not reached, the matter may be
referred by any  Member involved to the TMB for recommendations. This
provision is not intended to prevent Members from making <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000102200295"></a><a href="t.htm#_ICONOVEX_TECHNICALADJUSTMENTS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>technical

Article 6 </h2>
1.     Members recognize that during the transition period it may be
necessary to apply a specific transitional safeguard mechanism (referred to
in this Agreement as "transitional safeguard"). The transitional safeguard
may be applied by any Member to products covered by the Annex, except those
integrated into GATT&#160;1994 under the provisions of Article&#160;2. Members not
maintaining restrictions falling under Article&#160;2 shall notify the TMB
within 60-days following the date of entry into force of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000102500165"></a><a href="15.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000102500261"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>WTO
Agreement, as to whether or not they wish to retain the right to use the
provisions of this Article. Members which have not accepted the Protocols
extending the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000102500226"></a><a href="15.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000104300047"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>MFA since 1986  shall make such notification within six months
following the entry into force of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000102500261"></a><a href="15.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000104300076"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>WTO Agreement. The transitional
safeguard should be applied as sparingly as possible, consistently with the
provisions of this Article and the effective implementation of the
integration process under this Agreement.<p> 2.    Safeguard action may be
taken under this Article when, on the basis of a determination by a Member A
customs union may apply a safeguard measure as a single unit or on behalf of
a member State. When a customs union applies a safeguard measure as a single
unit, all the requirements for the determination of serious damage or actual
threat thereof under this Agreement shall be based on the conditions existing
in the customs union as a whole. When a safeguard measure is applied on
behalf of a member State, all the requirements for the determination of
serious damage, or actual threat thereof, shall be based on the conditions
existing in that member State and the measure shall be limited to that member
State.  , it is demonstrated that a particular product is being imported
into its territory in such increased quantities as to cause serious damage,
or actual threat thereof, to the domestic industry producing like and/or
directly competitive products. Serious damage or actual threat thereof must
demonstrably be caused by such increased quantities in total <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000102600371"></a><a href="15.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000103200070"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>imports of that

actual threat thereof, as referred to in paragraph&#160;2, the Member shall
examine the effect of those imports on the state of the particular industry,
as reflected in changes in such relevant <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000102700087"></a><a href="e.htm#_ICONOVEX_ECONOMICVARIABLES"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>economic variables as output,
productivity, utilization of capacity, inventories, market share, exports,
wages, employment, domestic prices, profits and investment; none of which,
either alone or combined with other factors, can necessarily give decisive
guidance.<p>4.     Any measure invoked pursuant to the provisions of this
Article shall be applied on a <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000102800033"></a><a href="m.htm#_ICONOVEX_MEMBERBYMEMBERBASIS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Member-by-Member basis. The Member or Members
to whom serious damage, or actual threat thereof, referred to in paragraphs&#160;2
and&#160;3, is attributed, shall be determined on the basis of a sharp and
substantial increase in imports, actual or imminent Such an imminent increase
shall be a measurable one and shall not be determined to exist on the basis
of allegation, conjecture or mere possibility arising, for example, from the
existence of production capacity in the exporting Members.  , from such a
Member or Members individually, and on the basis of the level of imports as
compared with imports from other sources, <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000102800250"></a><a href="m.htm#_ICONOVEX_MARKETSHARE"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>market share, and import and
domestic prices at a comparable stage of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000102800276"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_COMMERCIALTRANSACTION"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>commercial transaction;  none of
these factors, either alone or combined with other factors, can necessarily
give decisive guidance. Such safeguard measure shall not be applied to the
<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000102800335"></a><a href="m.htm#_ICONOVEX_MEMBEREXPORTSOF"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>exports of any Member whose <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000102800346"></a><a href="15.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000103600037"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>exports of the particular product are already
under restraint under this Agreement.<p>5.    The period of validity of a
determination of serious damage or actual threat thereof for the purpose of
invoking safeguard action shall not exceed 90-days from the date of
initial notification as set forth in paragraph&#160;7.<p>6.    In the
application of the transitional safeguard, particular account shall be taken
of the interests of exporting Members as set out below:<p> (a)
least-developed country Members shall be accorded treatment significantly
more favorable than that provided to the other groups of Members referred to
in this paragraph, preferably in all its elements but, at least, on overall
terms;<p> (b)    Members whose total volume of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000103200015"></a><a href="15.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000103300056"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>textile and clothing exports

paragraphs&#160;2 and 3 of Article&#160;1, of the future possibilities for
the development of their trade and the need to allow commercial quantities of
imports from them;<p> (c)    with respect to wool products from

proposing to take safeguard action shall seek consultations with the Member
or Members which would be affected by such action. The request for
consultations shall be accompanied by specific and relevant factual
information, as up-to-date as possible, particularly in regard to:
(<i>a</i>)-the factors, referred to in paragraph&#160;3, on which the
Member invoking the action has based its determination of the existence of
serious damage or actual threat thereof;  and (<i>b</i>)-the factors,
referred to in paragraph&#160;4, on the basis of which it proposes to invoke the
safeguard action with respect to the Member or Members concerned. In respect
of requests made under this paragraph, the information shall be related, as
closely as possible, to identifiable segments of production and to the
reference period set out in paragraph&#160;8. The Member invoking the action shall also indicate the specific level at
which <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000103500318"></a><a href="18.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000238900064"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>imports of the product in question from the Member or Members
concerned are proposed to be restrained; such level shall not be lower than
the level referred to in paragraph&#160;8. The Member seeking consultations shall,
at the same time, communicate to the Chairman of the TMB the request for
consultations, including all the relevant factual data outlined in
paragraphs&#160;3 and&#160;4, together with the proposed restraint level. The
Chairman shall inform the members of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000103500480"></a><a href="t.htm#_ICONOVEX_TMBOFREQUEST"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>TMB of the request for
consultations, indicating the requesting Member, the product in question and
the Member having received the request. The Member or Members concerned shall
respond to this request promptly and the consultations shall be held without
delay and normally be completed within 60-days of the date on which the
request was received.<p>8.    If, in the consultations, there is mutual
understanding that the situation calls for restraint on the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000103600037"></a><a href="e.htm#_ICONOVEX_EXPORTSOFPARTICULARPRODUCT"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>exports of the
particular product from the Member or Members concerned, the level of such
restraint shall be fixed at a level not lower than the actual level of
exports or imports from the Member concerned during the 12-month period
terminating two months preceding the month in which the request for
consultation was made. <p>9.    <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000103700003"></a><a href="r.htm#_ICONOVEX_RESTRAINTMEASUREDETAILSOFAGREED"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Details of the agreed restraint measure shall
be communicated to the TMB within 60-days from the date of conclusion of
the agreement. The TMB shall determine whether the agreement is justified in
accordance with the provisions of this Article. In order to make its
determination, the TMB shall have available to it the factual data provided
to the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000103700125"></a><a href="15.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000103800335"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Chairman of the TMB, referred to in paragraph&#160;7, as well as any
other relevant information provided by the Members concerned. The TMB may
make such recommendations as it deems appropriate to the Members
concerned.<p>10.    If, however, after the expiry of the period of
60-days from the date on which the request for consultations was
received, there has been no agreement between the Members, the Member which
proposed to take safeguard action may apply the restraint by date of import
or date of export, in accordance with the provisions of this Article, within
30-days following the 60-day period for consultations, and at the same
time refer the matter to the TMB. It shall be open to either Member to refer
the matter to the TMB before the expiry of the period of 60-days. In
either case, the TMB shall promptly conduct an examination of the matter,
including the determination of serious damage, or actual threat thereof, and
its causes, and make appropriate recommendations to the Members concerned
within 30-days. In order to conduct such examination, the TMB shall have
available to it the factual data provided to the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000103800335"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CHAIRMANOFTMB"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Chairman of the TMB,
referred to in paragraph&#160;7, as well as any other relevant information
provided by the Members concerned.<p>11.    In highly unusual and critical
circumstances, where delay would cause damage which would be difficult to
repair, action under paragraph&#160;10 may be taken provisionally on the
condition that the request for consultations and notification to the TMB
shall be effected within no more than five working days after taking the
action. In the case that consultations do not produce agreement, the TMB
shall be notified at the conclusion of consultations, but in any case no
later than 60-days from the date of the implementation of the action.
The TMB shall promptly conduct an examination of the matter, and make
appropriate recommendations to the Members concerned within 30-days.  In
the case that consultations do produce agreement, Members shall notify the
TMB upon conclusion but, in any case, no later than 90-days from the
date of the implementation of the action. The TMB may make such
recommendations as it deems appropriate to the Members concerned.<p>12.    A
Member may maintain measures invoked pursuant to the provisions of this
Article: (<i>a</i>) for up to three years without extension, or (<i>b</i>)
until the product is integrated into <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000104000071"></a><a href="24.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000394000070"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>GATT 1994, whichever comes first.<p>13.

the level for subsequent years shall be the level specified for the first
year increased by a growth rate of not less than 6-per-cent per
annum, unless otherwise justified to the TMB. The <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000104100101"></a><a href="r.htm#_ICONOVEX_RESTRAINTLEVEL"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>restraint level for the
product concerned may be exceeded in either year of any two subsequent years
by carry forward and/or carryover of 10-per-cent of which carry
forward shall not represent more than 5-per-cent. No quantitative
limits shall be placed on the combined use of carryover, carry forward and
the provision of paragraph&#160;14.<p>14.    When more than one product from
another Member is placed under restraint under this Article by a Member, the
level of restraint agreed, pursuant to the provisions of this Article, for
each of these products may be exceeded by 7-per-cent, provided that
the total exports subject to restraint do not exceed the total of the levels
for all products so restrained under this Article, on the basis of agreed
common units. Where the periods of application of restraints of these
products do not coincide with each other, this provision shall be applied to
any overlapping period on a <i>pro-rata </i>basis.<p>15.    If a
safeguard action is applied under this Article to a product for which a
restraint was previously in place under the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000104300047"></a><a href="m.htm#_ICONOVEX_MFA"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>MFA during the 12-month period

not maintaining a restraint under Article&#160;2 decides to apply a restraint
pursuant to the provisions of this Article, it shall establish appropriate
arrangements which: (<i>a</i>)-take full account of such factors as

implementation of this Agreement, to examine all measures taken under this
Agreement and their conformity therewith, and to take the actions
specifically required of it by this Agreement, the textiles Monitoring Body
("TMB") is hereby established. The TMB shall consist of a Chairman and 10
members. Its membership shall be balanced and broadly representative of the
Members and shall provide for rotation of its members at appropriate
intervals. The members shall be appointed by Members designated by the
Council for Trade in Goods to serve on the TMB, discharging their function on
an <i>ad-persona</i> basis. <p> 2.    The TMB shall develop its own
working procedures. It is understood, however, that consensus within the TMB
does not require the assent or concurrence of members appointed by  Members
involved in an unresolved issue under review by the TMB.<p>3.    The TMB
shall be considered as a standing body and shall meet as necessary to carry
out the functions required of it under this Agreement. It shall rely on
notifications and information supplied by the Members under the relevant
Articles of this Agreement, supplemented by any additional information or
necessary details they may submit or it may decide to seek from them. It may
also rely on notifications to and reports from other WTO bodies and from such
other sources as it may deem appropriate. <p>4.    Members shall afford to
each other adequate opportunity for consultations with respect to any matters
affecting the operation of this Agreement.<p>5.    In the absence of any
mutually agreed solution in the bilateral consultations provided for in this
Agreement, the TMB shall, at the request of either Member, and following a
thorough and prompt consideration of the matter, make recommendations to the
Members concerned.<p>6.    At the request of any Member, the TMB shall review
promptly any particular matter which that Member considers to be detrimental
to its interests under this Agreement and where consultations between it and
the Member or Members concerned have failed to produce a mutually
satisfactory solution. On such matters, the TMB may make such observations as
it deems appropriate to the Members concerned and for the purposes of the
review provided for in paragraph&#160;11.<p>7.    Before formulating its
recommendations or observations, the TMB shall invite participation of such
Members as may be directly affected by the matter in question.<p>8.
Whenever the TMB is called upon to make recommendations or findings, it shall
do so, preferably within a period of 30 days, unless a different time period
is specified in this Agreement. All such recommendations or findings shall be
communicated to the Members directly concerned. All such recommendations or
findings shall also be communicated to the Council for Trade in Goods for its
information.<p>9.    The Members shall endeavor to accept in full the
recommendations of the TMB, which shall exercise proper surveillance of the
implementation of such recommendations.<p>10.    If a Member considers itself
unable to conform with the recommendations of the TMB, it shall provide the
TMB with the reasons therefore not later than one month after receipt of such
recommendations. Following thorough consideration of the reasons given, the
TMB shall issue any further recommendations it considers appropriate
forthwith. If, after such further recommendations, the matter remains
unresolved, either Member may bring the matter before the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000106800146"></a><a href="16.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000210000055"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Dispute Settlement

ANNEX 3 <br>
TRADE POLICY REVIEW MECHANISM </h1>
<i>Members</i> hereby <i>agree</i> as follows:<p>
<i>A. Objectives</i><p>
    (i)    The purpose of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000549300013"></a><a href="t.htm#_ICONOVEX_TRADEPOLICYREVIEWMECHANISM"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Trade Policy Review Mechanism ("TPRM") is to
contribute to improved adherence by all Members to rules, disciplines and
commitments made under the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000549300063"></a><a href="28.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000550800426"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Multilateral Trade Agreements and, where
applicable, the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000549300080"></a><a href="28.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000550800443"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Plurilateral Trade Agreements, and hence to the smoother
functioning of the multilateral trading system, by achieving greater
transparency in, and understanding of, the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000549300131"></a><a href="28.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000549900007"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>trade policies and practices of
Members. Accordingly, the review mechanism enables the regular collective
appreciation and evaluation of the full range of individual <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000549300180"></a><a href="m.htm#_ICONOVEX_MEMBERSTRADEPOLICIES"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Members' trade
policies and practices and their impact on the functioning of the
multilateral trading system. It is not, however, intended to serve as a basis
for the enforcement of specific obligations under the Agreements or for
dispute settlement procedures, or to impose new policy commitments on
Members.<p>    (ii)    The assessment carried out under the review mechanism
takes place, to the extent relevant, against the background of the wider
economic and developmental needs, policies and objectives of the Member
concerned, as well as of its external environment. However, the function of
the review mechanism is to examine the impact of a <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000549400115"></a><a href="28.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000549900310"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Member's trade policies
and practices on the multilateral trading system.<i><p></i> <i>B. Domestic
transparency</i><p> Members recognize the inherent value of domestic
    <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000549600015"></a><a href="t.htm#_ICONOVEX_TRANSPARENCYOFGOVERNMENT"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>transparency of government decision-making on <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000549600026"></a><a href="t.htm#_ICONOVEX_TRADEPOLICYMATTERS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>trade policy matters for
    both <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000549600037"></a><a href="m.htm#_ICONOVEX_MEMBERSECONOMIES"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Members' economies and the multilateral trading system, and agree to
encourage and promote greater transparency within their own systems,
acknowledging that the implementation of domestic transparency must be on a
voluntary basis and take account of each Member's legal and <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000549600121"></a><a href="p.htm#_ICONOVEX_POLITICALSYSTEMS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>political
systems.<p> <i>C. Procedures for review</i><p> (i)    The <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000549800007"></a><a href="t.htm#_ICONOVEX_TRADEPOLICYREVIEWBODY"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Trade Policy Review
    Body (referred to herein as the "TPRB") is hereby established to carry
out <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000549800044"></a><a href="28.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000551000137"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>trade policy reviews.<p> (ii)    The <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000549900007"></a><a href="28.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000550400092"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>trade policies and practices of all
    Members shall be subject to periodic review. The impact of individual
Members on the functioning of the multilateral trading system, defined in
terms of their share of world trade in a recent representative period, will
be the determining factor in deciding on the frequency of reviews. The first
four trading entities so identified (counting the European Communities as
one) shall be subject to review every two years. The next 16 shall be
reviewed every four years. Other Members shall be reviewed every six years,
except that a longer period may be fixed for least-developed country Members.
It is understood that the review of entities having a common external policy
covering more than one Member shall cover all components of policy affecting
trade including relevant policies and practices of the individual Members.
Exceptionally, in the event of changes in a <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000549900310"></a><a href="28.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000550000060"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Member's trade policies or
practices that may have a significant impact on its trading partners, the
Member concerned may be requested by the TPRB, after consultation, to bring
forward its next review.<p>    (iii)    Discussions in the meetings of the
TPRB shall be governed by the objectives set forth in paragraph A. The focus
of these discussions shall be on the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000550000060"></a><a href="m.htm#_ICONOVEX_MEMBERSTRADEPOLICIES"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Member's trade policies and practices,
which are the subject of the assessment under the review mechanism.<p>
(iv)    The TPRB shall establish a basic plan for the conduct of the reviews.
It may also discuss and take note of updated reports from Members. The TPRB
shall establish a program of reviews for each year in consultation with the
Members directly concerned. In consultation with the Member or Members under
review, the Chairman may choose discussants who, acting in their personal
capacity, shall introduce the discussions in the TPRB.<p>    (v)    The TPRB
shall base its work on the following documentation:<p> (a)    a full report,
	referred to in paragraph D, supplied by the Member or Members under
review;<p> (b)    a report, to be drawn up by the Secretariat on its own
responsibility, based on the information available to it and that provided by
the Member or Members concerned. The Secretariat should seek clarification
from the Member or Members concerned of their <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000550400092"></a><a href="28.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000550800049"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>trade policies and
practices.<p> (vi)    The reports by the Member under review and by the
    Secretariat, together with the minutes of the respective meeting of the
TPRB, shall be published promptly after the review.<p>    (vii)    These
documents will be forwarded to the Ministerial Conference, which shall take
note of them.<p> <i>D. Reporting</i><p> In order to achieve the fullest
    possible degree of transparency, each Member shall report regularly to
the TPRB. Full reports shall describe the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000550800049"></a><a href="29b.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000642000106"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>trade policies and practices
pursued by the Member or Members concerned, based on an agreed format to be
decided upon by the TPRB. This format shall initially be based on the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000550800114"></a><a href="o.htm#_ICONOVEX_OUTLINEFORMAT"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Outline

19&#160;July&#160;1989 (BISD 36S/406-409), amended as necessary to extend the
coverage of reports to all aspects of trade policies covered by the
Multilateral Trade Agreements in Annex&#160;1 and, where applicable, the
Plurilateral Trade Agreements. This format may be revised by the TPRB in the
light of experience. Between reviews, Members shall provide brief reports
when there are any significant changes in their trade policies; an annual
update of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000550800288"></a><a href="s.htm#_ICONOVEX_STATISTICALINFORMATION"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>statistical information will be provided according to the agreed
format. Particular account shall be taken of difficulties presented to
least-developed country Members in compiling their reports. The Secretariat
shall make available <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000550800353"></a><a href="29a.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000568000023"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>technical assistance on request to developing country

performers shall have the possibility of preventing the following acts when
undertaken without their authorization: the fixation of their unfixed
performance and the reproduction of such fixation. Performers shall also
have the possibility of preventing the following acts when undertaken without
their authorization: the broadcasting by wireless means and the communication
to the public of their live performance.<p>2.    Producers of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000468500007"></a><a href="26.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000468700041"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>phonograms

material impairment of the exclusive rights of reproduction of right holders.
<p>5.  The term of the protection available under this Agreement to
performers and producers of phonograms shall last at least until the end of a
period of 50 years computed from the end of the calendar year in which the

indications which identify a good as originating in the territory of a
Member, or a region or locality in that territory, where a given quality,
reputation or other characteristic of the good is essentially attributable
to its geographical origin.<p> 2.    In respect of geographical indications,
Members shall provide the legal means for interested parties to prevent: <p>
(a)    the use of any means in the designation or presentation of a good
that indicates or suggests that the good in question originates in a

shall, <i>ex&#160;officio</i> if its legislation so permits or at the request
of an interested party, refuse or invalidate the registration of a trademark
which contains or consists of a geographical indication with respect to goods
not originating in the territory indicated, if use of the indication in the
trademark for such goods in that Member is of such a nature as to mislead the
public as to the true place of origin.<p> 4.    The protection under
paragraphs 1, 2 and 3 shall be applicable against a geographical indication
which, although literally true as to the territory, region or locality in
which the goods originate, falsely represents to the public that the goods
originate in another territory.<p>

In the case of homonymous geographical indications for wines, protection
shall be accorded to each indication, subject to the provisions of paragraph
4 of Article 22. Each Member shall determine the practical conditions under
which the homonymous indications in question will be differentiated from each
other, taking into account the need to ensure equitable treatment of the
producers concerned and that consumers are not misled.<p> 4.    In order to
facilitate the protection of geographical indications for wines, negotiations
shall be undertaken in the Council for TRIPS concerning the establishment of

Requirements for Protection </h3>


1.    Members shall provide for the protection of independently created
industrial designs that are new or original. Members may provide that designs

prevent third parties not having the owner's from making, selling or
importing articles bearing or embodying a design which is a copy, or
substantially a copy, of the protected design, when such acts are undertaken
for commercial purposes.  2.    Members may provide limited exceptions to the
protection of industrial designs, provided that such exceptions do not
unreasonably conflict with the normal exploitation of protected industrial
designs and do not unreasonably prejudice the legitimate interests of the
owner of the protected design, taking account of the legitimate interests of
third parties.<p> 3.    The duration of protection available shall amount to
at least 10 years.<p>

<h2>
        PART&#160;II </h2><h2>
DISCIPLINES TO GOVERN THE APPLICATION OF RULES OF ORIGIN </h2><h3>
Article&#160;2 </h3><h3>
Disciplines During the Transition Period </h3>
    Until the work program for the harmonization of rules of origin set
out in Part&#160;IV is completed, Members shall ensure that:<p> (a)    when
they issue administrative determinations of general application, the
requirements to be fulfilled are clearly defined. In particular:<p> (i)    in
cases where the criterion of change of tariff classification is applied, such
a rule of origin, and any exceptions to the rule, must clearly specify the
subheadings or headings within the tariff nomenclature that are addressed by
the rule;<p> (ii)    in cases where the ad-valorem percentage criterion
is applied, the method for calculating this percentage shall also be
indicated in the rules of origin;<p> (iii)    in cases where the criterion of
manufacturing or processing operation is prescribed, the operation that
confers origin on the good concerned shall be precisely specified;<p> (b)
notwithstanding the measure or instrument of commercial policy to which they
are linked, their rules of origin are not used as instruments to pursue trade
objectives directly or indirectly;<p> (c)    rules of origin shall not
themselves create restrictive, distorting, or disruptive effects on
<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000309600033"></a><a href="22.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000324300013"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>international trade. They shall not pose unduly strict requirements or
require the fulfillment of a certain condition not related to manufacturing or
processing, as a prerequisite for the determination of the country of origin.
However, costs not directly related to manufacturing or processing may be
included for the purposes of the application of an ad-valorem percentage
criterion consistent with subparagraph&#160;(a);<p> (d)    the rules of
origin that they apply to imports and exports are not more stringent than the
rules of origin they apply to determine whether or not a good is domestic and
shall not discriminate between other Members, irrespective of the affiliation
of the manufacturers of the good concerned With respect to rules of origin
applied for the purposes of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000309700126"></a><a href="29.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000552500007"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>government procurement, this provision shall not
create obligations additional to those already assumed by Members under
GATT&#160;1994.  ;<p> (e)    their rules of origin are administered in a
consistent, uniform, impartial and reasonable manner;<p> (f)    their rules
of origin are based on a positive standard. Rules of origin that state what
does not confer origin (negative standard) are permissible as part of a
clarification of a positive standard or in individual cases where a positive
determination of origin is not necessary;<p> (g)    their laws, regulations,
judicial decisions and administrative rulings of general application relating
to rules of origin are published as if they were subject to, and in
accordance with, the provisions of paragraph&#160;1 of Article&#160;X of
GATT&#160;1994;<p> (h)    upon the request of an exporter, importer or any
person with a justifiable cause, assessments of the origin they would accord
to a good are issued as soon as possible but no later than 150 days In
respect of requests made during the first year from the date of entry into
force of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000310100115"></a><a href="21.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000317100038"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>WTO Agreement, Members shall only be required to issue these
assessments as soon as possible.  after a request for such an assessment
provided that all necessary elements have been submitted.  Requests for such
assessments shall be accepted before trade in the good concerned begins and
may be accepted at any later point in time. Such assessments shall remain
valid for three years provided that the facts and conditions, including the
rules of origin, under which they have been made remain comparable. Provided
that the parties concerned are informed in advance, such assessments will no
longer be valid when a decision contrary to the assessment is made in a
review as referred to in subparagraph&#160;(j). Such assessments shall be
made publicly available subject to the provisions of
subparagraph&#160;(k);<p> (i)    when introducing changes to their rules of
    origin or new rules of origin, they shall not apply such changes
retroactively as defined in, and without prejudice to, their laws or
regulations;<p> (j)    any administrative action which they take in relation
to the determination of origin is reviewable promptly by judicial, arbitral
or administrative tribunals or procedures, independent of the authority
issuing the determination, which can effect the modification or reversal of
the determination;<p> (k)    all information that is by nature confidential
or that is provided on a confidential basis for the purpose of the
application of rules of origin is treated as strictly confidential by the
authorities concerned, which shall not disclose it without the specific
permission of the person or government providing such information, except to
the extent that it may be required to be disclosed in the context of
judicial proceedings.<p>

harmonized rules of origin, Members shall ensure, upon the implementation of
the results of the harmonization work program, that:<p>
    (a)    they apply rules of origin equally for all purposes as set out in
Article&#160;1;<p> (b)    under their rules of origin, the country to be
determined as the origin of a particular good is either the country where the
good has been wholly obtained or, when more than one country is concerned in
the production of the good, the country where the last substantial
transformation has been carried out;<p> (c)    the rules of origin that they
apply to imports and exports are not more stringent than the rules of origin
they apply to determine whether or not a good is domestic and shall not
discriminate between other Members, irrespective of the affiliation of the
manufacturers of the good concerned;<p> (d)    the rules of origin are
administered in a consistent, uniform, impartial and reasonable manner;<p>
(e)    their laws, regulations, judicial decisions and administrative

paragraph&#160;1 of Article&#160;X of GATT&#160;1994;<p> (f) upon the request of an
exporter, importer or any person with a justifiable cause, assessments of the

concerned are informed in advance, such assessments will no longer be valid
when a decision contrary to the assessment is made in a review as referred to
in subparagraph&#160;(h).  Such assessments shall be made publicly available
subject to the provisions of subparagraph&#160;(i);<p> (g)    when introducing
changes to their rules of origin or new rules of origin, they shall not apply
such changes retroactively as defined in, and without prejudice to, their
laws or regulations;<p> (h)    any administrative action which they take in
relation to the determination of origin is reviewable promptly by judicial,

PART IV </h2>

<h2>
HARMONIZATION OF RULES OF ORIGIN </h2>

<h3>
Article 9 </h3>

<h3>
Objectives and Principles </h3>


1.    With the objectives of harmonizing rules of origin and,
<i>inter-alia</i>, providing more certainty in the conduct of world
trade, the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000316200051"></a><a href="21.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000319200006"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Ministerial Conference shall undertake the work program set out
below in conjunction with the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000316200080"></a><a href="21.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000320700091"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>CCC, on the basis of the following
principles:<p> (a)    rules of origin should be applied equally for all
purposes as set out in Article&#160;1;<p> (b)    rules of origin should
provide for the country to be determined as the origin of a particular good
to be either the country where the good has been wholly obtained or, when
more than one country is concerned in the production of the good, the country
where the last substantial transformation has been carried out;<p> (c)
rules of origin should be objective, understandable and predictable;<p> (d)
notwithstanding the measure or instrument to which they may be linked, rules
of origin should not be used as instruments to pursue trade objectives
directly or indirectly. They should not themselves create restrictive,
distorting or disruptive effects on international trade. They should not pose
unduly strict requirements or require the fulfillment of a certain condition
not relating to manufacturing or processing as a prerequisite for the
determination of the country of origin. However, costs not directly related
to manufacturing or processing may be included for purposes of the
application of an ad-valorem percentage criterion;<p> (e)    rules of
origin should be administrable in a consistent, uniform, impartial and
reasonable manner;<p>
(f)    rules of origin should be coherent;<p>
(g)    rules of origin should be based on a positive standard. Negative
standards may be used to clarify a positive standard.<p>
<i>Work&#160;Program</i><p>
2.    (a)    The work program shall be initiated as soon after the entry
into force of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000317100038"></a><a href="21.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000322500109"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>WTO Agreement as possible and will be completed within

ANNEX&#160;II <br>
COMMON DECLARATION WITH REGARD TO PREFERENTIAL RULES OF ORIGIN </h2>


1.    Recognizing that some Members apply preferential rules of origin,
distinct from non-preferential rules of origin, the Members hereby
<i>agree</i> as follows.<p>2.    For the purposes of this Common Declaration,
preferential rules of origin shall be defined as those laws, regulations and

going beyond the application of paragraph&#160;1 of Article&#160;I of
GATT&#160;1994.<p> 3.    The Members <i>agree</i> to ensure that:<p> (a)
when they issue administrative determinations of general application, the
requirements to be fulfilled are clearly defined. In particular:<p> (i)
in cases where the criterion of change of tariff classification is applied,
such a preferential rule of origin, and any exceptions to the rule, must
clearly specify the subheadings or headings within the tariff nomenclature
that are addressed by the rule;<p> (ii)    in cases where the ad-valorem
percentage criterion is applied, the method for calculating this percentage
shall also be indicated in the preferential rules of origin;<p> (iii)    in
cases where the criterion of manufacturing or processing operation is
prescribed, the operation that confers preferential origin shall be precisely
specified;<p> (b)    their preferential rules of origin are based on a
positive standard. Preferential rules of origin that state what does not
confer preferential origin (negative standard) are permissible as part of a
clarification of a positive standard or in individual cases where a positive
determination of preferential origin is not necessary;<p> (c)    their laws,
regulations, judicial decisions and administrative rulings of general

required to issue these assessments as soon as possible.  after a request for
 such an assessment provided that all necessary elements have been submitted.
Requests for such assessments shall be accepted before trade in the good
concerned begins and may be accepted at any later point in time. Such
assessments shall remain valid for three years provided that the facts and
conditions, including the preferential rules of origin, under which they have
been made remain comparable. Provided that the parties concerned are informed
in advance, such assessments will no longer be valid when a decision contrary
to the assessment is made in a review as referred to in
subparagraph&#160;(f). Such assessments shall be made publicly available
subject to the provisions of subparagraph&#160;(g);<p> (e)    when
introducing changes to their preferential rules of origin or new preferential
rules of origin, they shall not apply such changes retroactively as defined
in, and without prejudice to, their laws or regulations;<p> (f)    any
administrative action which they take in relation to the determination of
preferential origin is reviewable promptly by judicial, arbitral or
administrative tribunals or procedures, independent of the authority issuing
the determination, which can effect the modification or reversal of the
determination;<p> (g)    all information that is by nature confidential or
that is provided on a confidential basis for the purpose of the application
of preferential rules of origin is treated as strictly confidential by the
authorities concerned, which shall not disclose it without the specific
permission of the person or government providing such information, except to
the extent that it may be required to be disclosed in the context of judicial
proceedings.<p> 4.    Members <i>agree </i>to provide to the Secretariat
promptly their preferential rules of origin, including a listing of the
preferential arrangements to which they apply, <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000322900056"></a><a href="26.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000490200088"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>judicial decisions, and

Agreement for the Member concerned. Furthermore, Members agree to provide any

Article V </h3><h3>
Economic Integration </h3>
1.    This Agreement shall not prevent any of its Members from being a party
to or entering into an agreement liberalizing trade in services between or
among the parties to such an agreement, provided that such an agreement:<p>
(a)    has substantial sectoral coverage
This condition is understood in terms of number of sectors, volume of trade
affected and modes of supply. In order to meet this condition, agreements
should not provide for the <i>a priori</i> exclusion of any mode of supply.

, and <p>
(b)    provides for the absence or elimination of substantially all
discrimination, in the sense of Article XVII, between or among the parties,
in the sectors covered under subparagraph&#160;(a), through:<p> (i)
elimination of existing discriminatory measures, and/or<p> (ii)
prohibition of new or more discriminatory measures,<p> either at the entry
into force of that agreement or on the basis of a reasonable time-frame,
except for measures permitted under Articles&#160;XI, XII,&#160;XIV and XIV
<i>bis</i>.<p> 2.    In evaluating whether the conditions under paragraph

countries concerned. <p>3.    (a)    Where developing countries are parties
to an agreement of the type referred to in paragraph&#160;1, flexibility
shall be provided for regarding the conditions set out in paragraph 1,
particularly with reference to subparagraph (b) thereof, in accordance with
the level of development of the countries concerned, both overall and in
individual sectors and subsectors.<p>    (b)    Notwithstanding
paragraph&#160;6, in the case of an agreement of the type referred to in
paragraph&#160;1 involving only developing countries, more favorable
treatment may be granted to juridical persons owned or controlled by natural
persons of the parties to such an agreement.<p>4.    Any agreement referred
to in paragraph&#160;1 shall be designed to facilitate trade between the
parties to the agreement and shall not in respect of any Member outside the
agreement raise the overall level of barriers to trade in services within the
respective sectors or subsectors compared to the level applicable prior to
such an agreement. <p>5.    If, in the conclusion, enlargement or any
significant modification of any agreement under paragraph&#160;1, a Member
intends to withdraw or modify a specific commitment inconsistently with the
terms and conditions set out in its Schedule, it shall provide at least
90&#160;days advance notice of such modification or withdrawal and the
procedure set forth in paragraphs&#160;2, 3 and 4 of Article&#160;XXI shall
apply.<p>6.    A service supplier of any other Member that is a juridical
person constituted under the laws of a party to an agreement referred to in
paragraph&#160;1 shall be entitled to treatment granted under such agreement,
provided that it engages in substantive business operations in the territory
of the parties to such agreement. <p>7.    (a)    Members which are parties
to any agreement referred to in paragraph&#160;1 shall promptly notify any
such agreement and any enlargement or any significant modification of that
agreement to the Council for Trade in Services. They shall also make
available to the Council such relevant information as may be requested by it.
The Council may establish a working  party to examine such an agreement or
enlargement or modification of that agreement and to report to the Council
on its consistency with this Article.<p>    (b)    Members which are parties
to any agreement referred to in paragraph 1 which is implemented on the basis
of a time-frame shall report periodically to the Council for Trade in
Services on its implementation. The Council may establish a working party to
examine such reports if it deems such a working party necessary. <p>    (c)
Based on the reports of the working parties referred to in subparagraphs (a)
and (b), the Council may make recommendations to the parties as it deems
appropriate.<p> 8.    A Member which is a party to any agreement referred to
in paragraph 1 may not seek compensation for <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000410200042"></a><a href="t.htm#_ICONOVEX_TRADEBENEFITS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>trade benefits that may accrue

ensure that the procedures in fact provide for an objective and impartial

to require a Member to institute such tribunals or procedures where this
would be inconsistent with its constitutional structure or the nature of its
legal system.<p>3.  Where authorization is required for the supply of a
service on which a specific commitment has been made, the competent
authorities of a Member shall, within a reasonable period of time after the
submission of an application considered complete under domestic laws and

Restrictions to Safeguard the Balance of Payments </h3>
1.    In the event of serious balance-of-payments and external financial
difficulties or threat thereof, a Member may adopt or maintain restrictions
on trade in services on which it has undertaken specific commitments,
including on payments or transfers for transactions related to such
commitments. It is recognized that particular pressures on the balance of
payments of a Member in the process of economic development or economic
transition may necessitate the use of restrictions to ensure, <i>inter
alia,</i> the maintenance of a level of financial reserves adequate for the
implementation of its program of economic development or economic
transition.<p> 2.    The restrictions referred to in paragraph 1:<p> (a)
shall not discriminate among Members;<p> (b)    shall be consistent with the
Articles of Agreement of the International Monetary Fund;<p> (c)    shall
avoid unnecessary damage to the commercial, economic and financial interests
of any other Member;<p> (d)    shall not exceed those necessary to deal with
     the circumstances described in paragraph&#160;1;<p> (e)    shall be
temporary and be phased out progressively as the situation specified in
paragraph 1 improves.<p> 3.    In determining the incidence of such
restrictions, Members may give priority to the supply of services which are
more essential to their economic or development programs. However, such
restrictions shall not be adopted or maintained for the purpose of protecting
a particular service sector.<p>4.    Any restrictions adopted or maintained
under paragraph 1, or any changes therein, shall be promptly notified to the
General Council.<p>5.    (a)    Members applying the provisions of this

Negotiation of  Specific Commitments </h3>
1.    In pursuance of the objectives of this Agreement, Members shall enter
into successive rounds of negotiations, beginning not later than&#160;five
years from the date of entry into force of the WTO Agreement and
periodically thereafter, with a view to achieving a progressively higher

respect for national policy objectives and the level of development of
individual Members, both overall and in individual sectors. There shall be
appropriate flexibility for individual developing country Members for opening
fewer sectors, liberalizing fewer types of transactions, progressively
extending market access in line with their development situation and, when
making access to their markets available to foreign service suppliers,
attaching to such access conditions aimed at achieving the objectives
referred to in Article&#160;IV.<p>3.    For each round, negotiating
guidelines and procedures shall be established. For the purposes of
establishing such guidelines, the Council for Trade in Services shall carry

out in paragraph&#160;1 of Article IV. Negotiating guidelines shall establish
modalities for the treatment of liberalization undertaken autonomously by
Members since previous negotiations, as well as for the special treatment for
least-developed country Members under the provisions of paragraph&#160;3 of
Article IV.<p> 4.    The process of progressive liberalization shall be
advanced in each such round through bilateral, <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000427500033"></a><a href="p.htm#_ICONOVEX_PLURILATERAL"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>plurilateral or multilateral

specified in Appendix I.  For each Party, <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000556700062"></a><a href="29a.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000557900042"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Appendix I is divided into five

    provisions of this Agreement.<p> -    Annex 4 specifies services, whether
    listed positively or negatively, covered by this Agreement.  <p> -
    Annex 5 specifies covered construction services.<p> Relevant thresholds
    are specified in each <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000557300013"></a><a href="p.htm#_ICONOVEX_PARTYSANNEXES"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Party's Annexes.  <p><p>2.    This Agreement
 applies to procurement by any contractual means, including through such
methods as purchase or as lease, rental or hire purchase, with or without an
option to buy, including any combination of products and services.<p>  <p>3.
Where entities, in the context of procurement covered under this Agreement,
require enterprises not included in Appendix I to award contracts in
accordance with particular requirements, Article&#160;III shall apply
<i>mutatis mutandis</i> to such requirements.<p><p>4.    This Agreement
applies to any procurement <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000557900015"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CONTRACTOFVALUE"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>contract of a value of not less than the relevant
threshold specified in <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000557900042"></a><a href="29a.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000605000159"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Appendix I.<p><p><p><h3>
Article&#160;II </h3><h3>
 </h3><h3>
Valuation of Contracts </h3>
<p>1.    The following provisions shall apply in determining the value of
contracts This Agreement shall apply to any procurement contract for which
     the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000558900047"></a><a href="29a.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000560300039"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>contract value is estimated to equal or exceed the threshold at the
time of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000558900076"></a><a href="p.htm#_ICONOVEX_PUBLICATIONOFNOTICE"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>publication of the notice in accordance with <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000558900091"></a><a href="index.htm#_ICONOVEX_ARTICLEIX"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Article IX.  for
 purposes of implementing this Agreement.<p><p>2.    Valuation shall take
into account all forms of remuneration, including any premiums, fees,
commissions and interest receivable.<p><p>3.    The selection of the
valuation method by the entity shall not be used, nor shall any procurement
requirement be divided, with the intention of avoiding the application of
this Agreement.<p><p>4.    If an individual requirement for a procurement
results in the award of more than one contract, or in contracts being awarded
in separate parts, the basis for valuation shall be either:<p><p> (a)    the
actual value of similar recurring contracts concluded over the previous
fiscal year or 12 months adjusted, where possible, for anticipated changes in
quantity and value over the subsequent 12 months;  or<p> <p> (b)    the
estimated value of recurring contracts in the fiscal year or 12 months
subsequent to the initial contract.<p> <p>5.    In cases of contracts for the
lease, rental or hire purchase of products or services, or in the case of
contracts which do not specify a total price, the basis for valuation shall
be:<p> <p> (a)    in the case of fixed-term contracts, where their term is 12
months or less, the total <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000560300039"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CONTRACTVALUE"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>contract value for their duration, or, where their
term exceeds 12 months, their total value including the estimated residual
value;<p> <p> (b)    in the case of contracts for an indefinite period, the
monthly instalment multiplied by 48. <p> <p>If there is any doubt, the second
basis for valuation, namely (b), is to be used.<p><p>6.    In cases where an

Procedures </h3> <p> 1.    To ensure optimum effective international
competition under selective tendering procedures, entities shall, for each
intended procurement, invite tenders from the maximum number of domestic
suppliers and suppliers of other Parties, consistent with the efficient
operation of the procurement system.  They shall select the suppliers to
participate in the procedure in a fair and non-discriminatory manner. <p>
<p>2.    Entities maintaining permanent lists of qualified suppliers may
select suppliers to be invited to tender from among those listed.  Any
selection shall allow for equitable opportunities for suppliers on the
lists.<p><p>3.    Suppliers requesting to participate in a particular
intended procurement shall be permitted to submit a tender and be considered,
provided, in the case of those not yet qualified, there is sufficient time to
complete the qualification procedure under Articles&#160;VIII and IX.  The
number of additional suppliers permitted to participate shall be limited only
by the efficient operation of the procurement system.<p><p>4.    Requests to
participate in selective tendering procedures may be submitted by telex,
telegram or facsimile.<p><p><p><h3> Article&#160;XI </h3><h3> </h3><h3>
Time-limits for Tendering and Delivery </h3>
<p><i>General</i><p><p>
1.    (a)    Any prescribed time-limit shall be adequate to allow suppliers
of other Parties as well as domestic suppliers to prepare and submit tenders
before the closing of the tendering procedures.  In determining any such
time-limit, entities shall, consistent with their own reasonable needs, take
into account such factors as the complexity of the intended procurement, the
extent of subcontracting anticipated and the normal time for transmitting
tenders by mail from foreign as well as domestic points.<p>

in selective procedures not involving the use of a permanent list of
qualified suppliers, the period for submitting an application to be invited
to tender shall not be less than 25 days from the date of publication
referred to in paragraph&#160;1 of Article&#160;IX;  the period for receipt
of tenders shall in no case be less than 40&#160;days from the date of
issuance of the invitation to tender;<p> <p> (c)    in selective procedures
involving the use of a permanent list of qualified suppliers, the period for
receipt of tenders shall not be less than 40 days from the date of the
initial issuance of invitations to tender, whether or not the date of initial
issuance of invitations to tender coincides with the date of the publication
referred to in paragraph&#160;1 of Article&#160;IX.  <p> <p>3.    The periods
referred to in paragraph 2 may be reduced in the circumstances set out
below:<p><p> (a)    if a separate notice has been published 40 days and not
more than 12 months in advance and the notice contains at least:  <p> <p> (i)

is available;<p> <p> (ii)    the information referred to in paragraph 8 of
Article&#160;IX;<p> <p> (iii)    a statement that interested suppliers should
express their interest in the procurement to the entity;  and<p> <p> (iv)
a contact point with the entity from which further information may be
obtained, <p> <p> the 40-day limit for receipt of tenders may be replaced by
a period sufficiently long to enable responsive tendering, which, as a
general rule, shall not be less than 24 days, but in any case not less than
10 days;<p> <p> (b)    in the case of the second or subsequent publications
dealing with contracts of a recurring nature within the meaning of paragraph
6 of Article&#160;IX, the 40-day limit for receipt of tenders may be reduced
to not less than 24 days;  <p> <p> (c)    where a state of urgency duly
substantiated by the entity renders impracticable the periods in question,
the periods specified in paragraph&#160;2 may be reduced but shall in no case
be less than 10&#160;days from the date of the publication referred to in
paragraph&#160;1 of Article&#160;IX; or<p> <p> (d)    the period referred to
in paragraph&#160;2(c) may, for procurements by entities listed in

the selected suppliers.  In the absence of agreement, the entity may fix
periods which shall be sufficiently long to enable responsive tendering and
shall in any case not be less than 10 days.  <p> <p>4.    Consistent with the
entity's own reasonable needs, any delivery date shall take into account such
factors as the complexity of the intended procurement, the extent of
subcontracting anticipated and the realistic time required for production,

Tenders&#160;and&#160;Awarding&#160;of&#160;Contracts </h3> <p> 1.    The
submission, receipt and opening of tenders and awarding of contracts shall
be consistent with the following:<p> <p> (a)    tenders shall normally be
submitted in writing directly or by mail.  If tenders by telex, telegram or
facsimile are permitted, the tender made thereby must include all the
information necessary for the evaluation of the tender, in particular the
definitive price proposed by the tenderer and a statement that the tenderer
agrees to all the terms, conditions and provisions of the invitation to

a supplier which complies with the conditions for participation.  If an
entity has received a tender abnormally lower than other tenders submitted,
it may inquire with the tenderer to ensure that it can comply with the
conditions of participation and be capable of fulfilling the terms of the
contract.<p> <p> (b)    Unless in the public interest an entity decides not
to issue the contract, the entity shall make the award to the tenderer who
has been determined to be fully capable of undertaking the contract and whose
tender, whether for domestic products or services, or products or services of
other Parties, is either the lowest tender or the tender which in terms of
the specific evaluation criteria set forth in the notices or tender

shall be made in accordance with the criteria and essential requirements

assist particular participants to bring their tenders up to the level of
other participants.<p><p>4.    Entities shall not, in the course of
negotiations, discriminate between different suppliers.  In particular, they

selective tendering procedures need not apply in the following conditions,
provided that limited tendering is not used with a view to avoiding maximum
possible competition or in a manner which would constitute a means of
discrimination among suppliers of other Parties or protection to domestic
producers or suppliers: <p><p> (a)    in the absence of tenders in response
to an open or selective tender, or when the tenders submitted have been
collusive, or not in conformity with the essential requirements in the
tender, or from suppliers who do not comply with the conditions for
participation provided for in accordance with this Agreement, on condition,
however, that the requirements of the initial tender are not substantially
modified in the contract as awarded;<p> <p> (b)    when, for works of art or
for reasons connected with protection of exclusive rights, such as patents or
copyrights, or in the absence of competition for technical reasons, the
products or services can be supplied only by a particular supplier and no
reasonable alternative or substitute exists;             <p> <p> (c)    in so
far as is strictly necessary when, for reasons of extreme urgency brought
about by events unforeseeable by the entity, the products or services could
not be obtained in time by means of open or selective tendering
procedures;<p> <p> (d)    for additional deliveries by the original supplier
which are intended either as parts replacement for existing supplies, or
installations, or as the extension of existing supplies, services, or
installations where a change of supplier would compel the entity to procure
equipment or services not meeting requirements of interchange-ability with
already existing equipment or services It is the understanding that "existing
     equipment" includes software to the extent that the initial procurement
     of the software was covered by the Agreement.  ;<p> <p> (e)    when an
entity procures prototypes or a first product or service which are developed
at its request in the course of, and for, a particular contract for research,
experiment, study or original development.  When such contracts have been
fulfilled, subsequent procurements of products or services shall be subject

<p>1.    Entities shall not, in the qualification and selection of
suppliers, products or services, or in the evaluation of tenders and award of

of technology, investment requirements, counter-trade or similar
requirements.  <p><p>2.    Nevertheless, having regard to general policy
considerations, including those relating to development, a developing country
may at the time of accession negotiate conditions for the use of offsets,
such as requirements for the incorporation of domestic content.  Such
requirements shall be used only for qualification to participate in the
procurement process and not as criteria for awarding contracts.  Conditions
shall be objective, clearly defined and non-discriminatory.  They shall be

Challenge Procedures </h3>
<p>
<i>Consultations</i><p>
<p>1.    In the event of a complaint by a supplier that there has been a
breach of this Agreement in the context of a procurement, each Party shall
encourage the supplier to seek resolution of its complaint in consultation
with the procuring entity.  In such instances the procuring entity shall
accord impartial and timely consideration to any such complaint, in a manner
that is not prejudicial to obtaining corrective measures under the challenge
system.<p><p><i>Challenge</i><p><p>2.    Each Party shall provide
non-discriminatory, timely, transparent and effective procedures enabling
suppliers to challenge alleged breaches of the Agreement arising in the
context of procurements in which they have, or have had, an interest.<p>
<p>3.    Each Party shall provide its challenge procedures in writing and
make them generally available.<p><p>4.    Each Party shall ensure that
documentation relating to all aspects of the process concerning procurements
covered by this Agreement shall be retained for three years.<p><p>5.    The
interested supplier may be required to initiate a challenge procedure and
notify the procuring entity within specified time-limits from the time when
the basis of the complaint is known or reasonably should have been known, but
in no case within a period of less than 10 days.  <p><p>6.    Challenges
shall be heard by a court or by an impartial and independent review body with
no interest in the outcome of the procurement and the members of which are
secure from external influence during the term of appointment.  A review

procedures shall provide for:<p><p> (a) rapid interim measures to correct
breaches of the Agreement and to preserve commercial opportunities.  Such
action may result in suspension of the procurement process.  However,
procedures may provide that overriding adverse consequences for the interests
concerned, including the public interest, may be taken into account in
deciding whether such measures should be applied.  In such circumstances,
just cause for not acting shall be provided in writing;<p> <p> (b)    an
assessment and a possibility for a decision on the justification of the
challenge;<p> <p> (c)    correction of the breach of the Agreement or
compensation for the loss or damages suffered, which may be limited to costs
for tender preparation or protest.  <p> <p>8.    With a view to the
preservation of the commercial and other interests involved, the challenge
procedure shall normally be completed in a timely fashion.<p><p><p><h3>

of GATT 1994.<p>

<h2>
Article-5 </h2>

<h2>
    Notification and Transitional Arrangements </h2>


1.    Members, within 90 days of the date of entry into force of the WTO
Agreement, shall notify the Council for Trade in <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000221600052"></a><a href="g.htm#_ICONOVEX_GOODSOFTRIMS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Goods of all TRIMs they are
applying that are not in conformity with the provisions of this Agreement.
Such TRIMs of general or specific application shall be notified, along with
their principal features.  In the case of TRIMs applied under discretionary
authority, each specific application shall be notified. Information that
would prejudice the legitimate commercial interests of particular enterprises
need not be disclosed.  <p> 2.    Each Member shall eliminate all TRIMs which
are notified under paragraph&#160;1 within two-years of the date of
entry into force of the WTO Agreement in the case of a developed country
Member, within five years in the case of a developing country Member, and
within seven-years in the case of a least-developed country Member. <p>
3.    On request, the Council for Trade in Goods may extend the transition
period for the elimination of TRIMs notified under paragraph&#160;1 for a
developing country Member, including a least-developed country Member, which
demonstrates particular difficulties in implementing the provisions of this
Agreement. In considering such a request, the Council for Trade in Goods
shall take into account the individual development, financial and <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000221800136"></a><a href="m.htm#_ICONOVEX_MEMBERTRADENEEDSOF"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>trade needs
of the Member in question.<p>4.    During the transition period, a Member
shall not modify the terms of any TRIM which it notifies under
paragraph&#160;1 from those prevailing at the date of entry into force of the WTO Agreement so as to increase the
degree of inconsistency with the provisions of Article&#160;2. TRIMs
introduced less than 180 days before the date of entry into force of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000221900131"></a><a href="19.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000270100107"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>WTO
Agreement shall not benefit from the transitional arrangements provided in
paragraph&#160;2.<p>
5.    Notwithstanding the provisions of Article&#160;2, a Member, in order
not to disadvantage established enterprises which are subject to a TRIM
notified under paragraph&#160;1, may apply during the transition period the
same TRIM to a new investment (<i>i</i>) where the products of such
investment are like products to those of the established enterprises, and
(<i>ii</i>) where necessary to avoid distorting the conditions of competition
between the new investment and the established enterprises. Any TRIM so
applied to a new <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000222000177"></a><a href="25.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000425100055"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>investment shall be notified to the Council for Trade in
Goods. The terms of such a TRIM shall be equivalent in their competitive
effect to those applicable to the established enterprises, and it shall be
terminated at the same time.<p>

<h2>
Article-6 </h2>

<h2>
Transparency </h2>


1.    Members reaffirm, with respect to TRIMs, their commitment to
obligations on transparency and notification in Article&#160;X of GATT&#160;1994,

<h1>
Understanding on the Interpretation of Article&#160;XXVIII of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 </h1>


<p>
<i>Members </i>hereby <i>agree</i> as follows:<p>1.    For the purposes of
modification or withdrawal of a concession, the Member which has the highest
ratio of exports affected by the concession (i.e. exports of the product to
the market of the Member modifying or withdrawing the concession) to its
total exports shall be deemed to have a principal supplying interest if it
does not already have an initial negotiating right or a principal supplying
interest as provided for in paragraph 1 of Article&#160;XXVIII. It is however
agreed that this paragraph will be reviewed by the Council for Trade in <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000034700194"></a><a href="g.htm#_ICONOVEX_GOODSFIVEYEARS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Goods
five years from the date of entry into force of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000034700219"></a><a href="12.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000036500057"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>WTO Agreement with a view
to deciding whether this criterion has worked satisfactorily in securing a
redistribution of negotiating rights in favor of small and medium-sized
exporting Members. If this is not the case, consideration will be given to
possible improvements, including, in the light of the availability of
adequate data, the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000034700329"></a><a href="index.htm#_ICONOVEX_ADOPTIONOFCRITERION"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>adoption of a criterion based on the ratio of exports
affected by the concession to exports to all <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000034700366"></a><a href="m.htm#_ICONOVEX_MARKETSOFPRODUCT"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>markets of the product in
question.<p>2.    Where a Member considers that it has a principal supplying
interest in terms of paragraph&#160;1, it should communicate its claim in
writing, with supporting evidence, to the Member proposing to modify or
withdraw a concession, and at the same time inform the Secretariat.
Paragraph&#160;4 of the "Procedures for Negotiations under Article&#160;XXVIII"
adopted on 10&#160;November&#160;1980 (BISD 27S/26-28) shall apply in these cases.<p>3.
In the determination of which Members have a principal supplying interest
(whether as provided for in paragraph&#160;1 above or in paragraph 1 of
Article&#160;XXVIII) or substantial interest, only trade in the affected product
which has taken place on an <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000034900088"></a><a href="47.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000685600049"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>MFN basis shall be taken into consideration.
However, trade in the affected product which has taken place under
non-contractual preferences shall also be taken into account if the trade in
question has ceased to benefit from such preferential treatment, thus
becoming <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000034900174"></a><a href="m.htm#_ICONOVEX_MFNTRADE"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>MFN trade, at the time of the negotiation for the modification or
withdrawal of the concession, or will do so by the conclusion of that
negotiation.<p>4.    When a <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000035000007"></a><a href="11.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000035200010"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>tariff concession is modified or withdrawn on a
new product (i.e. a product for which three years' trade statistics are not
available) the Member possessing initial negotiating rights on the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000035000074"></a><a href="11.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000035000281"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>tariff
line where the product is or was formerly classified shall be deemed to have
an initial negotiating right in the concession in question. The determination of principal supplying
and substantial interests and the calculation of compensation shall take into account, <i>inter-alia,
</i>production capacity and <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000035000170"></a><a href="13.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000069800039"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>investment in the affected product in the
<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000035000185"></a><a href="14.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000081500079"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>exporting Member and estimates of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000035000196"></a><a href="e.htm#_ICONOVEX_EXPORTGROWTH"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>export growth, as well as forecasts of
demand for the product in the importing Member. For the purposes of this
paragraph, "new product" is understood to include a <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000035000258"></a><a href="t.htm#_ICONOVEX_TARIFFITEM"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>tariff item created by
means of a breakout from an existing <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000035000281"></a><a href="t.htm#_ICONOVEX_TARIFFLINE"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>tariff line.<p>5.    Where a Member
considers that it has a principal supplying or a substantial interest in
terms of paragraph&#160;4, it should communicate its claim in writing, with
supporting evidence, to the Member proposing to modify or withdraw a
concession, and at the same time inform the Secretariat. Paragraph&#160;4 of
the above-mentioned "Procedures for Negotiations under Article&#160;XXVIII" shall
apply in these cases.<p> 6.    When an unlimited <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000035200010"></a><a href="t.htm#_ICONOVEX_TARIFFCONCESSION"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>tariff concession is

exceed the amount of the trade actually affected by the modification of the
concession. The basis for the calculation of compensation should be the
amount by which future trade prospects exceed the level of the quota. It is
understood that the calculation of future trade prospects should be based on
the greater of:<p> (a)    the average annual trade in the most recent
representative three-year period, increased by the average <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000035300036"></a><a href="index.htm#_ICONOVEX_ANNUALGROWTHRATEOFIMPORTS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>annual growth rate
of imports in that same period, or by 10 percent, whichever is the greater;
or<p> (b)    trade in the most recent year increased by 10 percent. <p> In
no case shall a <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000035500011"></a><a href="m.htm#_ICONOVEX_MEMBERSLIABILITY"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Member's liability for compensation exceed that which would
be entailed by complete withdrawal of the concession.<p>7.    Any Member
having a principal supplying interest, whether as provided for in paragraph 1
above or in paragraph&#160;1 of Article&#160;XXVIII, in a concession which is modified
or withdrawn shall be accorded an initial negotiating right in the
compensatory concessions, unless another form of compensation is agreed by
the Members concerned.

ANNEX 2 <br>
UNDERSTANDING ON RULES AND PROCEDURES GOVERNING THE SETTLEMENT OF
DISPUTES </h1>
<p><p>
<i>Members </i>hereby <i>agree </i>as follows:<p>

<h2>
Article 1 </h2><h2>
Coverage and Application </h2>
1.    The rules and procedures of this Understanding shall apply to disputes
brought pursuant to the consultation and dispute settlement provisions of the
agreements listed in <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000514700054"></a><a href="index.htm#_ICONOVEX_APPENDIX1"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Appendix 1 to this Understanding (referred to in this
Understanding as the "covered agreements"). The rules and procedures of this
Understanding shall also apply to consultations and the settlement of
disputes between Members concerning their rights and obligations under the
provisions of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000514700146"></a><a href="32.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000663200023"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Agreement Establishing the World Trade Organization
(referred to in this Understanding as the "WTO Agreement") and of this
Understanding taken in isolation or in combination with any other covered
agreement.<p>
2.    The rules and procedures of this Understanding shall apply subject to
such special or additional rules and procedures on dispute settlement
contained in the covered agreements as are identified in <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000514800064"></a><a href="index.htm#_ICONOVEX_APPENDIX2"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Appendix 2 to this
Understanding. To the extent that there is a difference between the rules
and procedures of this Understanding and the special or additional rules and
procedures set forth in Appendix&#160;2, the special or additional rules and
procedures in Appendix 2 shall prevail. In disputes involving rules and
procedures under more than one covered agreement, if there is a conflict
between special or additional rules and procedures of such agreements under
review, and where the parties to the dispute cannot agree on rules and
procedures within 20 days of the establishment of the panel, the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000514800267"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CHAIRMANOFDISPUTESETTLEMENTBODY"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Chairman of

(referred to in this Understanding as the "DSB"), in consultation with the
parties to the dispute, shall determine the rules and procedures to be
followed within 10 days after a request by either Member. The Chairman shall
be guided by the principle that special or additional rules and procedures
should be used where possible, and the rules and procedures set out in this
Understanding should be used to the extent necessary to avoid
conflict.<p><h2> Article 2 </h2><h2> Administration </h2> 1.    The <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000515300006"></a><a href="29a.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000620100240"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Dispute
Settlement Body is hereby established to administer these rules and
procedures and, except as otherwise provided in a covered agreement, the
consultation and dispute settlement provisions of the covered agreements.
Accordingly, the DSB shall have the authority to establish panels, adopt
panel and Appellate Body reports, maintain surveillance of implementation of
rulings and recommendations, and authorize suspension of concessions and
other obligations under the covered agreements. With respect to disputes
arising under a covered agreement which is a Plurilateral Trade Agreement,
the term "Member" as used herein shall refer only to those Members that are
parties to the relevant <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000515300218"></a><a href="27.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000515300246"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Plurilateral Trade Agreement. Where the DSB
administers the dispute settlement provisions of a <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000515300246"></a><a href="27.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000516900076"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Plurilateral Trade
Agreement, only those Members that are parties to that Agreement may
participate in decisions or actions taken by the DSB with respect to that
dispute.<p> 2.    The DSB shall inform the relevant <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000515400016"></a><a href="w.htm#_ICONOVEX_WTOCOUNCILS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>WTO Councils and

respective covered agreements. <p>3.    The DSB shall meet as often as
necessary to carry out its functions within the time-frames provided in this
Understanding.<p>
4.    Where the rules and procedures of this Understanding provide for the
DSB to take a decision, it shall do so by consensus.  The DSB shall be deemed
to have decided by consensus on a matter submitted for its consideration, if
no Member, present at the meeting of the DSB when the decision is taken,
formally objects to the proposed decision.
<p><h2>
Article 3 </h2><h2>
General Provisions  </h2>
1.    Members affirm their adherence to the principles for the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000516100022"></a><a href="m.htm#_ICONOVEX_MANAGEMENTOFDISPUTES"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>management of
disputes heretofore applied under <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000516100035"></a><a href="index.htm#_ICONOVEX_ARTICLESXXII"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Articles XXII and <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000516100042"></a><a href="x.htm#_ICONOVEX_XXIIIOFGATT1947"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>XXIII of GATT 1947, and
the rules and procedures as further elaborated and modified herein.<p>2.
The dispute settlement system of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000516200015"></a><a href="27.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000516300083"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>WTO is a central element in providing
security and predictability to the multilateral trading system. The Members
recognize that it serves to preserve the rights and obligations of Members
under the covered agreements, and to clarify the existing provisions of those agreements in accordance with
customary rules of interpretation of public international law.
Recommendations and rulings of the DSB cannot add to or diminish the rights
and obligations provided in the covered agreements.<p>3.    The prompt
settlement of situations in which a Member considers that any benefits
accruing to it directly or indirectly under the covered agreements are being
impaired by measures taken by another Member is essential to the effective
functioning of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000516300083"></a><a href="27.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000530100097"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>WTO and the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000516300090"></a><a href="m.htm#_ICONOVEX_MAINTENANCEOFPROPERBALANCE"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>maintenance of a proper balance between the
rights and obligations of Members. <p>4.    Recommendations or rulings made
by the DSB shall be aimed at achieving a satisfactory settlement of the
matter in accordance with the  rights and obligations under this
Understanding and under the covered agreements. <p>5.    All solutions to
matters formally raised under  the consultation and dispute settlement
provisions of the covered agreements, including arbitration awards, shall be
consistent with those agreements and shall not nullify or impair benefits
accruing to any Member under those agreements, nor impede the attainment of
any objective of those agreements. <p>6.    Mutually agreed solutions to
matters formally raised under the consultation and dispute settlement
provisions of the covered agreements shall be notified to the DSB and the
relevant Councils and Committees, where any Member may raise any point
relating thereto.<p>7.    Before bringing a case, a Member shall exercise its
judgement as to whether action under these procedures would be fruitful. The
aim of the  dispute settlement mechanism is to secure a positive solution to
a dispute. A solution mutually acceptable to the parties to a dispute and
consistent with the covered agreements is clearly to be preferred. In the
absence of a mutually agreed solution, the first objective of the dispute
settlement mechanism is usually to secure the withdrawal of the measures
concerned if these are found to be inconsistent with the provisions of any of
the covered agreements. The provision of compensation should be resorted to
only if the immediate withdrawal of the measure is impracticable and as a
temporary measure pending the withdrawal of the measure which is
inconsistent with a covered agreement. The last resort which this
Understanding provides to the Member invoking the dispute settlement
procedures is the possibility of suspending the application of concessions
or other obligations under the covered agreements on a <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000516700346"></a><a href="d.htm#_ICONOVEX_DISCRIMINATORYBASIS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>discriminatory basis
vis-a-vis the other Member, subject to authorization by the DSB of such
measures. <p>8.    In cases where there is an <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000516800015"></a><a href="i.htm#_ICONOVEX_INFRINGEMENTOFOBLIGATIONS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>infringement of the obligations
assumed under a covered agreement, the action is considered
<i>prima&#160;facie</i> to constitute a case of nullification or impairment.
This means that there is normally a presumption that a breach of the rules
has an adverse impact on other Members parties to that covered agreement, and
in such cases, it shall be up to the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000516800140"></a><a href="m.htm#_ICONOVEX_MEMBERCOMPLAINT"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Member against whom the complaint has
been brought to rebut the charge.<p>9.    The provisions of this
Understanding are without prejudice to the rights of Members to seek
authoritative interpretation of provisions of a covered agreement through
decision-making under the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000516900057"></a><a href="27.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000517100069"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>WTO Agreement or a covered agreement which is a
<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000516900076"></a><a href="p.htm#_ICONOVEX_PLURILATERALTRADEAGREEMENT"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Plurilateral Trade Agreement.<p>10.    It is understood that requests for
conciliation and the use of the dispute settlement procedures should not be
intended or considered as contentious acts and that, if a dispute arises,
all Members will engage in these procedures in good faith in an effort to
resolve the dispute. It is also understood that complaints and counter-com
plaints in regard to distinct matters should not be linked. <p>11.    This
Understanding shall be applied only with respect to new requests for
consultations under the consultation provisions of the covered agreements
made on or after the date of entry into force of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000517100069"></a><a href="27.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000517100144"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>WTO Agreement. With
respect to disputes for which the request for consultations was made under
<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000517100101"></a><a href="27.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000521800078"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>GATT 1947 or under any other predecessor agreement to the covered agreements
before the date of entry into force of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000517100144"></a><a href="27.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000517100190"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>WTO Agreement, the relevant
dispute settlement rules and procedures in effect immediately prior to the
date of entry into force of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000517100190"></a><a href="27.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000522100182"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>WTO Agreement shall continue to apply.  This
paragraph shall also be applied to disputes on which panel reports have not
been adopted or fully implemented.  <p> 12.    Notwithstanding paragraph 11,
if a complaint based on any of the covered agreements is brought by a
developing country Member against a developed country Member, the
complaining party shall have the right to invoke, as an alternative to the
provisions contained in Articles&#160;4, 5, 6 and 12 of this Understanding,
the corresponding provisions of the Decision of 5 April&#160;1966 (BISD
14S/18), except that where the Panel considers that the time-frame provided
for in paragraph 7 of that Decision is insufficient to provide its report and
with the agreement of the complaining party, that time-frame may be extended.
To the extent that there is a difference between the rules and procedures of
Articles&#160;4, 5,&#160;6 and&#160;12  and the corresponding rules and
procedures of the Decision, the latter shall prevail.<p><h2> Article 4
</h2><h2> Consultations </h2> 1.    Members affirm their resolve to
strengthen and improve the effectiveness of the consultation  procedures
employed by Members.<p>
2.    Each Member undertakes to accord sympathetic consideration to and
afford adequate opportunity for consultation regarding any representations
made by another Member concerning measures affecting the operation of any
covered agreement taken within the territory of the former.  Where the
provisions of any other covered agreement concerning measures taken by
regional or local governments or authorities within the territory of a Member
contain provisions different from the provisions of this paragraph, the
provisions of such other covered agreement shall prevail.  <p>3.    If a
request for consultations is made pursuant to a covered agreement, the Member
to which the request is made shall, unless otherwise mutually agreed, reply
to the request within 10 days after the date of its receipt and shall enter
into consultations in good faith within a period of no more than 30 days
after the date of receipt of the request, with a view to reaching a mutually
satisfactory solution. If the Member does not respond within 10 days after
the date of receipt of the request, or does not enter into consultations
within a period of no more than 30 days, or a period otherwise mutually
agreed, after the date of receipt of the request, then the Member that
requested the holding of consultations may proceed directly to request the
establishment of a panel.<p>4.    All such requests for consultations shall
be notified to the DSB and the relevant Councils and Committees by the Member
which requests consultations. Any request for consultations shall be
submitted in writing and shall give the reasons for the request, including
<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000518000087"></a><a href="i.htm#_ICONOVEX_IDENTIFICATIONOFMEASURES"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>identification of the measures at issue and an indication of the legal basis
for the complaint.<p>5.    In the course of consultations in accordance with
the provisions of a covered agreement, before resorting to further action
under this Understanding, Members should attempt to obtain satisfactory
adjustment of the matter.<p>6.    Consultations shall be confidential, and
without prejudice to the rights of any Member in any further
proceedings.<p>7.    If the consultations fail to settle a dispute within 60
days after the date of receipt of the request for consultations, the
complaining party may request the establishment of a panel. The complaining
party may request a panel during the 60-day period if the consulting parties
jointly consider that consultations have failed to settle the dispute. <p>8.
In cases of urgency, including those which concern perishable goods, Members
shall enter into consultations within a period of no more than 10 days after
the date of receipt of the request. If the consultations have failed to
settle the dispute within a period of 20 days after the date of receipt of
the request, the complaining party may request the establishment of a panel.
<p>9.    In cases of urgency, including those which concern perishable goods,
the parties to the dispute, panels and the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000518500042"></a><a href="27.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000529900008"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Appellate Body shall make every
effort to accelerate the proceedings to the greatest extent possible.<p>10.
During consultations Members should give special attention to the particular
problems and interests of developing country Members. <p> 11.    Whenever a

Good Offices, Conciliation and Mediation </h2>
1.     Good offices, conciliation and mediation are procedures that are
undertaken voluntarily if the parties to the dispute so agree.<p>2.
Proceedings involving good offices, conciliation and mediation, and in
particular positions taken by the parties to the dispute during these
proceedings, shall be confidential, and without prejudice to the rights of
either party in any further proceedings under these procedures.<p> 3.
Good offices, conciliation or mediation may be requested at any time by any
party to a dispute. They may begin at any time and be terminated at any time.
Once procedures for good offices, conciliation or mediation are terminated, a
complaining party may then proceed with a request for the establishment of a
panel.<p>4.     When good offices, conciliation or mediation are entered into
within 60 days after the date of receipt of a request for consultations, the
complaining party must allow a period of 60 days after the date of receipt of
the request for consultations before requesting the establishment of a panel.
The complaining party may request the establishment of a panel during the
60-day period if the parties to the dispute jointly consider that the good
offices, conciliation or <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000519700163"></a><a href="m.htm#_ICONOVEX_MEDIATIONPROCESS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>mediation process has failed to settle the dispute.

6.     The Director-General may, acting in an <i>ex&#160;officio</i>
capacity, offer good offices, conciliation or mediation with the view to
assisting Members to settle a dispute. <p><h2> Article 6 </h2><h2>
Establishment of Panels </h2>
1.     If the complaining party so requests, a panel shall be established at
the latest at the DSB meeting following that at which the request first
appears as an item on the DSB's agenda, unless at that meeting the DSB
decides by consensus not to establish a panel.  If the complaining party so
requests, a meeting of the DSB shall be convened for this purpose within 15
days of the request, provided that at least 10 days' advance notice of the
meeting is given.

<p>
2.     The request for the establishment of a panel shall be made in
writing. It shall indicate whether consultations were held, identify the
specific measures at issue and provide a brief summary of the legal basis of
the complaint sufficient to present the problem clearly. In case the
applicant requests the establishment of a panel with other than standard
terms of reference, the written request shall include the proposed text of
special terms of reference.<p><h2> Article 7 </h2><h2> Terms of Reference of
Panels </h2> 1.     Panels shall have the following terms of reference unless
the parties to the dispute agree otherwise within 20 days from the
establishment of the panel:<p> "To examine, in the light of the relevant
    provisions in (name of the covered agreement(s) cited by the parties to
the dispute), the matter referred to the DSB by (name of party) in document

terms of reference of the panel in consultation with the parties to the
dispute, subject to the provisions of paragraph&#160;1. The terms of
reference thus drawn up shall be circulated to all Members. If other than
standard terms of reference are agreed upon, any Member may raise any point
relating thereto in the DSB. <p><h2> Article 8 </h2><h2> Composition of
Panels </h2> 1.     Panels shall be composed of well-qualified governmental

common markets are parties to a dispute, this provision applies to citizens
of all member countries of the customs unions or common markets.  are parties
 to the dispute or third parties as defined in paragraph&#160;2 of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000522000103"></a><a href="27.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000530200071"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Article 10

the dispute agree otherwise.<p>4.     To assist in the selection of
panelists, the Secretariat shall maintain an indicative list of governmental
and non-governmental individuals possessing the qualifications outlined in
paragraph 1, from which panelists may be drawn as appropriate. That list
shall  include the roster of non-governmental panelists established on 30
November 1984 (BISD 31S/9), and other rosters and indicative lists
established under any of the covered agreements, and shall retain the names
of persons on those rosters and indicative lists at the time of entry into

governmental and non-governmental individuals for inclusion on the indicative
list, providing relevant information on their knowledge of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000522100235"></a><a href="29a.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000622700073"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>international

either party, the Director-General, in consultation with the Chairman of the
DSB and the Chairman of the relevant Council or Committee, shall determine
the composition of the panel by appointing the panelists whom the
Director-General considers most appropriate in accordance with any relevant
special or additional rules or procedures of the covered agreement or covered
agreements which are at issue in the dispute, after consulting with the
parties to the dispute. The <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000522400201"></a><a href="27.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000530800033"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Chairman of the DSB shall inform the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000522400216"></a><a href="m.htm#_ICONOVEX_MEMBERSOFCOMPOSITIONOFPANEL"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Members of

general rule, to permit their officials to serve as panelists.<p>9.
Panelists shall serve in their individual capacities and not as government
representatives, nor as representatives of any organization. Members shall

shall, if the developing country Member so requests, include at least one
panelist from a developing country Member.<p> 11.    Panelists'  expenses,
including travel and subsistence allowance, shall be met from the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000522800031"></a><a href="27.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000530600044"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>WTO budget

recommendations of the Committee on Budget, Finance and
Administration.<p><h2> Article 9 </h2><h2> Procedures for Multiple
Complainants </h2> 1.     Where more than one Member requests the
establishment of a panel related to the same matter, a single panel may be
established to examine these complaints taking into account the rights of all
Members concerned. A single panel should be established to examine such
complaints whenever feasible.<p> 2.     The single panel shall organize its
examination and present its findings to the DSB in such a manner that the
rights which the parties to the dispute would have enjoyed had separate
panels examined the complaints are in no way impaired. If one of the parties
to the dispute so requests, the panel shall submit separate reports on the
dispute concerned. The written submissions by each of the complainants shall
be made available to the other complainants, and each complainant shall have
the right to be present when any one of the other complainants presents its
views to the panel. <p>3.     If more than one panel is established to
examine the complaints related to the same matter, to the greatest extent
possible the same persons shall serve as panelists on each of the separate
panels and the timetable for the panel process in such disputes shall be
harmonized.<p><h2> Article 10 </h2><h2> Third Parties </h2> 1.    The
interests of the parties to a dispute and those of other Members under a
covered agreement at issue in the dispute shall be fully taken into account
during the panel process.<p> 2.     Any Member having a substantial interest
in a matter before a panel and having notified its interest to the DSB
(referred to in this Understanding as a "third party") shall have an
opportunity to be heard by the panel and to make written submissions to the
panel. These submissions shall also be given to the parties to the dispute
and shall be reflected in the panel report. <p> 3.    Third parties shall
receive the submissions of the parties to the dispute to the first meeting of
the panel. <p> 4.    If a third party considers that a measure already the
subject of a panel proceeding nullifies or impairs benefits accruing to it
under any covered agreement, that Member may have recourse to normal dispute
settlement procedures under this Understanding. Such a dispute shall be
referred to the original panel wherever possible.<p><h2> Article 11 </h2><h2>
Function of Panels </h2>
    The function of panels is to assist the DSB in discharging its
responsibilities under this Understanding and the covered agreements.
Accordingly, a panel should make an objective assessment of the matter before
it, including an objective assessment of the facts of the case and the
applicability of and conformity with the relevant covered agreements, and
make such other findings as will assist the DSB in making the recommendations
or in giving the rulings provided for in the covered agreements. Panels
should consult regularly with the parties to the dispute and give them
adequate opportunity to develop a mutually satisfactory solution. <p><h2>
Article 12 </h2><h2>
Panel Procedures </h2>
1.    Panels shall follow the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000525300012"></a><a href="w.htm#_ICONOVEX_WORKINGPROCEDURES"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Working Procedures in <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000525300019"></a><a href="index.htm#_ICONOVEX_APPENDIX3"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Appendix 3 unless the
panel decides otherwise after consulting the parties to the dispute. <p> 2.
Panel procedures should provide sufficient flexibility so as to ensure
high-quality panel reports, while not unduly delaying the panel process. <p>
3.    After consulting the parties to the dispute, the panelists shall, as
soon as practicable and whenever possible within one week after the
composition and terms of reference of the panel have been agreed upon, fix
the timetable for the panel process, taking into account the provisions of
paragraph 9 of Article&#160;4, if relevant.<p>4.    In determining the
timetable for the panel process, the panel shall provide sufficient time for
the parties to the dispute to prepare their submissions. <p>5.    Panels
should set precise deadlines for written submissions by the parties and the
parties should respect those deadlines.<p>6.    Each party to the dispute
shall deposit its written submissions with the Secretariat for immediate
transmission to the panel and to the other party or parties to the dispute.
The complaining party shall submit its first submission in advance of the
responding party's first submission unless the panel decides, in fixing the
timetable referred to in paragraph 3 and after consultations with the parties
to the dispute, that the parties should submit their first submissions
simultaneously. When there are sequential arrangements for the deposit of
first submissions, the panel shall establish a firm time period for receipt
of the responding party's submission. Any subsequent written submissions
shall be submitted simultaneously. <p>7.    Where the parties to the dispute
have failed to develop a mutually satisfactory solution, the panel shall
submit its findings in the form of a written report to the DSB. In such
cases, the report of a panel shall set out the findings of fact, the
applicability of relevant provisions and the basic rationale behind any
findings and recommendations that it makes. Where a settlement of the matter
among the parties to the dispute has been found, the report of the panel
shall be confined to a brief description of the case and to reporting that a
solution has been reached. <p>8.    In order to make the procedures more
efficient, the period in which the panel shall conduct its examination, from
the date that the composition and terms of reference of the panel have been
agreed upon until the date the final report is issued to the parties to the
dispute, shall, as a general rule, not exceed six months. In cases of
urgency, including those relating to perishable goods, the panel shall aim
to issue its report to the parties to the dispute within three months. <p>9.
When the panel considers that it cannot issue its report within six months,
or within three months in cases of urgency, it shall inform the DSB in
writing of the reasons for the delay together with an estimate of the period
within which it will issue its report. In no case should the period from the
establishment of the panel to the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000526100130"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CIRCULATIONOFREPORT"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>circulation of the report to the Members
exceed nine months.<p>10.    In the context of consultations involving a
measure taken by a developing country Member, the parties may agree to extend
the periods established in paragraphs&#160;7 and 8 of Article 4. If, after
the relevant period has elapsed, the consulting parties cannot agree that the
consultations have concluded, the Chairman of the DSB shall decide, after
consultation with the parties, whether to extend the relevant period and, if
so, for how long. In addition, in examining a complaint against a developing
country Member, the panel shall accord sufficient time for the developing
country Member to prepare and present its argumentation. The provisions of
paragraph 1 of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000526200228"></a><a href="27.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000526400099"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Article 20 and paragraph 4 of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000526200241"></a><a href="27.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000526400113"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Article 21 are not affected by
any action pursuant to this paragraph. <p>11.    Where one or more of the
parties is a developing country Member, the panel's report shall explicitly
indicate the form in which account has been taken of relevant provisions on
differential and more-favorable treatment for developing country Members
that form part of the covered agreements which have been raised by the
developing country Member in the course of the dispute settlement
procedures.<p> 12.    The panel may suspend its work at any time at the
request of the complaining party for a period not to exceed 12 months. In the
event of such a suspension, the time-frames set out in paragraphs 8 and 9 of
this Article, paragraph 1 of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000526400099"></a><a href="29a.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000621300193"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Article 20, and paragraph 4 of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000526400113"></a><a href="27.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000535200084"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Article 21 shall
be extended by the amount of time that the work was suspended. If the work of
the panel has been suspended for more than 12 months, the authority for
establishment of the panel shall lapse.<p><h2> Article 13 </h2><h2> Right to
Seek Information </h2> 1.    Each panel shall have the right to seek
information and technical advice from any individual or body which it deems
appropriate. However, before a panel seeks such information or advice from
any individual or body within the jurisdiction of a Member it shall inform
the authorities of that Member. A Member should respond promptly and fully to
any request by a panel for such information as the panel considers necessary
and appropriate. Confidential information which is provided shall not be
revealed without formal authorization from the individual, body, or
authorities of the Member  providing the information. <p>
2.    Panels may seek information from any relevant source and may consult
experts to obtain their opinion on certain aspects of the matter. With
respect to a factual issue concerning a scientific or other <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000527000071"></a><a href="t.htm#_ICONOVEX_TECHNICALMATTER"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>technical matter
raised by a party to a dispute, a panel may request an advisory report in
writing from an expert review group. Rules for the establishment of such a
group and its procedures are set forth in Appendix 4.<p><h2> Article 14
</h2><h2> Confidentiality </h2> 1.    Panel deliberations shall be
confidential.<p> 2.    The reports of panels shall be drafted without the
presence of the parties to the dispute in the light of the information
provided and the statements made.<p> 3.    Opinions expressed in the panel
report by individual panelists shall be anonymous.<p><h2> Article 15
</h2><h2> Interim Review Stage </h2> 1.    Following the consideration of
rebuttal submissions and oral arguments, the panel shall issue the
descriptive (factual and argument) sections of its draft report to the
parties to the dispute. Within a period of time set by the panel, the parties
shall submit their comments in writing. <p> 2.    Following the expiration of
the set period of time for receipt of comments from the parties to the
dispute, the panel shall issue an interim report to the parties, including
both the descriptive sections and the panel's findings and conclusions.
Within a period of time set by the panel, a party may submit a written
request for the panel to review precise aspects of the interim report prior
to <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000528300146"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CIRCULATIONOFFINALREPORT"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>circulation of the final report to the Members. At the request of a
party, the panel shall hold a further meeting with the parties on the issues
identified in the written comments. If no comments are received from any
party within the comment period, the interim report shall be considered the
final panel report and circulated promptly to the Members. <p> 3.    The
findings of the final panel report shall include a discussion of the
arguments made at the interim review stage. The interim review stage shall be
conducted within the time period set out in paragraph&#160;8 of
Article&#160;12.<p><h2> Article 16 </h2><h2> Adoption of Panel Reports </h2>
1.    In order to provide sufficient time for the Members to consider panel
reports, the reports shall not be considered for <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000528900045"></a><a href="27.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000529200230"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>adoption by the DSB until 20

Members, the report shall be adopted at a DSB meeting If a meeting of the DSB
is not scheduled within this period at a time that enables the requirements
of paragraphs 1 and&#160;4 of Article 16 to be met, a meeting of the DSB
shall be held for this purpose.  unless a party to the dispute formally

individual or a group.  appointed by the Director-General and shall be
 completed within 60 days after the date of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000537100311"></a><a href="e.htm#_ICONOVEX_EXPIRYOFREASONABLEPERIODOFTIME"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>expiry of the reasonable period
of time. Concessions or other obligations shall not be suspended during the
course of the arbitration.<p>7.    The arbitrator The expression "arbitrator"
shall be interpreted as referring either to an individual or a group or to
the members of the original panel when serving in the capacity of arbitrator.
acting pursuant to paragraph 6 shall not examine the nature of the
concessions or other obligations to be suspended but shall determine whether
the level of such suspension is equivalent to the level of nullification or
impairment. The arbitrator may also determine if the proposed suspension of
concessions or other obligations is allowed under the covered agreement.
However, if the matter referred to arbitration includes a claim that the
principles and procedures set forth in paragraph 3 have not been followed,
the arbitrator shall examine that claim. In the event the arbitrator
determines that those principles and procedures have not been followed, the
complaining party shall apply them consistent with paragraph 3. The parties
shall accept the arbitrator's decision as final and the parties concerned
shall not seek a second arbitration. The DSB shall be informed promptly of
the decision of the arbitrator and shall upon request, grant authorization to
suspend concessions or other obligations where the request is consistent with
the decision of the arbitrator, unless the DSB decides by consensus to reject
the request.<p>8.    The <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000537300005"></a><a href="27.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000538300032"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>suspension of concessions or other obligations shall be temporary and shall only be applied until such
time as the measure found to be inconsistent with a covered agreement has
been removed, or the Member that must implement recommendations or rulings
provides a solution to the nullification or impairment of benefits, or a
mutually satisfactory solution is reached. In accordance with
paragraph&#160;6 of Article 21, the DSB shall continue to keep under
surveillance the implementation of adopted recommendations or rulings,
including those cases where compensation has been provided or concessions or
other obligations have been suspended but the recommendations to bring a
measure into conformity with the covered agreements have not been
implemented.<p> 9.    The dispute settlement provisions of the covered
agreements may be invoked in respect of measures affecting their observance
taken by regional or local governments or authorities within the territory of
a Member.  When the DSB has ruled that a provision of a covered agreement has
not been observed, the responsible Member shall take such reasonable measures
as may be available to it to ensure its observance. The provisions of the
covered agreements and this Understanding relating to compensation and
suspension of concessions or other obligations apply in cases where it has
not been possible to secure such observance.  Where the provisions of any
covered agreement concerning measures taken by regional or local governments
or authorities within the territory of a Member contain provisions different
from the provisions of this paragraph, the provisions of such covered
agreement shall prevail.  <p><h2> Article 23 </h2><h2> Strengthening of the
Multilateral System </h2> 1.    When Members seek the redress of a violation

procedures of this Understanding.<p> 2.    In such cases, Members shall:<p>
(a)     not make a determination to the effect that a violation has occurred, that benefits have been nullified

agreements has been impeded, except through recourse to dispute settlement

Special Procedures Involving Least-Developed Country Members </h2>
1.    At all stages of the determination of the causes of a dispute and of
dispute settlement procedures involving a least-developed country Member,
particular consideration shall be given to the special situation of
least-developed country Members. In this regard, Members shall exercise due
restraint in raising matters under these procedures involving a
least-developed country Member. If nullification or impairment is found to
result from a measure taken by a least-developed country Member, complaining
parties shall exercise due restraint in asking for compensation or seeking
authorization to suspend the application of concessions or other obligations
pursuant to these procedures. <p> 2.     In dispute settlement cases

purpose. All such third parties may be present during the entirety of this
session.<p>7.    Formal rebuttals shall be made at a second substantive
meeting of the panel. The party complained against shall have the right to
take the floor first to be followed by the complaining party. The parties
shall submit, prior to that meeting, written rebuttals to the panel. <p>8.
The panel may at any time put questions to the parties and ask them for
explanations either in the course of a meeting with the parties or in
writing.<p>9.    The parties to the dispute and any third party invited to
present its views in accordance with <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000545800037"></a><a href="index.htm#_ICONOVEX_ARTICLE10"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Article 10 shall make available to the

EXPERT REVIEW GROUPS </h3>


    The following rules and procedures shall apply to expert review groups
established in accordance with the provisions of paragraph 2 of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000547800045"></a><a href="index.htm#_ICONOVEX_ARTICLE13"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Article
13.<p> 1.    Expert review groups are under the panel's authority. Their
terms of reference and detailed working procedures shall be decided by the
panel, and they shall report to the panel.<p> 2.    Participation in expert
review groups shall be restricted to persons of professional standing and
experience in the field in question.<p>3.    Citizens of parties to the
dispute shall not serve on an expert review group without the joint agreement
of the parties to the dispute, except in exceptional circumstances when the
panel considers that the need for specialized scientific expertise cannot be
fulfilled otherwise. Government officials of parties to the dispute shall not
serve on an expert review group.  Members of expert review groups shall serve
in their individual capacities and not as government representatives, nor as
representatives of any organization.  Governments or organizations shall
therefore not give them instructions with regard to matters before an expert
review group.<p>4.    Expert review groups may consult and seek information
and <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000548200021"></a><a href="t.htm#_ICONOVEX_TECHNICALADVICE"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>technical advice from any source they deem appropriate. Before an expert
review group seeks such information or advice from a source within the
jurisdiction of a Member, it shall inform the government of that Member. Any
Member shall respond promptly and fully to any request by an expert review
group for such information as the expert review group considers necessary and
appropriate.<p>5.    The parties to a dispute shall have access to all
relevant information provided to an expert review group, unless it is of a
confidential nature. Confidential information provided to the expert review
group shall not be released without formal authorization from the government,
organization or person providing the information. Where such information is
requested from the expert review group but release of such information by the
expert review group is not authorized, a non-confidential summary of the
information will be provided by the government, organization or person
supplying the information.<p>6.    The expert review group shall submit a
draft report to the parties to the dispute with a view to obtaining their
comments, and taking them into account, as appropriate, in the final report,
which shall also be issued to the parties to the dispute when it is submitted
to the panel. The final report of the expert review group shall be advisory
only.<p>

Nothing in this Understanding is intended to modify the rights and

<i>agree</i> as follows:<p> <i>Application of Measures</i><p> 1.    Members
confirm their commitment to announce publicly, as soon as possible,
time-schedules for the removal of restrictive <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000028100040"></a><a href="08.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000028400011"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>import measures taken for
balance-of-payments purposes. It is understood that such time-schedules may
be modified as appropriate to take into account changes in the
balance-of-payments situation. Whenever a time-schedule is not publicly
announced by a Member, that Member shall provide justification as to the
reasons therefor.<p>2.    Members confirm their commitment to give preference
to those measures which have the least disruptive effect on trade. Such
measures (referred to in this Understanding as "price-based measures") shall
be understood to include <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000028200074"></a><a href="i.htm#_ICONOVEX_IMPORTSURCHARGES"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>import surcharges, <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000028200080"></a><a href="i.htm#_ICONOVEX_IMPORTDEPOSITREQUIREMENTS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>import deposit requirements or
other equivalent <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000028200093"></a><a href="29b.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000640200181"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>trade measures with an impact on the price of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000028200112"></a><a href="19.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000253000165"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>imported
goods. It is understood that, notwithstanding the provisions of
Article-II, price-based measures taken for balance-of-payments purposes
may be applied by a Member in excess of the duties inscribed in the Schedule
of that Member. Furthermore, that Member shall indicate the amount by which
the price-based measure exceeds the bound duty clearly and separately under
the notification procedures of this Understanding. <p>3.    Members shall
seek to avoid the imposition of new quantitative restrictions for
balance-of-payments purposes unless, because of a critical
balance-of-payments situation, price-based measures cannot arrest a sharp
deterioration in the external payments position. In those cases in which a
Member applies quantitative restrictions, it shall provide justification as
to the reasons why price-based measures are not an adequate instrument to
deal with the balance-of-payments situation. A Member maintaining
quantitative restrictions shall indicate in successive consultations the
progress made in significantly reducing the incidence and restrictive effect
of such measures. It is understood that not more than one type of restrictive
import measure taken for balance-of-payments purposes may be applied on the
same product.<p>4.    Members confirm that restrictive <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000028400011"></a><a href="08.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000028600054"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>import measures taken
for balance-of-payments purposes may only be applied to control the general
level of imports and may not exceed what is necessary to address the
balance-of-payments situation. In order to minimize any incidental
protective effects, a Member shall administer restrictions in a transparent
manner. The authorities of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000028400115"></a><a href="14.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000081500092"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>importing Member shall provide adequate
justification as to the criteria used to determine which products are subject
to restriction. As provided in paragraph&#160;3 of Article&#160;XII and paragraph&#160;10 of Article&#160;XVIII, Members may, in the case of certain essential products,
exclude or limit the application of surcharges applied across the board or
other measures applied for balance-of-payments purposes. The term "essential
products" shall be understood to mean products which meet basic <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000028400269"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CONSUMPTIONNEEDS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>consumption

production. In the administration of quantitative restrictions, a Member
shall use discretionary licensing only when unavoidable and shall phase it
out progressively. Appropriate justification shall be provided as to the
criteria used to determine allowable import quantities or values.<p>
<i>Procedures for Balance-of-Payments Consultations</i><p>5.    The
Committee on <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000028600009"></a><a href="25.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000418300035"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Balance-of-Payments Restrictions (referred to in this

their wish to serve on it. The Committee shall follow the procedures for
consultations on balance-of-payments restrictions approved on
28&#160;April&#160;1970 (BISD 18S/48-53, referred to in this Understanding
as "full consultation procedures"), subject to the provisions set out
below.<p> 6.    A Member applying new restrictions or raising the general
level of its existing restrictions by a substantial intensification of the
measures shall enter into consultations with the Committee within four months
of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000028700070"></a><a href="index.htm#_ICONOVEX_ADOPTIONOFMEASURES"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>adoption of such measures. The Member adopting such measures may
request that a consultation be held under paragraph 4(a) of Article&#160;XII
or paragraph 12(a) of Article&#160;XVIII as appropriate. If no such request
has been made, the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000028700156"></a><a href="08.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000029200173"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Chairman of the Committee shall invite the Member to hold
such a consultation. Factors that may be examined in the consultation would
include, <i>inter-alia</i>, the introduction of new types of restrictive measures for balance-of-payments purposes, or an
increase in the level or product coverage of restrictions.<p>7.    All
restrictions applied for balance-of-payments purposes shall be subject to
periodic review in the Committee under paragraph 4(b) of Article&#160;XII or
under paragraph&#160;12(b) of Article&#160;XVIII, subject to the possibility
of altering the periodicity of consultations in agreement with the consulting
Member or pursuant to any specific review procedure that may be recommended
by the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000028800124"></a><a href="08.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000029100016"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>General Council.<p>8.    Consultations may be held under the
simplified procedures approved on 19&#160;December&#160;1972 (BISD 20S/47-49, referred
to in this Understanding as "simplified consultation procedures") in the case
of least-developed country Members or in the case of developing country
Members which are pursuing liberalization efforts in conformity with the
schedule presented to the Committee in previous consultations. Simplified
consultation procedures may also be used when the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000028900141"></a><a href="t.htm#_ICONOVEX_TRADEPOLICYREVIEWOFDEVELOPINGCOUNTRYMEMBER"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Trade Policy Review of a
developing country Member is scheduled for the same calendar year as the date
fixed for the consultations. In such cases the decision as to whether full
consultation procedures should be used will be made on the basis of the
factors enumerated in paragraph&#160;8 of the 1979&#160;Declaration. Except
in the case of least-developed country Members, no more than two successive
consultations may be held under simplified consultation procedures.<p>
<i>Notification and Documentation</i><p>
9.    A Member shall notify to the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000029100016"></a><a href="08.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000029100108"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>General Council the introduction of or any changes in the application of restrictive

Such reviews would be limited to the clarification of specific issues raised
by a notification or examination of whether a consultation under paragraph
4(a) of Article&#160;XII or paragraph 12(a) of Article&#160;XVIII is
required. Members which have reasons to believe that a restrictive <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000029200127"></a><a href="i.htm#_ICONOVEX_IMPORTMEASURE"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>import

<h1>
AGREEMENT ON SUBSIDIES AND COUNTERVAILING MEASURES </h1>


<p>


<i>Members</i> hereby <i>agree</i> as follows:<p>

<h2>
PART I: GENERAL PROVISIONS </h2>

<h3>
Article 1 </h3>

<h3>
Definition of a Subsidy </h3>


1.1    For the purpose of this Agreement, a subsidy shall be deemed to exist
if:<p> (a)(1)    there is a financial contribution by a government or any
public body within the territory of a Member (referred to in this Agreement
as "government"), i.e. where:<p> (i)    a <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000336000007"></a><a href="g.htm#_ICONOVEX_GOVERNMENTPRACTICE"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>government practice involves a
direct transfer of funds (e.g. grants, loans,  and equity infusion),
potential direct transfers of funds or liabilities (e.g. loan guarantees);<p>
(ii)    <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000336100005"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000373400054"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>government revenue that is otherwise due is foregone or not
collected (e.g. fiscal incentives such as tax credits) In accordance with the
provisions of Article&#160;XVI of GATT&#160;1994 (Note to Article&#160;XVI)
and the provisions of Annexes&#160;I through&#160;III of this Agreement, the
exemption of an exported product from duties or taxes borne by the like
product when destined for domestic consumption, or the remission of such
duties or taxes in amounts not in excess of those which have accrued, shall
not be deemed to be a subsidy.  ;<p> (iii)    a government provides goods or
services other than general infrastructure, or purchases goods;<p> (iv)    a
government makes payments to a funding mechanism, or entrusts or directs a
private body to carry out one or more of the type of functions illustrated in
(i) to (iii) above which would normally be vested in the government and the
practice, in no real sense, differs from practices normally followed by
governments;<p> or<p> (a)(2)    there is any form of income or price support
in the sense of Article&#160;XVI of GATT&#160;1994;<p> and<p> (b)    a
benefit is thereby conferred.<p> 1.2    A subsidy as defined in
paragraph&#160;1 shall be subject to the provisions of Part&#160;II or shall
be subject to the provisions of Part&#160;III or&#160;V only if such a
subsidy is specific in accordance with the provisions of Article&#160;2.<p>

<h3>
Article 2 </h3>

<h3>
Specificity </h3>


2.1    In order to determine whether a subsidy, as defined in
paragraph&#160;1 of Article&#160;1, is specific to an enterprise or industry
or group of enterprises or industries (referred to in this Agreement as
"certain enterprises") within the jurisdiction of the granting authority, the
following principles shall apply:<p> (a)    Where the granting authority, or
the legislation pursuant to which the granting authority operates, explicitly
limits access to a subsidy to certain enterprises, such subsidy shall be
specific.<p>
(b)    Where the granting authority, or the legislation pursuant to which
the granting authority operates, establishes objective criteria or conditions
Objective criteria or conditions, as used herein, mean criteria or
conditions which are neutral, which do not favor certain enterprises over
others, and which are economic in nature and horizontal in application, such
as number of employees or size of enterprise.  Governing the eligibility for,
and the amount of, a subsidy, specificity shall not exist, provided that the
eligibility is automatic and that such criteria and conditions are strictly
adhered to. The criteria or conditions must be clearly spelled out in law,
regulation, or other official document, so as to be capable of
verification.<p>
(c)    If, notwithstanding any appearance of non-specificity resulting from
the application of the principles laid down in subparagraphs&#160;(a) and (b),
there are reasons to believe that the subsidy may in fact be specific, other
factors may be considered. Such factors are: use of a subsidy program by a
limited number of certain enterprises, predominant use by certain
enterprises, the granting of disproportionately large amounts of subsidy to
certain enterprises, and the manner in which discretion has been exercised by
the granting authority in the decision to grant a subsidy. In this regard,
in particular, information on the frequency with which applications for a
subsidy are refused or approved and the reasons for such decisions shall  be
considered.  In applying this subparagraph, account shall be taken of the
extent of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000337600280"></a><a href="d.htm#_ICONOVEX_DIVERSIFICATIONOFECONOMICACTIVITIES"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>diversification of economic activities within the jurisdiction of
the granting authority, as well as of the length of time during which the
subsidy program has been in operation.<p>
2.2    A subsidy which is limited to certain enterprises located within a
designated <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000337700027"></a><a href="g.htm#_ICONOVEX_GEOGRAPHICALREGION"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>geographical region within the jurisdiction of the granting
authority shall be specific. It is understood that the setting or change of
generally applicable tax rates by all levels of government entitled to do so
shall not be deemed to be a specific subsidy for the purposes of this
Agreement. <p>2.3    Any subsidy falling under the provisions of
Article&#160;3 shall be deemed to be specific.<p> 2.4    Any determination of
specificity under the provisions of this Article shall be clearly
substantiated on the basis of positive evidence.<p>

<h2>
PART II: PROHIBITED SUBSIDIES </h2>

<h3>
Article 3 </h3>

<h3>
Prohibition </h3>


3.1    Except as provided in the Agreement on <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000338600019"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000350400029"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Agriculture, the following
subsidies, within the meaning of Article&#160;1, shall be prohibited:<p> (a)
subsidies contingent, in law or in fact This standard is met when the facts
demonstrate that the granting of a subsidy, without having been made legally
contingent upon export performance, is in fact tied to actual or anticipated
exportation or <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000338700088"></a><a href="e.htm#_ICONOVEX_EXPORTEARNINGS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>export earnings. The mere fact that a subsidy is granted to
enterprises which export shall not for that reason alone be considered to be
an export subsidy within the meaning of this provision.  , whether solely or
as one of several other conditions, upon export performance, including those
illustrated in Annex&#160;I Measures referred to in Annex&#160;I as not
constituting export subsidies shall not be prohibited under this or any other
provision of this Agreement.  ;<p> (b)    subsidies contingent, whether
solely or as one of several other conditions, upon the use of domestic over
imported goods.<p> 3.2    <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000338900003"></a><a href="24.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000391800005"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>A Member shall neither grant nor maintain subsidies
referred to in paragraph&#160;1.<p>

<h3>
Article 4 </h3>

<h3>
Remedies </h3>


4.1    Whenever a Member has reason to believe that a prohibited subsidy is
being granted or maintained by another Member, such Member may request
consultations with such other Member.    <p> 4.2    A request for
consultations under paragraph&#160;1 shall include a statement of available
evidence with regard to the existence and nature of the subsidy in
question.<p> 4.3    Upon request for consultations under paragraph&#160;1,
the Member believed to be granting or maintaining the subsidy in question
shall enter into such consultations as quickly as possible. The purpose of
the consultations shall be to clarify the facts of the situation and to
arrive at a mutually agreed solution.<p> 4.4    If no mutually agreed
solution has been reached within 30 days Any time periods mentioned in this
Article may be extended by <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000339700047"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000345000050"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>mutual agreement.  of the request for

Adverse Effects </h3>


    No Member should cause, through the use of any subsidy referred to in
paragraphs&#160;1 and&#160;2 of Article&#160;1, adverse effects to the interests of
other Members, i.e.:<p> (a)    injury to the domestic industry of another
Member The term "injury to the domestic industry" is used here in the same
sense as it is used in Part&#160;V.  ;<p> (b)    nullification or impairment of
benefits accruing directly or indirectly to other Members under
GATT&#160;1994 in particular the benefits of concessions bound under
Article&#160;II of GATT&#160;1994 The term "nullification or impairment" is
used in this Agreement in the same sense as it is used in the relevant
provisions of GATT&#160;1994, and the existence of such nullification or
impairment shall be established in accordance with the practice of
application of these provisions.  ;<p> (c)    serious prejudice to the
interests of another Member.  The term "serious prejudice to the interests of
another Member" is used in this Agreement in the same sense as it is used in
paragraph&#160;1 of Article&#160;XVI of GATT&#160;1994, and includes threat of serious

sufficient to demonstrate clear trends in the development of the market for
the product concerned, which, in normal circumstances, shall be at least one
year). "Change in relative shares of the market" shall include any of the

undercutting has been demonstrated through a comparison of prices of the
subsidized product with prices of a non-subsidized like product supplied to
the same market. The comparison shall be made at the same level of trade and
at comparable times, due account being taken of any other factor affecting
price comparability. However, if such a direct comparison is not possible,

such notification and the regular meeting of the Committee. The review
procedure described in this paragraph shall also apply, upon request, to
substantial modifications of a program notified in the yearly updates
referred to in paragraph&#160;3.<p>
8.5    Upon the request of a Member, the determination by the Committee
referred to in paragraph&#160;4, or a failure by the Committee to make such a
determination, as well as the violation, in individual cases, of the
conditions set out in a notified program, shall be submitted to binding
arbitration. The <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000348800112"></a><a href="index.htm#_ICONOVEX_ARBITRATIONBODY"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>arbitration body shall present its conclusions to the

Consultations and Authorized Remedies </h3>


9.1    If, in the course of implementation of a program referred to in
paragraph&#160;2 of Article&#160;8, notwithstanding the fact that the
program is consistent with the criteria laid down in that paragraph, a
Member has reasons to believe that this program has resulted in serious

effects referred to in paragraph&#160;1. If the Committee determines that
such effects exist, it may recommend to the subsidizing Member to modify this
program in such a way as to remove these effects. The Committee shall
present its conclusions within 120&#160;days from the date when the matter is
referred to it under paragraph&#160;3. In the event the recommendation is not

    PART V: COUNTERVAILING MEASURES </h2>

<h3>
Article&#160;10 </h3>


Application of Article VI of GATT&#160;1994
The provisions of Part&#160;II or&#160;III may be invoked in parallel with
the provisions of Part&#160;V; however, with regard to the effects of a
particular subsidy in the domestic market of the importing Member, only one
form of relief (either a countervailing duty, if the requirements of Part&#160;V
are met, or a countermeasure under Articles&#160;4 or&#160;7) shall be available. The
provisions of Parts&#160;III and&#160;V shall not be invoked regarding measures
considered non-actionable in accordance with the provisions of Part&#160;IV.
However, measures referred to in paragraph&#160;1(a) of Article&#160;8 may be
investigated in order to determine whether or not they are specific within
the meaning of Article&#160;2. In addition, in the case of a subsidy referred to
in paragraph&#160;2 of Article&#160;8 conferred pursuant to a program which has not
been notified in accordance with paragraph&#160;3 of Article&#160;8, the provisions of
Part&#160;III or&#160;V may be invoked, but such subsidy shall be treated as
non-actionable if it is found to conform to the standards set forth in
paragraph&#160;2 of Article&#160;8.  <h3> </h3>


    Members shall take all necessary steps to ensure that the imposition of
a countervailing duty The term "countervailing duty" shall be understood to
mean a special duty levied for the purpose of off-setting any subsidy
bestowed directly or indirectly upon the manufacture, production or <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000350300094"></a><a href="m.htm#_ICONOVEX_MERCHANDISEEXPORTOF"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>export of

the territory of another Member is in accordance with the provisions of
Article&#160;VI of GATT&#160;1994 and the terms of this Agreement.
Countervailing duties may only be imposed pursuant to investigations
initiated The term "initiated" as used hereinafter means procedural action by
which a  Member formally commences an investigation as provided in
Article&#160;11.<p>

Article 11 </h3>

<h3>
Initiation and Subsequent Investigation </h3>


11.1    Except as provided in paragraph&#160;6, an investigation to
determine the existence, degree and effect of any alleged subsidy shall be
initiated upon a written application by or on behalf of the domestic
industry.<p> 11.2    An application under paragraph&#160;1 shall include
sufficient evidence of the existence of <i>(a)</i>&#160;a subsidy and, if
possible, its amount, <i>(b)</i>&#160;injury within the meaning of
Article&#160;VI of GATT&#160;1994 as interpreted by this Agreement, and
<i>(c)</i>&#160;a causal link between the subsidized imports and the alleged
injury. Simple assertion, unsubstantiated by relevant evidence, cannot be
considered sufficient to meet the requirements of this paragraph. The
application shall contain such information as is reasonably available to the
applicant on the following:<p> (i)    the identity of the applicant and a
description of the volume and value of the domestic production of the like
product by the applicant. Where a written application is made on behalf of
the domestic industry, the application shall identify the industry on behalf
of which the application is made by a list of all known domestic producers of
the like product (or associations of domestic producers of the like product)
and, to the extent possible, a description of the volume and value of
domestic production of the like product accounted for by such producers;<p>
(ii)    a complete description of the allegedly subsidized product, the
names of the country or countries of origin or export in question, the
identity of each known exporter or foreign producer and a list of known
persons importing the product in question;<p> (iii)    evidence with regard
to the existence, amount and nature of the subsidy in question;<p> (iv)
evidence that alleged injury to a domestic industry is caused by <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000351400027"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000356800069"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>subsidized
imports through the effects of the subsidies; this evidence includes
information on the evolution of the volume of the allegedly subsidized
imports, the effect of these imports on prices of the like product in the
domestic market and the consequent impact of the imports on the domestic
industry, as demonstrated by relevant factors and indices having a bearing on
the state of the domestic industry, such as those listed in paragraphs&#160;2
and 4 of Article&#160;15.<p> 11.3    The authorities shall review the accuracy and
adequacy of the evidence provided in the application to determine whether the
evidence is sufficient to justify the initiation of an investigation.<p>11.4
An investigation shall not be initiated pursuant to paragraph&#160;1 unless
the authorities have determined, on the basis of an examination of the degree
of support for, or opposition to, the application expressed In the case of
fragmented industries involving an exceptionally large number of producers,
authorities may determine support and opposition by using statistically valid
sampling techniques.  by domestic producers of the like product, that the
application has been made by or on behalf of the domestic industry.  Members
are aware that in the territory of certain Members employees of domestic
producers of the like product or representatives of those employees may make
or support an application for an investigation under paragraph&#160;1.  The
application shall be considered to have been made "by or on behalf of the
domestic industry" if it is supported by those domestic producers whose
collective output constitutes more than 50&#160;percent of the total
production of the like product produced by that portion of the domestic
industry expressing either support for or opposition to the application.
However, no investigation shall be initiated when domestic producers
expressly supporting the application account for less than 25&#160;percent
of total production of the like product produced by the domestic
industry.<p>11.5    The authorities shall avoid, unless a decision has been
made to initiate an investigation,  any publicizing of the application for
the initiation of  an investigation.<p>11.6    If, in special circumstances,
the authorities concerned decide to initiate an investigation without having
received a written application by or on behalf of a domestic industry for the
initiation of such investigation, they shall proceed only if they have
sufficient evidence of the existence of a subsidy, injury and causal link,
as described in paragraph&#160;2, to justify the initiation of an
investigation.<p>11.7    The evidence of both subsidy and injury shall be
considered simultaneously <i>(a)</i> in the decision whether or not to
initiate an investigation and <i>(b)</i> thereafter, during the course of the
investigation, starting on a date not later than the earliest date on which
in accordance with the provisions of this Agreement provisional measures may
be applied.<p>11.8    In cases where products are not imported directly from
the country of origin but are exported to the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000352000038"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000352000122"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>importing Member from an
intermediate country, the provisions of this Agreement shall be fully
applicable and the transaction or transactions shall, for the purposes of
this Agreement, be regarded as having taken place between the country of
origin and the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000352000122"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000356900161"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>importing Member.<p>11.9    An application under
paragraph&#160;1 shall be rejected and an investigation shall be terminated
promptly as soon as the authorities concerned are satisfied that there is
not sufficient evidence of either subsidization or of injury to justify
proceeding with the case. There shall be immediate termination  in cases
where the amount of a subsidy is <i>de minimis</i>, or where the volume of
subsidized imports, actual or potential, or the injury, is negligible. For
the purpose of this paragraph, the amount of the subsidy shall be considered
to be <i>de minimis</i> if the subsidy is less than 1percent ad
valorem.<p>11.10    An investigation shall not hinder the procedures of
customs clearance.<p> 11.11    Investigations shall, except in special
circumstances, be concluded within one year, and in no case more than
18&#160;months, after their initiation.<p>

duty investigation shall be given notice of the information which the
authorities require and ample opportunity to present in writing all evidence
which they consider relevant in respect of the investigation in question.<p>
    12.1.1    Exporters, foreign producers or interested Members receiving
    questionnaires used in a countervailing duty investigation shall be given
at least 30&#160;days for reply.  As a general rule, the time-limit for exporters
shall be counted from the date of receipt of the questionnaire, which for
this purpose shall be deemed to have been received one week from the date on
which it was sent to the respondent or transmitted to the appropriate
diplomatic representatives of the exporting Member or, in the case of a
separate customs territory Member of the WTO, an official representative of
the exporting territory.  Due consideration should be given to any request
for an extension of the 30&#160;day period and, upon cause shown, such an
extension should be granted whenever practicable.<p> 12.1.2    Subject to the
requirement to protect confidential information, evidence presented in
writing by one interested Member or interested party shall be made available
promptly to other interested Members or interested parties participating in
the investigation.<p> 12.1.3    As soon as an investigation has been
initiated, the authorities shall provide the full text  of the written
application received under paragraph&#160;1 of Article&#160;11 to the known
exporters It being understood that where the number of exporters involved is
particularly high, the full text of the application should instead be
provided only to the authorities of the exporting Member or to the relevant
trade association who then should forward copies to the exporters concerned.
and to the authorities of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000353100170"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000361000089"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>exporting Member and shall make it available,
upon request, to other interested parties involved. Due regard shall be paid
to the protection of confidential information, as provided for in
paragraph&#160;4.<p> 12.2.    Interested Members and interested parties also
shall have the right, upon justification, to present information orally.
Where such information is provided orally, the interested Members and
interested parties subsequently shall be required to reduce such submissions
to writing. Any decision of the investigating authorities can only be based
on such information and arguments as were on the written record of this
authority and which were available to interested Members and interested
parties participating in the investigation, due account having been given to
the need to protect confidential information.<p>12.3    The authorities shall
whenever practicable provide timely opportunities for all interested Members
and interested parties to see all information that is relevant to the
presentation of their cases, that is not confidential as defined in
paragraph&#160;4, and that is used by the authorities in a countervailing
duty investigation, and to prepare presentations on the basis of this
information.<p>12.4    Any information which is by nature confidential (for
example, because its disclosure would be of significant competitive advantage
to a competitor or because its disclosure would have a significantly adverse
effect upon a person supplying the information or upon a person from whom the
supplier acquired the information), or which is provided on a confidential
basis by parties to an investigation shall, upon good cause shown, be
treated as such by the authorities. Such information shall not be disclosed
without specific permission of the party submitting it.  Members are aware
that in the territory of certain <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000353400202"></a><a href="m.htm#_ICONOVEX_MEMBERSDISCLOSURE"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Members disclosure pursuant to a
narrowly-drawn protective order may be required.  <p> 12.4.1    The
    authorities shall require interested Members or interested parties
    providing confidential information to furnish non-confidential summaries
thereof. These summaries shall be in sufficient detail to permit a reasonable
understanding of the substance of the information submitted in confidence. In
exceptional circumstances, such Members or parties may indicate that such
information is not susceptible of summary. In such exceptional circumstances,
a statement of the reasons why summarization is not possible must be
provided.<p>
12.4.2    If the authorities find that a request for confidentiality is not
warranted and if the supplier of the information is either unwilling to make
the information public or to authorize its disclosure in generalized or
summary form, the authorities may disregard such information unless it can be
demonstrated to their satisfaction from appropriate sources that the
information is correct.
Members agree that requests for confidentiality should not be arbitrarily
rejected. Members further agree that the investigating authority may request
the waiving of confidentiality only regarding information relevant to the
proceedings.

<p>
12.5    Except in circumstances provided for in paragraph&#160;7, the
authorities shall during the course of an investigation satisfy themselves as
to the accuracy of the information supplied by interested Members or
interested parties upon which their findings are based.<p>12.6    The
investigating authorities may carry out investigations in the territory of
other Members as required, provided that they have notified in good time the
Member in question and unless that Member objects to the investigation.
Further, the investigating authorities may carry out investigations on the
premises of a firm and may examine the records of a firm if
<i>(a)</i>&#160;the firm so agrees and <i>(b)</i>&#160;the Member in question
is notified and does not object. The procedures set forth in Annex&#160;VI
shall apply to investigations on the premises of a firm. Subject to the
requirement to protect confidential information, the authorities shall make
the results of any such investigations available, or shall provide disclosure
thereof pursuant to paragraph&#160;8, to the firms to which they pertain and
may make such results available to the applicants.<p>12.7    In cases in
which any interested Member or interested party refuses access to, or
otherwise does not provide, necessary information within a reasonable period
or significantly impedes the investigation, preliminary and final
determinations, affirmative or negative, may be made on the basis of the
facts available.<p>12.8    The authorities shall, before a final
determination is made, inform all interested Members and interested parties
of the essential facts under consideration which form the basis for the
decision whether to apply definitive measures. Such disclosure should take
place in sufficient time for the parties to defend their interests.<p>12.9
For the purposes of this Agreement, "interested parties" shall include:<p>

trade and business association a majority of the members of which produce the
like product in the territory of the importing Member.<p> This list shall not
preclude Members from allowing domestic or foreign parties other than those
mentioned above to be included as interested parties.<p>12.10    The
authorities shall provide opportunities for industrial users of the product

any difficulties experienced by interested parties, in particular small
companies, in supplying information requested, and shall provide any

Consultations </h3>


13.1    As soon as possible after an application under Article&#160;11 is
accepted, and in any event before the initiation of any investigation,
Members the products of which may be subject to such investigation shall be
invited for consultations with the aim of clarifying the situation as to the
matters referred to in paragraph&#160;2 of Article&#160;11 and arriving at a

of this Article.  <h3> </h3>


15.1    A determination of injury for purposes of Article&#160;VI of
GATT&#160;1994 shall be based on positive evidence and involve an objective
examination of both <i>(a)</i> the volume of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000356800069"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000356800084"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>subsidized imports and the

products Throughout this Agreement the term "like product" ("produit
similaire") shall be interpreted to mean a product which is identical, i.e.
alike in all respects to the product under consideration, or in the absence
of such a product, another product which, although not alike in all
respects, has characteristics closely resembling those of the product under
consideration.  and <i>(b)</i> the consequent impact of these imports on the
domestic producers of such products.<p> 15.2    With regard to the volume of
the subsidized imports, the investigating authorities shall consider whether
there has been a significant increase in subsidized imports, either in
absolute terms or relative to production or consumption in the importing
Member. With regard to the effect of the subsidized imports on prices, the
investigating authorities shall consider whether there has been a significant
price undercutting by the subsidized imports as compared with the price of a
like product of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000356900161"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000358800137"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>importing Member, or whether the effect of such imports
is otherwise to depress prices to a significant degree or to prevent price
increases, which otherwise would have occurred, to a significant degree. No
one or several of these factors can necessarily give decisive guidance. <p>
15.3    Where imports of a product from more than one country are
simultaneously subject to countervailing duty investigations, the
investigating authorities may cumulatively assess the effects of such imports
only if they determine that <i>(a)</i>&#160;the amount of subsidization
established in relation to the imports from each country is more than
<i>de&#160;minimis</i> as defined in paragraph&#160;9 of Article&#160;11 and
the volume of imports from each country is not negligible and <i>(b)</i> a
cumulative assessment of the effects of the imports is appropriate in light
of the conditions of competition between the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000357000200"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000357000219"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>imported products and the

factors and indices having a bearing on the state of the industry, including

affecting domestic prices; actual and potential negative effects on cash
flow, inventories, employment, wages, growth, ability to raise capital or
investments and, in the case of agriculture, whether there has been an
increased burden on government support programs. This list is not
exhaustive, nor can one or several of these factors necessarily give decisive
guidance.<p>15.5    It must be demonstrated that the subsidized imports are,
through the effects As set forth in paragraphs&#160;2 and&#160;4.  of subsidies,
causing injury within the meaning of this Agreement. The demonstration of a

domestic industry shall be based on an examination of all relevant evidence
before the authorities. The authorities shall also examine any known factors

respect include, <i>inter alia</i>, the volumes and prices of non-subsidized
imports of the product in question, contraction in demand or changes in the
patterns of consumption, trade restrictive practices of and competition
between the foreign and domestic producers, developments in technology and

determination of a threat of material injury shall be based on facts and not
merely on allegation, conjecture or remote possibility. The change in
circumstances which would create a situation in which the subsidy would cause
injury must be clearly foreseen and imminent. In making a determination
regarding the existence of a threat of material injury, the investigating
authorities should consider, <i>inter&#160;alia</i>, such factors as: <p> (i)
nature of the subsidy or subsidies in question and the trade effects likely
to arise therefrom; <p> (ii)    a significant rate of increase of subsidized
imports into the domestic market indicating the likelihood of substantially
increased importation; <p> (iii)    sufficient freely disposable, or an
imminent, substantial increase in, capacity of the exporter indicating the
likelihood of substantially increased subsidized exports to the importing
Member's market, taking into account the availability of other export markets
to absorb any additional exports; <p> (iv)    whether imports are entering at
prices that will have a significant depressing or suppressing effect on
domestic prices, and would likely increase demand for further imports;
and<p> (v)    inventories of the product being investigated. <p> No one of
these factors by itself can necessarily give decisive guidance but the
totality of the factors considered must lead to the conclusion that further
subsidized exports are imminent and that, unless protective action is taken,
material injury would occur.<p> 15.8    With respect to cases where injury is
threatened by <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000358100021"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000358700267"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>subsidized imports, the application of countervailing measures

Article 16 </h3>

<h3>
Definition of Domestic Industry </h3>


16.1    For the purposes of this Agreement, the term "domestic industry"
shall, except as provided in paragraph&#160;2, be interpreted as referring to
the domestic producers as a whole of the like products or to those of them
whose collective output of the products constitutes a major proportion of the
total  domestic <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000358600112"></a><a href="24.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000390800115"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>production of those products, except that when producers are
related For the purpose of this paragraph, producers shall be deemed to be
related to exporters or importers only if <i>(a)</i> one of them directly or
indirectly controls the other; or <i>(b)</i> both of them are directly or
indirectly controlled by a third person; or <i>(c)</i>&#160;together they
directly or indirectly control a third person, provided that there are
grounds for believing or suspecting that the effect of the relationship is
such as to cause the producer concerned to behave differently from
non-related producers. For the purpose of this paragraph, one shall be deemed
to control another when the former is legally or operationally in a position
to exercise restraint or direction over the latter.  to the exporters or
importers or are themselves importers of the allegedly subsidized product or
a like product from other countries, the term "domestic industry" may be
interpreted as referring to the rest of the producers.<p> 16.2.    In
exceptional circumstances, the territory of a Member may, for the production
in question, be divided into two or more competitive markets and the
producers within each market may be regarded as a separate industry if
<i>(a)</i>&#160;the producers within such market sell all or almost all of
their production of the product in question in that market, and
<i>(b)</i>&#160;the demand in that market is not to any substantial degree
supplied by producers of the product in question located elsewhere in the
territory. In such circumstances, injury may be found to exist even where a
major portion of the total domestic industry is not injured, provided there
is a concentration of subsidized imports into such an isolated market and
provided further that the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000358700267"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000359700050"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>subsidized imports are causing injury to the
producers of all or almost all of the production within such market.<p> 16.3
When the domestic industry has been interpreted as referring to the producers
in a certain area, i.e. a market as defined in paragraph&#160;2,
countervailing duties shall be levied only on the products in question
consigned for final consumption to that area. When the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000358800097"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CONSTITUTIONALLAWOFIMPORTINGMEMBER"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>constitutional law of

otherwise give assurances pursuant to Article&#160;18, and adequate
assurances in this regard have not been promptly given, and<i>
(b</i>)&#160;such duties cannot be levied only on products of specific
producers which supply the area in question.<p>16.4    Where two or more
countries have reached under the provisions of paragraph&#160;8(a) of
Article&#160;XXIV of GATT&#160;1994 such a level of integration that they
have the characteristics of a single, unified market, the industry in the
entire area of integration shall be taken to be the domestic industry
referred to in paragraphs&#160;1 and&#160;2.<p> 16.5    The provisions of

provisions of this Article unless the subsidy or subsidies are withdrawn.<p>
19.2    The decision whether or not to impose a countervailing duty in cases
where all requirements for the imposition have been fulfilled, and the
decision whether the amount of the countervailing duty to be imposed shall be
the full amount of the subsidy or less, are decisions to be made by the
authorities of the importing Member. It is desirable that the imposition
should be permissive in the territory of all Members, that the duty should be
less than the total amount of the subsidy if such lesser duty would be
adequate to remove the injury to the domestic industry, and that procedures
should be established which would allow the authorities concerned to take due
account of representations made by domestic interested parties For the
purpose of this paragraph, the term "domestic interested parties" shall
include consumers and industrial users of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000362000293"></a><a href="i.htm#_ICONOVEX_IMPORTEDPRODUCTSUBJECT"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>imported product subject to

whose interests might be adversely affected by the imposition of a
countervailing duty. <p>19.3    When a countervailing duty is imposed in
respect of any product, such countervailing duty shall be levied, in the
appropriate amounts in each case, on a <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000362100057"></a><a href="n.htm#_ICONOVEX_NONDISCRIMINATORYBASIS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>non-discriminatory basis on <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000362100064"></a><a href="24.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000391700189"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>imports of
such product from all sources found to be subsidized and causing injury,
except as to imports from those sources which have renounced any subsidies in
question or from which undertakings under the terms of this Agreement have
been accepted. Any exporter whose exports are subject to a definitive
countervailing duty but who was not actually investigated for reasons other
than a refusal to  cooperate, shall be entitled to an expedited review in
order that the investigating authorities promptly establish an individual
countervailing duty rate for that exporter.<p> 19.4    No countervailing duty
shall be levied As used in this Agreement "levy" shall mean the definitive or
final legal assessment or collection of a duty or tax.  on any imported
 product in excess of the amount of the subsidy found to exist, calculated in
terms of subsidization per unit of the subsidized and exported product.<p>

<h3>
Article 20 </h3>

<h3>
Retroactivity </h3>


20.1    Provisional measures and countervailing duties shall only be applied
to products which enter for consumption after the time when the decision
under paragraph&#160;1 of Article&#160;17 and paragraph&#160;1 of
Article&#160;19, respectively, enters into force, subject to the exceptions
set out in this Article.<p> 20.2    Where a final determination of injury
(but not of a threat thereof or of a material retardation of the
establishment of an industry) is made or, in the case of a final
determination of a threat of injury, where the effect of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000362800093"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000373100013"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>subsidized
imports would, in the absence of the provisional measures, have led to a
determination of injury, countervailing duties may be levied retroactively
for the period for which provisional measures, if any, have been applied.<p>
20.3    If the definitive countervailing duty is higher than the amount
guaranteed by the cash deposit or <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000362900035"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000362900082"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>bond, the difference shall not be
collected. If the definitive duty is less than the amount guaranteed by the
cash deposit or <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000362900082"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000362900102"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>bond, the excess amount shall be reimbursed or the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000362900102"></a><a href="b.htm#_ICONOVEX_BOND"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>bond
released in an expeditious manner.<p>20.4    Except as provided in
paragraph&#160;2, where a determination of threat of injury or material
retardation is made (but no injury has yet occurred) a definitive
countervailing duty may be imposed only from the date of the determination of
threat of injury or material retardation, and any cash deposit made during
the period of the application of provisional measures shall be refunded and
any bonds released in an expeditious manner.<p>20.5    Where a final
determination is negative, any cash deposit made during the period of the
application of provisional measures shall be refunded and any bonds released
in an expeditious manner.<p> 20.6    In critical circumstances where for the
<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000363200015"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000384900191"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>subsidized product in question the authorities find that injury which is
difficult to repair is caused by massive imports in a relatively short period
of a product benefiting from subsidies paid or bestowed inconsistently with
the provisions of GATT&#160;1994 and of this Agreement and where it is deemed
necessary, in order to preclude the recurrence of such injury, to assess
countervailing duties retroactively on those imports, the definitive
countervailing duties may be assessed on imports which were entered for
consumption not more than 90 days prior to the date of application of
provisional measures.<p>

<h3>
Article 21 </h3>

<h3>
    Duration and Review of Countervailing Duties and Undertakings </h3>


21.1    A countervailing duty shall remain in force only as long as and to
the extent necessary to counteract subsidization which is causing injury.<p>
21.2    The authorities shall review the need for the continued imposition of the duty, where warranted, on
their own initiative or, provided that a reasonable period of time has
elapsed since the imposition of the definitive countervailing duty, upon
request by any interested party which submits positive  information
substantiating the need for a review. Interested parties shall have the
right to request the authorities to examine whether the continued imposition
of the duty is necessary to offset subsidization, whether the injury would be
likely to continue or recur if the duty were removed or varied, or both. If,
as a result of the review under this paragraph, the authorities determine
that the countervailing duty is no longer warranted, it shall be terminated
immediately.<p> 21.3    Notwithstanding the provisions of paragraphs 1 and 2,
any definitive countervailing duty shall be terminated on a date not later
than five years from its imposition (or from the date of the most recent
review under paragraph&#160;2 if that review has covered both subsidization
and injury, or under this paragraph), unless the authorities determine, in a
review initiated before that date on their own initiative or upon a duly
substantiated request made by or on behalf of the domestic industry within a
reasonable period of time prior to that date, that the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000363900196"></a><a href="e.htm#_ICONOVEX_EXPIRYOFDUTY"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>expiry of the duty
would be likely to lead to continuation or recurrence of subsidization and
injury.  When the amount of the countervailing duty is assessed on a
retrospective basis, a finding in the most recent assessment proceeding that
no duty is to be levied shall not by itself require the authorities to
terminate the definitive duty.
 The duty may remain in force pending the outcome of such a review.<p>21.4    The provisions of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000364000008"></a><a href="27.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000533100156"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Article 12 regarding evidence and procedure shall apply to any review carried out
under this Article. Any such review shall be carried out expeditiously and
shall normally be concluded within 12&#160;months of the date of initiation of the
review.<p> 21.5    The provisions of this Article shall apply <i>mutatis
mutandis</i> to undertakings accepted under Article&#160;18.<p>

basis:<p> 1.  Where it is alleged that an indirect tax rebate scheme, or a
drawback scheme, conveys a subsidy by reason of over-rebate or excess
drawback of indirect taxes or <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000381300062"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000382200021"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>import charges on inputs consumed in the

first determine whether the government of the exporting Member has in place
and applies a system or procedure to confirm which inputs are consumed in the
production of the exported product and in what amounts. Where such a system
or procedure is determined to be applied, the investigating authorities
should then examine the system or procedure to see whether it is reasonable,
effective for the purpose intended, and based on generally accepted
<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000381300245"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000382600154"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>commercial practices in the country of export. The investigating authorities
may deem it necessary to carry out, in accordance with paragraph&#160;6 of
Article&#160;12, certain practical tests in order to verify information or to
satisfy themselves that the system or procedure is being effectively
applied.<p>2.    Where there is no such system or procedure, where it is not
reasonable, or where it is instituted and considered reasonable but is found
not to be applied or not to be applied effectively, a further examination by
the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000381400084"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000381700119"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>exporting Member based on the actual inputs involved would need to be
carried out in the context of determining whether an excess payment occurred.
If the investigating authorities deemed it necessary, a further examination
would be carried out in accordance with paragraph&#160;1.<p>3.
Investigating authorities should treat inputs as physically incorporated if
such inputs are used in the production process and are physically present in
the product exported. The Members note that an input need not be present in
the final product in the same form in which it entered the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000381500100"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000381600138"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>production

waste" should be taken into account, and such waste should be treated as
consumed in the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000381600084"></a><a href="p.htm#_ICONOVEX_PRODUCTIONOFEXPORTEDPRODUCT"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>production of the exported product. The term "waste" refers

in the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000381600138"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000381700042"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>production process, is not consumed in the production of the exported
product (for reasons such as inefficiencies) and is not recovered, used or
sold by the same manufacturer.<p>
5.    The investigating authority's determination of whether the claimed
allowance for waste is "normal" should take into account the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000381700042"></a><a href="p.htm#_ICONOVEX_PRODUCTIONPROCESS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>production
process, the average experience of the industry in the country of export, and
other technical factors, as appropriate. The investigating authority should
bear in mind that an important question is whether the authorities in the

provided such inputs are equal in quantity to, and have the same quality and
characteristics as, the imported inputs being substituted. The existence of a
verification system or procedure is important because it enables the
government of the exporting Member to ensure and demonstrate that the
quantity of inputs for which drawback is claimed does not exceed the quantity
of similar products exported, in whatever form, and that there is not
drawback of import charges in excess of those originally levied on the
imported inputs in question.<p>2.    Where it is alleged that a substitution
drawback system conveys a subsidy, the investigating authorities should first
proceed to determine whether the government of the exporting Member has in
place and applies a verification system or procedure. Where such a system or
procedure is determined to be applied, the investigating authorities should
then examine the verification procedures to see whether they are reasonable,
effective for the purpose intended, and based on generally accepted
<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000382600154"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_COMMERCIALPRACTICES"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>commercial practices in the country of export. To the extent that the
procedures are determined to meet this test and are effectively applied, no
subsidy should be presumed to exist. It may be deemed necessary by the
investigating authorities to carry out, in accordance with paragraph&#160;6
of Article&#160;12, certain practical tests in order to verify information or
to satisfy themselves that the verification procedures are being effectively
applied.<p> 3.    Where there are no verification procedures, where they are
not reasonable, or where such procedures are instituted and considered
reasonable but are found not to be actually applied or not applied
effectively, there may be a subsidy. In such cases a further examination by
the exporting Member based on the actual transactions involved would need to
be carried out to determine whether an excess payment occurred. If the
investigating authorities deemed it necessary, a further examination would
be carried out in accordance with paragraph&#160;2.<p>4.    The existence of
a substitution drawback provision under which exporters are allowed to select
particular <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000382800033"></a><a href="i.htm#_ICONOVEX_IMPORTSHIPMENTS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>import shipments on which drawback is claimed should not of itself
be considered to convey a subsidy.<p> 5.    An excess drawback of import
charges in the sense of paragraph&#160;(i) would be  deemed to exist where
governments paid interest on any monies refunded under their drawback
schemes, to the extent of the interest actually paid or payable.<p>

as well as to clarify and obtain elaboration of information available to the
parties to a dispute through the notification procedures set forth in
Part&#160;VII.  The information-gathering process by the DSB shall take into
account the need to protect information which is by nature confidential or
which is provided on a confidential basis by any Member involved in this
process.  <p>3.    In the case of effects in third-country markets, a party
to a dispute may collect information, including through the use of questions

in such a way as not to impose an unreasonable burden on the third-country
Member. In particular, such a Member is not expected to make a market or
price analysis specially for that purpose. The information to be supplied is
that which is already available or can be readily obtained by this Member
(e.g. most recent statistics which have already been gathered by relevant
statistical services but which have not yet been published, customs data
concerning imports and declared values of the products concerned, etc.).
However, if a party to a dispute undertakes a detailed market analysis at its
own expense, the task of the person or firm  conducting such an analysis
shall be facilitated by the authorities of the third-country Member and such
a person or firm shall be given access to all information which is not
normally maintained confidential by the government.<p>4.    The DSB shall
designate a representative to serve the function of facilitating the
information-gathering process. The sole purpose of the representative shall
be to ensure the timely development of the information necessary to
facilitate expeditious subsequent multilateral review of the dispute. In
particular, the representative may suggest ways to most efficiently solicit
necessary information as well as encourage the cooperation of the
parties.<p>5.    The information-gathering process outlined in
paragraphs&#160;2 through&#160;4 shall be completed within 60&#160;days of
the date on which the matter has been referred to the DSB under
paragraph&#160;4 of Article&#160;7. The information obtained during this

conclusions.<p>6.    If the subsidizing and/or third-country Member fail to
cooperate in the information-gathering process, the complaining Member will
present its case of serious prejudice, based on evidence available to it,
together with facts and circumstances of the non-cooperation of the
subsidizing and/or third-country Member. Where information is unavailable due
to non-cooperation by the subsidizing and/or third-country Member, the panel
may complete the record as necessary relying on best information otherwise
available.<p>7.    In making its determination, the panel should draw adverse
inferences from instances of non-cooperation by any party involved in the
information-gathering process.<p>8.    In making a determination to use
either best information available or adverse inferences, the panel shall
consider the advice of the DSB representative nominated under
paragraph&#160;4 as to the reasonableness of any requests for information and
the efforts made by parties to comply with these requests in a cooperative
and timely manner.<p> 9.    Nothing in the information-gathering process
shall limit the ability of the panel to seek such additional information it
deems essential to a proper resolution to the dispute, and which was not
adequately sought or developed during that process. However, ordinarily the
panel should not request additional information to complete the record where
the information would support a particular party's position and the absence
of that information in the record is the result of unreasonable
non-cooperation by that party in the information-gathering process.<p>

ANNEX VI <br>
PROCEDURES FOR ON-THE-SPOT INVESTIGATIONS PURSUANT TO PARAGRAPH&#160;6 OF
ARTICLE&#160;12 </h2>


1.    Upon initiation of an investigation, the authorities of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000385700025"></a><a href="23.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000385900034"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>exporting
Member and the firms known to be concerned should be informed of the
intention to carry out on-the-spot investigations.<p>2.    If in exceptional
circumstances it is intended to include non-governmental experts in the
investigating team, the firms and the authorities of the exporting Member
should be so informed. Such non-governmental experts should be subject to
effective sanctions for breach of confidentiality requirements.<p> 3.    It
should be standard practice to obtain explicit agreement of the firms
concerned in the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000385900034"></a><a href="24.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000395900128"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>exporting Member before the visit is finally scheduled.<p>4.
As soon as the agreement of the firms concerned has been obtained, the
investigating authorities should notify the authorities of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000386000046"></a><a href="m.htm#_ICONOVEX_MEMBEROFNAMESEXPORTING"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>exporting
Member of the names and addresses of the firms to be visited and the dates
agreed.<p>5.    Sufficient advance notice should be given to the firms in
question before the visit is made.<p>6.    Visits to explain the
questionnaire should only be made at the request of an exporting firm. In
case of such a request the investigating authorities may place themselves at
the disposal of the firm; such a visit may only be made if <i>(a)</i> the
authorities of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000386200103"></a><a href="24.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000392900036"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>importing Member notify the representatives of the

to the visit.<p>7.    As the main purpose of the on-the-spot investigation is
to verify information provided or to obtain further details, it should be
carried out after the response to the questionnaire has been received unless
the firm agrees to the contrary and the government of the exporting Member is
informed by the investigating authorities of the anticipated visit and does
not object to it; further, it should be standard practice prior to the visit
to advise the firms concerned of the general nature of the information to be
verified and of any further information which needs to be provided, though
this should not preclude requests to be made on the spot for further details
to be provided in the light of information obtained.<p> 8.    Enquiries or
questions put by the authorities or firms of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000386400026"></a><a href="24.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000394000083"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>exporting Members and
essential to a successful on-the-spot investigation should, whenever
possible, be answered before the visit is made.<p>

than required unless there is another measure, reasonably available taking
into account technical and economic feasibility, that achieves the
appropriate level of sanitary or phytosanitary protection and is
significantly less restrictive to trade.  <p>7.    In cases where relevant

<h1>
Understanding on the Interpretation of Article&#160;XXIV of the General
Agreement on Tariffs and Trade 1994 </h1> <i>Members,</i><p>    <i>Having
regard</i> to the provisions of Article&#160;XXIV of GATT&#160;1994;<p>
<i>Recognizing</i> that customs unions and <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000030300013"></a><a href="f.htm#_ICONOVEX_FREETRADEAREAS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>free-trade areas have greatly
increased in number and importance since the establishment of GATT&#160;1947
and today cover a significant proportion of world trade;<p>
<i>Recognizing</i> the contribution to the expansion of world trade that may
be made by closer integration between the economies of the parties to such
agreements;<p> <i>Recognizing</i> also that such contribution is increased if
the elimination between the constituent territories of duties and other
restrictive regulations of commerce extends to all trade, and diminished if
any major sector of trade is excluded;<p>    <i>Reaffirming</i> that the
purpose of such agreements should be to facilitate trade between the
<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000030600031"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CONSTITUENTTERRITORIES"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>constituent territories and not to raise barriers to the trade of other
Members with such territories;  and that in their formation or enlargement
the parties to them should to the greatest possible extent avoid creating
adverse effects on the trade of other Members;<p>    <i>Convinced</i> also of
the need to reinforce the effectiveness of the role of the Council for Trade
in Goods in reviewing agreements notified under Article&#160;XXIV, by clarifying
the criteria and procedures for the assessment of new or enlarged agreements,
and improving the transparency of all Article&#160;XXIV agreements;<p>
<i>Recognizing</i> the need for a common understanding of the obligations of
Members under paragraph&#160;12 of Article&#160;XXIV;<p>    Hereby <i>agree
</i>as follows:<p> 1.    Customs unions, free-trade areas, and interim
agreements leading to the formation of a customs union or free-trade area,
to be consistent with Article XXIV, must satisfy, <i>inter alia</i>, the
provisions of paragraphs&#160;5, 6, 7 and 8 of that
Article.<p> <i></i><b><i>Article&#160;XXIV:5</b></i><p> 2.    The evaluation
under paragraph&#160;5(a) of Article&#160;XXIV of the general incidence of the
duties and other regulations of commerce applicable before and after the
formation of a customs union shall in respect of duties and charges be based
upon an overall assessment of weighted average <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000031200099"></a><a href="09.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000031200206"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>tariff rates and of customs
duties collected. This assessment shall be based on <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000031200127"></a><a href="18.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000252300143"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>import statistics for a
previous representative period to be supplied by the customs union, on a
tariff-line basis and in values and quantities, broken down by <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000031200182"></a><a href="15.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000105600086"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>WTO country
of origin. The Secretariat shall compute the weighted average <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000031200206"></a><a href="t.htm#_ICONOVEX_TARIFFRATES"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>tariff rates

assessment of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000031200239"></a><a href="t.htm#_ICONOVEX_TARIFFOFFERS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>tariff offers in the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000031200248"></a><a href="20.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000292000023"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Uruguay Round of Multilateral Trade
Negotiations. For this purpose, the duties and charges to be taken into
consideration shall be the applied rates of duty. It is recognized that for
the purpose of the overall assessment of the incidence of other regulations
of commerce for which quantification and aggregation are difficult, the
examination of individual measures, regulations, products covered and trade
flows affected may be required.<p> 3.    The "reasonable length of time"
referred to in paragraph&#160;5(c) of Article&#160;XXIV should exceed
10-years only in exceptional cases. In cases where Members parties to
an interim agreement believe that 10 years would be insufficient they shall
provide a full explanation to the Council for Trade in Goods of the need for
a longer period.<p> <i></i><b><i>Article&#160;XXIV:6</b></i><p> 4.    Paragraph 6
of Article&#160;XXIV establishes the procedure to be followed when a Member
forming a customs union proposes to increase a bound rate of duty. In this
regard Members reaffirm that the procedure set forth in Article&#160;XXVIII,
as elaborated in the guidelines adopted on 10&#160;November&#160;1980 (BISD 27S/26-28)
and in the Understanding on the Interpretation of Article&#160;XXVIII of
GATT&#160;1994, must be commenced before tariff concessions are modified or
withdrawn upon the formation of a customs union or an interim agreement
leading to the formation of a customs union. <p> 5.    These negotiations
will be entered into in good faith with a view to achieving mutually
satisfactory compensatory adjustment. In such negotiations, as required by
paragraph&#160;6 of Article&#160;XXIV, due account shall be taken of reductions
of duties on the same <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000031600089"></a><a href="11.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000035000074"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>tariff line made by other <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000031600100"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CONSTITUENTSOFCUSTOMSUNION"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>constituents of the customs
union upon its formation. Should such reductions not be sufficient to
provide the necessary compensatory adjustment, the customs union would offer
compensation, which may take the form of reductions of duties on other
<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000031600178"></a><a href="13.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000045400147"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>tariff lines. Such an offer shall be taken into consideration by the Members
having negotiating rights in the binding being modified or withdrawn. Should
the compensatory adjustment remain unacceptable, negotiations should be
continued. Where, despite such efforts, agreement in negotiations on
compensatory adjustment under Article&#160;XXVIII as elaborated by the
Understanding on the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000031600291"></a><a href="i.htm#_ICONOVEX_INTERPRETATIONOFARTICLE"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Interpretation of Article&#160;XXVIII of GATT&#160;1994
cannot be reached within a reasonable period from the initiation of
negotiations, the customs union shall, nevertheless, be free to modify or
withdraw the concessions;  affected Members shall then be free to withdraw
substantially equivalent concessions in accordance with
Article&#160;XXVIII.<p> 6.    GATT&#160;1994 imposes no obligation on Members
benefiting from a reduction of duties consequent upon the formation of a
customs union, or an interim agreement leading to the formation of a customs
union, to provide compensatory adjustment to its constituents.<p> <i>Review
of Customs Unions and Free-Trade Areas</i><p> 7.    All notifications made
under paragraph&#160;7(a) of Article&#160;XXIV shall be examined by a working party in
the light of the relevant provisions of GATT&#160;1994 and of paragraph&#160;1 of
this Understanding. The working party shall submit a report to the Council
for Trade in Goods on its findings in this regard. The Council for Trade in
Goods may make such recommendations to Members as it deems appropriate.<p>
8.  In regard to interim agreements, the working party may in its report make
appropriate recommendations on the proposed time-frame and on measures
required to complete the formation of the customs union or <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000032000069"></a><a href="f.htm#_ICONOVEX_FREETRADEAREA"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>free-trade area.
It may if necessary provide for further review of the agreement.<p>9.
Members parties to an interim agreement shall notify substantial changes in
the plan and schedule included in that agreement to the Council for Trade in
Goods and, if so requested, the Council shall examine the changes.<p>10.
Should an interim agreement notified under paragraph 7(a) of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000032200024"></a><a href="index.htm#_ICONOVEX_ARTICLEXXIV"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Article XXIV not
include a plan and schedule, contrary to paragraph 5(c) of Article XXIV, the
working party shall in its report recommend such a plan and schedule.  The
parties shall not maintain or put into force, as the case may be, such
agreement if they are not prepared to modify it in accordance with these
recommendations. Provision shall be made for subsequent review of the
implementation of the recommendations.<p>11.    Customs unions and

<i></i><b><i>Article&#160;XXIV:12</b></i><p> 13.    Each Member is fully
responsible under GATT&#160;1994 for the observance of all provisions of

to it to ensure such observance by regional and local governments and

suspension of concessions or other obligations apply in cases where it has
not been possible to secure such observance.<p>15.    Each Member undertakes
to accord sympathetic consideration to and afford adequate opportunity for
consultation regarding any representations made by another Member concerning
measures affecting the operation of GATT&#160;1994 taken within the territory
of the former.

in "cyberspace" has always been a rather nebulous issue; this report
is one of the first attempts to apply legal precedents to 
it.</H3><H4>Septmeber, 1995</h4><hr>

                          PAUL, BISHOP,
<p>
                 SERVANT OF THE SERVANTS OF GOD
<p>
         TOGETHER WITH THE FATHERS OF THE SACRED COUNCIL
<p>


                     FOR EVERLASTING MEMORY
<p>


            DOGMATIC CONSTITUTION ON DIVINE REVELATION
<p>
                          (DEI VERBUM)

<p>



                            <h3>PREFACE</h3>
</center>


  1. Hearing the Word of God with reverence and proclaiming it with

faith, the sacred Synod takes its direction from these words of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000004800054"></a><a href="s.htm#_ICONOVEX_STJOHN"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>St

John: "We announce to you the eternal life which dwelt with the

Father and was made visible to us.  What we have seen and heard we

announce to you, so that you may have fellowship with us and our

common fellowship be with the Father and His <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000004800159"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CHRISTSONJESUS"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Son Jesus Christ" (1

John 1:2-3).  Therefore, following in the footsteps of the Council

of Trent and of the First Vatican Council, this present Council

wishes to set forth authentic doctrine on divine revelation and how

it is handed on, so that by hearing the message of salvation the

whole world may believe, by believing it may hope, and by hoping it

may love [1].

<p>
<center>


                            <h3>CHAPTER I

                        REVELATION ITSELF</h3>

</center>

  2. In His goodness and wisdom God chose to reveal Himself and to

make known to us the hidden purpose of His will (see Eph. 1:9) by

which through <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000005100069"></a><a href="v2-1.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000005100405"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ, the Word made flesh, man might in the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000005100090"></a><a href="v2-1.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000005500169"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Holy

Spirit have access to the Father and come to share in the divine

nature (see Eph. 2:18; 2 Peter 1:4).  Through this revelation,

therefore, the invisible God (see Col. 1:15; 1 Tim. 1:17) out of

the abundance of His love speaks to men as friends (see Ex. 33:11;

John 15:14-15) and lives among them (see Bar. 3:38), so that He may

invite and take them into fellowship with Himself.  This plan of

revelation is realized by deeds and words having an inner unity:

the deeds wrought by God in the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000005100303"></a><a href="m.htm#_ICONOVEX_MANIFESTHISTORYOFSALVATION"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>history of salvation manifest and

confirm the teaching and realities signified by the words, while

the words proclaim the deeds and clarify the mystery contained in

them.  By this revelation then, the deepest truth about God and the

salvation of man shines out for our sake in <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000005100405"></a><a href="v2-1.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000006000083"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ, who is both the

mediator and the fullness of all revelation [2].

<p>

  3. God, who through the Word creates all things (see John 1:3)

and keeps them in existence, gives men an enduring witness to

Himself in created realities (see Rom. 1:19-20).  Planning to make

known the way of heavenly salvation, He went further and from the

start manifested Himself to our first parents.  Then after their

fall His promise of redemption aroused in them the hope of being

saved (see Gen. 3:15) and from that time on He ceaselessly kept the

human race in His care, to give eternal life to those who

perseveringly do good in search of salvation (see Rom. 2:6-7).

Then, at the time He had appointed He called Abraham in order make

of him a great nation (see Gen. 12:2).  Through the patriarchs, and

after them through Moses and the prophets, He taught this people to

acknowledge Himself the one living and true God, provident father

and just judge, and to wait for the Saviour promised by Him, and in

this manner prepared the way for the Gospel down through the

centuries.

<p>

  4. Then, after speaking in many and varied ways through the

prophets, "now at last in these days God has spoken to us in His

Son" (Heb. 1:1-2).  For He sent His Son, the eternal Word, who

enlightens all men, so that He might dwell among men and tell them

of the innermost being of God (see John 1:1-18).  Jesus Christ,

therefore, the Word made flesh, was sent as "a man to men" [3].  He

"speaks the words of God" (John 3:34), and completes the work of

salvation which His Father gave to Him to do (see John 5:36, 17:4).

To see <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000005300246"></a><a href="v2-1.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000005300275"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Jesus is to see His Father (see John 14:9).  For this reason

<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000005300275"></a><a href="v2-1.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000008400406"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Jesus perfected revelation by fulfilling it through his whole work

of making Himself present and manifesting Himself: through His

words and deeds, His signs and wonders, but especially through His

death and glorious resurrection from the dead and final sending of

the Spirit of truth.  Moreover He confirmed with divine testimony

what revelation proclaimed, that God is with us to free us from the

darkness of sin and death, and to raise us up to life eternal.
<p>


  The Christian dispensation, therefore, as the new and definitive

covenant, will never pass away and we now await no further new

<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000005400050"></a><a href="p.htm#_ICONOVEX_PUBLICREVELATION"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>public revelation before the glorious manifestation of our Lord

Jesus Christ (see 1 Tim. 6:14 and Tit. 2:13).
<p>


  5. "The obedience of faith" (Rom. 16:26; see Rom. 1:5; 2 Cor.

10:5-6) "is to be given to God who reveals, an obedience by which

man commits his whole self freely to God, offering the full

submission of intellect and will to God who reveals" [4], and

freely assenting to the truth revealed by Him.  TO make this act of

faith, the grace of God and the interior help of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000005500169"></a><a href="v2-1.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000005500275"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Holy Spirit

must precede and assist, moving the heart and turning it to God,

opening the eyes of the mind and giving "joy and ease to everyone

in assenting to the truth and believing it" [5].  To bring about an

ever deeper understanding of revelation the same <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000005500275"></a><a href="v2-1.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000006000404"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Holy Spirit

constantly brings faith to completion by His gifts.
<p>


  6. Through divine revelation, God chose to show forth and

communicate Himself and the eternal decisions of His will

regarding the salvation of men.  That is to say, He chose to share

with them those divine treasures which totally transcend the

understanding of the human mind [6].

<p>

  As a sacred synod has affirmed, "God, the beginning and end of

all things, can be known with certainty from created reality by the

light of human reason" (See Rom. 1:20); but it teaches that it is

through His revelation "that those <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000005700099"></a><a href="r.htm#_ICONOVEX_RELIGIOUSTRUTHS"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>religious truths which are by

their nature accessible to human reason can be known by all men

with ease, with solid certitude and with no trace of error, even in

this present state of the human race" [7].
<p>


<center>

                           <h3>CHAPTER II

                  HANDING ON DIVINE REVELATION</h3>

</center>

  7. In His gracious goodness, God has seen to it that what He had

revealed for the salvation of all nations would abide perpetually

in its full integrity and be handed on to all generations.

Therefore <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000006000083"></a><a href="v2-1.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000006000227"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000006000088"></a><a href="l.htm#_ICONOVEX_LORDFULLREVELATIONOFSUPREMEGOD"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Lord in whom the full revelation of the

supreme God is brought to completion (see 2 Cor. 1:30; 3:15; 4:6),

commissioned the Apostles to preach to all men that Gospel which is

the source of all saving truth and moral teaching [1], and to

impart to them heavenly gifts.  This Gospel had been promised in

former times through the prophets, and <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000006000227"></a><a href="v2-1.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000006500158"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ Himself had fulfilled

it and promulgated it with His lips.  This commission was

faithfully fulfilled by the Apostles who, by their oral preaching,

by example, and by observances handed on what they had received

from the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000006000310"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CHRISTLIPSOF"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>lips of Christ, from living with Him, and from what He

did, or what they had learned through the prompting of the Holy

Spirit.  The commission was fulfilled, too, by those Apostles and

apostolic men who under the inspiration of the same <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000006000404"></a><a href="v2-1.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000006500169"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Holy Spirit

committed the message of salvation to writing [2].

<p>

  But in order to keep the Gospel forever whole and alive within

the Church, the Apostles left bishops as their successors, "handing

over" to them "the authority to teach in their own place" [3].

This sacred tradition, therefore, and <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000006100094"></a><a href="s.htm#_ICONOVEX_SACREDSCRIPTUREOFOLD"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Sacred Scripture of both the

Old and <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000006100110"></a><a href="n.htm#_ICONOVEX_NEWTESTAMENTS"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>New Testaments are like a mirror in which the pilgrim

Church on earth looks at God, from whom she has received

everything, until she is brought finally to see Him as He is, face

to face (see 1 John 3:2).


<p>
  8. And so the apostolic preaching, which is expressed in a

special way in the inspired books, was to be preserved by an

unending succession of preachers until the end of time.  Therefore

the Apostles, handing on what they themselves had received, warn

the faithful to hold fast to the traditions which they have learned

either by word of mouth or by letter (see 2 Thess. 2:15), and to

fight in defense of the faith handed on once and for all (see Jud.

3) [4].  Now what was handed on by the Apostles includes everything

which contributes toward the holiness of life and increase in faith

of the People of God; and hands on to all generations all that she

herself is, all that she believes.

<p>

  This tradition which comes from the Apostles develops in the

Church with the help of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000006300035"></a><a href="h.htm#_ICONOVEX_HOLYSPIRIT5"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Holy Spirit [5].  For there is a growth

in the understanding of the realities and the words which have been

made by believers, who treasure these things in their hearts (see

Luke 2:19, 51), through a penetrating understanding of the

spiritual realities which they experience, and through the

preaching of those who have received through episcopal succession

the sure gift of truth.  For as the centuries succeed one another,

the Church constantly moves forward toward the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000006300206"></a><a href="f.htm#_ICONOVEX_FULLNESSOFDIVINETRUTH"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>fullness of divine

truth until the words of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000006300224"></a><a href="g.htm#_ICONOVEX_GODREACH"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>God reach their complete fulfillment in

her.

<p>

  The words of the holy Fathers witness to the presence of this

living tradition, whose wealth is poured into the practice and life

of the believing and praying Church.  Through the same tradition

the Church's full canon of the sacred books is known, and the

sacred writings themselves are more profoundly understood and

unceasingly made active in her; and thus God, who spoke of old,

uninterruptedly converses with the bride of His beloved Son; and

the Holy Spirit, through whom the living <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000006400181"></a><a href="g.htm#_ICONOVEX_GOSPELVOICEOF"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>voice of the Gospel

resounds in the Church, and through her, in the world, leads unto

all truth those who believe and makes the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000006400235"></a><a href="w.htm#_ICONOVEX_WORDOFCHRISTDWELL"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Word of Christ dwell

abundantly in them (see Col. 3:16).

<p>

  9. Hence there exists a close connection and communication

between sacred tradition and sacred Scripture.  For both of them,

flowing from the same divine wellspring, in a certain way merge

into a unity and tend toward the same end.  For sacred Scripture is

the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000006500099"></a><a href="v2-1.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000006500147"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Word of God inasmuch as it is consigned to writing under the

inspiration of the divine Spirit, while sacred tradition takes the

and make it more widely known.  Consequently it is not from sacred

Scripture alone that the Church draws her certainty about

everything which has been revealed.  Therefore both sacred

tradition and sacred Scripture are to be accepted and venerated

with the same sense of loyalty and reverence [6].
<p>


  10. Sacred tradition and sacred <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000006600014"></a><a href="w.htm#_ICONOVEX_WORDOFGODSCRIPTUREFORMONESACREDDEPOSITOF"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Scripture form one sacred deposit

of the Word of God, committed to the Church.  Holding fast to this

deposit the entire holy people united with their shepherds remain

always steadfast in the teaching of the Apostles, in the common

life, in the breaking of the bread and in prayers (see Acts 8:42,

Greek text), so that holding to, practicing and professing the

heritage of the faith, it becomes on the part of the bishops and

faithful a single common effort [7].

<p>

  But the task of authentically interpreting the Word of God,

whether written or handed on [8], has been entrusted exclusively to

the living teaching office of the Church [9], whose authority is

exercised in the name of Jesus Christ.  This teaching office is not

above the Word of God, but serves it, teaching only what has been

handed on, listening to it devoutly, guarding it scrupulously and

explaining it faithfully in accord with a divine commission and

with the help of the Holy Spirit; it draws from this one deposit of

faith everything which it presents for belief as divinely revealed.
<p>


  It is clear, therefore, that sacred tradition, sacred Scripture

and the teaching authority of the Church, in accord with God's most

wise design, are so linked and joined together that one cannot

stand without the others, and that all together and each in its own

way under the action of the one <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000006800117"></a><a href="v2-1.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000007200041"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Holy Spirit contribute

                           <h3>CHAPTER III

                        SACRED SCRIPTURE,

            ITS INSPIRATION AND DIVINE INTERPRETATION</h3>
</center>


  11. Those divinely revealed realities which are contained and

presented in sacred Scripture have been committed to writing under

the inspiration of the Holy Spirit.  For holy mother Church,

relying on the belief of the Apostles (see John 20:31; 2 Tim. 3:16;

2 Peter 1:19-21; 3:15-16), holds that the books of both the Old and

New Testaments in their entirety, with all their parts, are sacred

and canonical because written under the inspiration of the Holy

Spirit, they have God as their author and have been handed on such

to the Church herself [1].  In composing the sacred books, God

chose men and while employed by Him [2] they made use of their

powers and abilities, so that with Him acting in them and through

them [3], they, as true authors, consigned to writing everything

and only those things which He wanted [4].

<p>

  Therefore since everything asserted by the inspired authors or

sacred writers must be held to be asserted by the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000007200041"></a><a href="v2-1.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000008400239"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Holy Spirit, it

follows that the books of Scripture must be acknowledged as

teaching solidly, faithfully and without error that truth which God

wanted put into the sacred writings [5] for the sake of our

salvation.  Therefore "all Scripture is divinely inspired and has

its use for teaching the truth and refuting error, for reformation

of manners and discipline in right living, so that the man who

belongs to God may be efficient and equipped for good work of every

kind" (2 Tim. 3:16-17, Greek text).

<p>

  12. However, since God speaks in sacred Scripture through men in

human fashion [6], the interpreter of sacred Scripture, in order to

see clearly what God wanted to communicate to us, should carefully

investigate what meaning the sacred writers really intended, and

what God wanted to manifest by means of their words.

<p>

  To search out the intention of the sacred writers, attention

should be given, among other things, to "literary norms."  For

truth is set forth and expressed differently in texts which are

variously historical, prophetic, poetic, or of other forms of

discourse.  The interpreter must investigate what meaning the

sacred writer intended to express and actually expressed in

particular circumstances by using contemporary <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000007400142"></a><a href="l.htm#_ICONOVEX_LITERARYFORMS"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>literary forms in

accordance with the situation of his own time and culture [7].  For

the correct understanding of what the sacred author wanted to

assert, due attention must be paid to the customary and

characteristic styles of feeling, speaking and narrating which

prevailed at the time of the sacred writer, and to the patterns men

normally employed at the period in their everyday dealings with one

another [8].

<p>

  But, since holy Scripture must be read and interpreted in the

same spirit in which it was written [9], no less serious attention

must be given to the content and unity of the whole Scripture if

the meaning of the sacred texts is to be correctly worked out.  The

living tradition of the whole Church must be taken into account

along with the harmony which exists between elements of the faith.

It is the task of exegetes to work according to these rules toward

a better understanding and explanation of the meaning of sacred

Scripture, so that through preparatory study the judgement of the

Church may mature.  For all of what has been said about the way of

interpreting Scripture is subject finally to the judgement of the

Church, which carries out the divine commission and ministry of

guarding and interpreting the Word of God [10].
<p>


  13. In sacred Scripture, therefore, while the truth and holiness

of God always remains intact, the marvelous "condescension" of

eternal wisdom is clearly shown, "that we may learn the gentle

kindness of God, which words cannot express, and how far He has

gone in adopting His language with thoughtful concern for our weak

human nature" [11].  For the words of God, expressed in human

language, have been made like human discourse, just as the word of

the eternal Father, when He took Himself the flesh of human

weakness, was in every way made like men.

His promises.  <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000007900081"></a><a href="f.htm#_ICONOVEX_FIRSTHE"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>First He entered into a covenant with Abraham (see

24:8).  To this people which He had acquired for Himself, He so

manifested Himself through words and deeds as the one true and

living God that <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000007900191"></a><a href="i.htm#_ICONOVEX_ISRAEL"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Israel came to know by experience the ways of God

with men.  Then, too, when God Himself spoke to them through the

mouth of the prophets, Israel daily gained a deeper and clearer

understanding of His ways and made them more widely known among the

nations (see Ps. 21:29; 95:1-3; Is. 2:1-4; Jer. 3:17).  The plan of

salvation foretold by the sacred authors, recounted and explained

by them, is found as the true <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000007900359"></a><a href="v2-1.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000009600018"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Word of God in the books of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000007900376"></a><a href="v2-1.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000008000145"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Old

Testament: these books, therefore, written under divine

inspiration, so that by steadfastness and the encouragement of the

Scriptures we might have hope" (Rom. 15:4).

<p>

  15. The principal purpose to which the plan of the old covenant

was directed was to prepare for the coming of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000008000046"></a><a href="v2-1.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000008100079"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ, the redeemer

its meaning through various types (see 1 Cor. 10:11).  Now the

books of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000008000145"></a><a href="o.htm#_ICONOVEX_OLDTESTAMENT"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Old Testament, in accordance with the state of mankind

before the time of salvation established by Christ, reveal to all

men the knowledge of God and of man and the ways in which God, just

and merciful, deals with men.  These books, though they also

contain some things which are incomplete and temporary,

nevertheless show us true divine <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000008000274"></a><a href="p.htm#_ICONOVEX_PEDAGOGY1"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>pedagogy [1].  These same books,

then, give expression to a lively sense of God, contain a store of

sublime teachings about God, sound wisdom about human life, and a

wonderful <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000008000346"></a><a href="t.htm#_ICONOVEX_TREASURYOFPRAYERSMYSTERYOFSALVATION"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>treasury of prayers, and in them the mystery of our

salvation is present in a hidden way.  Christians should receive

them with reverence.

<p>

  16. God, the inspirer and author of both Testaments, wisely

arranged that the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000008100032"></a><a href="v2-1.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000008400087"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>New Testament be hidden in the Old and that the

established the new covenant with His blood (see Luke 22:20; 1 Cor.

11:25), still the books of the Old Testament with all their parts,

caught up into the meaning of the proclamation of the Gospel [3],

acquire and show forth their full meaning in the New Testament (see

<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000008100193"></a><a href="v2-1.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000008900030"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Matt. 5:17; Luke 24:27; Rom. 16:25-26; 2 Cor. 3:14-16) and in turn

                        THE NEW TESTAMENT</h3>
</center>


  17. Word of God, which is the power of God for the salvation of

all who believe (see Rom. 1:16), is set forth and shows its power

in a most excellent way in the writings of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000008400087"></a><a href="v2-1.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000008800022"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>New Testament.  For

John 1:14).  <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000008400163"></a><a href="v2-1.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000008400410"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ established the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000008400170"></a><a href="k.htm#_ICONOVEX_KINGDOMOFGOD"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Kingdom of God on earth,

manifested His Father and Himself by deeds and words, and completed

His work by His death, resurrection and glorious ascension and by

the sending of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000008400239"></a><a href="v2-1.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000008400361"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Holy Spirit.  Having been lifted up from the

earth, He draws all men to Himself (see John 12:32, Greek text), He

who alone has the words of eternal life (see John 6:68).  This

mystery had not been manifested to other generations as it was now

revealed to His holy Apostles and prophets in the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000008400361"></a><a href="v2-1.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000009500029"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Holy Spirit (see

Eph. 3:4-6, Greek text), so that they might preach the Gospel, stir

up faith in <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000008400406"></a><a href="j.htm#_ICONOVEX_JESUS"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Jesus, <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000008400410"></a><a href="v2-1.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000009700054"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ and Lord, and gather together the Church.

Now the writings of the New Testament stand as a perpetual and

divine witness to these realities.


<p>
  18. It is common knowledge that among all the Scriptures, even

those of the New Testament, the Gospels have a special preeminence,

and rightly so, for they are the principal witness for the life and

teaching of the Incarnate Word, our Saviour.

<p>

  The Church has always and everywhere held and continues to hold

that the four <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000008600031"></a><a href="g.htm#_ICONOVEX_GOSPELSOFAPOSTOLICORIGIN"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Gospels are of apostolic origin.  For what the

Apostles preached in fulfillment of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000008600062"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CHRISTCOMMISSIONOF"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>commission of Christ,

afterwards they themselves and apostolic men, under the inspiration

of the divine Spirit, handed on to us in writing: the foundation of

the faith, namely, the fourfold Gospel, according to Matthew, Mark,

Luke and John [1].

<p>

  19. <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000008700005"></a><a href="h.htm#_ICONOVEX_HOLYMOTHERCHURCH"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Holy Mother Church has firmly and with absolute constancy

held, and continues to hold, that the four Gospels just named,

whose <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000008700053"></a><a href="h.htm#_ICONOVEX_HISTORICALCHARACTER"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>historical character the Church unhesitatingly asserts,

faithfully hand on what Jesus Christ, while living among men,

really did and taught for their eternal salvation until the day He

was taken up into heaven (see Acts 1:1-2).  Indeed, after the

ascension of the Lord the Apostles handed on to their <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000008700163"></a><a href="h.htm#_ICONOVEX_HEARERS"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>hearers what

He had said and done.  This they did with that clearer

understanding which they enjoyed [3] after they had been instructed

by the glorious events of Christ's life and taught by the light of

the Spirit of truth [2].  The sacred authors wrote four Gospels,

selecting some things from the many which had bee handed on by word

of mouth or in writing, reducing some of them to a synthesis,

explaining some things in view of the situation of their churches,

and preserving the form of proclamation but always in such fashion

that they told us the honest truth about <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000008700387"></a><a href="j.htm#_ICONOVEX_JESUS4"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Jesus [4].  For their

intention in writing was that either from their own memory and

recollections, or from the witness of those who "themselves from

the beginning were eyewitnesses and ministers of the Word" we might

know "the truth" concerning those matters about which we have been

instructed (see Luke 1:2-4).

<p>

  20. Besides the four Gospels, the canon of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000008800022"></a><a href="n.htm#_ICONOVEX_NEWTESTAMENT"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>New Testament also

contains the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000008800034"></a><a href="s.htm#_ICONOVEX_STPAULEPISTLESOF"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>epistles of St. Paul and other apostolic writings,

composed under the inspiration of the Holy Spirit, by which

according to the wise plan of God, those matters which concern

Christ the Lord are confirmed, His true teaching is more and more

preached, the story is told of the beginnings of the Church and its

marvelous growth, and its glorious fulfillment is foretold.

<p>

  For the Lord Jesus was with His Apostles as He had promised (see

<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000008900030"></a><a href="m.htm#_ICONOVEX_MATT"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Matt. 28:2)) and sent them the advocate Spirit who would lead them

into the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000008900063"></a><a href="f.htm#_ICONOVEX_FULLNESSOFTRUTH"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>fullness of truth (see John 16:13).

                           <h3>CHAPTER VI

                        SACRED SCRIPTURE

                    IN THE LIFE OF THE CHURCH</h3>
 </center>
<p>

  21. The Church has always venerated the Scriptures just as she

venerates the body of the Lord, since, especially in sacred

liturgy, she unceasingly receives and offers to the faithful the

bread of life from the table both of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000009300087"></a><a href="g.htm#_ICONOVEX_GODSWORD"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>God's Word and of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000009300096"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CHRISTSBODY"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ's

Body.  She has always maintained them, and continues to do so,

together with sacred tradition, as the supreme rule of faith,

since, as inspired by God and committed once and for all to

writing, they impart the Word of God Himself without change, and

make the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000009300204"></a><a href="h.htm#_ICONOVEX_HOLYSPIRITVOICEOF"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>voice of the Holy Spirit resound in the words of the

prophets and Apostles.  Therefore, like the Christian religion

itself, all the preaching of the Church must be nourished and

regulated by sacred Scripture.  For in the sacred books, the Father

who is in heaven meets His children with great love and speaks with

them; and the force and power in the word of God is so great that

it stands as the support and energy of the Church, the strength of

faith for her sons, the food of the soul, the pure and everlasting

source of spiritual life.  Consequently these words are perfectly

applicable to sacred Scripture: "For the word of God is living and

active" (Heb. 4:12) and "it has power to build you up and give you

your heritage among all those who are sanctified" (Acts 20:32; see

1 Thess. 2:13).

<p>

  22. Easy access to sacred Scripture should be provided for all

the Christian faithful.  That is why the Church from the very

beginning accepted as her own that very ancient <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000009400066"></a><a href="o.htm#_ICONOVEX_OLDTESTAMENTGREEKTRANSLATIONOF"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Greek translation

of the Old Testament which is called the Septuagint; and she has

always given a place of honor to other <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000009400114"></a><a href="e.htm#_ICONOVEX_EASTERNTRANSLATIONS"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Eastern translations and

But since the Word of God should be accessible at all times, the

Church by her authority and with maternal concern sees to it that

suitable and correct translations are made into different

languages, especially from the original texts of the sacred books.

And should the opportunity arise and the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000009400253"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CHURCHAUTHORITIES"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Church authorities

approve, if these translations are produced in cooperation with the

separated brethren as well, all Christians will be able to use

them.

<p>

  23. The bride of the Incarnate Word, the Church taught by the

<a name="_ICONOVEX_00000009500029"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000012500108"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Holy Spirit, is concerned to move ahead toward a deeper

understanding of the sacred Scriptures so that she may increasingly

feed her sons with the divine words.  Therefore, she also

of sacred theology, working diligently together and using

appropriate means, should devote their energies, under the watchful

as many ministers of the divine word as possible will be able

effectively to provide nourishment of the Scriptures for the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000009500283"></a><a href="p.htm#_ICONOVEX_PEOPLEOFGOD"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>People

of God, to enlighten their minds , strengthen their wills and set

men's hearts on fire with the love of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000009500329"></a><a href="g.htm#_ICONOVEX_GOD1"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>God [1].  The sacred Synod

encourages the sons of the Church and Biblical scholars to continue

energetically, following the mind of the Church, with the work they

have so well begun, with a constant renewal of vigor [2].

<p>

  24. Sacred <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000009600007"></a><a href="t.htm#_ICONOVEX_THEOLOGYRESTS"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>theology rests on the written <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000009600018"></a><a href="v2-1.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000009600122"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Word of God, together

with sacred tradition, as its primary and perpetual foundation.  By

scrutinizing in the light of faith all truth stored up in the

mystery of Christ, <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000009600084"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000018100007"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>theology is most powerfully strengthened and

constantly rejuvenated by that Word.  For the sacred Scriptures

contain the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000009600122"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000020000108"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Word of God and since they are inspired really are the

Word of God; and so the study of the sacred page is, as it were,

the soul of sacred <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000009600188"></a><a href="t.htm#_ICONOVEX_THEOLOGY3"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>theology [3].  By the same word of Scripture the

ministry of the Word also, that is, pastoral preaching, catechetics

and all Christian instruction, in which the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000009600250"></a><a href="l.htm#_ICONOVEX_LITURGICALHOMILY"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>liturgical homily must

hold the foremost place, is nourished in a healthy way and

flourishes in a holy way.
<p>


  25. Therefore, all the clergy must hold fast to the sacred

Scriptures through diligent sacred reading and careful study,

especially the priests of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000009700054"></a><a href="v2-1.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000010200065"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ and others, such as deacons and

catechists whoa re legitimately active in the ministry of the Word.

This is to be done so that none of them will become "an empty

preacher of the word of God outwardly, who is not a listener to it

inwardly" [4] since they must share the abundant wealth of the

divine Word with the faithful committed to them, especially in the

sacred liturgy.  The sacred Synod also earnestly and especially

urges all the Christian faithful, especially Religious, to learn by

frequent <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000009700250"></a><a href="s.htm#_ICONOVEX_SCRIPTURESREADINGOFDIVINE"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>reading of the divine Scriptures the "excellent knowledge

of Jesus Christ" (Phil. 3:8). "For ignorance of the Scriptures is

ignorance of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000009700302"></a><a href="c.htm#_ICONOVEX_CHRIST5"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Christ" [5].  Therefore, they should gladly put

themselves in touch with the sacred text itself, whether it be

through the liturgy, rich in the divine Word or through devotional

reading, or through instructions suitable for the purpose and other

aids which, in our time with approval and active support of the

shepherds of the Church, are commendably spread everywhere.  And

let them remember that prayer should accompany the reading of

sacred Scripture, so that God and man may talk together; for "we

speak to Him when we pray; we hear Him when we read the divine

saying" [6].

<p>

  It devolves on sacred bishops "who have the apostolic teaching"

[7] to give the faithful entrusted to them suitable instruction in

the right use of the divine books, especially the New Testament and

above all the Gospels.  This can be done through translations of

the sacred texts, which are to be provided with the necessary and

really adequate explanations so that the children of the Church may

safely and profitably become conversant with the sacred Scriptures

and be penetrated with their spirit.


<p>
  Furthermore, editions of the sacred Scriptures, provided

with suitable footnotes, should be prepared also for the sue of non-

Christians and adapted to their situation.  Both <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000009900060"></a><a href="p.htm#_ICONOVEX_PASTORSOFSOULS"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>pastors of souls

and Christians generally should see to the wide distribution of

these in one way or another.


<p>
  26. In this way, therefore, through the reading and study of the

sacred books "the word of God may spread rapidly and be glorified"

(2 Thess. 3;1) and the treasure of revelation, entrusted to the

Church, may more and more fill the hearts of men.  Just as the life

of the Church is strengthened through more frequent celebration of

the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000010000139"></a><a href="v2-3.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000022500068"><img src="books5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Eucharistic mystery, similarly we may hope for a new stimulus

for the life of the Spirit from a growing reverence for the word of

God, which "lasts forever" (Is. 40:8; see 1 Peter 1:23-25).

<p>
Ministers salute the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000005100007"></a><a href="h.htm#_ICONOVEX_HISTORICACHIEVEMENT"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>historic achievement represented by the conclusion of

In
particular, they welcome:  -     the stronger and clearer legal framework
    they have adopted for the conduct of international trade, including a
more effective and reliable dispute settlement mechanism,<p> -     the global
reduction by 40 per cent of tariffs and wider <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000005200025"></a><a href="m.htm#_ICONOVEX_MARKETOPENINGAGREEMENTS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>market-opening agreements on

of a multilateral framework of disciplines for trade in services and for the
protection of trade-related intellectual property rights, as well as the
reinforced multilateral trade provisions in agriculture and in textiles and
clothing.<p> Ministers affirm that the establishment of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000005400015"></a><a href="w.htm#_ICONOVEX_WORLDTRADEORGANIZATIONUSHERS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>World Trade

reflecting the widespread desire to operate in a fairer and more open
multilateral trading system for the benefit and welfare of their peoples.
Ministers express their determination to resist protectionist pressures of
all kinds. They believe that the trade liberalization and strengthened rules
achieved in the Uruguay Round will lead to a progressively more open world
trading environment. Ministers undertake, with immediate effect and until the
entry into force of the WTO, not to take any <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000005400203"></a><a href="08.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000028200093"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>trade measures that would
undermine or adversely affect the results of the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000005400228"></a><a href="u.htm#_ICONOVEX_URUGUAYROUNDNEGOTIATIONS"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>Uruguay Round negotiations
or their implementation.  Ministers confirm their resolution to strive for
greater global coherence of policies in the fields of trade, money and
finance, including cooperation between the <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000005400292"></a><a href="01.htm#_ICONOVEX_00000005400744"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>WTO, the IMF and the World Bank
for that purpose.  Ministers welcome the fact that participation in the
Uruguay Round was considerably wider than in any previous multilateral <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000005400351"></a><a href="t.htm#_ICONOVEX_TRADENEGOTIATION"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>trade
negotiation and, in particular, that developing countries played  a notably
active role in it. This has marked a historic step towards a more balanced and
integrated global trade partnership. Ministers note that during the period
these negotiations were underway significant measures of <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000005400442"></a><a href="e.htm#_ICONOVEX_ECONOMICREFORM"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>economic reform and

and formerly centrally planned economies.  Ministers recall that the results
of the negotiations embody provisions conferring differential and more
favorable treatment for developing economies, including special attention to
the particular situation of least-developed countries. Ministers recognize
the importance of the implementation of these provisions for the
least-developed countries and declare their intention to continue to assist
and facilitate the expansion of their trade and <a name="_ICONOVEX_00000005400599"></a><a href="i.htm#_ICONOVEX_INVESTMENTOPPORTUNITIES"><img src="default5.gif" alt="@" border="0"></a>investment opportunities.

least-developed countries as well as on the net food-importing developing
countries, with a view to fostering positive measures to enable them to
