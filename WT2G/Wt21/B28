<p>

<font size=+3>I</font>n 1888, the U.S. Supreme Court declared that marriage 
is &quot;the foundation of the family and of society, without which there 
would be neither civilization nor progress.&quot;

<p>

Because of its crucial role, marriage has a special status within
the culture and the law.  Its essence -- the joining of one man
and one woman in an exclusive legal, sexual, economic and spiritual
bond with the procreation of children as a desirable and common
result -- had not been seriously challenged for thousands of years.

<p>

<center><h3>Hawaiian Havoc</h3></center>

<p>

Now, a tiny segment of a tiny fraction of the population -- the
homosexual activist community -- is on the verge of radically
redefining marriage and family.  If they succeed, all distinctions
based on sex may fall, and the worst aspects of the rejected Equal
Rights Amendment will be imposed.  Homosexuals will gain the &quot;right&quot;
to adopt children; schoolchildren will be taught that homosexual
sex is the equivalent of marital love between husband and wife;
businesses will be forced to subsidize homosexual relationships;
churches will be pushed outside the civil law; and government
power will be wielded against anyone who holds the biblical view
of homosexuality.

<p>

In August, a Hawaiian court is expected to strike down that state's
law limiting marriage to &quot;one man and one woman.&quot;  The
case, <i>Baehr v. Lewin,</i> was brought by three same-sex couples
who charged the state with &quot;discrimination&quot; for not
granting them marriage licenses.  Despite widespread opposition
within Hawaii (recent polls show that 71% of Hawaiians oppose
same-sex &quot;marriage&quot;), homosexual activists hope to impose
their agenda through compliant courts.

<p>

Because the U.S. Constitution's Full Faith and Credit Clause calls
for states to honor each other's laws, homosexuals are planning
to fly to Hawaii, &quot;marry,&quot; and return to the mainland
to claim &quot;married&quot; status.  About 25 states now have
efforts underway to protect marriage, and three of them -- Hawaii,
Utah and South Dakota -- have enacted new laws protecting marriage.

<p>

In Washington, a bill is being drafted to bind the federal government
to a &quot;one-man, one-woman&quot; definition of marriage.  Tentatively
titled the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA), the bill would protect
the military, Social Security,  and all federal agencies from
radical redefinition of wedlock.

<p>

<center><h3>Full Court Press</h3></center>

<p>

The marriage battle is being fought while several other key cases
involving homosexuality are being decided in the nation's courts.
The Supreme Court is expected to rule soon in a key Colorado
case in which voters had passed a constitutional amendment to
bar any city or county from enacting special rights based on sexual
orientation.  About a dozen cases challenging the military's ban
on homosexuality are being heard around the nation.

<p>

In Georgia, a federal appeals court ruled in favor of a lesbian
fired from her job at the state attorney general's office after
she announced that she had  &quot;married&quot; her lover.  Bear
in mind that the attorney general is required to defend Georgia's
sodomy law.  In  New York, the state's high court opened adoption
proceedings to homosexual couples and unmarried heterosexual couples,
thus devaluing marriage and jeopardizing children.

<center><i><font size=+2>
TWENTY-FIVE STATES MOVE TO<br>
PROTECT MARRIAGE.
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

The pattern is clear:  homosexual activists are using the courts
to get what they cannot achieve through democracy.  But the courts
do not operate in a vacuum.  U.S. Supreme Court justices noted
that one factor that affected the <i>Casey</i> decision upholding
<i>Roe v. Wade</i> was the court's public image.  Amherst legal
scholar Hadley Arkes notes that if Americans boldly defend marriage,
the courts may hesitate to radically redefine it.  If the states
pass marriage protection bills, and Congress enacts DOMA, the
judicial assault on traditional morality could falter.

<p>

<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>

<p>

Call your Congressman and Senators and ask that they cosponsor
the coming Defense of Marriage Act.  The Capitol Hill switchboard
is 202-225-3121.

<p>

Call state legislators and ask them to support your state's marriage
protection bill, or if there isn't yet such a bill, ask them to
sponsor one.

<p>

Educate yourself about the threat to marriage today -- from mistaken
public policies and cultural decay.  Consult the enclosed reply
card for information on new resources that defend this embattled,
but essential institution.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>Border Order.</b>  H.R. 2202 by Rep. Lamar Smith (R-Tex.),
and two competing Senate bills, Alan Simpson's (R-Wyo.) S. 1394
and Spencer Abraham's (R-Mich.) S. 1535, each seek to reform immigration
policy.  FRC deplores nativist rhetoric and supports provisions
which reflect the following principles:  (1) Illegal immigration
must be halted; America should not reward those whose first act
in this country is to break the law, and (2) America must remain
a country that welcomes legal immigrants, with appropriate safeguards
for our national sovereignty.

<p>

<b>Red Letter.</b> President Clinton went on record in a Feb.
28 letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Orrin Hatch (R-Utah),
saying he will veto the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act when it
reaches his desk.  Mr. Clinton claims the legislation is unacceptable
because it does not protect a woman's life or &quot;health.&quot;
FRC responded by saying, &quot;That President Clinton would veto
a ban on a procedure characterized as four-fifths infanticide
and one-fifth abortion shows his clear disregard for the value
of human life.&quot;

<p><a name="gamble">

<b>Gambling Gambit.</b> On March 5, the House of Representatives
passed legislation to establish the National Gambling Impact and
Policy Commission.  The nine-member commission would conduct a
two-year study and report its findings to states, Congress and
the president. &quot;[T]his legislation creates no new regulations
and imposes no new mandates on gambling or state and local governments,&quot;
said its sponsor, Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.).  The sole purpose,
he added, is to help communities make informed decisions on gambling
questions.  Senate consideration is next.

<p>

<b>Healthy Debate.</b> On April 18-19 the Senate will debate
a health insurance reform bill sponsored by Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.)
and Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.).  The bill, which President Clinton
supports, does <I>not</I> contain medical savings accounts (MSA's),
and would give Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala
the power to ensure that state health insurance plans conform
with the &quot;goals&quot; of the bill, including &quot;comprehensive
coverage.&quot;  A related House bill, sponsored by Rep. Dennis
Hastert (R-Ill.), is expected to contain MSA's, no new taxes,
and no defined comprehensive benefits package.

<p>

<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Teens and AIDS.</b> A new study released by the White House
advocates more efforts to reduce the spread of AIDS among teenagers.
Twenty-five percent of Americans infected with AIDS each year
are under the age of 20.  The report calls for more explicit AIDS
education and HIV testing without parental notice.  Meanwhile,
a House-Senate conference committee on the Ryan White Care Act
reauthorization is deadlocked over an amendment by Reps. Tom Coburn,
M.D. (R-Okla.) and Gary Ackerman (D-N.Y.) to require AIDS testing
of newborns.  The Clinton administration opposes the requirement.
FRC supports it.

<p><a name="prayer">

<b>Wing and a Prayer.</b> The Department of Transportation is
at odds with a DOT employees' group over whether a prayer and
fellowship group can label homosexual behavior a sin.  The 50-member
Christian organization has waited more than 14 months for official
status because it rejects a &quot;nondiscrimination&quot; clause
that includes sexual orientation.  Group leaders say they welcome
homosexuals, but cannot agree to give them leadership positions
or sanction actions they consider sinful.  Meanwhile, DOT has
already given preferential treatment to GLOBE, the Gay, Lesbian
or Bisexual Employees group.

<p>

<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Court-Assisted Suicide.</b> The Ninth U.S. Circuit Court of
Appeals ruled March 7 that Washington state's ban on assisted
suicide is unconstitutional.  The next day, a Michigan jury acquitted
Dr. Jack Kevorkian on charges of assisting in the suicide of two
individuals, the second time he has been exonerated.  Judge Stephen
Reinhardt, writing for the Ninth Circuit's 8-3 majority, directly
linked the ruling with <i>Roe v. Wade</i>, the 1973 case that
established abortion on demand.  Decision by Washington state
officials on an appeal to the U.S. Supreme Court is pending.

<p>

<b>Damsels in Distress.</b> A new Population Reference Bureau
study confirms what Massachusetts and California have already
found:  about two-thirds of births to teenage girls are fathered
by men age 20 or older.  In addition, a 1994 Alan Guttmacher Institute
report found that six of 10 girls who had sex before age 15 were
coerced by males an average of six years their senior.  As more
girls grow up without fathers to protect their honor, their search
for a father figure leaves them more vulnerable to predatory males.

<p>

<b>Grave But Stable?</b> Another Population Reference Bureau
report reveals both positive and negative trends among U.S. families.
Good news is that the divorce rate has leveled off, the growth
rate of single-parent families has been halved, and more two-parent
families with children have formed. However, the report also shows
that the U.S. still has the world's highest divorce rate and that
single-parent families are increasing three percent annually.
Census reports such as these sometimes reflect only a change in
demographics, not a genuine attitudinal shift.

<h3>FRC Soldiers On</h3>

<p>

FRC's Military Readiness Project (MRP) was present on March 4
in Seattle, Washington when the ACLU and the Clinton Justice Department
once again misrepresented the military's homosexual law.  In the
case of <i>Philips v. Perry</i> which involves a homosexual sailor
who admitted to misconduct, Justice's attorney told a three-judge
appeals court panel that what the military has is a &quot;homosexual
accommodation law.&quot;  In fact, it has always had an exclusion
policy.

<p>

The government cited as evidence the fiction that some homosexual
service members have successfully convinced administrative boards
that being homosexual does not mean that they will engage in
illicit conduct.  At the hearing the ACLU asserted that homosexuals
can legally serve, and then argued that the <i>Philips</i> case
was really about discrimination.  Unbelievably, it took a judge
(a Bush-appointee) to highlight the fact that Philips had admitted
to homosexual sex with &quot;a dozen&quot; men.

<p>

The MRP has participated in five federal appeals court cases.
Most recently, on March 15, it joined the <i>Richtenberg v. Perry</i>
case which involves an Air Force captain who declared himself
a homosexual.  Like the others, he seeks to invalidate the law
and the Pentagon's regulations.  This case may present another
opportunity for the MRP to make oral arguments, as it did last
December in <i>Thomasson v. Perry</i>. The MRP will defend the
underlying law, and the Clinton Justice Department will defend
the faulty &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; implementing regulations.

<p>

Two cases soon to be decided, <i>Abel v. U.S.A.</i> and <i>Thomasson</i>,
are competing for the attention of the Supreme Court.  Decisions
in both cases are expected this spring, and one of them will be
appealed to the high court this summer with oral arguments likely
during the court's next term.

<p>

Meanwhile, a new administration could discard Clinton's faulty
&quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell&quot; regulations and require the
Justice Department to defend the law before the Supreme Court.
In any event, major news on this issue is only months away.

<h3>Rx for the Drug War</h3>

<p>

On Feb. 15, FRC hosted a national drug abuse prevention strategy
meeting.  Nationally known experts from diverse backgrounds and
regions came together to develop an eight-part action plan.  The
participants agreed:  the drug scourge is getting worse, and something
must be done to reignite grass-roots anti-drug efforts.

<p>

The strategy has a two-part prevention focus:  use of mind/mood-altering
drugs is dangerous to the individual and society, and comprehensive
community-based prevention is the most viable solution to the
drug crisis.

<p>

Drug education must begin at home.  The strategy calls for drug
education resources to be tied to accountability.  Drug abuse
messages must be congruent and consistently broadcast through
every educational setting (homes, schools, workplaces, communities
and media).

<p>

Law enforcement must identify all users and impose consequences
on abuse.  It must also create systematic accountability for funding
and success rates.  Key to the strategy is leadership.  Leaders
at all levels must speak clearly and serve as role models.

<p>

Grass-roots citizen action is vital.  Accountability for drug
abuse prevention must be locally based, and citizen groups must
have power over funds to make their programs work.  The media
must stop glamorizing drugs and provide truthful alternative messages.
The strategy calls for an annual report on media handling of
the drug prevention message.

<p>

Treatment for abusers should be delivered at the point of need
with accountability.  This includes providing appropriate long-term
treatment.  Finally, the strategy calls for reallocating available
drug funds with strict standards.  This year the federal government
will spread $13 billion across 140 programs with little accountability.

<p>

FRC wants the strategy to influence each political party's presidential
platform and all future drug-related legislation.   It provides
a federal model for the drug war that focuses the government on
supply interdiction and passes responsibility and fiscal authority
for prevention and treatment to local communities.

<p>

FRC's short-term goal is to have drug abuse recognized as a national
crisis. America must aim to cut current abuse levels at least
in half by the year 2000.  The long-term goal is the eradication
of drug abuse.

<font size=+2><b><i>Bashers, Bombers and Bigots</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer
</center>

<p>

Several years ago, radical homosexual members of the ACT-UP group
invaded St. Patrick's Cathedral in New York City and desecrated
the Host.  Millions of Christians around the world believe that
Christ is really present in the sacrament of communion.  America
has had, tragically, anti-Catholic riots in its history.  &quot;Know
Nothing&quot; mobs even dumped one of the stones intended for
the Washington Monument into the Potomac because it had been generously
donated by the pope.  But Act-Up's church invasion set a new low
for efforts to offend the deeply held religious beliefs of a whole
community.

<p>

In suburban Washington, D.C., the Montrose Baptist Church has
twice been the site of suspicious fires.  No one has been charged
with arson, but church members have cited the congregation's strong
pro-life stance and its high profile during the 1992 Maryland
abortion referendum as making it a likely target in liberal Montgomery
County.

<p>

Now we have even more disturbing evidence of hatred in action.
At least 25 black churches have been hit in a new wave of arson
in California and a number of southern states. This form of bigotry
cannot be tolerated. That is why I have joined with a group of
black, Jewish, Catholic and evangelical Christian leaders to call
for prompt hearings by the Judiciary Committees of the House and
Senate.

<p>

The current wave of church bombings began on April 4, 1993.  That
was the 25th anniversary of the assassination of Dr. Martin Luther
King, Jr.  The pace of these attacks has picked up since January,
1995.  There is evidence of a pattern here, a pattern that suggests
a conspiracy to violate our civil rights laws. There is every
reason for the federal government to act.

<p>

It does not matter what motivates the haters.  Whether it is a
<i>Hamas</i> suicide bomber who catches Bus No. 18 in Jerusalem,
or a racist who wants to terrorize black Christians peacefully
worshipping here at home, terrorism is evil and we must mobilize
against it.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center>
<i><font size=+2>WE MUST MOBILIZE AGAINST<br>
TERRORISM.</font></i>
</center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

This is also a good time to reassert the real meaning of the First
Amendment. The right of the people to the &quot;free exercise&quot;
of religion is a precious one, bought with the blood of patriots
and martyrs.  Millions of our American ancestors came to this
country seeking this right above all others.

<p>

It does not help the cause of religious tolerance when the federal
government itself treats religion as a suspect classification.
Christian employees of the Federal Aviation Administration are
still finding their request to start a prayer group stiff-armed
by bureaucrats who welcome gay activist groups (see 
<a href="#news"><I>Newswatch</I></a>).

<p>

Moreover, the Clinton administration has recently moved to squelch
tuition assistance which has been provided since 1929 for Americans
serving in Ecuador.  The parents who chose the Alliance Academy,
a Christian school, were evidently pleased with the quality of
education provided and the spiritual and moral guidance their
children received there.  But now, with the opening of a completely
secular private school in Ecuador's capital, Quito, parents have
been told to enroll their kids in this private school or forego
the assistance the U.S. government has long provided.

<p>

Anti-Semitism, anti-Catholicism and racism have no place in our
sweet land of liberty. Nor does the disdainful view of too many
that religion itself is to be discouraged. As Irving Kristol has
wisely noted:  &quot;The real danger is not from a revived Christianity...but
from an upsurge of antibiblical barbarism that will challenge
Christianity, Judaism and Western Civilization together.&quot;
To which, I say: &quot;Amen!&quot;

<center><h1>A NATION MOURNS</h1></center>

<p>

<font size=+3>O</font>n April 10, President Bill Clinton vetoed the 
Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act (PBA).  With a stroke of his pen, Clinton 
continued to authorize abortion on demand, leaving to the abortionist 
the gruesome method of his choice.

<p>

And gruesome it is. In a partial-birth abortion, a child between
five and nine months of gestation is delivered -- all but the head --
and living brain tissue is vacuumed out after the child is stabbed
at the base of the skull with surgical scissors.  A top physician
testified before Congress that babies subjected to this process
most certainly feel pain.  Strangely, if a &quot;mistake&quot;
were made and the child slipped out of the mother, he would be
legally human and fully protected from being killed.

<p>

<center><h3>Broad Support</h3></center>

<p>

The brutality of this technique seemed capable of delivering a
first -- the first federal restriction of abortion since the 1973
<I>Roe v. Wade</I> Supreme Court decision.  In fact, Rep. Patricia
Schroeder (D-Colo.) fought to keep pictorials of the procedure
off the House floor, but the pro-life side carried the day, winning
the votes of House and Senate members who had never cast a pro-life
vote in their careers.  Winning margins in the House were 288-139
and 286-129, and in the Senate, 54-44.

<p>

When the bill went to the White House on Good Friday, it included
an exception allowing the procedure if necessary to save a mother
whose life &quot;is endangered by a physical disorder, illness
or injury.&quot;  The bill also received important symbolic support.
Many national leaders called for the President to approve it,
including liberal columnists and prominent clergy.  Several Catholic
bishops, including two cardinals, endured a soaking rain on April
1 to pray outside the White House.

<p>

When Bill Clinton vetoed the bill, beside him stood five women
who had experienced troubled pregnancies.  The setting was designed
to suggest that PBA had been the only answer to their trauma.

<p>

But it was not even clear that the women beside him had undergone
PBA, according to transcripts of the President's remarks and
media accounts.  The President said, &quot;The emotional power
of the description of the procedure -- which I might add did not
cover the procedure these women had ... was so great ...&quot;
He also cited the bill's omission of an exception for the &quot;health&quot;
of the mother -- a term defined so broadly by the courts that, PBA
supporters say, it means unrestricted abortion.

<p>

<center><h3>Feeling Pain</h3></center>

<p>

Many myths have been reported as fact in the PBA debate.  Among
the cruelest is that anesthesia kills the baby before the procedure
is carried out, a falsehood that, dangerously, only scares many
pregnant mothers needing legitimate surgery.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>
MANY MYTHS HAVE BEEN<br>
REPORTED AS FACT.
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

The decision on whether to attempt an override of the President's
veto rests first with the House leadership.  Since PBA began in
the House, the vetoed bill has been returned there.  If two-thirds
of the House votes to override the veto (a margin previously achieved),
then it would go to the Senate. The initial vote in the Senate
was short of the two-thirds margin needed for adoption.

<p>

The veto comes at a time when recent polls show that more than
two-thirds of Americans support either restrictions on abortion
or an end to PBA altogether.

<p>

&quot;I am among the majority of Americans who know that our nation
has more to offer than abortion,&quot; Family Research Council
President Gary L. Bauer said.  &quot;This is a time for us to
pray for the return of a respect for life, born out of our Judeo-Christian
heritage and honored by our nation's founders.  Our future depends
on it.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>

<p>

Write your member of Congress and two senators and urge them to
continue to press for enactment of the PBA.  Write or call FRC
(1-800-225-4008) and obtain a copy of our free packet (PK033) 
describing the truth about PBA's and the need
for federal legislation.  Thomas Jefferson once said that he trembled
for his country when he reflected that God is just.  A nation
that will not protect children (and mothers) at the very threshold
of birth has reason to tremble -- and to mourn.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>Omnibus Riders.</b> A new omnibus spending bill (H.R. 3019)
may include several pro-family provisions.  The Coats amendment,
which passed the Senate 63-37, would protect medical schools from
losing federal funds if they ignore an abortion mandate issued
by the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education. 
The mandate requires medical students specializing in obstetrics
to be trained in performing elective abortions.  House and Senate
conferees on the bill are also expected to maintain restrictions
on District of Columbia abortion funding and on international
population assistance to groups that perform elective abortions.

<p>

<b>Health Savings.</b> The House recently passed a health reform
bill (H.R. 3103) by a vote of 267-151.  FRC supported the bill,
which includes 100 percent tax-free medical savings accounts for
families and individuals.  MSA's allow working families to choose
their own doctors and make their own health care spending decisions.
An amendment by Sen. Robert Dole to include MSA's in the Senate
bill, cosponsored by Nancy Kassebaum (R-Kan.) and Ted Kennedy
(D-Mass.), was defeated, 52-46, under a veto threat from President
Clinton if MSA's were adopted.

<p>

<b>Et Tu, Newt?</b> House Speaker Newt Gingrich gave a speech
on March 24 endorsing a candlelight AIDS march that benefits pro-homosexual
organizations. Among them are the Whitman-Walker Clinic, which
treats AIDS victims but also runs homosexual activist workshops,
promotes lesbian parenting, and places &quot;safe sex&quot; ads
in a Washington homosexual newspaper that promotes strip clubs
and bathhouses.  The newspaper noted that Gingrich credited Rep.
Steve Gunderson (R-Wis.) for asking him to publicize the march.
Gingrich also credited Gunderson's homosexual partner.

<p>

<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>

<p><a name="fda">

<b>Rubber Stamp.</b> After experimenting on 2,100 pregnant American
women, the Population Council recently filed a petition with
the Food and Drug Administration (FDA) to request approval for
the abortion drug, RU 486. FDA Commissioner David Kessler had
earlier suggested that the FDA would put RU-486 on a fast-track
review process, perhaps approving the drug within six months.
FRC condemns any action by the FDA that would legitimize, for
the first time ever, a drug that would have no other use except
to kill innocent human life.

<p>

<b>Fostering Failure.</b> Dr. Henry Foster, head of a new Presidential
teen pregnancy task force, appeared with several pro-teen contraceptive
advocates at an April 10 Capitol Hill briefing.  The panelists
criticized abstinence-only programs, despite their proven effectiveness
in reducing teenage sexual activity and sexually transmitted diseases.
The panelists stressed instead more vigorous sex education programs,
increased use of contraception, and self-esteem programs. A hand-out
they distributed claimed that &quot;abstinence until marriage&quot;
programs and programs to produce &quot;secondary virginity&quot;
have not been shown to work.

<p>

<b>MIT Saber-Rattling.</b> On March 20, a Massachusetts Institute
of Technology faculty task force announced that it wants to open
the college's Reserve Officer Training Corps (ROTC) program to
avowed homosexuals.  The task force encourages universities nationwide
to rethink their relationship with the ROTC and their adherence
to its homosexual policy. MIT risks losing $56 million, 16 percent
of its annual research budget, because of a 1996 law that denies
Pentagon dollars to any institution that has an anti-ROTC policy.
Last year, ROTC commissioned 7,200 officers, barely reaching
the Pentagon's goal.

<p>

<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>

<p><a name="marriage">

<b>States of Matrimony.</b> Kansas has become the fifth state
to enact a law protecting marriage, joining Hawaii, Utah, South
Dakota and Georgia.  Other states are also acting against an expected
Hawaiian court ruling that may legalize homosexual &quot;marriage&quot;
licenses, which could then be imposed on other states under the
Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution.  In Hawaii,
the Senate also voted 24-0 specifically to ban same-sex 
&quot;marriage.&quot; The vote boosts the state's case in the suit 
brought by three homosexual couples that triggered the controversy.

<p>

<b>Ornery.</b> The Republican and Democratic political establishments
were both thwarted by insurgent candidacies in the April 9 Texas
primary runoff.  Former Congressman Ron Paul beat incumbent Republican
Greg Laughlin, a recent party-switcher.  House Speaker Newt Gingrich
was among those who campaigned vigorously for Laughlin. Both
candidates had vied for the support of pro-family activists.  In
the Democratic race for U.S. Senate, school teacher Victor Morales
defeated veteran Congressman John Bryant despite Bryant's support
from former Gov. Ann Richards and labor unions, including the
Texas Federation of Teachers.

<p>

<b>Revisionists Revise.</b> Revisionist historians missed the
U.S. landing on the moon and the presidency of George Washington
in their first, politically correct attempt back in 1994 to devise
national history standards. Now the latest revision, just released,
re-defines the family as &quot;a group of people from whom we receive
love and support.&quot;  The standards also endorse President
Clinton's embattled Goals 2000 plan and, for good measure, put
in a plug for equalized school funding nationwide.  Some conservative
critics were assuaged, but the standards remain a biased political
document.

<h3>Implementing Beijing</h3>

<p>

Despite the fact that most women in the world marry and have
children at some point in their lives, the family remained a non-issue
at the 40th session of the United Nations Commission on the Status
of Women (CSW) which met in New York in mid-March.  The CSW is
planning the implementation of the Platform for Action of last
autumn's Beijing Women's Conference.

<p>

There was no statement at the session that the family had
value, no effort to protect or shore it up now that it is under
siege, not even an invocation of the UN's usual definition of
the family as &quot;the basic unit of society.&quot; 

<p>

Most of the meeting revolved about the issues of &quot;women
and poverty&quot; and &quot;women and child and dependent care.&quot;
Noting that women constitute the majority of the world's poor,
the Commission urged governments to undertake education and training
programs and to adopt legislation promoting women's rights to
inheritance, land ownership and political decision-making.  The
&quot;dependent care&quot; debate urged redistribution of responsibilities
in the home and more part-time work, child care services and elder
care.

<p>

The session ended with the adoption of strong resolutions
condemning traffic in women and girls (a growing problem especially
in some developing countries) and wartime violence against civilians.
The Commission also approved the UN's System-Wide Plan of Action
(known as SWIMTEP) for implementing the Beijing Platform, including
its controversial provisions for health and &quot;reproductive
rights,&quot; which many UN advocacy groups hold to include abortion
and contraceptive programs for girls.

<p>

Among the tasks which SWIMTEP assigned regarding reproductive
rights were: a directive for the World Health Organization (WHO),
UNICEF and UNESCO to report on promotion of these rights to the
UN Population Division; a directive to the WHO 
and the UN Fund for Population to provide governments with technical
guidelines on methods of family planning and community distribution
of contraceptives; and a directive to UN agencies to provide special
programs for youth regarding sexual behavior.  (These directives
make no mention of parental rights or the influence of religious
or ethical traditions.)

<h3>FRC's Day in Court</h3>

<p>

On April 5, FRC received good news from a federal appeals
court in a pace-setting military homosexual case, <I>Thomasson
v. Perry</I>.  In this case, a homosexual sailor challenged both
the law passed by Congress and the Clinton administration regulations
on homosexuality in the armed forces.

<p>

The full court of 13 judges heard oral argument in December,
including argument presented by FRC's Military Readiness Project.
The MRP had filed two briefs in this case, both of which thoroughly
exposed the administration's failure to implement the law.

<p>

The law Congress passed is very clear:  no homosexuals in
the military.  But this binding expression of the will of the
American people has not stopped the administration from creating
regulatory loopholes through which homosexuals not only could
serve, but could serve openly in the military.

<p>

In <I>Thomasson,</I> the majority federal judges said, &quot;no
way.&quot; They cited FRC by name as they ruled that the Clinton
regulations on homosexuals are invalid.  The judges declared that
the administration deliberately mischaracterized the law and deliberately
shaded its answers to Congress when concerned members tried to
pin down exactly how the White House was implementing the new
statute.

<p>

Meanwhile,  the MRP was in court April 8 to hear <I>Richenberg
v. Perry</I>, a federal appeals case involving a homosexual Air
Force officer.   Predictably, the government mischaracterized
the law, but for the first time a government lawyer spoke of the
increased risk of AIDS posed by homosexuals serving.

<p>

Government counsel quoted a gay activist, &quot;I didn't
fight all my life to remain celibate&quot; and used an illustration.
If an airman identifies himself as an F16 pilot, can't the military
reasonably infer that he flies?  The counsel said the military
excludes homosexuals for a similar reason.  After all, soldiers
who identify themselves as homosexuals will engage in illicit
behavior. The court in <I>Thomasson</I> found this logic compelling.

<font size=+2><b><i>The &quot;Big Blue&quot; Summit</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer
</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>&quot;A</font>t the end of today, give me your badge, your 
desk key and everything that belongs to IBM,&quot; Charlene Mitchell
remembers her manager saying to her.  &quot;Go home and don't
come back.&quot;  Mrs. Mitchell told <I>The Washington Post</I>
how she was &quot;surplused&quot; in 1993 by the computer giant,
known for decades as &quot;Big Blue.&quot;  It was a bitter pill
for Mrs. Mitchell to swallow.  She was the third generation in
her family to work for IBM.

<p>

Charlene Mitchell was just one of 12,500 layoffs by IBM in
the Washington area since 1987.  Nationally, more than 3.2 million
Americans have gotten pink slips from large multinational corporations
over a recent six-year period.  Many layoffs are inevitable, of
course, but controversial firing practices have become &quot;business
as usual&quot; under the leadership of a new crop of corporate
high-rollers.

<p>

IBM's chief, Lou Gerstner, Jr, bluntly told the nation's
governors in 1995 that they should &quot;confront and expel&quot;
anyone they saw as a barrier to achievement of the national education
goals. He invited them to a summit last month at IBM's New York
conference center:  &quot;We'll pull it all together,&quot; he
said.  Pull it he did.  Gerstner ruled discussion of parental
choice out of order, even though he conceded that the &quot;public
education system is broken.&quot;

<p>

Gerstner clashed with Gov. George Allen (R-Va.) behind closed
doors when the conservative opposed national curricula and national
tests.  How could Gerstner force the governors to accept his edicts?
He pointedly reminded them and the press that IBM is already
the largest employer in North Carolina and Vermont.  He enlisted
other corporate bigs into making the same threat: reform our
way or face a hiring boycott of your states.

<p>

It's ironic to be battling over education standards now.
Pro-family conservatives were among the first recruits for the
education reform movement of the 1980's.  We cheered when my boss,
Bill Bennett, called for &quot;Content, Character and Choice.&quot;
We battled the &quot;dumbing down&quot; of American education.
We wanted teachers who can teach and school curricula that emphasize
the basics:  reading, writing, math, history and reliable standards
of right and wrong.  Instead, we've seen the education reform
movement hijacked by people who have given such &quot;triumphs&quot;
as vague, behavioral Outcome-Based Education (OBE) and anti-American
history standards.

<p>

Nobody has greater concern for the future economic success
of America's young graduates than their own parents.  But it's
a mistake to look at education as just a matter of work force
preparation. Education is primarily about family, faith
and freedom.  It must pass on the heritage of Western Civilization.
When we concentrate on basics, when we respect parents' rights
and the authority of locally elected school boards, excellence
will follow.

<p>

One corporate executive at the IBM summit admitted as much.
He described his state of New Hampshire. They still have New
England town meetings to discuss school issues, he said, and parents
are actively engaged in their children's education.  The result:
top scores for New Hampshire kids on national tests, even though
the state spends very little per pupil.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center>
<i><font size=+2>&quot;I LIKE THE NEW HAMPSHIRE<br>
MODEL.&quot;</font></i>
</center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

I like the New Hampshire model, not the German model that
is increasingly put forward by Marc Tucker, a liberal education
theorist and close associate of Hillary and Bill Clinton.  In
the same issue of <I>Newsweek</I> (April 8) where Jonathan Alter
touted the German model for education and job training, the magazine's
&quot;Business&quot; section reported a German unemployment rate
twice ours. Mercedes-Benz is building factories outside Germany
for the first time in its history.  There is serious division
in German society -- East-West splits, anti-immigrant violence,
and skinhead, directionless youth.

<p>

We can have excellent schools if we respect parental rights,
institute parental choice and uphold our free institutions.  We
should not try to make our kids over in anyone else's image: 
Let Americans be Americans!

<p>

&quot;<font size=+3>T</font>he Defense of Marriage Act is a powerful 
antidote to the destructive trend that has gripped this country at the 
hands of some injudicious judges.&quot; -- Gary Bauer, FRC president, 
before the U.S. Senate Judiciary Committee on July 11, 1996.

<p>

On July 12, the House of Representatives approved the Defense
of Marriage Act (DOMA) by an overwhelming vote of 342 to 67.
The bill defines marriage for federal purposes as &quot;the union
of a man and a woman as husband and wife.&quot;  It also asserts
the power of Congress to interpret the Full Faith and Credit Clause
of the Constitution to protect the other 49 states if Hawaii legalizes
homosexual &quot;marriage&quot; as expected later this year.

<p>

<center><h3>Senate Action Soon</h3></center>

<p>

As of press time, DOMA was slated for Senate action before the
August 3 recess.  Sen. Edward Kennedy (D-Mass.) has threatened
to attach an amendment to the bill that would grant homosexuals
special workplace protection.  This could kill DOMA, since the
Kennedy amendment is an unacceptable, back-door way of enacting
federal gay rights legislation.  Calls are needed to Capitol Hill
to urge legislators to &quot;pass DOMA pure.&quot;

<p>

The swift consideration of DOMA is testament to the hard work
of thousands of pro-family activists who have pressed Congress
to act.  FRC's government relations staff report that Capitol
Hill has been inundated with calls and letters supporting DOMA.

<p>

On June 24, leaders of 11 state family policy councils allied
with FRC and Focus on the Family spoke in support of DOMA at a
Washington press conference that drew national and regional press
coverage.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>
"URGE LEGISLATORS TO<br>
PASS DOMA PURE"
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

On July 3, FRC hosted a Capitol Hill briefing on DOMA with eight
experts who analyzed the faulty research on homosexuality and
addressed the importance of traditional marriage in law, culture,
education and adoption.  Speakers included author Dr. Jeffrey
Satinover,  Transformation Ex-Gay Ministry leader Anthony Falzarano,
Amherst Professor of Jurisprudence Hadley Arkes, FRC cultural
studies director Robert Knight, social work specialist Brenda
Destro, adoption expert Mary Beth Style, former school principal
and author Linda Page, journalist Peter LaBarbera, and Gary Bauer.

<p>

<center><h3>Briefing Highlights</h3></center>

<p>

The two-hour briefing ran live on C-SPAN, which repeated it three
times during the next two days.  Millions of Americans learned
facts about homosexuality and the homosexual political agenda
that are routinely omitted from media coverage.  Here are some
excerpts:

<p>

<b>Jeffrey Satinover, M.D.</b>, former Fellow in Psychiatry and Child
Psychiatry at Yale:  &quot;Two profoundly mistaken ideas have
sunk deeply into public sentiment where they exert a powerful
influence in the shaping of public policy as it relates to family,
sexuality and marriage.  1) Homosexuality is genetic, and that
consequently, 2) Homosexuality is unchangeable.  Neither idea
is true, and in fact there is a mountain of scientific evidence
to the contrary.&quot;

<p>

<b>Hadley Arkes</b>: &quot;Every argument for gay marriage is an argument
that would support polygamy.  The gay activists may not have the
remotest interest in promoting polygamy, but ... they have the
most profound interest...in discrediting the notion that marriage
finds its defining ground in 'nature.'  We can count on the fact
that there will be someone, somewhere, ready to press this issue
by raising a challenge in the court....&quot;

<p>

Anthony Falzarano: &quot;I speak to you today not just as an
observer of this movement, but as one of them.  I am a former
homosexual.  I lived that lifestyle from the time I was 17 until
I was 26.  I entered the gay lifestyle thinking that there really
wasn't any choice for me.  What I didn't realize is that although
I didn't choose to be homosexual, I did not have to be gay.  I
had a choice.... Many of us are sick and tired of a lifestyle
that initially seems very freeing but eventually puts us in all
kinds of bondage and eventually will kill us....&quot;

<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>

<p>

Call or write your senators and urge them to keep DOMA
pure -- no amendments.  The Capitol Hill switchboard number is
202-225-3121.  Address:  U.S. Senate, Washington, D.C.  20510.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>Bill Emerson, RIP.</b>  A strong champion of the sanctity of
life and the family, Rep. Bill Emerson (Mo.) died of cancer June
22.  Emerson was universally admired by his colleagues and popular
with his constituents.  His public career was sparked by service
as a Congressional page at age 16.  The flag-waving families who
lined his funeral route and the members of Congress who paid him
tearful tribute during a July 12 memorial service offered praise
to his memory.  Emerson's quiet service was marked with integrity
and devotion.

<p>

<b>Istook Tries.</b> On July 11, the House passed the 1997 funding
bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services and
Education. Defeated: a pro-family amendment offered by Rep.
Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) that would have required written parental
consent before a teenager receives any services, including abortion
referrals, under the Title X federal family planning program.
The House also defeated an attempt by Rep. Nita Lowey (D-N.Y.)
that would have allowed federally-funded human embryo experiments.
Current law prohibits such research on live human embryos.

<p>

<b>Unaccountable.</b> The House and Senate passed separate health
reform bills last spring with bipartisan support, yet no compromise
has been reached.  Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.) has been holding
the bill hostage by refusing to let the Senate leadership appoint
conferees.  Kennedy opposes medical savings accounts (MSAs), which
were contained in the House bill but narrowly defeated by the
Senate.  He has vowed to continue stalling until the leadership
appoints a majority of conferees opposed to MSAs. If Kennedy
succeeds, much-needed reforms (in access and ability to keep insurance
when changing jobs) will go by the boards.

<p>

<b>Jubilee Pits.</b> &quot;Come, Holy Spirit&quot; -- with those
words, Rep. Bob Dornan (R-Calif.) took the floor of Congress on
June 27 and defended his Christian faith, biblical sexual morality,
and FRC's role in exposing the homosexual &quot;circuit&quot;
party in a federal building in April. Dornan made the remarks
in response to a personal attack by fellow Rep. Steve Gunderson
(R-Wis.).  For a full transcript of Rep. Dornan's remarks as they
were printed in the <I>Congressional Record</I>, call 1-800-225-4008.

<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>

<p><a name="fdabortion">

<b>FDA Variety Store.</b> In a highly unusual move, the Food
and Drug Administration (FDA) Reproductive Drug Advisory Committee
initiated hearings on two new abortion drugs -- hearings not solicited
by a drug manufacturer.  On June 28, the FDA committee decided
that increased dosages of oral contraceptives were &quot;safe&quot;
and &quot;effective&quot; for use as an abortifacient &quot;morning-after
pill.&quot;  Pro-abortion groups urged the FDA to force reluctant
manufacturers to relabel oral contraceptives for post-coital use.
On July 19, the same FDA committee considered approving RU-486
for use in the US.  FRC attended both hearings and  publicly opposed
both FDA actions.

<p>

<b>China MFN.</b> The Clinton administration prevailed in renewing
China's &quot;most favored nation&quot; (MFN) trade status for
the coming year.  On June 27, an effort to revoke China's MFN
status failed in the House of Representatives by vote of 141 to
286.  However, the House did pass a second, non-binding resolution
(H. Res. 461 by vote of 411 to 7) which called for hearings and
possible legislation to punish China for its military intimidation
of Taiwan, weapons sales, and human rights abuses.  FRC supports
hearings and opposes MFN for China because of its myriad human
rights abuses.

<p>

<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>

<p>

<b>Five-ring Political Circus.</b> The 1996 Olympics in Atlanta
were, sadly, misused to advance the homosexual agenda.  The Olympic
torch run bypassed Cobb County, Georgia, and Greenville County,
South Carolina, because officials there passed resolutions opposing
homosexuality.  The torch was actually hidden in a van and driven
through Greenville County during the night.  Meanwhile, the Clinton
administration lifted the ban on HIV-infected immigrants for the
Olympics, just as was done earlier for the Gay Games in New York.
It's not known whether other infectious diseases got equal opportunity.

<p>

<b>First Advocate.</b> In a first-ever presidential interview
with a homosexual magazine, President Clinton told <I>The Advocate</I>
(June 25) that his administration &quot;has taken more steps than
any previous in bringing the gay and lesbian communities to the
table.&quot;  Los Angeles-based Liberation Publications, which
publishes <I>The Advocate</I>, also owns Alyson Publications,
a Boston-based publisher of <I>Heather Has Two Mommies, Daddy's
Roommate, Daddy's Wedding</I> and books about sado-masochistic
sex with children.  One book gives advice for homosexual pedophiles
on how to avoid prosecution.

<p><a name="marijuana">

<b>MUM's Not the Word.</b> California's &quot;Medical Use of
Marijuana&quot; initiative will appear on the November ballot.
International &quot;decriminalization&quot; promoters who have
bankrolled this initiative claim it will provide &quot;compassionate
use&quot; of marijuana without prescription for people with cancer,
AIDS and glaucoma, but the initiative allows use for &quot;any
other illness&quot; and would virtually legalize possession and
cultivation for anyone, including children.  The federal government
rejects smoking marijuana as a medicine because it has serious
physical and psychological consequences.  Physicians wishing to
prescribe THC, marijuana's active ingredient, have the FDA-approved
drug Marinol.

<h3>FRC: Ready and <i>Abel</i></h3>

<p>

The Supreme Court will decide this September whether to hear the
first challenge to the Pentagon's new ban on homosexuals in the
military.  This appeal was prompted by the high court's recent
ruling that Colorado cannot constitutionally bar &quot;special
rights&quot; laws for homosexuals.

<p>

On July 1, 1996, former Navy Lieutenant Paul Thomasson, who was
discharged for proclaiming, &quot;I am gay,&quot; asked the high
court to hear his case.  He challenged both the law passed by
Congress and the Clinton administration's regulations on homosexuality
in the armed forces.

<p>

Thomasson lost his challenge in both the federal district and
appeals courts.  The appeals court hearing was noteworthy because
it included oral argument presented on behalf of the Family Research
Council.  FRC had filed two briefs in this case, both of which
thoroughly exposed the administration's illegal plans to use the
military to legitimize homosexuality.

<p>

Thomasson's attorney said his appeal decision was influenced by
the high court's <I>Romer v. Evans</I> ruling, which struck
down Colorado's &quot;special rights&quot; amendment.  He claims
that the judicial landscape has improved greatly with <I>Romer</I>.
Writing for the Supreme Court's minority in the <I>Romer</I>
decision, Justice Antonin Scalia said there is &quot;no foundation
in American constitutional law&quot; for the court's ruling.

<p>

It's expected the Clinton Justice Department will favor the appeal
request.  If the court accepts <I>Thomasson</I>, oral arguments
will likely be held this fall with a decision next spring.  The
military's ban should be upheld -- if the Supreme Court relies
on the constitution.

<p>

FRC's Military Readiness Project (MRP) has participated in 12
homosexual court cases so far.  Should the <I>Thomasson</I> case
be heard, the MRP will file an amicus brief and ask the high court
for time to make oral argument.

<p>

Meanwhile, also on July 1, 1996, the U.S. Court of Appeals for
the Second Circuit returned the <I>Abel et al. v. Perry</I> case
to federal district court directing that judge to determine whether
the military can constitutionally exclude soldiers who engage
in homosexual conduct.  The lower court previously ruled that
the First and Fifth Amendment rights of the six service members
in <I>Abel</I> were violated when the military sought to discharge
them based solely on their <I>admission</I> of homosexuality,
without regard to actual conduct.

<h3>Ban the Postcards!</h3>

<p>

The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act passed the House of Representatives
and the Senate and was vetoed by President Clinton on April 10,
1996.  The House will first attempt to override the President's
veto shortly after Labor Day. A two-thirds majority of those
present and voting is required to override.  If the House vote
is successful, the Senate is expected to make an override attempt
shortly thereafter. These are crucial pro-life votes.

<p>

On June 29-30, the nation's Catholic bishops sponsored a massive
pro-life postcard campaign (in local churches) to members of Congress
to urge support for the override.  It is expected that millions
of postcards will flood Capitol Hill in the next month or two.
The House Post Office has reportedly hired extra workers to deal
with the heavy influx of cards.

<p>

The Clinton White House is not waiting for the cards to react,
however. Administration officials at the Pentagon attempted to 
silence Catholic chaplains on military bases by issuing a directive 
forbidding them to mention the postcard campaign in church. They 
claimed it involved &quot;partisan political activity,&quot; a 
claim belied by the fact that the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban was 
passed overwhelmingly by bipartisan majorities in both houses of 
Congress.  Many Catholic service members and their families believe 
that they were illegally denied the guidance of their priests and 
bishops on this vital issue. A legal defense fund which specializes 
in religious liberty cases is reportedly planning to file suit on 
behalf of military chaplains who believe that their First Amendment 
rights were violated.

<p>

FRC urges concerned citizens to call on their legislators to override
the veto by talking with them personally, especially at local
&quot;town meetings&quot; during the August congressional recess.
Calls and/or letters to the members' district offices are also
encouraged.  Please continue to educate your friends and neighbors
about partial-birth abortions by writing &quot;letters to the
editor&quot; to local newspapers, participating in radio talk
shows, etc.

<font size=+2><b><i>The Court's Conscientious Dissenter</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer
</center>

<p>

<font size=+3>J</font>ustice Antonin Scalia is making a name for himself 
as a conscientious objector to a Supreme Court run amok.  He is heard 
most often from the dissenting side these days, frequently accompanied 
by Chief Justice Rehnquist and Associate Justice Clarence Thomas.
His dissents are noteworthy -- some would say notorious.  Justice
Scalia has an uncanny knack for cutting through the majority's
sophistry and sloppy self-justification to make a stunning legal
defense of American tradition, true democracy, plain old common
sense and decency.

<p>

Scalia shines the light of truth on &quot;this most illiberal
Court, which has embarked on a course of inscribing one after
another of the current preferences of the society (and in some
cases only the counter-majoritarian preferences of the society's
law trained elite) into our Basic Law.&quot;  He believes that
it is &quot;no business of the courts (as opposed to the political
branches) to take sides in the cultural war.&quot;  We at FRC
believe the same, and Scalia's measured umbrage is our vicarious
voice.

<p>

In response to special rights gained by the well-funded gay lobby
in several Colorado cities, voters across the state approved a
constitutional amendment that would prevent any person from getting
such legal privileges solely on the basis of their homosexuality.
The Court majority said that the amendment was unconstitutional
because it was obviously born of hatred against gays, despite
what the Coloradans say.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>
THE COURT UNASHAMEDLY<br>
OVERSTEPS ITS AUTHORITY.
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

Scalia retorted that &quot;[t]he Court's portrayal of Coloradans
as a society fallen victim to pointless, hate-filled 'gay-bashing'
is so false as to be comical.&quot;  He also deplored the sinister
effect of the Court's &quot;verbally disparaging as bigotry adherence
to traditional attitudes.&quot;  Scalia charged the majority with
&quot;tak[ing] sides in the culture wars,&quot; specifically,
choosing &quot;the views and values of the lawyer class from which
the Court's Members are drawn&quot; and supporting this choice
&quot;by inventing a novel and extravagant constitutional doctrine.&quot;

<p>

The Court unashamedly overstepped its authority, he wrote: &quot;Amendment
2 is designed to prevent piecemeal deterioration of the sexual
morality favored by a majority of Coloradans, and is not only
an appropriate means to that legitimate end, but a means that
Americans have employed before.  Striking it down is an act, not
of judicial judgment, but of political will.&quot;

<p>

Scalia took up his pen again in the case challenging the male-only
admissions policy at the Virginia Military Institute:  &quot;Since
it is entirely clear that the Constitution of the United States
-- the old one -- takes no sides in this educational debate, I
dissent....Today the Court shuts down an institution that has
served the people of the Commonwealth of Virginia with pride and
distinction for over a century and a half.&quot;  To do that,
it &quot;sweeps aside the precedents of this Court, and ignores
the history of our people.&quot;

<p>

In one of the last cases of the term, Justice Scalia rhetorically
shook his head: &quot;The court must be living in another world.
Day by day, case by case, it is busy designing a Constitution
for a country I do not recognize.&quot;

<p>

Those are stark words from the bench, words befitting the steady
dismantling of legislative prerogatives today's &quot;conservative&quot;
Supreme Court is engaged in.  But Scalia is no doomsayer.  A recent
report of a celebration of his first 10 years on the bench with
his present and former law clerks noted that, despite his angry
dissents, Justice Scalia is a happy man with a sense of hope.
Apparently he knows, as we know, that ours is not in the winning,
but in the trying.

<center><h1>TYRANNY IN ROBES</h1></center>

<p>

<font size=+3>O</font>n May 20, the U.S. Supreme Court issued a ruling 
whose destructive power may rival the infamous <I>Roe v. Wade</I> 
(1973) decision.

<p>

In <I>Romer v.  Evans</I>, the court voted 6-3 to strike
down a voter-approved amendment to Colorado's constitution that
would have prevented homosexuality from being added to civil rights
laws by the state and local governments.  The people of Colorado
had voted for Amendment 2 in response to adoption of homosexual
rights laws in several cities, including Denver and Aspen.  The
amendment took no rights away from homosexuals, merely ensuring
that homosexuality would not receive preferential treatment.

<p>

<center><h3>800,000 Bigots?</h3></center>

<p>

Justice Anthony Kennedy, writing for the majority, concluded
that the voters were motivated only by &quot;animus&quot; toward
homosexuals, seeking to deny them access to the political process.
In effect, he called more than 800,000 Coloradans &quot;hate-filled
bigots&quot; for withholding a powerful legal weapon from homosexual
activists.

<p>

In a scathing dissent, Justice Antonin Scalia said the ruling
has &quot;no foundation in American constitutional law and barely
pretends to. ... Amendment 2 is designed to prevent piecemeal deterioration
of the sexual morality favored by a majority of Coloradans ... striking
it down is an act, not of judicial judgment, but of political
will.&quot;

<p>

Scalia noted that under the court's reasoning, polygamists
could demand redress because they are disadvantaged by state laws
prohibiting polygamy.  He asked whether the court had somehow
concluded that polygamy was a greater social harm than homosexuality.
Scalia also noted that the majority had completely ignored the
1986 <I>Bowers v. Hardwick</I> case, which established that states
can criminalize sodomy.  If states can do that, he wrote, then
surely they can deny &quot;preferential treatment&quot; to a class
that defines itself solely by its willingness to engage in that
behavior.

<p>

Homosexual activists celebrated the <I>Romer</I> ruling.
Conservative activist Paul Weyrich and Colorado for Family Values
President Will Perkins called for impeachment of the six majority
justices, who include Reagan appointee Kennedy, Sandra Day O'Connor
(Reagan), David Souter (Bush), John Paul Stevens (Ford),  Stephen
Breyer (Clinton) and Ruth Bader Ginsburg (Clinton).  Other leaders
raised the question of judicial term limits and of activating
Congress' constitutional power to limit which cases the Supreme
Court can rule upon.

<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>
"NOT JUDICIAL JUDGMENT,<br>
BUT POLITICAL WILL."
</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>

The court did stop short of elevating &quot;sexual orientation&quot;
to the same level of protection as race, ethnicity and other traditional
civil rights categories.  But the legal effect may be less than
the cultural effect.  Within hours of the decision, a lesbian
attorney in Florida said the court had ruled that homosexuality
could not be taken into account in child custody cases.  The court
did no such thing, but such broad interpretations can now be expected
to be routinely advanced in homosexuality-related cases.

<p>

<center><h3>Pass DOMA Now</h3></center>

<p>

Citizens who believe in traditional morality and the rule
of law must now rally around the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA),
a federal bill that defines marriage as &quot;the union of one
man and one woman as husband and wife&quot; and allows states
to ignore out-of-state marriage licenses issued to homosexual
couples.

<p>

Liberal judges in Hawaii are expected to legalize homosexual
&quot;marriage&quot; as early as September, and homosexuals are
preparing to fly to Hawaii, get &quot;married,&quot; and claim
marital status in their home states.  Given the Supreme Court's
usurpation of power in Colorado, passage of DOMA (H.R. 3396) and
(S. 1740) is imperative.  DOMA will reassert the constitutional
authority of Congress, send the courts the message that America
will not surrender to homosexual activists, and secure marriage
against radical redefinition.  So far, 11 states have passed bills
protecting marriage, but DOMA is needed immediately to protect
the federal code and state marriage laws.

<p>

<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>

<p>

Call or write your senators and congressman and urge them
to sponsor DOMA, not merely pledge to vote for it.  The Capitol
Hill switchboard is 202-225-3121.  Addresses:  U.S. Senate, Washington,
D.C.  20510; U.S. House of Representatives, Washington, D.C. 
20515.  Also, ask your state representatives to pass a marriage
protection law at the state level.

<h3>On the Hill</h3>

<p>

<b>Medicare Package.</b> The Medicare trustees issued a report
on June 5 indicating that Medicare Part A (payment for hospital
costs) may become insolvent by 2001.  The Part A trust fund lost
$2.6 billion in 1995.  The trustees recommended that an independent
commission develop a long-term strategy. Congress passed a budget
last year which limited projected increases in Medicare spending
to an annual average of 6.4 percent.  President Clinton vetoed
that plan and insists that Congress enact his more limited proposal.
An election year resolution of this issue is unlikely.

<p>

<b>No Relief in Sight.</b> Family tax relief continues to receive
consideration on Capitol Hill, even as the presidential candidates
float various tax cut plans.  Congressional leaders may include
the child credit in a package with welfare and Medicaid reform,
or include it as part of a separate tax package.  President Clinton
threatens to veto any bill that contains the Republicans' proposed
Medicaid reforms, but it does not appear that he will sign the
tax cuts without comparable cuts in spending.  Sounds like another
&quot;Catch-22&quot; situation.

<p><a name="privacy">

<b>Preventing Predators.</b> The Children's Privacy Protection
and Parental Empowerment Act of 1996 was introduced by Congressman
Bob Franks (R-N.J.) on May 22. The purpose of this bill is to
empower parents to further protect their children from child predators.
The bill would allow parents to learn what information commercial
vendors have obtained about their children, where the information
originated, and where it has been distributed.  People who prey
on children should not be able to purchase, receive, sell, or
in any way handle personal information about children.

<p>

<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>

<p>

<b>No Federal Cradle.</b> Many news stories on the Stand for
Children rally sponsored by the Children's Defense Fund asked
the same questions FRC raised at a press conference the day before
the event:  Is more spending on failed federal programs really
helping children?  Or are liberal advocacy groups just using children
as props to make one last stand for big government?  FRC argued
that strong parents are still the best advocates for children.
Society's role is to help rebuild healthy communities that strengthen
the hands of those who rock the cradles.

<p>

<b>Dues Under Duress.</b> A new House Republican task force on
labor policy has recommended legislation that would protect union
members from being forced to pay dues to fund partisan politics.
In the 1994 election, 40 percent of union members voted for conservative
candidates while union chiefs generally backed liberals.  Giving
workers an option to restrict their dues to collective bargaining
purposes is an obvious way to protect the integrity of representative
government while protecting workers' interests -- and putting
hard-earned dollars back in the pockets of American workers.

<p>

<b>Justice Denied.</b> Some black youngsters in a Washington,
D.C. suburb were almost denied the chance to see how faith and
hard work can pay off in America.  Supreme Court Justice Clarence
Thomas was publicly disinvited to speak at a student awards ceremony
in early June when a school official threatened to disrupt the
event.  Although the school board ultimately voted to reinvite
Thomas, the whole spectacle sent a troubling message to students,
who, fortunately, ultimately got to hear Thomas's powerful message
of personal virtue and equality before the law.

<p>

<center><h3>Across the Globe</h3></center>

<p><a name="beijing">

<b>Costly Habitat.</b> From June 3-14 in Istanbul, Turkey, Habitat
II, the United Nations Conference on Human Settlements, built
on the anti-family agendas of previous U.N. conferences, this
time focusing on the environmental and economic challenges of
rapid urbanization.  Urging more efforts to implement that agenda,
Clinton Secretary of State Warren Christopher called for a moratorium
on further U.N. world conferences.  And none too soon.  A recent
General Accounting Office study found that the U.S. Government
spent a whopping $5.9 million on the U.N. Conference on Women
held last September in Beijing, China.

<p>

<b>Rewarding Tyranny.</b> On June 3, President Clinton formally
announced his intention to extend &quot;most favored nation&quot;
(MFN) trade privileges to China.  Unless Congress quickly opposes
Clinton's stand, China will continue to enjoy low tariffs on exports
to the U.S.  FRC opposes extending China's MFN status not only
because the U.S. runs a trade deficit of $34 billion every year
with China, but especially because of China's myriad human rights
abuses, such as forced abortion and sterilization policies, exploitation
of prisoners as slave laborers, and systematic persecution of
Christians.

<p>

<b>Wirth Stumbles.</b> During a Senate Foreign Relations Committee
hearing June 4, chairman Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) put two questions
to witness Timothy Wirth, Undersecretary of State for Global Affairs.
Citing Hillary Clinton's speech during the U.N. Beijing conference,
where she strongly denounced sex selection abortion and mandatory
abortion, Helms asked Wirth if the Clinton administration would
support legislation outlawing sex selection abortion in the U.S.
and admitting refugees fleeing China's coercive abortion policies.
Wirth could not answer either question directly, saying there
were &quot;other implications&quot; which needed to be considered.

<h3>Parental Rights Vote Near</h3>

<p>

The recent pro-big-government &quot;Stand for Children&quot;
rally in Washington, D.C. had little in common with the growing
grass-roots parental rights movement, except for its focus on
children.  The Family Research Council's message to rally participants
was that government programs can never provide what children vitally
need -- parents raising them with love and direction.  Which is
to say, parents are irreplaceable.

<p>

With public school officials handing condoms to pre-teens,
it is no wonder that the parental rights movement has captured
the public's attention.  Parents across the country are finding
their voice against intrusive state and federal governments.
At the state level, parents are supporting constitutional amendments
which protect the right of parents to direct the upbringing and
education of their children without unwanted government infringement.
At the federal level, parents are supporting the Parental Rights
and Responsibilities Act of 1996 (PRRA), which simply codifies
Supreme Court rulings that parents have a fundamental right to
raise their children which the government must respect.

<p>

That parents, not government, should have the primary responsibility
and authority in raising their children seems beyond dispute.
Yet, the ubiquitous ACLU and their education counterpart, the
National Education Association, have weighed in with heavy protests.
They are fond of presenting hypothetical &quot;horror stories&quot;
of child abuse they claim the PRRA will permit, yet the bill specifically
excludes abusive parents from its protection.

<p>

In contrast to these theoretical concerns, real-life instances
of outrageous government violations of parents rights persist.
If the PRRA were law, parents in Pennsylvania would probably
not have had to file suit against the East Stroudsburg public
school for forcing their sixth-grade daughters to undergo vaginal
examinations without their knowledge or consent and over the tearful
protestations of the girls.  This flagrant usurpation of the right
of parents to make health care decisions for their children would
not be tolerated under the PRRA.  Without it, the Pennsylvania
parents have little certainty of success.

<p>

A vote on the PRRA is expected before August.  Call 202-225-3121
and urge your congressman and senators to vote for the PRRA (H.R.
1946; S. 984).  For information on state initiatives, contact
Of the People at 703-351-5051.

<h3>Indecent Opinion</h3>

<p>

The District Court for the Eastern District of Pennsylvania
has ruled against provisions of the Communications Decency Act
(CDA), the first major anti-pornography legislation for cyberspace.
This is a sad defeat with ominous implications for the burgeoning,
new &quot;global community.&quot;  The Clinton Justice Department
will appeal the ruling to the Supreme Court.

<p>

The CDA was passed as part of the Telecommunications Reform
bill in February 1996.  It seeks to protect children from sexually
explicit material on the Internet by prohibiting adults from knowingly
sending or displaying &quot;indecent material&quot; to kids.
It imposes criminal penalties for violation of the law.

<p>

The ACLU and a coalition of liberal groups and on-line service
providers filed the challenge to the CDA in Philadelphia.  A similar
challenge was filed in New York and is still pending.  The Family
Research Council and the National Law Center for Children and
Families submitted 400 pages of legal argument and exhibits on
behalf of anti-pornography groups defending the CDA.  Judge Delores
Sloviter, a Carter appointee, headed the Philadelphia three-judge
panel which heard testimony this spring from ACLU and government
witnesses.

<p>

The CDA uses the time-tested standard of &quot;indecency&quot;
to draw the line between material that is appropriate for adults
but not for children.  &quot;Indecent material&quot; is defined
as material depicting or describing sexual or excretory activities
or organs which, in context, is presented in a patently offensive
manner.  The Supreme Court has ruled that adults have a First
Amendment right to receive indecent material and share it with
other adults, but no right to foist it upon children.  The indecency
standard has protected children in the broadcast television, radio,
and telephone media.

<p>

At closing arguments in Philadelphia, it was clear that the
ACLU was not simply quarreling with this particular law, but was
advocating no restrictions whatsoever on the dissemination of
computer pornography to children.  The Philadelphia court was
openly hostile to the Justice Department and its defense of the
CDA, and its ruling absurdly implies that the advancement of Internet
technology depends upon unfettered exhibition of sexual material
to children.

<p>

<font size=+3>W</font>e got a postcard from Air Force Captain Dave Panzera 
the other day.  That's not so unusual, since we receive many calls
and letters from active duty military.  But Captain Panzera's
card came to us from <I>Antarctica.</I>

<p>

That's a dramatic example of how far and wide the
message of FRC is traveling these days.  It's not at all unusual
for us to host meetings with pastors from Southern Africa, champions
of religious liberty from Russia and pro-family leaders from Canada,
Australia and New Zealand.  The international interest in Family
Research Council is a reflection of the global nature of the threat
to the family.

<p>

I always try to give encouragement to our friends from abroad.
They often report feeling &quot;overwhelmed&quot; by a tide of
pornography, drugs, abortion and sexual misconduct.  I share with
our allies some of the expanding array of communications tools
we use to get our message out.  In trying to support them, I find
that <I>I</I> am uplifted. Let me share with you, a regular reader
of <I>Washington Watch,</I> the growing array of devices we have
used in the fight for faith, family and freedom.

<p>

As Americans reduce their reliance on the liberal talking
heads of TV network news, radio has filled the gap.  Sure, there
are the Howard Sterns and Don Imuses, but well-informed pro-family
callers to radio talk shows shatter the media myths about our
movement.  My nickname for conservative programs broadcast from
our nation's capital is &quot;Radio Free Washington.&quot;  I'm
proud that Focus on the Family's news and information feature,
<I>Family News in Focus</I> (FNIF), is broadcast to hundreds of
religious stations every day.  FNIF's Washington bureau, and its
veteran chief, Carl Ramsey, are good neighbors to FRC.

<p>

My daily radio commentary, which bears the same title as
this newsletter, keeps many of you informed of late-breaking
stories and my perspective on the issues.  You can call our FRC
toll-free line at 1-800-225-4008 to obtain a listing of 
participating stations in your community.

<p>

FRC's <I>Legislative Hotline</I> is easily reached by dialing
1-202-783-HOME.  It's available 24 hours a day and is put together
each week (or more frequently as events warrant) by our top-notch
government relations staff.  You can also receive the text of
the <I>Hotline</I> via FAX.  Just call our Government Relations
department at 1-202-393-2100.

<p>

If education is your special interest, <I>Ed Facts</I> is
just for you.  <I>Ed Facts</I> is a weekly fax report available
to citizens for a suggested donation.  It details the latest news
from Washington on issues that affect your kids and their schools.

Our CAN mailing goes out once a month.  Intended for community
impact groups, it contains more in-depth analyses, copies of &quot;op

<p>

FRC's staff includes some intrepid &quot;cybernauts&quot;
who are using the latest technology to make sure we are represented
on the Internet.  Our site is located at: http://www.frc.org.
I confess I'm a bit &quot;low-tech.&quot; My word processor is
located under my hat, and I carry my printer around in my shirt
pocket.  But for those of you who find that the world begins with
a keyboard, our Internet site should please you.

<p>

When David Brinkley's producers called me recently to appear
on <I>This Week,</I> I was pleased (even if I did have to lock
horns with Rep. Barney Frank).  And CBS-TV's <I>Face the Nation</I> 
gave me yet another opportunity to tout the Defense of Marriage
Act (DOMA).  As gratifying as these major media appearances are,
it's good to know that FRC isn't dependent on others to spread
our message.  We have our own means of getting the word out.
And that word is clearly reaching the ends of the earth.

its interest in working with congressional sponsors of CAREERS to

God we are officially now mandated to be a country with no
formal recognition of God [emphasis added], whether God be
Christian, Moslem, Hindu, or Unitarian.&quot;  In daily radio
commentary on June 5, Gary Bauer said, &quot;A nation that no
longer sees itself as living 'under God' <B>had better get used
to waking each morning to the same bleak headlines of violence

WASHINGTON, APRIL 17, 1995 -- While almost everybody in the 
nation's capital, from President Clinton to House Speaker Newt Gingrich, 
continues to talk about "reinventing" or slimming down government, The 
Heritage Foundation today offered a comprehensive and detailed plan for 
actually doing so.<p>
The ambitious proposal, released today in draft form, "examines every 
nook and cranny of the $1.6 trillion federal enterprise," a spokesman for 
the prominent think tank said. Every agency and every program within 
each agency was "put to the test."<p>
The Heritage Foundation plan was characterized by Vice President Stuart 
Butler as a "federalism budget" because many responsibilities would be 
transferred to state and local government. In putting the plan together, he 
said, a team of analysts conducted a Peter Drucker-style top-to-bottom 
review of the entire federal government<p>
The plan, according to budget expert Scott Hodge, would: 1) balance the 
federal budget by the year 2000, two years earlier than would have been 
required under the balanced-budget amendment, while providing $152 
billion in tax relief to families with children, business and the elderly; 2) 
end corporate welfare; 3) close down obsolete and wasteful programs, 
strengthen core programs that are legitimate functions of government, 
and transfer functions that "are not proper federal activities" to the states 
or the private sector; and 4) create several new agencies as part of the 
consolidation process.<p>
<center><h3>Medicare, Foreign Aid, Defense</center></h3><p>
To promote economic growth, the Heritage budget plan calls for cutting 
the effective capital gains tax rate in half; allowing businesses the 
equivalent of writing off capital investments in the year in which they are 
made, rather than stretching out the deductions; and creating new 
"Individual Retirement-Plus Accounts," which would provide tax-free 
income upon retirement (though contributions to such accounts would not 
be tax-deductible).<p>
Social Security would not be touched. Medicare, however, would 
undergo major surgery, offering to retirees a variety of medical plans and 
choices, similar to those enjoyed by federal employees and members of 
Congress under the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program.
Changes and cuts in the foreign-aid program would result in savings of 
$10 billion to $14.6-billion over five years.<p>
In keeping with the Heritage Foundation's view that the first priority of 
the federal government is to defend the nation and secure U.S. interests 
abroad, defense spending would be maintained at current levels, adjusted 
for inflation. This is about $130 billion more than the administration has 
called for over the next five years.<p>
Heritage analysts consistently have argued that the Clinton administration 
has underfunded its own defense plan, known as the "Bottom-Up 
Review," by some $100 billion over five years. The General Accounting 
Office (GAO) has placed the shortfall even higher, at $150 billion.<p>
House and Senate leaders have more or less gone along with the 
administration's funding plans. Heritage Foundation analysts, however, 
believe this is a mistake, arguing that funding at such low levels would 
require the United States to withdraw more forces from Europe or Asia. It 
also would mean leaving the United States vulnerable to ballistic missile 
attack. To fully fund the Bottom-Up Review force, the Heritage budget 
would add the needed $100 billion to the Clinton administration's 
proposed five-year defense budget, plus $30 billion for such new 
initiatives as ballistic-missile defense. (The Heritage Foundation is 
expected to publish its own missile-defense plan next month.)<p>
<center><h3>Top-to-Bottom Structural Reorganization</center></h3><p>
Butler said the Heritage plan would allow U.S. taxpayers to spend far 
more of their own money, rather than sending it to Washington for 
bureaucrats to spend. "The public realizes that the federal government is 
too expensive, mired in debt, and does a poor job of carrying out its core 
functions, while doing many things it shouldn't do. They want this to 
stop. That was the message of both the 1992 and 1994 elections. The 
Clinton administration has proposed nothing that would change 
fundamentally the way government works -- or its cost." What is needed, 
instead, Butler said -- and what The Heritage Foundation will present to 
Congress when the House and Senate return from their recess -- is a plan 
for the kind of "top-to-bottom structural reorganization" many businesses 
have undertaken in recent years.<p>
If the Heritage plan were fully implemented, Butler said, the number of 
Cabinet level departments of government would be reduced from 14 to 
five (Defense, Health and Human Services, Justice, State and the 
Treasury). The Departments of Agriculture and Interior would be 
reorganized and reduced to sub-cabinet level independent agencies. The 
Department of Energy's nuclear-weapons programs and veterans 
programs now administered by the Department of Veterans Affairs would 
be shifted to the Department of Defense. <p>
Three major independent agencies -- the Federal Communications 
Commission, Interstate Commerce Commission and Small Business 
Administration -- would disappear entirely. The Departments of 
Commerce, Education, Housing and Urban Development (HUD), Labor, 
and Transportation -- like Energy and Veterans Affairs -- would be 
closed down, though some of their functions, as part of the overall 
streamlining and consolidation process, would be shifted to the states or 
moved elsewhere within the federal government.<p>
The new agencies proposed by The Heritage Foundation would 
consolidate various functions now scattered throughout the bureaucracy. 
Government research and data-collection functions, for example, would 
be moved from the Census Bureau (part of the slated-for-extinction 
Commerce Department), Bureau of Labor Statistics (Labor Department), 
and other agencies to a new Bureau of National Statistics. According to 
Butler, "An important purpose of this change is to house these functions 
within an agency characterized by a new ethos -- dispassionate data 
collection -- rather than within departments driven by policy-making."
Similarly, various environmental and land-management functions, now 
housed at the Departments of Agriculture and Interior, would be 
consolidated within a new Bureau of Natural Resources.<p>
Total spending reductions over five years would amount to more than 
$750 billion net. There also would be a net saving of $97 billion in 
interest on the national debt by the time the deficit is eliminated in the 
year 2000. (The Heritage Foundation report calculates future spending 
levels three different ways: using l) direct year-to-year spending 
comparisons, 2) government "baseline" spending projections, and 3) 
baseline projections, plus revenue from privatization and asset sales. 
Washington has been using the second method, measuring everything 
against a projected spending baseline.)<p>
<center><h3>Step-by-Step Instructions</center></h3><p>
Unlike the Clinton administration's and other budget proposals now being 
"vetted" in Washington, most of which focus solely on budget 
"functions" and costs, The Heritage Foundation blueprint provides 
Washington with step-by-step instructions on how to make the necessary 
changes.<p>
"It is very easy to say, 'Shut down the Departments of Commerce, 
Education, Energy, Labor, and Transportation and board up their doors.' 
But the process is far more complicated than that, so lawmakers need 
realistic advice on how you actually close down a government agency." 
Butler noted, "Some functions of these departments and the other 
agencies identified for extinction are necessary and proper, and worth 
continuing. The bureaucratic edifices within which these isolated 
programs now operate, however, are totally unnecessary and should be 
eliminated." Butler added that Heritage analysts already have been 
working with congressional task forces on how to conduct "radical 
surgery" on the government.<p>
<center><h3>Federalism, Privatization, Reorganization, Elimination</center></h3><p>
The Heritage budget plan was written by a team of analysts including 
Scott Hodge, Grover M. Hermann Fellow in Federal Budgetary Affairs, 
Ronald Utt, a visiting fellow and former director of privatization 
programs for the Office of Management and Budget, and Baker Spring, 
Heritage's senior defense policy analyst.<p>
To accomplish the objective of balancing the budget by the year 2002, 
while providing taxpayers with a "fiscal responsibility (tax-cut) 
dividend," the plan would:<p>
Limit the overall rate of increase in federal spending to just over 1 
percent per year. "Capping total spending [increases] ... does not mean 
every program must grow at that rate," Butler said. "It means that, taken 
together, programs cannot exceed that limit. If some high-priority 
programs grow faster," he added, "others must grow more slowly and 
others may have to be terminated." If Congress can't muster the political 
courage to make the cuts needed to stay within the legally binding 
ceiling, a bipartisan spending reduction commission -- similar to the 
military base-closing commission -- would be appointed, rather than 
instituting an across-the-board "sequester."<p>
Transfer to state and local governments programs more appropriately 
carried out at those levels of government. For example, more than 70 
means-tested anti-poverty programs, currently administered by the 
Departments of Agriculture, Education, Energy, Health and Human 
Services, and Housing and Urban Development, would be included in a 
new welfare block grant that would be given to the states. The Heritage 
Foundation plan also would transfer most federal lands to the states, 
except for national parks and wilderness areas that are deemed to be "of 
national significance," and end the "earmarking" of funds for local 
transportation and other projects.<p>
Butler explained: "Congress should enact a federal budget that makes 
clear that the first responsibility of the federal government is an adequate 
national defense. Congress then should examine every other program to 
determine whether it is truly national in scope and can be carried out on a 
national scale only by the federal government. Funding for all agencies 
and programs that don't meet this test, such as many education, welfare, 
health (and) transportation ... programs should be transferred to the states, 
or the money returned to the people as federal tax relief."<p>
Privatize all commercial activities of government. The proposal calls for 
the sale of the following federal assets: the $200 billion federal direct-
loan portfolio; Amtrak; the federal Power Marketing Administrations; the 
hydroelectric dams currently operated by the Army Corps of Engineers 
and Bureau of Reclamation; most of the National Weather Service; the 
Naval Petroleum Reserve, Strategic Petroleum Reserve, Federal Helium 
Reserves, and U.S. Uranium Enrichment Corporation; many real-estate 
holdings; and most of the 1,200 non-defense aircraft owned by the 
government.<p>
Eliminate corporate welfare. The Heritage Foundation budget plan would 
terminate dozens of programs that directly or indirectly subsidize private 
businesses, including all agricultural subsidies and commercial 
agricultural research programs, energy research programs, NASA's 
commercial aeronautic research and development programs, export credit 
guarantee programs, and export enhancement and "market promotion" 
programs. Also headed for the chopping block: Airport Grants-in-Aid 
and Essential Air Service Program (Transportation Department), Bureau 
of Export Administration (Commerce), Corporation for Public 
Broadcasting (independent), Economic Development Administration 
(Commerce), Farmers Home Administration and Farm Credit System 
(Agriculture), International Trade Administration (Commerce), Minority 
Business Development Agency (Commerce), Next Generation High-
Speed Rail Program (Transportation), Small Business Administration 
(independent), and U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration (Commerce). 
All government ties and taxpayer guarantees to the Federal Home Loan 
Bank System, Federal National Mortgage Association, Federal Home 
Loan Mortgage Corp., and Government National Mortgage Association 
would be terminated.<p>
End programs that don't work, "have become outmoded or obsolete, that 
duplicate other programs, or that do not involve legitimate government 
functions."<p>
"Because outmoded, obsolete, or inefficient programs almost never die, 
bureaus, agencies and programs that duplicate each other's function's 
have sprung up all over the government," Butler observed. Vice President 
Al Gore's National Performance Review, for example, noted that 14 
separate government departments and agencies spend $24 billion a year 
on 150 employment and training programs; 11 different federal 
departments and agencies administer 340 separate programs for families 
and children; and the Department of Commerce shares its mission with at 
least 7l federal departments, agencies and offices.<p>
The Heritage Foundation budget plan would close down many of the 
government's 1,200 "independent commissions, councils and boards," 
would sharply reduce the size and scope of the 170-year-old Army Corps 
of Engineers, and would close down, among other agencies, the 85-year-
old Bureau of Mines (Interior Department), 81-year-old Agricultural 
Extension Service (Agriculture), the 60-year-old Soil Conservation 
Service (Agriculture: now called the Natural Resource Conservation 
Service), the 60-year-old Rural Electrification Administration 
(Agriculture: now called the Rural Utilities Service); the 70-year-old 
National Fertilizer Development Center (part of the independent 
Tennessee Valley Authority: now called the TVA Environmental 
Research Center), and the 108-year-old Interstate Commerce 
Commission (independent).<p>
Butler said, "This is not the time to be timid. The federal government 
now consists of layer upon layer of bureaucratic waste, duplication and 
inefficiency. This was documented during the Reagan era by the Grace 
Commission and more recently by Vice President Gore's National 
Performance Review. "In addition, the federal bureaucracy has been 
assigned, or has assigned to itself, numerous tasks that are best left to the 
states, the private sector, or individuals.<p>
"Rather than tinkering at the margins, Washington needs to act with 
intelligence and resolve. We hope the Heritage budget plan will inspire 
the Congress and White House to accept the challenge."<p>

<p>
<font size=+3>C</font>ontrary to the impression left by the recent O.J. Simpson 
trial, a large majority of black Americans support get-tough efforts to combat 
crime.
<p>
According to FRC's newly released Family Issues Survey, 82 percent
of blacks favor &quot;requiring convicted criminals to work while serving their 
sentence.&quot; Seventy-seven percent favor &quot;requiring convicted criminals 
to pay their victims and their victims' families financial compensation for the
pain, suffering, and economic hardship they caused.&quot;  Moreover,
85 percent of blacks favor &quot;requiring criminals to undergo drug tests to show 
that they are drug-free before completing their sentence.&quot;
<p>
<center><h3>Choose Life</h3></center>
<p>
The FRC poll, conducted by the Voter/Consumer Research Firm, also
found that:
<p>
<li><b>Adoption is considered the best response -- and abortion the
worst response -- to an unwed pregnancy.</b>
<p>
When asked what is the best response to an unmarried pregnancy,
29 percent choose adoption, 24 percent say marrying the child's father, 11 
percent choose single motherhood, eight percent opt for abortion, and the 
rest either volunteer that &quot;it depends&quot; or say they &quot;don't 
know.&quot; Conversely, when asked which of these options would be worst, 55 
percent say abortion, 13 percent say single motherhood, 12 percent say marrying 
the child's father, and six percent choose adoption.
<p>
<li><b>Most Americans -- including rank-and-file pro-lifers -- strongly
oppose subsidizing illegitimate births.</b>
<p>
Opposition runs strong and deep to &quot;increasing a welfare
mother's monthly welfare check if she has another child out of wedlock.&quot; 
Two-thirds (66 percent) say they &quot;strongly&quot; oppose such
increases.  Another 18 percent &quot;somewhat&quot; oppose welfare
benefit increases for illegitimacy. 
<p>
Only 13 percent say these increases are justified. Among those
who &quot;strongly&quot; favor laws against abortion, 70 percent 
&quot;strongly&quot; support the family cap, and another 16 percent 
&quot;somewhat&quot; support this measure.
<p>
<li><b>The religiously devout are more apt to give and volunteer --
and say they would do more if government welfare programs were dramatically 
cut or abolished.</b>
<p>
People who attend worship services at least once a week report
higher levels of giving (97 percent) and volunteering (79 percent) than any 
other demographic group. Frequent churchgoers are also more likely to say they 
would give and volunteer more if &quot;government welfare programs
were cut back dramatically, or abolished.&quot;
<p>
<li><b>Even young people think today's popular culture encourages
teen sex, violence and drug use.</b>
<p>
When asked to assess the degree to which today's movies, television,
and music lyrics encourage teenage sex, 63 percent of young Americans say 
&quot;a great deal&quot; or &quot;quite a lot.&quot;  Fifty-six percent
offer identical responses to a question about the entertainment
industry's role in encouraging violent crime, and 47 percent say the same 
about pop culture's contribution to alcohol and drug abuse. Moreover, 75 percent 
of Americans aged 18 to 30 either &quot;strongly&quot; or &quot;somewhat&quot; 
agree with the statement, &quot;The values promoted in today's movies,
on TV, and in music lyrics do not represent my own views.&quot;
<p>
<li><b>Single parents say families need help shielding kids from harmful
cultural influences.</b>
<P>
Only 36 percent of all single parents -- and 33 percent of divorcees
-- say parents can adequately shield children from violent or sexually-explicit 
material by themselves.  Better than 60 percent of single parents agree 
with the statement, &quot;These days, it is too difficult for parents to deal 
with this alone.&quot;  Moreover, 92 percent of all those surveyed say they
do not believe public libraries should make <i>Playboy</i> magazine available 
to children without parental permission.

Roughly four out of five Americans (79 percent) favor tax relief
for families raising children. Sixty-one percent say they would rather have 
&quot;a permanent tax cut beginning next year&quot; than &quot;a
temporary tax cut beginning this year.&quot;  Only 26 percent

<h3>On the Hill</h3>
<p>
<b>Partial Victory.</b> Accommodating the request of a majority of senators,
a Senate Judiciary Committee hearing was held on the Partial-Birth Abortion 
Ban Act (H.R. 1833) on Nov. 17. The bill passed the House by vote of 288-139 
on Nov. 1, drawing the votes of such infrequent supporters of abortion limits 
as Minority Leader Richard Gephardt (D-Mo.) and freshman Rep.
Patrick Kennedy (D-R.I.).  Nurse Brenda Shafer told the Senate
committee that she assisted an Ohio abortionist with several partial-birth 
abortions, but was repulsed and then quit.  Senate floor action is likely 
before Dec. 7.  The Clinton White House continues to signal a veto.
<p><a name="gambling">
<b>Gambling Scourge.</b> Rep. Frank Wolf's bill (H.R. 497) to create
The National Gambling Impact and Policy Commission is gaining momentum. The 
bill, which has broad bipartisan support, does not outlaw, tax, or regulate 
gambling, but recognizes its growing influence. In 1993, Americans
made more trips to casinos than they did to major league ballparks.
 Today, casinos operate in 23 states, and 37 states have lotteries.  Studies 
show that gambling increases public corruption and other criminal activities. 
It cannibalizes legitimate businesses, and government's gambling-related
costs for regulation, lost productivity and family disintegration
outstrip the economic gain.
<p>
<b>Budget Break?</b> The battle between Congress and the White House
moved to the next stage Nov. 19 with an agreement to enact a balanced budget 
within seven years, using Congressional Budget Office (CBO) economic estimates. 
President Clinton reversed course and agreed to negotiate legislation by Jan. 
1 to achieve the zero deficit goal. Republican concessions on
spending control are likely.   FRC will work hard to keep the
$500-per-child tax credit in the GOP bill, as well as real spending limits 
to avoid leaving our children a legacy of debt.
<p>
<center><h3>Around Town</h3></center>
<p>
<b>Playing the Odds.</b> Gambling industry political action committees
(PAC) are influencing legislation such as proposals to tax gambling revenues 
and regulate the American Indian gaming boom.  Gambling is projected to grow 
to an $80-billion-per-year industry this decade. According to the Federal 
Election Commission, PACs gave $321,942 to the major political parties in 
1993-94, and four non-PAC industry gifts totaling $690,000 went to the 
Republican National Committee in 1994. Columnist William Safire warns 
that state-sponsored gambling is a &quot;cancer ravaging society, corrupting 
public officials and becoming the fastest-growing teenage addiction.&quot;
<p>
<b>Murphy Brown Sweeps.</b> According to a new Census Bureau report,
America is experiencing a rise in the number of Murphy Brown-style moms. 
The study, released in early November, shows that the proportion of 
college-educated, never-married women who have given birth has more
than doubled in the past 10 years, while the proportion of young,
single, black women giving birth has dropped. The report also says that 
the illegitimacy rate among all never-married white women rose from 6.7 
percent to 12.9 percent.  The greatest rise in this group was, indeed, among 
women who are managers and professionals.
<p><a name="divorce">
<b>Divorce, American Style.</b> The U.S. divorce rate dropped slightly
in 1994, but <i>The Economist</i> magazine reports that divorce is still more 
common in America than anywhere else in the world. To combat this problem, 
a growing number of pro-family state leaders are working to reform
divorce laws to protect individuals who want to save their marriages
rather than promote the interests of individuals initiating divorce proceedings. 
By a margin of 55 percent to 31 percent, Americans support such reforms, 
according to FRC's newly-released Family Issues Survey.
<p>
<center><h3>Across the Nation</h3></center>
<p>
<b>FRC Intervenes.</b> In a highly unusual move, the Fourth U.S. Circuit
Court of Appeals granted a motion Nov. 20 that will permit FRC to present 
oral arguments in a key case involving homosexuals in the military. The 
case <i>Thomasson v. Perry</i> is likely to reach the Supreme Court next 
year. FRC sought to intervene in the appeals court to argue that the
Clinton administration regulations at issue do not faithfully reflect 
Congressional intent and will result in allowing declared homosexuals 
to serve.  Melissa Wells-Petry, a former Army litigator, will represent 
FRC at the Dec. 5 hearing.
<p>
<b>Young Guns.</b> A quarter of those arrested on weapons charges are
juveniles, and such offenses are the fastest growing crime among adolescents. 
Juvenile weapons cases have grown 86 percent since 1985 to more than 61,000 
arrests last year, and teen gun violence has risen steadily even
though the number of teens has declined.  Weapons offenses include
illegal use, possession, importing or exporting of guns, ammunition and the 
like.  Attorney General Janet Reno warns, &quot;If the last decade's trends 
continue unchecked, juvenile arrests for violent crime will double by the
year 2010.&quot;
<p>
<b>Money Talks.</b> A record turnout of Maine voters narrowly rejected
a proposal on November's ballot to deny special rights to homosexuals.  Four 
hundred thousand voters took part in the 53 to 47 percent outcome.  
Pro-homosexual rights forces spent an unprecedented $1.2 million, 10 times 
more than those who oppose special rights.  Despite the close vote, 
homosexual activists are pushing ahead with their plans to introduce gay rights 
bills into the Maine legislature for the 10th time.  None has passed to date.

<h3>The Bare Non-Necessities</h3>
<p>
Did local schools notice the difference when 89 percent of the
U.S. Education Department's 5,500 employees were sent home as 
&quot;non-essential&quot; federal workers during the recent budget show-down? 
Equally unnoticeable is any improvement resulting from Washington D.C.'s 
recurrent attempts at top-down education reform:  National Education Goals,
the Goals Panel, Goals 2000, the National Standards for U.S. History.  With all 
the rhetoric and frenzy over initiatives with such visionary titles, you'd 
expect to see some results as 1995 draws to a close.
<p>
But when the National Education Goals Panel met in November to provide a 
halftime report on progress toward the eight National Education Goals, set in 
1990 for the year 2000, they could point to no significant improvement. 
&quot;Progress is spotty at best,&quot; said Albert Shanker, President of 
the American Federation of Teachers union.  The panelists urged patience; 
Americans put up $3 million this year to hear the Goals Panel stall for time.
<p>
Americans are growing increasingly impatient with dismal academic
test scores year after year. Recently released results from the 1994 
National Assessment of Educational Progress remain poor: less than a 
third of the students tested were proficient readers; 57 percent of high 
school seniors scored &quot;below basic&quot; in their knowledge of U.S.
history.  Writers of the National Standards for U.S. History released last 
year thought they could improve performance by imposing an official body 
of knowledge.  However, if the 30,000 copies already distributed make their 
way into classrooms, students will continue to know more about Madonna,
whom the standards mention, than they do about Robert E. Lee, whom the standards 
ignore.
<p>
Regrettably, our millions earmarked for education reform over
the past five years have been ill-spent on bureaucracy and systems management. 
Bill Bennett, former Secretary of Education, suggested in 1989, &quot;I'd 
give the education reform movement another five years.  If we're not able
to get our schools back to where they were in 1963, after spending
40 percent more, then maybe we should just declare bankruptcy, give the people 
back their money, and let them start their own schools.&quot;  Time's up. We 
want our money back.

<h3>We the Parents</h3>
<p>
FRC has taken its battle for parental rights to the Supreme
Court.  FRC joined forces with the Of the People Foundation and asked the 
high court to hear the case of Massachusetts students and parents who oppose 
a school district's program of condom distribution to junior high and high
school students.  A &quot;friend of the court&quot; petition was
filed on Nov. 15.
<p>
In early 1992 the Falmouth School District adopted a policy
whereby school nurses were instructed to distribute free condoms to students 
as young as 11 years old -- even over their parents' objections.  Condom 
machines were also installed in high school student restrooms. FRC's brief 
argues that the program violates the parents' right to direct the upbringing 
of their children as well as the right to free exercise of religion.
<p>
In 1993, New York's highest court ruled that an identical public school 
condom distribution program violated the right of parents to rear their children 
as they see fit.
<p>
This dispute highlights the need for legislation to acknowledge
and solidify parents' fundamental rights.  To accomplish this, Sen. Charles 
Grassley (R-Iowa) and Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) have introduced the 
Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act of 1995 (H.R. 1946).  The
act establishes the fundamental right of parents to direct and
provide for the education and religious teaching of their children, and also 
addresses health care decisions and reasonable corporal discipline. Importantly, 
the act allows the government to intervene when it has a compelling interest 
to do so, and has specific allowances for cases of child abuse and neglect.
<p>
Support this much-needed legislation by calling or writing
your representatives today.

<center><font size=+2><b><i>Looking for Lincoln</i></b></font><br>
by Gary L. Bauer</center>
<p>
<font size=+3>G</font>en. Colin L. Powell has declined to run for President in 
1996. He has also said that he will not accept the Vice Presidency, though 
time may change this decision. Finally, he is joining the Republican party. 
These are crucial decisions.
<p>
As everyone knows by now, Powell had described himself as 
&quot;pro-choice&quot; on abortion during an interview with ABC's 
Barbara Walters on the eve of his national book tour.  That position, 
combined with the warm reaction to his candidacy among some conservative
leaders in Washington, raised the real possibility that, for the first time 
in two decades, the Republican platform next year would reflect a 
&quot;pro-choice&quot; position on abortion.
<p>
The media response to this prospect, as well as to Powell, was
wild excitement.  From a strict news sense, it's not hard to understand why. 
A Powell candidacy presented historic opportunities: the nomination and 
possible election of the first black American President. Second, a GOP 
abandonment of its pro-life plank would have caused an earthquake
on the American political landscape.  Earthquakes are hard news.
<p>
The Republican Platform calls for a constitutional amendment to provide legal 
protection for the unborn.  It also calls for the appointment of judges who 
respect traditional values and the sanctity of innocent human life.  Has it 
made much difference?  One conservative leader has said that a pro-choice 
president like Powell &quot;could do more to lower the number of abortions 
than a presidential candidate who claims to be pro-life, who supports a 
constitutional amendment to ban abortions, but who does nothing more than pay 
lip-service to the pro-life constituency.&quot;
<p>
Of course, pro-life Americans want no part of this leader's dilemma.
 They prefer a third way: someone, Republican or Democratic, who not only claims 
to be, but is, pro-life, who supports full legal protection for the unborn, 
and who will pay service to that goal in both speech and action.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>PERSISTENCE ISN'T<br>
ALWAYS APPRECIATED.</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
So why are pro-life Americans so often made to feel like skunks at the wedding 
party?  Partly, I'm sure, it's because nothing is more alien to the modern 
American mind than a moral absolute, even when that absolute is the 
overwhelming duty to refrain from taking innocent human life.  Second,
there is the matter of persistence.  It isn't always appreciated.
<p>
In his <i>Lincoln: The War Years</i>, Carl Sandburg retells the story
of a White House reception after Lincoln's Second Inaugural. Frederick 
Douglass, the black anti-slavery leader, tried to enter the White House 
to greet the President.  Guards barred his way.  Douglass eluded them 
and rushed through the door.  He was seized and escorted to a plank that
led outside through a window. Once again on the street, he asked a 
passerby entering the White House to tell Lincoln that &quot;Frederick 
Douglass is detained by officers at the door.&quot;
<p>
Hearing the news, Lincoln invited Douglass into the East Room, and the 
journalist finally greeted the reelected president.  Lincoln told Douglass 
that he had seen him in the crowd listening to his address. &quot;There 
is no man's opinion that I value more than yours,&quot; Lincoln told him, 
&quot;what do you think of it?&quot;  Douglass replied, &quot;Mr. Lincoln, 
it was a sacred effort.&quot;
<p>
In this world of slippery slope relativism, where rights to do
wrong are enshrined among our political commandments, the pro-life cause 
is often treated like an unwelcome guest.  As 1996 approaches, some of 
the political &quot;palace guards&quot; are already trying to show us to the 
window again.  As they do so, we could use a little of the spirit of
Frederick Douglass.  After all, this cause is a sacred effort, too.

Dear Cleta:

     I live in Maryland and my congresswoman is Connie 
Morella.  She voted against term limits and other significant 
items in the Contract with America.  Everyone says she is 
unbeatable. Is that true and is there anything I can do to mount 
a campaign against her?

                     Taxed but not represented in Maryland
</pre>
<p>

Dear Taxed:
<p>
<dd>You're right.  Connie Morella is disgusting.  She votes wrong on most things.  I know, because she's my congresswoman, too...  Here are some suggestions if you are serious about replacing her:
<p>
<dd>First, this is a long term proposition -- it isn't going to be done overnight.  It will take at least 18 months of planning a campaign to get rid of her, and it might take two election cycles of intense effort.  It is difficult to get rid of an incumbent member of Congress without an infusion of major dollars and assistance like the labor unions are presently pouring into beating up on some of the freshmen.
<p>
<dd>Second, a small group of 5 to 10 people, dedicated to ridding the Congress of Rep. Morella should begin meeting monthly through the end of this year.  Who should come to the meeting?  People with a sincere desire to beat Connie Morella -- and at least one or two people who have been involved in politics in some form prior to this effort. The information at the meeting should include a map of the district and the voting patterns in both the GOP and Democratic primaries as well as the general elections from the past 3 cycles.  
<p>
<dd>Third, form some task forces: research (to gather information about her record); candidate recruitment (to develop a list of possible opponents for Rep. Morella); third, outreach (to develop a plan for broadening the circle of activists plotting her overthrow); fourth, finance (you can't do this for free).
<p>
<dd>Watch the fall campaign carefully and continue to meet monthly through December.  By then, you should have complete research on her record through this Congress and a sense of what it's going to take to beat her in two years.  When you've got that all assembled, write me again and we'll go from there.  
<p>
<dd>This is a good project.  I hope you'll do it.

<a name="un"><h2><i>UN:  Bound for Beijing</i></h2></center>
<p>
<font size=+3>F</font>rom Sept. 4-15, 1995, the United Nations (UN) will hold
its Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China.  The United
States will be sending a delegation to the conference -- despite
the objections of pro-familiy advocates.  First Lady Hillary Clinton
was originally slated to attend, but at latest word will not,
due to China's imprisonment of American human rights activist
Harry Wu.
<p>
<center><h3>Bracketing the Family</h3></center>
<p>
This conference purports to advance women's rights.  However,
many pro-family groups, including FRC, oppose the Beijing conference
agenda for the very reason that it denigrates women and families,
reflecting a radical feminist agenda.  For, not only is the conference
being hosted by a country with a long track record of abusing
women (e.g., female infanticide, coercive abortion policies),
but the platform document:
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+2>"<font size=+3>M</font>OTHER" IS BRACKETED<br>
FOR REPLACEMENT.</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<b>Denigrates motherhood and traditional family life.</b> For example,
the word &quot;mother&quot; has been bracketed throughout the
entire platform so that it might be changed to the term &quot;caretaker.&quot;
 Similarly, the word &quot;family&quot; has been bracketed for
change to &quot;household.&quot;  Bracketed sections indicate
that delegates could not agree in advance on the text.  These
sections are to be debated in Beijing.  In addition, the word
&quot;family&quot; almost always appears in a negative context,
i.e., in relation to domestic violence or female oppression.
<p>
<b>Devalues the husband-wife relationship to a mere power play.</b>
  Consider paragraph 198 of the platform:  &quot;Inequality in
the public arena can often start within the family when power
relations between men and women are unbalanced with discriminatory
attitudes and practices within the family.  The unequal division
of labour and responsibilities within households based on unequal
power relations also limits women's potential...&quot;  Thus,
rather than acknowledging marriage as a cooperative partnership,
the platform pits one mate against the other.  Notably, the words
&quot;wife&quot; and &quot;husband&quot; are never used.
<p>
<b>Leaves the term &quot;gender&quot; open for interpretation.</b>
 &quot;Gender&quot; appears more than 200 times in the platform
document.  But when asked to define the term, the UN rejected
the suggestion that there are two genders: &quot;male&quot; and
&quot;female.&quot;  The UN also rejected the definition of &quot;gender&quot;
as &quot;the socially-constructed roles which society assigns
to men and women.&quot;  In feminist literature, this definition
means that gender is subject to change and there exists a spectrum
of genders, perhaps even five (e.g., male heterosexual, female
heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, and transsexual).  Instead,
the UN decided that &quot;gender&quot; was to be understood &quot;in
its commonly accepted meaning.&quot;  The definition battle will
be a major focus in Beijing.
<p>
<b>Undermines parental authority in reproductive health decisions.</b>
 The platform repeatedly states that governments should &quot;emphasize
the role and responsibility of adolescents in sexual and reproductive
behavior through the provision of appropriate services and counseling[.]&quot;
 While occasionally mentioning the legal responsibility of parents
for their children, the platform refuses to recognize parental
authority regarding their children's reproductive health.
<p>
<b>Promotes abortion and contraception as reproductive &quot;rights.&quot;</b>
  In the tradition of previous UN conferences in Cairo and Copenhagen,
the Beijing platform urges governments to &quot;take action to
ensure that women's sexual and reproductive rights are fully recognized
and respected&quot; (paragraph 232).  In fact, the platform elevates
reproductive &quot;rights&quot; above all other rights, stating
that &quot;the ability of women to control their own fertility
forms an important basis for their enjoyment of other rights&quot;
(paragraph 98).
<p>
<center><h3>What You Can Do</h3></center>
<p>
Contact your representative and senators, either in Washington
or at their in-state office.  Tell them to speak out against the
Beijing conference, publicizing its violations of women's fundamental
dignity.

<h3>On The Hill</h3>
<p><a name="issues">
<b>The House Holds.</b> Before adjourning for its August vacation, the
House of Representatives passed two amendments to curb U.S. promotion
of abortion overseas.  Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) led the fight
to prevent U.S. funding of groups that seek to overturn the anti-abortion
laws of sovereign nations.  The Smith amendments would also deny
U.S. aid to the UN Population Fund (UNFPA) if it continues to
participate in China's coercive population control program.  Sen.
Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) intends to offer the same amendment to S.
908, the State Department authorization bill.
<p>
<b>Pro-Family Sendoff.</b> U.S. delegates to the Beijing Women's Conference
received pro-family instructions from the Senate on August 1.
 Senator Kay Bailey Hutchison (R-Tex.) offered an amendment which
called on the U.S. delegation to promote a representative perspective
on the value of motherhood and the traditional family.  The amendment
also urged the delegates to define &quot;gender&quot; classically,
as in &quot;male and female, the two sexes of the human being.&quot;
 Pro-family delegates and observers participating in pre-conference
negotiations at the UN headquarters in New York were energized
by passage of the resolution.
<p>
<b>Pop Aid Bust.</b> The foreign aid bill passed by the House in July
will make it more difficult for the Clinton Administration to
carry out its population control agenda.  The &quot;development
assistance&quot; account, which has traditionally provided hundreds
of millions of dollars each year for international population
projects, was substantially reduced and a separate account was
dedicated to child survival and disease prevention efforts.  Pro-family
forces will now try to persuade the Senate to go along with the
reduced anti-population money.
<p><a name="alphabet">
<center><h3>The United Nations at Half-Century: A Primer</h3></center>
<p>
<font size=+2>T</font>he messages of congratulation poured in from all over the
world.   President Truman thanked Almighty God for bringing the
world community so far in its search for peace.  South African
Prime Minister Jan Christian Smuts called its Charter &quot;not
a perfect document, by any means . . . But at least it is a good,
practical, workmanlike plan for peace.&quot;  As he presided over
the final vote to create the United Nations, taken on June 25,
1945, Britain's Lord Halifax expressed the hope that the delegates
had taken part &quot;in one of the great moments of history.&quot;
<p>
To carry out its charter, the United Nations has, over time,
created an alphabet soup of commissions and agencies.  Some of
these entities have social and economic missions; others have
military missions.  Recently, peacekeeping activities by UN agencies
in such trouble spots as Somalia (UNISOM), Haiti (UNMIH) and the
former Yugoslavia (UNPROFOR) have raised serious questions about
the world body's effectiveness and its proper role.  
<p>
The UN has grown with the decolonization of major European
powers and the breakup of the Soviet empire. The major bodies
of the UN have different functions. The UN's annual budget is
$4 billion. The U.S. contribution, according to our Mission to
the UN, is between $1 billion and $1.5 billion.  UN documents
are printed  in the five official languages: English, French,
Spanish, Chinese and Russian.   Unless otherwise indicated, the
UN body described below is headquartered in New York.
<p>
<b>The General Assembly.</b>  The largest UN body, the General Assembly
is comprised of 185 member states.  Each member has one vote in
the General Assembly.  The General Assembly has authorized many
of the key UN agencies which have a direct impact on families.
 These include the UN Conference on Trade and Development (UNCTAD),
the UN Fund for Population Activities (UNFPA), the United Nations
Children's Fund (UNICEF), and the UN Development Fund for Women
(UNIFEM).
<p>
<b>The Secretariat.</b> This body is headed by the Secretary-General,
who reports to the General Assembly.  He supervises executive
functions of the UN.  The Secretary-General has traditionally
been selected from the ranks of the &quot;non-aligned&quot; nations.
 Boutros Boutros-Ghali (Egypt) currently serves in the post.
<p>
<b>The Security Council.</b>  The Security Council consists of 15
members.  Five of these -- Russia, China, the U.S., Britain and
France -- have veto powers over council actions.  The Council
is charged with responding to threats to peace.
<p>
<b>The Economic and Social Council.</b>  The 54 members of this
body are elected to terms by the General Assembly.  It is responsible
for UN efforts in the economic and social areas.  It includes
many specialized agencies.  Among them are the Food and Agriculture
Organization (FAO, Rome), the World Health Organization (WHO,
Geneva), the International Labor Organization (ILO, Geneva), the
very influential International Monetary Fund (IMF, Washington),
the newly created World Trade Organization (WTO), and the United
Nations Educational, Scientific and Cultural Organization (UNESCO,
Paris). 
<p>
<b>The International Court of Justice (World Court, The Hague,
Netherlands).</b> The 15 judges are elected to nine-year terms by
the General Assembly and the Security Council.  Questions are
decided by majority vote.  All members of the UN are members of
the World Court, as are non-members Switzerland, San Marino and
Liechtenstein.

<p><a name="convention">
<font size=+3><i>The</i></font> United Nations Convention on the Rights of the Child
(UNCRC) was approved by the UN General Assembly on Nov. 20, 1989.
 It was in force on Sept. 2, 1990 after the 20th nation ratified
it.
<p>
The United States Ambassador to the United Nations, Madeleine
Albright, signed the treaty on Feb. 16, 1995.  President Clinton
has said that the U.S. will spell out its interpretation of the
Convention with a statement of  &quot;reservations and understandings&quot;
that will go to the Senate.
<p>
A treaty becomes law in this country if the U.S. Senate ratifies
it by a two-thirds vote (67 Senators, if all are present).  This
has not yet happened and seems unlikely because Sen. Jesse Helms
(R-N.C.), a strong opponent of the Convention, is chairman of
the Senate Foreign Relations Committee, which must review it.
<p>
In fact, on June 14, Helms introduced S. R. 133.  This resolution
expresses the sense of the Senate that &quot;the primary safeguard
for the well-being and protection of children is the family, and
that, because the United Nations Convention on the Rights of the
Child could undermine the rights of the family, the President
should not sign and transmit it to the Senate.&quot;  Twenty-three
Senators are cosponsors.
<p>
As an international treaty, the UNCRC would be co-equal with
federal statutes, and possibly the United States Constitution.
 If the United States were to ratify the treaty as it stands,
it would become not only an international obligation, but also
a domestic obligation potentially regulating the most intimate
details of American family life. 
<p>
Several articles in the Convention grant children new rights
independent of their parents and families.  In the U.S. today,
children's rights are, in effect, held in trust by their parents.
 Under the Convention, children would hold those rights themselves.
 Conceivably, taking a child to church, when he would rather not
go, could be a violation of the child's right to freedom of religion
(Article 14); telling a child to turn off the television could
violate the child's right &quot;to seek, receive, and impart information&quot;
(Article 13), and so forth. 
<p>
The Convention on the Rights of the Child is a risk America's
families do not need -- and cannot afford -- to take.

<a name="march"><center><h3>The UN and the Family: Major Documents</h3></center>
<p>
<font size=+2>T</font>he United Nations was founded in the shadow of the Second
World War, a renewed attempt by the victorious democracies to
establish an international body to safeguard the peace and promote
human rights.  From the beginning, with the drafting of the UN
Charter and related documents such as the Universal Declaration
of Human Rights, the UN has attempted to give voice to the common
aspirations of the world's people.  Only within the past two decades
has the UN expanded its agenda in ways that pose direct threats
to the traditional family.
<p>
Here are some major landmarks in the history of UN advocacy
regarding marriage and the family:
<p>
<b>Universal Declaration of Human Rights.</b> Article 16 asserts
the right &quot;to marry and to found a family,&quot; provides
that marriage must be entered into &quot;freely&quot; by the spouses,
and defines the family &quot;as the natural and fundamental group
unit of society . . . entitled to protection by society and the
state.&quot;  The Declaration was adopted by the UN General Assembly
in 1948.
<p>
<b>International Covenant on Economic, Social and Cultural Rights.</b>
 The Covenant, which is in treaty form, promotes special measures
to protect the family, mothers, and children.  Article 10 repeats
the definition of family in the <b>Universal Declaration</b> and calls
for &quot;the widest possible protection and assistance&quot;
to the family. Addresses such issues as family leave and child
labor.
<p>
<b>International Covenant on Civil and Political Rights.</b> Article
23 of the Covenant uses the same definition of family as the <b>Universal
Declaration</b>, and requires nations that have ratified the Covenant
&quot;to ensure equality of rights and responsibilities of spouses
as to marriage[.]&quot;
<p>
<b>Convention on the Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination
Against Women.</b> Article 12 introduces language requiring nations
to ensure access to health care, including family planning.  Like
the <b>Universal Declaration</b>, it speaks clearly of &quot;men&quot;
and &quot;women&quot; in these contexts.  Article 16 enumerates
eight specific rights as regards marriage, with emphasis on equality
of rights regarding children and property and the &quot;right
to decide freely and responsibly on the number and spacing of
their children[.]&quot; The United States has not ratified this
Convention.
<p>
<b>International Year of the Family (IYF).</b> First proposed in
1987, the year was actually celebrated in 1994.  In the best modern
UN mode, Secretary General Boutros-Ghali announced that &quot;[t]here
is no single definition of a family.  There is no one model.&quot;
 An IYF document, &quot;The Changing Family Structure,&quot; lumped
together everything from &quot;polygamous&quot; and &quot;community&quot;
families to &quot;biological&quot; and &quot;adoptive&quot; families.
 &quot;Same-sex&quot; families also get equal footing in the document.
<p><hr width=65%><p>
<h3><center>NGO: FRC and the UN</center></h3>
<p>
&quot;NGO&quot; is one of the most commonly heard terms in
UN-speak.  It stands for &quot;Non-Governmental Organization,&quot;
and refers to private associations specifically recognized and
consulted by the United Nations.  Examples include the International
Red Cross, Amnesty International, Greenpeace, and Planned Parenthood.
 NGOs are first mentioned in the UN Charter of 1945 as important
resources for the General Assembly and the various commissions
it creates to address specific issues.
<p>
NGOs may be international or merely national in scope.  Their
number is large (some 1,500) and growing.  The presence of UN
Headquarters in New York City has given New York-based NGOs a
considerable advantage in lobbying the UN on a daily basis.  Some
NGOs, like WEDO, led by former Congresswoman Bella Abzug and a
major participant in UN conferences on population and the environment,
are almost fully funded by foundation money.  Others are grassroots-oriented.
<p>
NGO status can be permanent or temporary, allowing a group
access to the UN generally or merely to specific conferences.
 The Family Research Council was granted NGO status for the world
population conference in Copenhagen, Denmark, in 1994.  FRC has
also obtained NGO status for Beijing (<i>see earlier article</i>).  This status
does not allow FRC to vote on the Beijing Plan, but it <i>will</i> make
us more effective eyes and ears for the American family.

<center><b><font size=+2><i>What So Proudly We Hail?</i></font></b><br>
by Gary L. Bauer</center>
<p>
Americans have historically sacrificed for peace. We went
to war twice in this century for the peace and freedom of Europe.
 Americans fought and died defending the independence of Korea,
Vietnam, Grenada, Kuwait and Saudi Arabia.  Most recently, Americans
have shouldered the burden of famine relief in strife-torn Somalia.
The American people and their government respond generously to
natural disasters. 
<p>
America has taken a leading role in supporting the United
Nations, too.  From 1945 on, the U.S. provided the greater part
of UN funding and support.  President Kennedy defended the world
organization when the Soviets tried to hamstring it with a three-man
troika in place of its single Secretary-General.  That formula
would have guaranteed paralysis -- which is what the Soviets really
wanted.
<p>
Despite this record, the UN has often been a three-ring circus
of anti-Americanism.  The U.S. has regularly been denounced as
&quot;imperialist&quot; and a &quot;war monger&quot; during what
passed for UN debates.  Efforts to empower the nations of the
&quot;South&quot; by levying confiscatory assessments on the free
industrial democracies of the &quot;North&quot; have been popular
among all too many members of the General Assembly.  Third World
delegates have cheered the so-called New World Information Order,
which is nothing more than a dignified name for press muzzling
by tinpot despots. 
<p>
Still, Americans have remained largely willing to tolerate
the UN as an important forum for international discussion.  For
the sake of peace, we have gone the extra mile.  Recent stories
about UN diplomats who have run up thousands of parking violations
in New York City and who have stiffed the Big Apple's merchants
to the tune of millions have struck nerves, however.  No warm
and fuzzy talk of &quot;cultural disparities&quot; should cover
the obvious truth:  a ripoff is a ripoff.
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
<center><i><font size=+3>UN E</font><font size=+2>XPANSION</font> 
 <font size=+3>T</font><font size=+2>HREATENS</font><br>
<font size=+3>U.S. S</font><font size=+2>OVEREIGNTY</font></i></center>
<p><hr width=45% size=2><p>
This corruption is far less troubling than the new trend
toward building an army of &quot;blue helmets&quot; to police
the world.  UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali has moved
aggressively since the collapse of the Soviet Union to assert
a new doctrine of sovereignty. <i>Sovereignty</i>. That's a key word
and concept.  Americans recognize it better by referring to our
founding document, the Declaration of Independence.  That document
set forth our right to stand &quot;among the powers of the earth&quot;
as a free and equal nation.
<p>
The Secretary General's expansive view of UN authority is
not just an opinion.  The UN fielded only two peacekeeping missions
in its first five years, but it has dispatched the blue helmet
19 times in the past four years.  Many have greater ambitions
still.  Former Soviet leader Mikhail Gorbachev, a communist, is
pushing a worldwide environmental initiative which sees a major
role for the UN.  Former French President Francois Mitterand,
a socialist, advocates the creation of a &quot;UN Legion&quot;
to give military teeth to the UN's resolutions. 
<p>
Veteran liberal Ronnie Dugger would go even further.  He
writes in <i>The New York Times</i> that if the member states are unwilling
or unable to man a UN Legion, the UN should accept volunteers
from the recognized Non-Governmental Organizations (NGOs).  These
private groups are playing an increasing role in UN activities.
 The <i>Rainbow Warrior</i>, the Greenpeace ship that has confronted
whalers and nuclear test personnel, might be the first of a whole
fleet under the Dugger plan.
<p>
All of these suggestions come at a time of growing UN military
focus.  The UN Department of Peacekeeping has expanded from a
staff of 23 to more than 350 today, with a modern &quot;situation
center,&quot; staffed 24 hours a day.  What are the limits to
this mushrooming role?
<p>
As we watch the UN's Beijing Conference on Women, we should
each ask ourselves:  what if an army had the power to enforce
the resolutions passed by these delegates?  Would Americans remain
free and independent? I once considered such questions idle speculation.
 Not anymore.

<P>
	I am not the kind of guy who normally takes part in feminist "consciousness-raising" efforts.  But I am participating in Take Your Daughter to Work Day today because I have an eight-year-old daughter whose self-esteem matters a great deal to me.
<P>
	For the uninitiated, Take Your Daughter To Work Day is an annual event dreamed up by the Ms. Foundation in response to research showing that girls' self-esteem often plummets during the fragile pre-teen and early adolescent years.  By exposing young girls to successful women in the workplace, organizers hope that girls will learn to think more highly of females in general and of themselves in particular.
<P>
	I have a great day planned for my daughter, Allison.  This morning, I plan to take her by the offices of two women whose job it is to meet regularly with members of Congress and other public officials.  Then, I plan to have her talk with a young woman who just finished graduate school at Johns Hopkins University and is now serving as a health policy analyst.  At lunch, she'll chat with a woman who does some public speaking, and another who crunches numbers in our accounting department.  Finally, in the late afternoon, Allison is scheduled to meet with a woman who used to practice law and now manages a bevy of staff writers.
<P>
	I am sure all of this will be interesting to Allison.  But the time I am most looking forward to is the ride home.  For it is then that I plan to point out to my daughter that some of the exciting tasks carried out by my female colleagues in the workplace are tasks my wife performed in jobs she held prior to motherhood.  She used to meet regularly with congressmen and senators.  She used to do some writing and public speaking.  And she has a Phi Beta Kappa key from hr college days.
<P>
	After I remind my daughter of these things, I plan to turn to her and look her in the eye and say, "Allison, you must be a very special young girl.  Your mother could be using her talents and skills in all sorts of jobs in the workplace, but she has chosen instead to use them at home teaching you.  She must love you very, very much and think you are very, very important."
<P>
	Somehow, I think that at that moment my daughter' self-esteem will rise to a level heretofore unimagined by the organizers of Take Your Daughter to Work Day.  And for that I owe debt of gratitude to my wife, whose esteem-building job as a mother at home rarely receives the public esteem it deserves.
<P>

<TITLE>Donor Profile:  Steven P.J. Wood</TITLE>
</HEAD>
<BODY>
<H1>Integrity and charity in business</H1>
<H3><FONT COLOR=#808080>Steve Wood builds for the future of conservative values</FONT></H3>

<H5><I>BY DAVID J. LINTON</I></H5>

<DD>	If your lawyer privately lauds your good judgment, decisiveness and business success, it's safe to bet you're capable.
<DD>	If your subordinate remarks on your warm-hearted treatment of your factory workers, you're truly generous.
<DD>	If your secretary of more than thirty years admires your caring attitude, you must be a gentleman.  
<DD>	And if they all three commend your personal integrity, generous spirit and professional skill, then you must be Steven P. J. Wooda rare individual, an unsung American hero. 
<DD>	Or just a traditional Midwesterner.
<DD>	Steven P.J. Wood clearly prefers the latter description.  He sees himself as a fairly ordinary Midwesterner who tries to do his civic duty.  And he modestly attributes his business success to  "50% luck and 50% putting the right people in the right jobs."
<DD>	But some of the credit must go to this unusually humble man whose commitment to the conservative philosophy and concern for future generations led him to give the Leadership Institute the largest single donation in its history: $1 million.


<P><B>A conservative commitment to community</B>
<DD>	Steven Pierpont Jeffris Wood grew up in Janesville Wisconsin, a small town of about 25,000.  His father was a lawyer.  He had two siblings, a brother and a sister.  He describes his family as, "very conservative, a typical small-town family."
<DD>	Wood began his education in the Janesville public schools.  He continued at Phillips Exeter Academy.  Then he attended Princeton University and the University of Chicago in a campus environment "much more conservative and serious" than one finds these days.  
<DD>	Wood served in the army in WWII, where he was a staff officer with the Third Armored Division and with the VI Corps in Germany.  
<DD>	After the war, Wood worked for his father-in-law briefly.  Then he returned to his native Wisconson to work at a company struggling to recover from the Great Depression.
<DD>	Wood said, "My father and three friends had invested in Warner Electric to rescue it during the Great Depression.  They planned to sell the company, but a good opportunity never arose.  So my father offered me the chance to work at the company.  It was my first really challenging work."
<DD>	Wood prospered at Warner.  Warner prospered under Wood.  
<DD>	But no matter how successful either grew, Wood kept Warner's headquarters and roots firmly planted in rich Midwestern soil.
	
<P><B>Business success without compromising principles</B>
<DD>	Only eleven years after joining Warner, Wood was elected as president and CEO.  During his time at Warner, the company grew from a single American manfacturing plant with 120 employees to eleven plants in the United States, Europe and Brazil. 
<DD>	Sales also grew rapidly.  When Wood retired as chairman in 1984, they were almost $200 million, up from about $10 million.
<DD>	During his 40 years with Warner Electric, Wood never let his business success go his head. Instead, he applied the traditional values he learned from his parents to his work.
<DD>	Florence Vonder Vellen, Wood's secretary of more than 30 years, calls Wood "generous and caring."  She added, "He likes people and likes to see them succeed."
<DD>	Vonder Vellen noted that Wood often went out of his way to help people succeed.
<DD>	She said, "I remember how Mr. Wood helped a blind man who worked on the assembly line.  He was a very good worker, and Mr. Wood got him a seeing-eye dog."
<DD>	"Mr. Wood was always doing things like that, but he kept it quiet, to himself," Vonder Vellen said.  
<DD>	Wendell Witten, who describes Wood as "kind and thoroughly honest," remembered a visit by Wood to a company factory.
<DD>	"It was tremendous.  As he walked along the assembly line he called out to each worker by name," Witten said.
<DD>	John Morris, Wood's legal counsel at Warner, confirmed Wood's character:   "I've got high regard for him.  He has great integrity.  Steve always suggested things be done fairly even when he might otherwise have seized an advantage."  		"My position as counsel prohibits me from going into specifics, but there were many such occasions," Morris said.
<DD>	Morton Blackwell, president of the Leadership Institute, said, "Steve Wood's honest,  charitable and successful business practice is a rebuke to the liberals, who scorn free enterprise and economic liberty in America.
<DD>	"His example proves that the best businessmen are first the best men," Morton said.

<P><B>Life-long Republican</B>
<DD>	Steven Wood's business proficiency and personal integrity are matched by his conservative commitment.
<DD>	Wood's family have been Republican for several generations.
<DD>	Wood said, "My grandfather ran unsuccessfully for the U.S. Senate against Bob LaFollette in the early part of the century.  My father didn't run for political office but was Republican National Committeeman from Wisconsin."
<DD>	Wood followed their civic leadership model.  He has served on Republican state and national finance committees during the past forty years.
<DD>	In addition to doing his part to see that current conservative candidates are elected, Wood keeps at least one eye on the future.

<P><B>Supports the next generation </B>
<DD>	Wood supports the Leadership Institute because he sees it as key to the health of the conservative movement in the next generation.
<DD>	"Young people are key to the success of the conservative movement.  They're it.  And you've got to get them started right," Wood said.     
<DD>	But Wood also notes that there are formidable obstacles ahead.  He singles out the media as the major threat to conservative progress.
<DD>	"It's more than just a problem of not telling the truth; it's outright lies," Wood said.
<DD>	Wood mentions the Student Publications School, the Capitol Hill Staff Training School and the Employment Placement Service as Institute programs of particular interest to him.
<DD>	"I think it's very important to train kids in college how to run a conservative newspaper.  And I think it's important to train conservatives how to get jobs working for a congressman or a senator," Wood said.
<DD>	Institute president Morton Blackwell said, "With conservative paragons like Steve Wood keeping careful watch over America, there's good reason for optimism about our future.
<DD>	"Skilled conservative media will counter the  dominant liberals.  Leftist government staffers will find themselves outnumbered.  And more conservatives will be trained for all kinds of leadership in public policythanks to Steve Wood," Morton said.
<DD>	He added, "So it's only appropriate that the growing Leadership Institute programs will soon operate out of the new National Training Headquarters in the honorably-named Steven P. J. Wood Building."

<P>	Economic analysis can promote environmental quality.  By identifying subsidies, inefficiencies, and new opportunities, economists apply their powerful analytical tools to environmental ends. </P>

<P>	Yet despite its great potential, economic analysis has failed to improve environmental policy in many areas.  Environmental regulators often ignore the importance of secure property rights and advocate regulatory &quot;takings&quot; of property with predictable and oft perverse consequences.  The Progressives of the early 20th Century, who established the federal land management bureaucracies, completely failed to understand why America's founders were so skeptical of activist, intrusive government.  The persistent failures of bureaucracies like the Forest Service and Bureau of Land Management illustrate the founders' wisdom.  And too often American ideals of limited government are ignored by agencies and special interests, both of whom gain through wasteful central planning that corrupts good intentions.</P>

<P>	Economists have failed to deliver their message because they are neither naturally inclined nor trained to communicate with intelligent non-specialists.  The language of economists, calculus and econometrics, are alien to most people.  Even when economists share environmental goals and interests with conventional greens, their message is unheard or misinterpretted.</P>

<P>	This communication gap between economists, environmental activists, and decision-makers inspired a new organization, the Gallatin Institute.  This non-profit, educational and research foundation links essayists, poets, and novelists with economists and policy analysts interested in environmental quality and sensitive to an emerging environmentalist culture.  Gallatin works with these purveyors of culture to forge innovative cultural and intellectual foundations for an emerging West.  </P>

<P>	Shared goals of sustainable economies, ecologies, and cultures would be at the heart of such a New West.  To get there, Gallatin first fosters exchange between writers and policy experts. Gallatin Fellows next take these messages to communities.  </P>

<P>	Environmental concerns increasingly affect the West.  Technically complex and highly emotional, they often pit ecological against other human values.  These ingredients for error and acrimony provide opportunities for demagogues to work their mischief.  Lies go undetected, truths untold, opportuism fostered.</P>

<P>	In pursuit of ecological integrity and viable economies, Gallatin Fellows respect the ideals of free and responsible individuals, the importance of community, and the value of voluntary cooperative actions. They agree productive and just economic and social coordination is rarely achieved through force, and never by fraud.</P>

<P>	The Gallatin Institute develops thoughtful foundations for constructive policy reform.  With support from the Ford Foundation and others, Gallatin hosts working conferences and seminars and provides modest support for writers to produce popular and scholarly articles and books.  Its varied ideas and proposals respectfully recognize differing cultures and traditions of the old while articulating a vision for a new West. </P>

<P>	When a group of writers met some years back, they envisioned a West moving away from federal dependency, factious division, and unsustainable land use.  The Gallatin Institute emerged as one vehicle for ushering in a new West.  Its aim is not to provide &quot;the answer&quot; for the New West.  Rather, Gallatin promotes an ecumenical, constructive dialogue among leaders of rural communities, Western writers, and policy analysts.  Gallatin recognizes that the West must determine its own identity, its own future.</P>

<P>	The Institute's emphasis on fostering harmony and responsibility reflects its namesake, Albert Gallatin, the secretary of the treasury under Thomas Jefferson.  Albert Gallatin had coherent and yet diverse interests.  A fiscal conservative, he stressed simple government and ending public debt.  In spite of the Louisiana Purchase and preparations for the War of 1812, Gallatin cut the federal debt by 38% in eight years.  He strongly opposed war and was instrumental in negotiating peace with Britain.  Gallatin funded the Lewis and Clark expedition and founded New York University and the American Ethnological Society.  Like its namesake, Gallatin Institute fosters constructive and peaceful exchange to find a new identity in the West, based on responsibility, cultural and ecological harmony, and self-governance.</P>

<P>	The Gallatin Institute brings eclectic writings to the media and general public through several avenues.  A new<CITE> Gallatin Journal</CITE>, based on writings brought to seminars and community gatherings, will be launched in mid-1996.  Two forthcoming Gallatin books, <CITE>The Next West</CITE> and <CITE>Writers on the Range</CITE>, were generated by the seminars.</P>

<P>	A series of op-ed pieces are published in local, regional, and national print and electronic media are produced by the Institute.  Under the banners of &quot;Range Writers&quot; and &quot;Writers on the Range&quot;, Gallatin's writers produce columns and articles to promote this dialogue in the West.</P>

<P>	The Gallatin Institute is one of many examples of environmental entrepreneurship in action, this one in the intellectual arena.  The Institute recognizes the important morality, ethics, and the analytic power of economics to explore an emerging West.  When writers begin using the potent tools of economic analysis, and if even a few economists return to their ethical/moral roots in Moral Philosophy, then the 21st century will yield a West whose public policies equal the quality of its scenery.  For once, I am not keeping my hopes and expectations in separate baskets.</P>

<b>by Elizabeth Schoenfeld</b>
<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	A report last year by the Council on Families in 
America characterized America's culture of divorce this way: "Relationships between men and 
women are not getting better; by many measures, they are getting worse. They are becoming 
more difficult, fragile, and unhappy. . . . The promises of the divorce revolution proved empty, 
its consequences devastating for both adults and children." Researchers predict that roughly half 
of existing marriages will break up, and nearly three out of five new unions will end in divorce or 
permanent separation. For many couples, such odds can make their sacred vows seem more like a 
crapshoot.
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Along with the problem of illegitimacy, failed and 
failing marriages are at the root of the nation's worst social ills. But what can we do about it? 
Public policymakers need to reconsider the legal regime governing marriage and divorce, from 
reform of no-fault divorce laws to longer waiting periods for divorcing parents. In the next issue 
of <i>Policy Review</i>, we'll examine which states have the lowest divorce rates, where 
legislatures are trying to make divorce more difficult, and other efforts to reverse the 
proliferation of divorces. 
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Public policy, however, is only one part of any 
solution. Over the past 20 years, research has revealed or confirmed the elements of successful 
marriages. Many programs, support groups, and therapy techniques are now available to 
strengthen even the most troubled relationships. The religiously based Marriage Encounter and 
Family Life weekend retreats, for example, have renewed the faith and commitment of thousands 
of couples. In the pages that follow, we profile a few of the ideas for forming more perfect 
unions, in the hope that they take root in families, communities, and religious congregations 
around the country.
<p>
<a name="div">
<b>Divorce Buster</b></a>
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In the 1960s, as divorce rates began to climb, many 
family counselors began to see divorce itself as a therapeutic option of first resort. Therapist 
Michele Weiner-Davis recalls a fellow counselor who claimed that 90 percent of the marriages in 
his practice were dead on arrival. Weiner-Davis herself used to believe that many marital 
problems were insurmountable.
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	No longer. "The vast majority of relationship 
problems are solvable and the vast majority of marriages are worth the effort required to make 
them work," she writes. "Now I do whatever I can to help people find solutions to their marital 
problems so that they can stay together."
<p> 
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Why the change? Weiner-Davis says she's seen up 
close the suffering and disillusionment that can come with divorce. And blaming one spouse as 
the source of the problems, she says, is a mistake, because "it doesn't take into account the roles 
both partners play in the deterioration of the relationship." Bad habits and behaviors developed 
over years go with them when they end the marriage.
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"I don't believe in 'saving marriages,'" she says. "I 
believe in divorcing the old marriage and beginning a new one -- with the same partner." With 
that creed in hand, Weiner-Davis pioneered the use of Solution-Oriented Brief Therapy (SBT) in 
marriage counseling. Unlike traditional therapy methods, which tend to focus on problems and 
on the past, SBT emphasizes solutions. For example, rather than encouraging couples to talk 
about childhood disappointments and how they may be affecting their relationship, SBT asks 
them to define what they want to accomplish in their reconciliation, and then to devise a strategy 
for meeting these goals.
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In her own practice, Weiner-Davis has found that 
SBT can salvage at least four out of five seriously troubled marriages. She says that couples can 
begin to turn their relationships around within a month, even if only one spouse wants to save the 
marriage. She promotes SBT in her recent bestseller, <i>Divorce Busting: A Step-By-Step 
Approach to Making Your Marriage Loving Again</i> (Fireside).

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>	For information about SBT therapists, send a self-
addressed stamped envelope to Michele Weiner-Davis, P.O. Box 197, Woodstock, Ill. 60098. 
Tel.: 815-337-8000. Also available is a home-study course with six audio cassettes and a 
workbook called Keeping Love Alive.</i>
<p>
<a name="lang">
<b>The Language of Diplomacy </b></a>
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	One of the most common reasons marriages break 
up is that husbands and wives don't know how to communicate or handle conflicts. The problem 
may be not what you fight about, but how you fight. The good news is that just about anyone -- 
even the most emotionally inept -- can learn skills in communication and conflict resolution. 
There are numerous seminars to prevent divorces and enhance marriages. Here are three that are 
especially well researched and effective. In each of them, participants follow the curriculum in 
small groups and then huddle with instructors for individual coaching.
<P>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	<b>PREP.</b> "We have a Geneva Convention for 
the way we conduct warfare," says Howard Markman, the director of the Center for Marital and 
Family Studies and developer of the Prevention and Relationship Enhancement Program (PREP). 
"What we need is a sort of Geneva Convention for handling marital conflict." PREP supplies just 
that by imparting rules that couples can use to negotiate the minefields of marriage, including 
calling "timeouts" when a conflict gets out of hand and taking turns listening to each other. The 
"how-to"s of conflict resolution are taught in a five-session workshop that offers plenty of 
practice and coaching. PREP recently won a four-year grant from the National Institute for 
Mental Health to train clergy in administering the program. The PREP approach can be 
previewed in a book called <i>Fighting for Your Marriage: Positive Steps for Preventing 
Divorce and Preserving a Lasting Love</i>, by Howard Markman, Scott Stanley, and Susan L. 
Blumberg (Jossey-Bass).
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>	For information about counselors trained in the 
PREP approach, send a self-addressed stamped envelope to PREP, Inc./Referrals, 1780 S. 
Bellaire Street, Suite 621, Denver, Colo. 80222. Tel.: 303-750-8798.</I>
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>	Couple Communication.</b> More than 
500,000 couples have been helped by this program, which provides practical skills in four to six 
sessions. The program uses tools such as the "Listening Cycle," which helps spouses ascertain, 
for example, whether they are really listening to each other or just waiting for their turn to talk. 
Developed by Sherod Miller, Phyllis Miller, Daniel Wackman, and Elam Nunnally at the 
University of Minnesota, the curriculum is praised by therapists for being easy to use.

<P>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>	For more information, call 1-800-328-5099, or 
write to Interpersonal Communication Programs, Inc., 7201 S. Broadway, #11, Littleton, Colo. 
80122</I>.
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<b>	Relationship Enhancement Therapy.</b> 
Pioneered by Bernard and Louise Guerney, this approach stands out for long-term effectiveness 
when measured against marriage-enrichment programs, including Marriage Encounter. In part, 
its success can be attributed to the greater length of its program (nine to 10 weeks of two-hour 
sessions), but it also provides a unique emphasis on the teaching of empathy.
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>	There are a few RE centers around the country, but 
Bernard Guerney, its originator, can be reached in Bethesda, Md., at 301-986-1479.

<p>
<a name="better">
<b>Better Wed Than Dead</b></a>
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Couples may want to think twice before saying "I 
don't." Recent research indicates that getting a divorce could kill you. For men, "being divorced 
and a nonsmoker is only slightly less dangerous than smoking a pack or more a day and staying 
married," says David B. Larson, the president of the National Institute for Healthcare Research, a 
think tank located in Rockville, Maryland.
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Divorced men are twice as likely as married men to 
die prematurely from cardiovascular disease, four times more likely to die from suicide, and 
seven times more likely to die from pneumonia. Divorced women, on the other hand, have lower 
fatality rates than their married counterparts, but are more likely to suffer acute or chronic 
disease. And both sexes face a greater likelihood of accidental death for six months before and 
after divorce.
<P>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Separating spouses aren't the only ones to suffer the 
medical effects of a divorce. Children of divorce are 50 percent more likely to develop asthma, 
and 20 to 30 percent more likely to suffer an injury. And the deleterious effects last long beyond 
childhood. One long-term study at the University of California at Riverside found that people 
whose parents divorced before they were 21 faced a one-third greater risk of dying in any given 
year. Men whose parents had divorced had a median life span of 70 years, while those whose 
parents stayed married lived 10 years longer; for women, the figures were 82 versus 86 years.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	If you value your health, get regular exercise, eat 
plenty of fruits and vegetables -- and stay married. Of course, tense marriages carry their own 
health risks: A study by researchers at Ohio State University has found that couples who engage 
in fierce fighting suffer impaired immune systems.
<p>
<a name="count">
<b>Counting the Costs </b></a>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Anyone interested in family issues but intimidated 
by the dense prose of academic journals will appreciate a recent book from the National Institute 
for Healthcare Research. Need to know how divorce contributes to health-care costs or the 
relationship between marital disruption and juvenile delinquency? It can all be found in <i>The 
Costly Consequences of Divorce: Assessing the Clinical, Economic, and Public Health Impact of 
Marital Disruption in the United States</i>, by David B. Larson, James P. Swyers, and Susan S. 
Larson. This 282-page manual is a mother lode of up-to-date research on everything from 
changes in attitudes about marriage and divorce to the morbidity consequences of divorce to the 
ingredients for marital satisfaction.
<p>
 &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Some of the reasons examined for marital instability 
may not surprise: premarital pregnancy, short courtships, exposure to divorce as a child. "Those 
who marry before age 20," the book notes, "are twice as likely to divorce as those who wait until 
their twenties." But contrary to conventional wisdom, there is growing evidence that those who 
live together before marriage will experience poorer quality marriages and higher divorce rates 
than those who do not.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The book also gathers the latest data on the effect of 
religious commitment on marriage. One study found that marital dissolution among white men is 
three times more common for those who never attend church than those who attend at least twice 
a month. Protestants and Catholics as a group have higher divorce rates than Jews, but within 
each faith, the decisive issue is the degree of religious commitment. Part of the reason, 
researchers suggest, is that "those who actively participate in their church have a wide network of 
friends and associates to turn to for help in times of distress."
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Although packed with social-science data, this book 
is surprisingly friendly to the lay reader -- call it Cliff Notes for policy analysts. And it's a 
bargain at $40.

<b>A Modesto Proposal</b></a>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;We can save 90 percent of all marriages in America," 
boldly asserts Michael J. McManus, an ethics and religion columnist. Considering that the 
United States is the divorce capital of the world, that sounds like a pipe dream. But McManus, a 
sort of avuncular modern-day prophet, has seen what works -- and what doesn't -- in the 
marriage-making business. Calling churches little more than "blessing machines," he takes them 
to task for what he sees as an abject failure to support and nurture marriages (see his article "Veil 
of Tears," <i>Policy Review</i>, Winter 1994).
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	To counter this trend, McManus has drafted a 
practical blueprint for organizing congregations to adopt a united Community Marriage Policy, a 
sort of civil compact that requires prospective newlyweds to meet minimum standards of 
preparation and marriage enrichment. The bottom line: Participating churches pledge not to 
marry couples who refuse to enroll in the premarital program. McManus reasons that, since 
almost three-quarters of first marriages take place in a religious setting, church is a strategic 
place to begin rolling back divorce rates.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	McManus also encourages congregations to locate 
"mentoring couples" to help the engaged and newly married in their midst -- giving them advice 
on making their marriages and families work. "There are some 350,000 churches in America," he 
says, "and every one of the them has couples with solid marriages who've never been asked, 
trained, equipped, or inspired to do this job." 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	This church-based strategy is taking root -- and 
seems to be bearing fruit. In 1986, Modesto, California, became the first city to institute a 
Community Marriage Policy. Since then, about 40 towns from Fairbanks, Alaska, to 
Montgomery, Alabama, have enacted such policies. After Modesto established its Community 
Marriage Policy, divorce rates dropped by 15 percent, and Peoria, Illinois, has experienced a 20 
percent decline in its divorce rate since the churches in town signed a marriage policy in 1991.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	For a fuller explication of the Community Marriage 
Policy idea, read McManus's book, <i>Marriage Savers: Helping Your Friends and Family 
Avoid Divorce</i> (Zondervan). Marriage Savers not only spells out ideas for organizing 
churches, but also is one of the best all-around resources for anyone who wants to throw a 
lifeline to a friend, a family member, anyone who seems to be drowning in America's culture of 
divorce.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Though moralistic in tone and filled with biblical 
references, the book brims with optimism. McManus also offers a set of six videotapes based on 
the book and a study guide aimed at church groups for a total price of $199.
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;<i>	For more information about putting together a 
Community Marriage Policy, contact Michael J. McManus, president, Marriage Savers Institute,

<p>
<a name="show">
<b>Showcasing Success </b></a>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Between 800 to 1,200 people in the marriage-saving 
business -- mentor couples, religious leaders, and marital therapists -- will trek to Fort Worth, 
Texas, for the Second International Marriage Enrichment Conference, May 23 through May 25. 
Designed to showcase some of the leading marriage-building techniques, the conference will 
include workshops on communication skills and marriage preparation, as well as more than 40 
seminars on topics ranging from the special needs of parents of preschoolers to maintaining 
sexual intimacy after recovery from a heart attack. The event is cosponsored by the Association 
for Couples in Marriage Enrichment (A.C.M.E.) and several other marriage groups.
<P>

Wood, the event's coordinators in Fort Worth. Tel: 817-924-8509, fax: 817-927-7749. </i>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The Woods also serve as copresidents of A.C.M.E., 
a nonprofit, nonsectarian membership organization based in Winston-Salem, North Carolina. 
This group was founded in 1973 by David and Vera Mace, a husband-and-wife team of marital 
therapists. The organization also acts as an informal clearinghouse for those interested in 
marriage-renewal efforts nationwide, and promotes marital support groups in local communities. 
Consisting of more than 1,100 couples, the organization puts out a bimonthly newsletter and 
coordinates weekend retreats, skills-learning classes, and seminars.

<title>Gary Bauer's February, 1996 Letter</title>
<body>
<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>
<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>
February 7, 1996
<p>
Dear Friend:
<p>
Hillary Rodham Clinton has written a new book.  It isn't supposed
to be about herself, but in one disturbing sense it is a biography.
Mrs. Clinton's book -- <i>It Takes a Village and Other Lessons Children
Teach Us</i> -- attempts to write the biography of the next generation
of America's children.  I disagree with her message, and I want
to tell you why.
<p>
The book's title comes from an African proverb, &quot;It takes
a village to raise a child.&quot;  An article about the book in
<I>Newsweek</I> magazine helps make the proverb's meaning perfectly
clear.  One of  Mrs. Clinton's favorite expressions, the article
says, is, &quot;There is no such thing as other people's children.&quot;
After reading just a few chapters of <I>It Takes a Village</I>,
it becomes obvious that what she means by &quot;village&quot;
is really <b>more</b> Big Government.  What she means by &quot;family
values&quot; is the mush that's left over after the time-honored
traditions of men and women of faith have been driven from the
public square.
<p>
I believe that our problem today is that too many parents are
looking to the so-called village to care for their children, instead
of meeting this precious responsibility themselves.  Many other
parents are struggling to meet this responsibility themselves,
but they are overwhelmed by crushing taxes, stagnating incomes,
the relentless encroachment on parental rights by government,
and the destruction of values by an amoral culture.  From Calvin
Klein ads to the studios of Hollywood, there is indeed a &quot;village&quot;
seeking to raise our children -- a Greenwich Village of sexual license
and crass materialism.  I don't want my children raised this way,
and I am confident you don't want it for your children or grandchildren
either.
<p>
Kay Coles James, a former Vice President at the Family Research
Council, knows this African proverb well.  Kay, a black American who was 
born in the slums of Portsmouth, Virginia, has risen to prominence
in our national political life.  She has written how Mrs. Clinton's
slogan has made the rounds and how deeply wrong it is:
<p><blockquote>
<i>It is really quite simple, we are told, if only we would cede parental 
control to the village, all would be well.  Children would no longer grow 
up insecure or worried; they would be well-adjusted, well-developed,
and full of healthy self-esteem.  What a wonderful world it would be .
. . .</i>
<p>
<i>But the village cannot raise a child.  Children don't belong to the 
community. Children belong to the parents who tuck them in at
night, wipe away their tears, feed them their meals, and answer their 
questions. If the past thirty years have taught us anything, it is that 
stable, intact, two-parent families are the foundation of a healthy 
village.</i>[1]
</blockquote><p>
Kay is right.  The village <b>cannot</b> raise a child.  Increasingly,
the &quot;village&quot; is taking our children away from us.  And as I told you 
last month, that is why I have written a new book of my own, <I>Our Hopes, 
Our Dreams:  A Vision for America</I>. Like Mrs. Clinton's, my book is about 
families and children -- but there the similarity ends.
<p>
In fact, it would be difficult to imagine two books more diametrically
opposed on the major issues facing our families and our nation.  Mrs. 
Clinton writes with admiration of Western Europe's &quot;openness about 
sexuality&quot;[2] and wishes we were similarly enlightened.  <I>Our Hopes, 
Our Dreams</I> ponders how our sex-saturated society can restore the virtues 
of fidelity and chastity. (I wonder if Mrs. Clinton has watched any cable t.v. 
lately or checked the tabloids as she walked through a grocery check-out lane?)
<I>It Takes a Village</I> deplores abortions <b>only</b> if they
are &quot;unsafe&quot;[3] and argues that the &quot;village&quot;
should promote contraception to young people to &quot;help them
deal responsibly with the consequences of their actions.&quot;[4]
My book questions the future for a nation that has abandoned
the sanctity of human life and lost the meaning of holy matrimony.
<p>
Hillary Clinton, <I>Newsweek</I> says, champions a government
&quot;program for every problem&quot;[5] and accuses conservatives
of opposing Big Government because we desire &quot;to advance
narrow religious, political and economic agendas.&quot;[6] My book
yearns for a rebirth of family and community that restores the
federal government to its limited constitutional role.  Mrs. Clinton
believes that &quot;everyone should wait until the age of 21 before
having sex.&quot;[7] Not only should sex be within the bonds of
marriage, but I believe that the virtue of an action does not
depend on one's age.
<p>
Hillary Clinton believes that out-of-home child care is controversial
because, she says, &quot;Americans have never sufficiently valued
the work of caring for children&quot; and have long been ambivalent
&quot;about whether surrogate child care is acceptable.&quot;[8]
<I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> argues, instead, that America's
families place the highest value on caring for children.  Families
have told pollsters time and again that they not only favor parental
care of children, but also want public policies that support that
choice.
<p>
The first lady's book is receiving tremendous attention in the
national liberal media.  She has also been interviewed by the
major news magazines.  The best-seller lists will no doubt track
her book's sales with enthusiasm.  As you know, however, those
lists completely ignore books like mine which come from Christian
publishers such as Focus on the Family.  The media will try to
ignore our pro-family message, too.  In some ways the outcome
of the family policy debate in 1996 will be determined by whether
more Americans support Hillary Clinton's message of Big Government
and liberal values or whether they accept and embrace the message
of renewal and faith contained in <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I>.
With your help, we can win this first &quot;debate&quot; of 1996
by making sure <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> reaches as many Americans
as possible.  I hope you will choose to read this pocket-size
paperback and then help distribute it to your friends, neighbors,
co-workers, sunday school class and anyone else interested in
America's future.
<p>
Hillary Clinton, however, is not the only public figure tossing
around adjectives like &quot;extreme&quot; these days.  If you've
watched the long-running budget battle between the Congress and the 
White House, you've heard some of the nastiest descriptions ever
applied to elected legislators by the sitting president and his
staff.  Specifically, they've described the congressional freshman
class as everything from &quot;the far right&quot; to &quot;inflexible
extremists.&quot;
<p>
Listening to the president, you would think that these first-term
legislators hate the elderly, intend to starve the poor, abandon
children, trash the environment, and close schoolhouse doors.
The budget deadlock that gripped this city was even blamed on
these newcomers.  Last  March, I wrote to you that these very
same members of Congress &quot;bring to Washington a spirit of
service that is truly rare.&quot;  In the aftermath of the recent
government shutdown, has my opinion changed?
<p>
Not at all!  If anything, I hold the congressional freshman class
in even higher regard now than I did a year ago.  The reason is simple: 
they have kept their word. The vast majority of these members came to 
Washington as citizen-legislators. That is, they did not see themselves 
as part of a permanent governing class. They supported term limits. They 
promised to rein in runaway government.  They promised to cut taxes
on families with children.  They pledged to balance the budget
and eliminate useless bureaucracies.
<p>
I have often prayed with these deeply faithful new members, and
I wince as I see them daily attacked in the liberal press.  The
media have been an echo chamber for the White House, unfairly
charging the freshmen with denying funds for everything from Meals
on Wheels to school lunch programs.  Medicare is the primary example.
Throughout the budget battle, Bill Clinton accused these men
and women of seeking &quot;to strip our government and our country&quot;[9]
of its rightful role.  Clinton huffed that the Congress has held
some 40+ hearings on the Whitewater scandal, but only one on the
Medicare bill he was asked to sign.
<p>
Actually, Congress held over 50 hearings on Medicare, but
Bill Clinton &quot;counted&quot; only the one hearing
held on the actual bill.  Where was our adversary press on this
one?  Furthermore, Medicare spending under the GOP seven-year
balanced budget plan will increase by 89%.  Per-person spending
will also increase from just over $4,800 per year now to over
$7,000 in the year 2002.  To keep Medicare from going bankrupt,
seniors would pay an additional $7 per month, an &quot;increase&quot;
that happens only because the GOP plan keeps the beneficiaries'
share of the premium right where it is now at 31.5%.  The President's
alternative was to shift more of the costs of the program to taxpayers
who do not receive any of the benefits.  Moreover, the House-backed
plan provided the elderly with a new freedom, medical savings
accounts, to help them take charge of their own coverage and avoid
the threat of rationing posed by the Clintons' health reform model.
<p>
Watching the president's January press conference, this thought
occurred to me, too.  He pointed out that he has halved the budget
deficit in three years.  That's true -- even if you believe, as I
do, that the administration's policies are not the primary cause
of the decline.   Much of the additional revenue necessary to
reduce the deficit came as a result of Clinton's tax increase,
$280 billion over five years[10], the largest in our nation's history!
My question is this:  If Bill Clinton could cut the deficit in
half in three years, how can it be &quot;extremist&quot; for congressmen
to advocate wiping out the <i>other</i> half of the deficit in
seven years?
<p>
Let me share with you just a few of the House conservatives'
other extraordinary accomplishments for the family:
<p><ul>
<li>Passed a $500 per child tax credit for all families with
dependent children under the age of 18.  Insisted on the full amount
of this credit in tough negotiations with the Senate, and held their
ground during the federal shutdown when Clinton vetoed the budget bill.
<p>
<li>Passed a $5,000 credit for adoption expenses to facilitate
the placement of children in permanent homes.
<p>
<li>Restored the ability of the states to deny taxpayer funds
for abortions; denied federal funds for human embryo research;
adopted language to deny foreign aid funds to agencies like International
Planned Parenthood that promote and perform abortion overseas;
protected the accreditation of teaching hospitals that refuse
to participate in abortion training; restored the ban on use of
taxpayer funds to subsidize abortions under federal employee health plans; 
reimposed limits, lifted in 1993 by President Clinton, on the performance of 
abortions in U.S. military hospitals; passed a ban on partial-birth abortions. 
The first four items have been bottled up in the Senate, but none of these 
actions would have been possible without the pro-life members added to the House 
in 1994.
<p>
<li>Passed the first major welfare reform in a generation, designed to curb 
illegitimacy, encourage work and discourage the formation of single-parent 
households headed by teenagers.
<p>
<li>Forced a sharp reduction in funding for the National Endowment
for the Arts, leading to its elimination in two years, thereby putting
out of business this elitist agency that has been unable to distinguish art
from obscenity.
</ul><p>
In the coming year, these members are likely to endure even more
media abuse as they strive to deliver on their promises to protect
religious liberty and parental rights.  Rep. Steve Largent's (R-Okla.) 
Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act and religious liberty protections 
championed by Reps. Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) and Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) will 
be FRC priorities in 1996.  These are just some of the many ideas
we advocate to ensure that when it comes to our children, Mom
and Dad are village chiefs!
<p>
In closing, let me thank you for the support you have provided
to FRC during the past year.  Your encouragement and financial
gifts will keep us fighting hard for the values we share.  <b>I
hope you'll take a moment to review the enclosed reply card and
that you will choose to help us distribute <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I>
to every American home.  Also, please ask your local Christian
Book Store to carry this important book.</b>
<p>
Sincerely,
<p><br>
Gary L. Bauer<br>
President
<p>
P.S.  I am thankful for your faithful friendship and support.
My family joins me in praying that God will richly bless you
and yours during this tumultuous time.

This month marks a departure from the usual format of <i>Washington Watch</i>. While most families are beginning summer vacations from school, Congress is entering the heart of its regular legislative schedule.  This special issue of <i>Watch</i> is designed to bring you up to date on what FRC regards as the most important pro-family policy measures pending on Capitol Hill.
<p>
On the inside pages, you'll find a convenient "scorecard" on the legislative achievements of the 104th Congress.  You may want to keep a copy handy for future reference.  Feel free to duplicate copies of these pages as you see fit for your neighbors or your church.
Bulk copies of this issue of <i>Watch</i> are available on request.  Just dial 1-800-225-4008 for information.
<p>
And remember -- for current pro-family legislative information, updated every Friday, dial FRC at 1-202-783-HOME (a toll call).
<p>
<i>Watch</i> will return in its regular format in July.  In the meantime, drop me a note and let me know how well <i>Washington Watch</i> is serving your need for timely facts and findings about how the family fares in national policy.

<font size=+2><b><i>Dear Reader:</i></b></font>
<p>Late last year, <i>The Wall Street Journal</i> asked me to write an essay on what pro-family Americans expected from the new Congress.  I was happy to do so, even though I had to begin my article with a concession.  The concession was this:  the new Congress should keep the promises made in the Republican Contract with America -- most of which involved economic and structural reforms -- then turn to the social agenda:  reversing the breakdown of the family, defunding our grossly mismanaged (and too often simply gross) arts agencies, protecting the sanctity of human life, reforming the education mess.
<p>
In the last four months, the pro-family movement has helped to implement a lot of reforms related to the budget and the economy.  Now it's time to deal with issues related to our families and values.  Patience may be its own reward, but in public policy, too much patience can be poison.  In my two decades in Washington, I have witnessed only a handful of opportunities for progress on a pro-family platform.  We are now in the midst of such an opportunity.  We can move forward and see dramatic policy change to strengthen the family unit morally, socially and economically.
<p>
Or we can see the opposite.  Because just as this opportunity is upon us, so too is there unprecedented danger to the family.  Every parent in America senses this fact.  To read a daily newspaper is to be bombarded with a hail of horrors.  To look at our nation's illegitimacy rate -- and to understand its correlation with youth crime -- is to recognize that America may be just a decade away from an explosion of street violence.  To see the staggering toll of abortions, the pressures on our court system to sanction euthanasia and assisted suicide, and other anti-life trends, is to know that the nation is perilously close to complete dissolution of the Judeo-Christian consensus that has sustained it through the centuries.
<p>
A wise veteran on Capitol Hill put our situation to me bluntly.  For the first time since it has been his job to understand the pulse of the American people, he cannot tell which way this nation is headed.  In the next five years, he said, anything seems possible, from a religious and pro-family renaissance to an utter collapse of traditional values that brings on drug legalization, homosexual marriages, and all-pervasive pornography.  
<p>
Life and death truly have been set before us.  Which way we will choose?  What follows in this special edition of <i>Washington Watch</i> is an effort to lay out an agenda for <i>the way of life</i> -- an American way of life.  My hope is that you will share these pages with your friends, your neighbors and those with whom you attend church.  Each of us has the responsibility to take a clear look at the alternatives that lie before us -- before the window of opportunity is shut.

<p>
<i>Introduction:  The architecture of family freedom is no accident, even if, once upon a time in America, government officials almost instinctively adopted policies to protect family stability and promote civic character.  Today, both deliberate and unintentional assaults upon the family have multiplied.  But the structure of the family is written on the heart of humanity.  Lawmakers can ignore that God-given structure, but they cannot erase it.  Here are ways that the 104th Congress can help to restore family-friendly public policy</i>.
<p>
<a name="life"><center><h3>Restoring the Sanctity of Human Life</h3></center>
<p>
<b>1. The Civil Right to Life.</b> Four members of the House, two Democrats and two Republicans, have introduced constitutional amendments to restore the right to life of children before birth.  Sen. Jesse Helms (R-N.C.) has introduced S. 320, the "Unborn Children's Civil Rights Act."  It would put Congress on record as declaring, among other things, that the U.S. Constitution sanctions no right to abortion and that <i>Roe v. Wade</i> was improperly decided.  It would also bar any federal funding or promotion of abortion, and provide for an expedited right of appeal to the Supreme Court when any abortion restriction is found unconstitutional by a lower court.  These proposals do not merely "modify" the abortion right, they would give protection to unborn children for the first time in 22 years.
<p>
<b>2. Members Against Dismemberment</b>. As a first step toward providing constitutional protection for unborn children, Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.) and Henry Hyde (R-Ill.) will offer legislation to ban "partial birth abortions," which involve the heinous D&X procedure performed on unborn children 20-26 weeks of gestation.  Hearings are scheduled this month in the House Judiciary Committee, Subcommittee on the Constitution.
<p>
<b>3. "Lady Liberty" Means No to Forced Abortions.</b> The Clinton administration has shown blatant disregard for fundamental human rights by overturning previous administrations' asylum policy for families fleeing China's coercive "birth quota" system, with its forced abortions and sterilizations.  Rep. Chris Smith (R-N.J.) recently attached language to the foreign aid bill (H.R. 1561) to restore the previous policy.  By record vote of  240-181 on the same bill, the House voted to deny U.S. foreign assistance dollars to non-governmental groups that perform or provide abortions, or that lobby other nations to repeal their laws restricting abortion.  The same measure would also require the United Nations Population Fund to end its involvement in China's draconian family planning program -- or lose all U.S. funds.  H.R. 1561 should pass the House as is, and the Senate should agree.
<p>
<b>4. Adopt Adoption Assistance.</b> In an effort to encourage adoption by lowering financial obstacles, the House of Representatives has passed a budget provision which allows taxpayers a $5,000 credit for qualified adoption expenses.  The Senate did not include the adoption assistance measure in their budget measure, passed on May 25.  An amendment offered by Sen. Phil Gramm (R-Tex.) that included the credit was defeated on May 23 by vote of 69-31.  The differing budgets now go to a House-Senate conference, and FRC will be working to ensure that the adoption credit survives in the final bill.  Adoption is the <i>option of choice</i> for dealing with crisis pregnancy.
<p>
<b>5. No Abortion Mandate</b>. Rep. Pete Hoekstra (R-Mich.) will introduce legislation to prohibit the Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) from requiring hospital ob/gyn residency programs (including religious hospitals) to train or refer medical students to perform abortions, lest they lose accreditation.  At stake are federal  Medicare and Medicaid reimbursement dollars.  Subcommittee chairman Hoekstra also scheduled a June 14  hearing in the House Oversight and Investigations Subcommittee to examine ACGME's coercive policy.
<p>
<a name="education"><center><h3>Empower Parents for Education</h3></center>
<p>
<b>6. Be True to Our Schools.</b> At last, serious efforts are under way to dismantle the U.S. Education Department.  The House budget resolution withdraws funding for the department.  In addition, the House Education Task Force's "Back to the Basics Education Bill" returns authority to the state and local level.  This is a high-priority issue for FRC; action could come in Congress within several months.  The decline in American education parallels the rise of the Department of Education; it's time to test the linkage in reverse.
<p>
<b>7. Be True II.</b> The House has taken one small swipe at Goals 2000, the omnibus education legislation that transferred unprecedented education authority from localities to Washington, D.C.  Last month, the House passed H.R. 1045, which would eliminate NESIC, the equivalent of a national school board set up by the law.  Congress should now repeal <i>all</i> of the intrusive programs instituted by Goals 2000.  Kudos to Rep. Lindsey Graham (R-S.C.), who has raised the issue in the House Economic and Educational Opportunities Committee, and to Gov. George Allen of Virginia, who has refused to accept Goals 2000 funding for his state.  We have to free our children from the control of the national education bureaucrats and their allies at the National Education Association.
<p>
<a name="purse"><center><h3>Protect the Family Purse</h3></center>
<p>
<b>8. Pro-child Tax Credits.</b> The $500-per-child tax credit helps relieve the tax burden on American families.  The House of Representatives has passed a tax bill that includes the $500-per-child credit and has also included it in its budget resolution.  Unfortunately, the credit's fate in the Senate is uncertain:  key Republican senators are raising doubts about the bill, and the Senate budget resolution passed on May 25 omitted it.  The Senate should change course and act to protect the family budget as it works to fix the federal budget.
<p>
<b>9. Don't Forget Health Reform.</b> Rep. Bill Archer (R-Tex.) has drafted legislation, not yet introduced, to change the income tax code to permit individual Medical Savings Accounts (MSAs).  These MSAs would give individuals and families greater control over their health care decisions, resulting in your family having coverage even if you change jobs, decreased costs, and broadened access to health care services.  FRC has joined a coalition of pro-family groups to promote such legislation.  The effort in 1994 to turn over health care to the government -- socialized medicine -- was defeated.  Sound reform is more critical now than ever.
<p>
<a name="wilderness"><center><h3>Tame the Cultural Wilderness</h3></center>
<p>
<b>10. Ban Homosexuality in Uniform.</b> Most Americans thought the military homosexual issue was resolved when Congress passed a reform bill in 1993.  Wrong.  The Clinton administration ignored the text of the law when it wrote the implementing regulations, effectively lifting the ban anyway.  Now the administration is using the federal courts to get around public opinion and scuttle the ban by building a losing case in the Supreme Court.  New legislation is imperative.  None is pending, but FRC's Military Readiness Project, with senior advisers former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff Admiral Thomas Moorer and former Marine Corps Commandant Robert Barrow, is seeking Congressional support for appropriate amendments to the 1996 Defense Authorization Act.
<p>
<b>11. Porn-Free Cable TV.</b> With the encouragement of FRC, Reps. Tony Hall (D-Ohio) and Chris Smith (R-N.J.) have introduced legislation that would require cable TV operators to provide basic cable packages free of pornography.  Meanwhile, pro-family groups are working on alternatives to Sen. Jim Exon's (D-Neb.) Communications Decency Act of 1995, S. 314.   Exon's bill is a well-intentioned attempt to restrict transmission of pornography via computer, but may actually make it more difficult to prosecute.
<p>
<b>12. Porn-Free PXs</b>. Under current policy, military exchange managers are responsible to select magazines based on sales volume, customer preferences, and, in the case of pornographic material, whether or not it fits the definition of "obscenity" outlined in the 1973 Supreme Court case of <i>Miller v. California</i>.  The services oppose removing so-called "soft-core" pornography from exchange shelves because of the threat of legal action from the ACLU.  President Clinton has the unilateral authority to remove pornographic material from military stores.  He should do so, and Congress should adopt a resolution urging that action upon him.
<p>
<a name="misguided"><center><h3>Reform Misguided Federal Programs</h3></center>
<p>
<b>13. True Welfare Reform.</b> The full Senate should vote on a measure to restore the anti-illegitimacy provisions that were adopted by the House but then eliminated by the Senate Finance Committee on May 25.  The critical provisions are:  a restriction on federally funded cash benefits for adolescent unwed mothers; a "cap" on benefits  to mothers who bear additional children while on welfare; and bonus payments to states that succeed in reducing their illegitimacy rates without increasing the number of abortions.
<p>
<b>14. X Out Title X.</b> Title X of the Public Health Service Act -- a program which funds family planning projects throughout the country -- has been a dismal failure, especially among teenagers.  Since it began in 1970, out-of-wedlock births, pregnancies, and abortions among teenagers have all risen sharply.  Sexually transmitted diseases have multiplied in variety and are on the rebound as well.  Last year, Title X received $194 million in your tax money.  This summer, FRC will work to change that figure to zero.  Planned Parenthood will be poorer, but adolescent well-being should flourish.
<p>
<b>15. Cures, Not Activism.</b> Federal taxpayers spend billions on AIDS through the Ryan White Care Act. Unfortunately, much money now goes to groups promoting homosexuality to school-children through "AIDS education." The Act is the single largest source of funds for homosexual activism. A Washington, D.C., recipient, the Whitman-Walker Clinic, endorses "safe" bathhouse sex (with condoms) and holds gay political seminars. Basic reform is needed.
<p>
<a name="ideas"><center><h3>Other Family-Friendly Ideas</h3></center>
<p>
<b>16. Women at Arms.</b> The Clinton administration has conducted an aggressive campaign to thrust women into military combat.  Women can now be assigned to more than 80 percent of all military positions -- many combat-related.  Meanwhile, Congress has failed to host hearings to examine the recommendations of the 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces, which opposed many of the recent changes.  The administration, with Congressional neglect, has advanced a feminist agenda without regard for readiness.  Congress should convene hearings and prepare legislation that puts readiness first.  If they don't, someday soon your daughter could be drafted.
<p>
<b>17. Off the Dole.</b> The Integrity in Government Act (H.R. 1130), sponsored by Rep. Bob Dornan (R-Cal.), would limit federally funded persons or organizations, such as contractors and advocacy groups, from lobbying Congress for more funding.  It would also prohibit lobbyists from receiving federal funds.  The legislation would not apply to recipients of entitlements and would not restrict the ability of individual citizens to communicate with their elected representatives.
<p>
<b>18. Revitalize Drug Abuse Prevention.</b> Drug abuse among teenagers has increased significantly in recent years.  This change is attributable to a resurgence of pro-drug sentiment in popular culture, less-than-effective prevention programs, and President Clinton's silence on the issue.  The administration's drug strategy focuses on "harm reduction" -- treatment for chronic drug users and less enforcement.  Meanwhile, Congress is considering cuts in drug prevention programs.  Any long-term solution requires parental involvement, community programs, and strong national leadership.  New legislation is needed to address this plague. 
<p>
<b>19. Liberate the Arts.</b> The House passed a budget resolution (H. Con. Res. 67) on May 18, providing no funds for the National Endowment for the Arts or the National Endowment for the Humanities.  The resolution also ends funding for public television after three years.  A separate bill (H.R. 1557), passed by a House committee on May 10, would phase out the endowments by 1999.  Meanwhile, several senators have introduced S. 856, a bill that would keep the NEA alive.  FRC and other pro-family forces favor total defunding.  Artists need their freedom -- and so do taxpayers.
<p>
<b>20. Restore Religious Rights.</b> Rep. Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) is heading a congressional coalition in drafting an amendment to the U.S. Constitution which would restore to individuals and groups the right to speak and express their religious beliefs.  The language of the amendment is not yet final, but it is expected to include provisions preventing the government from prohibiting prayer or other forms of religious expression wherever non-religious expression is permitted.  The amendment is also likely to ban discrimination against or denying benefits to groups on account of their religious identity or ideas.  No more second-class status for this First Amendment freedom.
<p>
<b>21. Restore Parental Rights.</b> Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) and Rep. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) are working on legislation to prohibit the government from interfering with the right of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their children.  Such a law would, for instance, support parents who want to opt their children out of offensive sex education programs.  State constitutional amendments to protect parental rights have also been introduced in over half of the states.  Public policy cannot put families first if it does not empower parents.
<p>
<b>22. Defund Anti-Family Legal Activism.</b> Pro-family groups are calling for defunding of the Legal Services Corporation.  The $415 million per year program purports to provide legal services to the poor but often engages in politically motivated legal assaults on the family.  Since 1974, taxpayers have given LSC $5 billion, some of it used for things like obtaining cable TV for prisoners, fighting welfare reform, seeking public abortion funding, and forcing states to fund sex-change operations.

<a name="meaning"><center><h3>The Meaning of Family</h3></center>
<p>
On the grounds of the U.S. Capitol there is a small cluster of crab apple trees, one of the most moving monuments in all of Washington.  The cluster was planted on June 12, 1952 in memory of the Sullivan brothers, five sons of Iowa who died in 1942 during an attack upon the <i>U.S.S. Juneau</i> in the Solomon Islands.
<p>
After this devastating tragedy, the U.S. Navy changed its policy allowing service by family members on the same vessel.  Never again would a single American family lay, simultaneously, so "costly a sacrifice on the altar of freedom." (A. Lincoln)
<p>
In 1942 the contributions of American families -- the meaning of <i>family</i> -- to our nation's well-being and survival were never in question.  Today, as the accompanying <i>Blueprint</i> shows, our nation is at grave risk of forgetting all that the courage and faithfulness of families have given this land.
<p>
As Americans commemorate the family during this month of June -- from  
celebrations honoring the 50th anniversary of the end of World War II, to Father's Day -- Congress could give the nation no greater gift than to make pro-family legislation a priority.
<p>
FRC's writers and analysts are working overtime to bring the best family policy analysis to print.  Our recently expanded Government Relations staff is responding to an over-rising tide of requests for information.  Your partnership with us in this effort is essential.  FRC deeply appreciates your prayers and financial support.  If you can remember FRC with an additional gift this month, thank you.  Please use the enclosed reply card.

<I><DD>It's not often that a twenty-five year-old gets  his name on a celebrated Supreme Court case.
<DD>	It's uncommon to see a college student take his school to court and win.
<DD>	It's rare for a young man to face sudden fame and maintain his character.
<DD>	But Ron Rosenberger is not a typical man. 
<DD>	He's a true native northern Virginian in a region full of carpetbaggers.  He's a conservative Christian in a city of pagans.  And he's a Leadership Institute faculty and staff memberdirector of the Student Publications School.
<DD>	But that's only the beginning of his fascinating story.  Building Leadership interviewed Ron recently to review his case and see what he does today.  Excerpts of Ron's comments follow:   

</I> 
<P><DD><B>A four-year-old learns to mistrust Big Brother</B>
<DD>	"My conservative views toward government were first formed when I was four.  My family had a park on the Potomac River a mile up river from Great Falls.  We had cabins, canoes,  boats and a fishing tackle shop.
<DD>	But in 1973 the government came through and forced us to sell our park.  The alleged reason was to consolidate all land on the Potomac's banks.  But certain politically-well-connected wealthy people magically escaped.
<DD>	We sued.  Too late we discovered that the prominent lawyer we'd hired was at the same time on retainer for the government we were trying to fight.  So we lost the park.
<DD>	Thus my concerns about excessive government power, bureaucracy and corruption were well developed at an early age.

<P><B><DD>Education  in contemporary paganism</B>
<DD>	"When I was a little older, I attended the Fairfax County public school system, which has been called the lighthouse system of the nation.  I found it to be anything but that.  
<DD>	In fifth grade I went through a "gifted" program which was nothing but new age mysticism, a program to train students in PC gobbledygook.  
<DD>	One of the teachers was named Mrs. Christian, and she was anything but.  She once had us lie down in a darkened school theater and led us in visualizations as we floated from our bodies out through imaginary windows.
<DD>	So I had my first out of body experience under Mrs. Christian's tutelage in fifth grade.  My parents, needless to say, weren't too happy.  
<DD>	So early on I learned to hate the socialist education system dominant in our country.
<DD>

<P><B><DD>Christian upbringing</B>
<DD>	"I grew up in the church and said a salvation prayer when I was six years old.  In about eighth grade, I attended the Urbana missions conference in Illinois.  At that time I sensed some kind of call in my life for missions, but I wasn't sure what.  
<DD>	It wasn't until college when I went to the University of Virginia that I really tried to act much on the sense of calling I had felt.
<DD>

<P><B><DD>Pushed into politics</B>
<DD>	"About my second semester in college I begin to think seriously about political issues.  I'd always been conservative, but my actvism had been limited to chanting "Carter's a farter but Ford we can afford,"  in an elementary school bus.
<DD>	What I found in college activated me politically at last.  I'd expected a sleepy, apathetic campus; I found a hotbead of liberal radicalism.  
<DD>	I saw it in the classroom and among the students. 
<DD>	I took some classes on the Old and New Testaments.  The faculty were very careful to distance themselves from any suggestion that it might be true.  
<DD>	They were very often very critical.  One professor, Harry Gamble, would talk about Jesus and his "kingdom parties" that he would throw with the prostitutes and tax collectors.  It was all very subversive.
<DD>	But when I took an Eastern Religion class I found that the non-Christian material was treated very differently.  The professors would bring in practitioners from the local community basically to evangelize for each religion studied.  
<DD>	I soon learned my experience was the rule, not the exception, that there were  different standards for Christians and for others.  It was a shock.  I decided to get involved.
<DD>

<P><B><DD>A Christian paper is born</B>
<DD>	"Students were very active on campus.  There were over 340 student groups, and 118 received funding from the mandatory student activities fee.
<DD>	But out of all of these groups, which included fifteen different publications, there was no clear Christian vision or voice to challenge the culture.
<DD>	There was also a certain anti-intellectualism  and an attitude that Christians should not be involved politically.  
<DD>	We didn't agree.  We believed Christians are commanded in the Bible to be salt and light to the culture.  That's why we founded Wide Awake magazine.
<DD>	We tried to structure the magazine so that there would be something in Wide Awake for everyone.    We had a lot of variety and focused on many topics covered in the other campus publications.  We just approached issues from a Christian perspective.
<DD>	This was all fineuntil we applied for student activities funding.  Until we asked for our  fair share of the fees we were forced to pay as students.  
<DD>	Our application was quickly rejected.  We were told the school's policy did not permit funding of religious groups.  
<DD>	But we soon learned the truth:  that only Christians were being excluded.  A Jewish law  students organization and a Muslim publication were funded.
<DD>	And so, of course, were ostensibly non-religious groups that undermined religious faith.  For example, there were no less than five different gay and lesbian groups that actively promoted the lifestyleall funded in part from my mandatory student activities fee.
<DD>	We had to support them, while they were 'protected' from having to support us.  And we  couldn't even use our own student activities money for our own activities. Clearly, there was a double standard.
<DD>	When UVA rebuffed all of our appeals, we decided to sue, to stand up for principle.  
<DD>	In my view, the case was about being treated fairly, no longer being second class citizens, no longer having to sit in the back of the bus.
<DD>	And the Supreme Court agreed.  It ruled that the school didn't need to fund any student activities.  But if it did, there must be equal access. 
<DD>

<P><B><DD>A call to the Leadership Institute</B>
<DD>	"A few months after the Supreme Court handed down its ruling, I joined the Leadership Institute to take part in training a new generation of conservative journalists.  Now hundreds of students I train fight against the liberal media monopolies on most campuses.  
<DD>	That way I spread the benefits of what I learned to others. 
<DD>	 Sadly, it's still necessary, because so many radical administrators continue to deny equal access and equal treatment to conservatives and Christians, despite the court case.
<DD>	Mr. Jefferson said, 'Eternal vigilance is the price of liberty.'  Having seen how easily liberty is lost, I decided to help pay that price.  It's worth it."

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P>3/13/96</P><H1>Westerners, Wolves, Politics and Shifting Cultural Plates</H1><P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>	Beneath Greater Yellowstone, powerful thermal energies relentlessly shift tectonic plates.  The subsurface motion creates rifts and faults, occasionally volcanoes and earthquakes.  The fundamental tensions are always there.</P>

<P>	The tectonic plates of culture and political economy are also shifting and generating profound tensions in the new American West.  In Oregon and Idaho, hi-tech industries now provide more jobs than wood products industries.  In Washington, 4,900 lost timber jobs were replaced by three times as many software jobs.  As standing trees become more valuable than logs, it is apparent that values are evolving. Different cultures, polities, and economies collide, occasionally with catastrophic results.  The Yellowstone wolf reintroduction illustrates these changes.</P>

<P>	The wolf is mediagenic, an icon of the changing West.  But icons have varying interpretations.  Those insulated from rural traditions see the wolves as displaced natives who must be returned to the ecosystem. The wolf icon combines their romantic vision of an untamed past with a feel-good mission to set things right.  Conversely, many native Westerners view wolf reintroduction as the imposition of an alien culture that threatens ranching and the traditional economy.</P>

<P>	These traditional interests prompted the National Park Service to exterminate the wolf from Yellowstone in the 1920s.  Now, another federal agency, the US Fish and Wildlife Service, is charged with undoing that misguided &quot;progress&quot;.  However, the imported wolves don't easily coexist with local ranchers and hunters.</P>

<P>	Montanan Chad McKittrick, an unemployed carpenter, just received a six-month sentence in the slammer for killing &quot;Alpha One&quot;, a reintroduced wolf.  The U.S. Magistrate called the shooting, &quot;an intentional, thrill-seeking act in direct violation of the law.&quot;  McKittrick boasted a T-shirt saying &quot;Northern Rockies Wolf Reduction Project&quot;.  In the battle over the wolf icon, some locals in Montana made McKittrick a hero.</P>

<P>	When Park Rangers exterminated wolves Yellowstone lost a key component of its ecosystem.  Since then our ecological knowledge and sensitivity have increased while ranchers' economic and social influence have waned.  New people and interests are colonizing the West.   Nike, Microsoft, and Hewlett Packard are moving in.</P>

<P>	Loggers, farmers, fishermen, and miners feel their industries wither.  8,000 logging jobs are expected to disappear from the region in the next two years.  Despite this, the Pacific Northwest has led the nation in new job creation based on a diversifying economy and high quality of life.  In many National Forests, standing trees have greater value than decked logs.  Progressive-era bureaucracies like the Forest Service and Park Service, however, are caught on the fault line between amenity and commodity interests.  Federal agencies cannot manage to the mounting tensions.</P>

<P>	In Oregon, environmentalists chain themselves to trees to stop logging.  But loggers, whose wages have fallen 22% since 1978, miss that income.  In Nevada, a state comprised of 87% federal lands, counties are suing feds for control.  In Idaho, militia concoct conspiracy theories linking federal agencies like the US Fish and Wildlife Service with the U.N. and a New World Order.  </P>

<P>	Representative Helen Chenoweth of Idaho describes the friction between the traditional West and &quot;a government-sponsored religion&quot; based upon &quot;New Age mysticism, Native American folklore, and primitive Earth worship.&quot;  She sees an invaded West, where &quot;Easterners dream of preserving it, but in the process they're driving our people off the land.&quot;  The Yellowstone wolf symbolizes this conflict.</P>

<P>	Elsewhere, wolves are quietly and naturally recolonizing their former ranges in the Glacier National Park region of Montana.  The Glacier wolf has rapidly proliferated.  Why don't Glacier's wolves attract the same attention, debate, and tension as Yellowstone's?</P>

<P>	The difference between Yellowstone and Glacier is one of means.  The wolves naturally recolonized Glacier, following their food source.  Cut-over forests with booming deer populations are excellent wolf habitat.  These wolves have learned to survive near man.  The wolves that kill livestock are shot.  Vigilant ranchers with rifles provide an evolutionary filter which selects out wolves that won't adapt to man, the supreme predator.</P>

<P>	In contrast, the Yellowstone wolves were caught in the wild, caged, drugged, and then airlifted into the Park.  Federal &quot;caretakers&quot; short circuited the adaptive process.  The transplanted wolves lacked the &quot;training&quot; to coexist with ranchers.  They're not passed through the filters of accommodation with people.  Predictably, Yellowstone wolves are more troublesome than those in Glacier.  The Yellowstone reintroduction may still succeed, but it will be costly in terms of dead wolves, dead livestock, taxpayer money, and cultural conflict between new and old interests.</P>

<P>	The cultural tectonic plates have shifted from 70 years ago when Westerners demanded wolf extermination and the government complied.  Old, native values are undergoing a process geologists call &quot;subduction&quot;.  As one tectonic plate submerges below another, it quietly heats up and eventually returns to the surface through volcanic eruption.  If we are not careful, the &quot;subducted&quot; traditional political economy might one day erupt as it did with Chad McKittrick.  The consequences preclude a harmonious West.</P>

<P>	Long ago, Progressives believed that federal government would foster community harmony.  Instead, it has fueled passions and amplified conflicts near Yellowstone.  And if we're not careful, rare bumper-stickers like &quot;Wolves: Gut Shoot 'Em At The Border!&quot;  and &quot;Hungry And Out Of Work?  Eat An Environmentalist&quot; will become as common as gun racks. </P>

<title>The Clinton Administration: Sound Bites Vs. Reality -- Heritage</title>

<h2>THE CLINTON ADMINISTRATION: <br>
SOUND BITES VS. REALITY</h2>
By John S. Barry<br>
Commentary: <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
10/19/95<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
	"We have to cut yesterday's government to help solve tomorrow's problems."
<p><blockquote>-- President Clinton, State of the Union Address, January 24, 1995.</blockquote>
<p>	President Clinton and Vice President Al Gore continue to speak out, as they have for several years, about the need to "reinvent" the federal government and rein in the budget deficit. The vice president, to his credit, has issued more than two dozen reports through the National Performance Review, outlining many inefficiencies and excesses of big government.
<p>	Yet, now that Congress is trying to deliver the very "change" Clinton and Gore promised as candidates in 1992, the administration is balking. The president has threatened to veto 11 of the 13 appropriations bills now making their way through Congress, calling them too extreme.  
<p>	In fact, these appropriations bills are very modest: reducing the size of wasteful federal programs on average by just 10 percent. The appropriations bill for the Departments of Commerce, Justice, and State, for example, would cut spending by a mere 4.5 percent on these programs from their 1995 levels. The $1.1 billion saved amounts to less than .08 percent of the entire federal budget. But even this is apparently too radical.
<p>	Despite his veto threats, the president insists he favors a balanced budget. He says he thinks the Republicans are going too far, too fast, and have their priorities mixed up.
<p>	Unfortunately, it is hard to take the president seriously. His own budget, released in February, showed the deficit increasing to $250 billion per year by the year 2000, and even more after that, according to Congressional Budget Office (CBO) calculations.
<p>	Then, struck by the political mood of the country, the administration had second thoughts and issued a new budget in June. The president's new proposal was supposed to balance the budget by the year 2005. But CBO read the numbers differently. It estimates the new White House budget would result in a deficit of more than $200 billion in the year 2005, actually an increase of some $13 billion over the current year's deficit.
<p>	If the president is serious about reinventing government and balancing the budget, he can show it by supporting several proposals as put forth in the various appropriations bills.
<p>	For example, President Clinton has threatened to veto the Commerce, Justice, and State appropriations bill, largely because it would eliminate the Advanced Technology Program (ATP). In his own budget, the president proposed increasing funding for this program by 622 percent! Yet, judging by downsizing and streamlining standards spelled out by administration officials, ATP is exactly the type of program the president should be against. 
<p>	Administered by the National Institute of Standards and Technology within the Department of Commerce, ATP is the most egregious example of what Secretary of Labor Robert Reich has termed "corporate welfare." The program directly subsidizes businesses involved in high technology research and development; thus placing the burden of these risky ventures on the shoulders of taxpayers, rather than on the private companies that stand to benefit from successful efforts. The program should be killed, not expanded.
<p>	President Clinton has threatened to veto the appropriations bill for the Departments of Labor, Health and Human Services, and Education because it would eliminate the AmeriCorps program. This program is one of the president's favorites -- created in 1993 as a model program that would help "volunteer" students serve local U.S. communities. Unfortunately, these volunteers are anything but free help. A recent General Accounting Office study found the program costs more than $26,700 per "volunteer" per year, $7,900 more than the administration originally estimated. Ironically, while the president speaks publicly of making government work better at lower cost, he is adamant about protecting AmeriCorps -- even though 18 students could be supported through the Pell Grant program for the same cost as one AmeriCorps "volunteer."
<p>	President Clinton has threatened to veto the Transportation appropriation bill because it would limit urban mass transit grants. Yet, the mass transit program is one of the most ineffective in all of government; it is a boondoggle, pure and simple.
<p>	Over the past 25 years, more than $90 billion, in inflation-adjusted dollars, has been spent subsidizing local mass transit projects in an effort to promote public transportation. At the same time, mass transit's share of commuter travel has declined in nearly every city since the federal subsidies were initiated, down from 9 percent nationwide in 1970 to 5 percent in 1990. 
<p>	Do the math, Mr. President: Why are we building these systems if Americans don't use them? Federal subsidies, moreover, have encouraged many cities to build systems they cannot afford, leaving them heavily in debt. Yet, instead of supporting Congress's efforts to return money and authority to localities, the president would increase funding for mass transit grants. 
	<P>President Clinton was right about "cutting yesterday's government." That's exactly what Congress is trying to do. So, why is President Clinton standing in the way of reform?

<h3>Knowledgeable Limbaugh Dittoheads<br>
Not The Media Caricature</h3>
<p>
In his just published book, Hot Talk: All Talk, All the Time, Washington Post media reporter Howard Kurtz argues that talk radio, especially Rush Limbaugh, has a corrosive effect on society as hosts heighten division and spread misinformation. But a new poll by Kurtz' own newspaper found that listening to Limbaugh may be the antidote, not the cause, of public ignorance as his listeners are among the best informed Americans.
<p>
A major Washington Post survey revealed an incredible level of ignorance as 40 percent of the public could not name the Vice President, 47 percent failed to identify the House Speaker, 66 percent had no idea who is U.S. Senate Majority Leader, 94 percent were unable to name the Chief Justice of the Supreme Court, and 58 percent thought the U.S. spends more on foreign aid than Medicare. 
<p>
But Limbaugh listeners are in a better league. As the Post noted January 29, "They are much more knowledgeable than most about what goes on inside the Beltway and, although they are among the least trusting of the federal government, they are also among the most politically engaged voters." Over 80 percent are registered voters, "compared to only a quarter of non-dittoheads."
<p>
The poll demonstrated just how far off the mark reporters have been. In a January 1995 NBC Nightly News Bob Faw asked whether "talk radio is not democracy in action, but democracy run amok." Writing a Washington Post book review last May former CBS and NBC reporter Marvin Kalb charged: "Cut off the funding for NPR, or gradually reduce its funding to the point where it becomes a mere shadow of its usual robust, sensible self, and the American people may find themselves left with nothing much more than Rush and dozens of his mini-clones for information about the world. For Limbaugh's `dittoheads,' this may be the most splendid of tomorrows, but for other more thoughtful listeners, it may be the bleakest of forecasts." 
<p>
Six in ten Limbaugh listeners "have very little confidence in the news media." Sounds like dittoheads have a better understanding of the media than the media have of them.

</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P>6/12/96</P><H1>Wildlands: salvation through decentralization</H1><P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>Americans are increasingly concerned about our wildlands.  Historically we looked toward federal custodians.  But, if you believe that Congress will respond with large appropriations, read no further.</P>

<P>The federal government has made promises it cannot afford to keep.  The implications preclude an expanded federal wildlands system.  What will happen when actual spending cuts become unavoidable?  As the 104th Congress demonstrates, environmental expenditures are prime targets.</P>

<P>Yet, as our ecological understanding increases, we realize that large, intact systems are important.  David Quammen, author of <CITE>Song of the Dodo</CITE>, notes that wildlands cannot exist merely as &quot;island ecologies&quot;.  Without linking large, diverse areas and populations, island ecologies are doomed to stagnate and fail.  But will wildlands be worth their political cost to politicians?</P>

<P>Already, half the federal budget goes to Medicare and Social Security.  This drain is projected to double in the next 40 years.  What will be left for wildlands?  And where would federal wildlands be if revenue-hungry Congressmen, pressured by retired baby boomers, propose selling off bits and pieces of federal lands to fund the boomers' retirement?  </P>

<P>According to a Claiborne-Ortenberg Foundation report, <CITE>The View from Airlie</CITE>, such mischief is endemic to top-down control where local sites &quot;offer tantalizing potential for financing industrial development, servicing foreign debt, or simply getting rich.&quot;</P>

<P>Allowing the political process to determine the priority of wildlands designations invites michief.  With the Presidio, an old naval base, becoming a national park, might the <A HREF="http://www.pmrma-www.army.mil/rma.html">Rocky Mountain Arsenal</A> be designated a Wilderness Area? (This would eliminate the required cleanup.)</P>

<P>We expect politicians' attention spans to reach only to the next election, but wildlands require long-term stewardship.  These two time frames are incompatible.  Politicians aren't held accountable for events after they leave office.</P>

<P>Yet, the stubborn reliance on command-and-control by orthodox environmentalists ignores these structural impediments to a federal wildlands program.  We need new institutional arrangements to protect massive tracts of wildlands.  Responsible and constructive proposals are required.  Here are a few ideas.</P>

<P>Across America, untold multitudes of environmentally sensitive landowners are eager to manage their land for environmental ends but are afraid of political entanglements and potential takings.  The Safe Harbor program in North Carolina is successful because it responds to landowner concerns.  It is expected to double the endangered red-cockaded woodpecker population through voluntary agreements with landowners. Previously, the arrival of these woodpeckers meant losing control of their property.  Landowners enrolled in Safe Harbor have their rights protected.  If they attract woodpeckers they may continue active forestry and agriculture.  Similar programs can link large tracts of wilderness without removing land from all productive uses.</P>

<P>Creativity, flexibility, and adaptability are essential in coordinating habitat and wildlands.  These are not attributes of governmental bureaucracies.  Environmental entrepreneurs, however, like leaders of the <A HREF="http://www2.rmef.org/rmef/">Rocky Mountain Elk Foundation</A>, specialize in identifying conservation opportunities and building a constituency for wildlands.  Likewise, other conservationists could invest in wildlands based on voluntary agreements and mutual exchange.</P>

<P>When governments restrict use of private wildlands, landowners have strong incentives to develop their property before a bureaucrat comes locking.  In the voluntary sector, on the other hand, landowners are rewarded if their parcels qualify as wildlands and become attractive to a regional &quot;Wildlands Easement Trust&quot;.  </P>

<P>A regional Wildlands Easement Trust would have a board of trustees, similar in operation to those of museums and hospitals.  This decentralized approach allows caretaking priorities to adapt to increases in scientific understanding.</P>

<P>Such an approach wouldn't rely on massive federal land acquisition or regulatory intervention.  This different path to the same goal promises better results with less confrontation.  Dave Foreman founded <A HREF="http://www.hrc.wmin.ac.uk/campaigns/ef/earthfirst.html">Earth First!</A> because of his frustration with the pro-environment but entirely statist Carter Administration.  He observes &quot;conservationists have relied too much on federal government law and regulation&quot;.  He reminds us that it &quot;has also been easier to pass federal laws than to work out good conservation through the free market or through voluntary agreements.&quot;</P>

<P>Preserving vast tracts of land, as Wildlands Easement Trusts promise to do, is a daunting task not amenable to quick fixes.  The dangerous temptation is to rely upon governments alone to constrain those who would gladly plunder our natural heritage.   America's heritage is not about coercing dissenters into obedient silence.  As Alexis de Tocqueville explained early in our history, Americans excel at building voluntary institutions that foster cooperative pursuit of shared interests.  </P>

<P>Saving wildlands by dipping deeper into the U.S. Treasury is doomed to frustration and failure.  Federal management predictably fails to deliver environmental goods--be they commodities like timber or amenities like habitat.  There is an important federal role to monitor against abuse and adjudicate conflict.  Mischief follows when it tries to manage.</P>

<P>A decentralized and flexible approach, and positive incentives can make Wildlands Easement Trusts happen.  Private and public, nongovernmental wildlands provide our best and most realistic opportunities to further protect nature's precious gifts.</P>

<P>We have many successful models all across America:  the R Ranch in California, the Iram Wild Horse Preserve in South Dakota, Pennsylvania's <A HREF="http://jasper.stanford.edu/OBFS/stations/PA_Hawk_Mountain_Sanct..html">Hawk Mountain</A>, and the <A HREF="http://www.biddeford.com/~mcht/trusts/mcht.htm">Maine Coast Heritage Trust</A>.  These nature preserves offer important lessons in the new environmentalism. </P>

<title>Rector -- How to Reform Welfare -- Heritage </title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>

<h2>HOW TO REFORM WELFARE</h2>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/rector.htm">Robert Rector</a></center>
<p>
	In the battle over welfare reform, the blame game already has started. The White House stands ready to point the accusing finger at Congress if lawmakers dare to take the tough steps that are needed, while Congress cowers in fear at the thought of being blamed for "lack of compassion." 
<p>	But hope springs eternal. Just in case Washington decides it wants to forget politics and "just do it," as the saying goes, here are a few of the steps it can take to get welfare spending under control and break the cycle of dependency:<p>
<ol>
<li>	The growth of total welfare spending must be capped at 3 percent per year. One reason welfare spending is out of control is because there aren't any controls on it. In 1965, Americans paid about 1.5 percent of gross national product (GNP) for welfare. By 1993, they were paying more than 5 percent, or $324 billion. In just three years, we're projected to be paying around $500 billion, or about 6 percent of GNP. 
<p>	A 3 percent cap on the yearly increase in welfare spending would force state welfare bureaucracies to grapple with illegitimacy and dependency. And reformers should note: A 3 percent "cap" is still a yearly spending increase of 3 percent. It's not a cutoff.<p>
<li>	 Limit welfare benefits to unwed teenage mothers. Welfare makes it possible for young, unmarried women to have children and set up house as single parents. This is another reason welfare costs are skyrocketing. The welfare rolls increase geometrically year by year because many welfare children grow up to do the same thing their mothers did. This must stop. Statistically, children born out of wedlock are by far the most likely to fail in school, take drugs and engage in crime. 
<p>	Instead of paying money directly to unwed teenage mothers, the money they would have received through Aid to Families with Dependent Children (AFDC) and Food Stamps should be given to the states. States could develop programs to assist teenage mothers, including promoting adoption, orphanages or assisting young mothers in tightly-supervised group homes. Since other families don't receive increased income when they have additional children, neither should women on AFDC and/or Food Stamps. Eventually, direct federal payments to unwed mothers of all ages should be eliminated, so there is no longer a government reward for having children out of wedlock.<p>
<li>	 The law requiring mothers on AFDC to identify the father of their children, routinely ignored by welfare workers, should be enforced. Modern DNA testing permits determination of a child's father beyond a shadow of doubt. Once paternity is determined, fathers should be required to pay child support to offset welfare costs. If a father claimed that he could not pay, the government could require him to perform community service.  <p> 
<li>	 Reduce welfare's marriage penalty. When couples on welfare marry, their benefits decrease. This discourages marriage and contributes to illegitimacy. A pro-marriage tax credit should be extended to low-income married couples who support dependent children and have at least one parent employed. The tax credit should be worth $1,000, and families paying less than that amount in federal taxes in any particular year should be able to receive the remainder of the credit in the form of a check from the government.<p> 
<li>	 Establish serious workfare. Previous welfare "reforms," including President Clinton's  recent proposal, have talked about workfare without requiring many people to work. Work requirements should be imposed first on able-bodied, non-elderly, single persons on welfare, followed by fathers in two-parent families and absent fathers who fail to pay child support. All able-bodied persons in the AFDC-UP and Food Stamp programs and half of all single mothers on AFDC -- those whose children are school age -- should have to work for their benefits.<p>   
<li>	 Pass school voucher programs as part of a broader effort to promote cultural renewal. Members of Congress must recognize three rules for escaping poverty in America; no one who follows them will be "chronically poor": a) finish high school; b) Get a job -- any job -- and stick with it; and c) Do not have children outside of marriage. </ol>
<p>	Ample research shows that the church is the institution best suited to instill the values that encourage these behaviors. School voucher programs would help churches play a greater role in molding America's youth. Poor parents should be able to take vouchers worth the sum spent on their children in public schools and use them at schools of their choice, including private, religious schools. Many low-income parents, trying to save their kids from violence, drugs and sexual promiscuity, would love to place them in church-based schools. If voucher plans were set up in cities, dozens of high-quality, private religious schools would spring up, operating as adjuncts of urban churches. 
<p>	Congress and the White House have an opportunity to convert the welfare system from a one-way handout into a system of mutual responsibility in which welfare recipients are given aid but also are expected to contribute something to society for assistance given.    
<p>	Or, they can just keep playing politics.

<title>Administration Fails to Make Case for U.S. Troops In Bosnia -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h2>ADMINISTRATION FAILS TO MAKE CASE 
FOR U.S. TROOPS IN BOSNIA</h2>
By John Hillen<br>
Commentary: <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
10/19/95<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
	On Oct. 17, hearings on Capitol Hill exposed the Clinton administration's plan to use 25,000 American troops to implement a Bosnian peace accord as a haphazard and risky enterprise with no coherent political or military rationale. 
<p>	Lawmakers repeatedly challenged members of the Clinton foreign policy team to present clearly defined, attainable political goals and military objectives, estimates of the probability of success, the risks entailed, and readings of the level of support from the American people. Former U.S. Secretary of State Robert McNamara recently noted in his Vietnam memoirs that the Kennedy and Johnson administrations failed to address these fundamental issues in the early debates over Vietnam. It was evident from the responses of President Clinton's team that his administration is making the same deadly mistake.
<p>	The Clinton peace plan for Bosnia is a classic example of putting the cart before the horse. Instead of making a troop commitment that is tailored to support a known, specific, workable mission, President Clinton made the commitment of 25,000 U.S. ground troops first, more than two years ago, without any peace plan in hand. Now, his team is busy figuring out how to shoehorn a plan to fit an arbitrary U.S. military commitment only incidentally related to military conditions that may exist on the ground. This is strategy backwards -- a formula for confusion and disarray -- and members of Congress are correct to question it.
<p>	The hearings on Capitol Hill raised other basic yet prescient questions. For example, what are the objectives of this mission, and how will America know when they have been achieved? The 25,000-troop U.S. "Implementation Force" has been given no clearly defined and attainable military goals, nor specific criteria by which U.S. commanders can measure their success. The Clinton peace plan doesn't even address military objectives, and commits American forces to static "picket duty" in buffer zone. U.S. forces are intended to sit there (as in "sitting duck") and "monitor" infractions of the peace accord.  
<p>	In testimony on Capitol Hill, Gen. Lewis MacKenzie, a Canadian who commanded the first U.N. troops in Sarajevo, made no bones about the fact that, of all the various national contingents, U.S. troops would be the primary targets for disgruntled belligerents. He also let the House National Security Committee know that while the administration may try to portray the Implementation Force as a neutral "peacekeeping" presence, the United States is clearly the enemy of one side in this conflict. After all, the Serbs aren't likely to regard U.S. air strikes against them as acts of neutrality. Under such conditions, Gen. MacKenzie said if he were an American military officer, he "wouldn't touch this mission with a ten-foot pole." 
<p>	Another problem is that we have no exit strategy. Since U.S. forces have no well-defined and achievable military goals, "mission creep" -- in which adverse circumstances force greater military commitment to avert disaster -- is built into the Clinton peace plan. The administration will be under tremendous pressure to succeed after deploying 25,000 troops to Bosnia. President Clinton will be sorely tempted to escalate U.S. military efforts when faced with inevitable resistance from the warring factions and the threat of widespread American casualties. 
<p>	Aware of these concerns, the White House's answer is to pledge that U.S. forces will be pulled out in 12 months. This is a purely political decision unrelated to actual conditions that could arise on the ground. Almost all lawmakers recognized the electoral motivations behind this pledge and were extremely skeptical when Joint Chiefs of Staff Chairman Gen. John Shaliskavili defended the 12-month timetable as being based on unexplained "operational reasons." As former Under Secretary of Defense Richard Perle testified, "An exit date is not an exit strategy."
<p>	The entire Clinton plan is based on a best-case scenario. Yet, astute military planning, down to the lowest levels, must always take into account what to do when anything (or everything) goes wrong. Senators were rightly astounded when Secretary of Defense William Perry stated he "could not conceive of circumstances where troops would stay longer" than the one-year target date. This comment exposed the political and military naivet that permeates this administration.
<p> 	Needless to say, there are no contingency plans to address a worst-case scenario. Should there be anything less than cooperation by the Bosnian parties, America would be forced to cut and run, or reinforce troops and escalate military efforts to make the peace plan succeed. 
<p>	The Clinton foreign policy team has failed to provide satisfactory answers to Congress on the fundamental issues involved in any military action, to say nothing of the host of other questions that arise about this particular mission. In the absence of such a rationale or credible plan for U.S. involvement, Congress should withhold its approval of President Clinton's Bosnia peace plan.

Since 1991, Kristi Hamrick has served the Family Research Council 
as director of communications, aggressively taking the pro-family 
message forward both in paid media (advertising) and earned media 
(news).  Mrs. Hamrick manages a broad operation that handles all 
in-coming requests from the news media -- from CNN to <I>The New 
York Times</I> -- and out-going media strategy, developing the 
framework for taking the pro-family message nationwide, via 
television, radio and print, and through such vehicles as op-ed 
articles or policy pieces.

<p>

The news operation at FRC, a pro-family policy and lobbying group, 
works to respond to breaking events and to look ahead at the trends 
that are shaping the American family.  The goal is to influence the 
cultural mindset by taking part in every pro-family debate as it 
happens.  Mrs. Hamrick is a spokesperson for FRC as well as a 
representative of the organization at events and conferences. She 
debates regularly on television, and her appearances include ABC's 
<i>Good Morning America, CBS This Morning</i>, NBC's <i>Today Show, 
The Montel Williams Show, Fox News</i>, CNN's <i>Jesse Jackson Both 
Sides</i> and numerous other CNN programs.  Her articles have appeared 
in <a href="/townhall/FRC/whois/hamdoc.html"><I>USA Today</I></a>, 
and she has been quoted nationwide, in publications including the 
<I>New York Times, Washington Post, Wall Street Journal, Washington 
Times, USA Today, Boston Globe</I>, Gannett News, Knight Ridder News, 
and The Associated Press. Her voice can be heard daily on radio 
programs throughout the United States.

<p>

As part of the coordinated FRC effort, Mrs. Hamrick also develops 
media strategies as part of FRC's work in government relations, 
grassroots coalition building, research and policy development, 
corporate and community outreach and publication marketing.

<p>

Before joining FRC in 1991, Mrs. Hamrick worked as press secretary 
in the Hopkins for Governor Campaign.  Mrs. Hamrick was a spokesperson 
for the campaign and directed the media operation for the U.S. 
congressman from Kentucky when he won his primary bid. Earlier in her 
career, Mrs. Hamrick also worked in the press operations of the late 
U.S. Senator John Heinz and Senator Arlen Specter, both of Pennsylvania.

<p>

Most of Mrs. Hamrick's experience is in the media.  In Washington, 
D.C., she was an on-air correspondent for CBN News Washington, D.C. 
Bureau, covering social issues.  In print, Mrs. Hamrick worked for 
<I>The Muncie Star</I>, covering courts, crime and politics, after 
completing a Pulliam Fellowship at <I>The Indianapolis Star</I>. In 
fact, Mrs. Hamrick worked her way through college as a writer and 
journalist.  She continues the crafts of a wordsmith, working on 
occassion as a freelance journalist.

<p>

Mrs. Hamrick's extensive speaking experience includes many appearances 
in schools and colleges.  She also taught news writing and advanced 
news writing at Ball State University in Indiana.

<p>

Mrs. Hamrick graduated <I>cum laude</I> and with honors in

<title> Trade Deficit Myths -- Heritage </title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h2>TRADE DEFICIT MYTHS</h2>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/johnson.htm">Bryan Johnson</a></center>
<p>
	The Clinton administration's near collision with Japan over automobiles and auto parts almost started a trade war with America's second-largest trading partner.
<p>	Fortunately, the White House backed off from insisting on numerical targets in trade agreements, even though numerical purchasing quotas were the heart of its position. Thus, what was largely a defeat for Clinton's managed-trade policy is a victory for the American consumer.
<p>	But the president and his trade team may not have learned the larger lesson from their defeat. Underlying the Clinton administration's policies toward Japan is an irrational fear of trade deficits and the belief that protectionist policies are necessary to combat them.
<p>	In fact, myths and faulty assumptions about trade deficits are the intellectual foundation of the administration's managed-trade policies.
<p>	Trade deficits are more a sign of strength than of weakness. The meaning of the U.S. trade deficit is that Americans can afford to buy more goods than their foreign trading partners.  This is a sign of America's wealth. The influx of foreign goods and services in return for dollars adds to America's wealth by increasing our standard of living; it does not detract from it.
<p>	The way protectionists see it, most people run a trade "deficit;" with their grocer.  When you go to the supermarket and buy $150 worth of groceries, protectionist theorists could chalk this up as a trade "surplus;" of $150 for the grocer, while you have a "deficit" of  $150. But this is not the case at all. The grocer ends up with $150 in currency, while you have $150 worth of groceries. It is a mutually beneficial transaction. Both you and the grocer are winners.
<p>	Another misunderstanding involves trade-deficit figures. At least one-third to one-half of the U.S. trade-deficit figure consists of U.S. imports from overseas subsidiaries of American companies. For example, when Ford Mexico sends a motor from its plant to the Ford assembly plant in Detroit, it is counted as an import: a "deficit" supposedly is created. If the car is then sold in the United States, why should this still be calculated as part of the trade deficit? Most of the money made from this sale stays in the United States.
<p>	Protectionists claim trade deficits are a major cause of unemployment. History shows, however, that unemployment typically drops as the trade deficit rises.
<p>	For example, while the trade deficit leaped from 1983 to 1984 and peaked in 1987, the U.S. unemployment rate fell from 9.6 percent in 1983 to 5.5 percent in 1988. When the trade deficit began to shrink from 1989 to 1991, unemployment rose from 5.3 percent 6.7 percent. When it began to rise from 1992 to 1994, unemployment shrank from 7.4 percent to 6.1 percent.
<p>	U.S. policy-makers often use Japan as an example of how a country can eliminate trade deficits by managing trade and industry. A closer look reveals that too much government "management" may be responsible for Japan's current economic malaise. If living standards are the measure of success, Japan has lost the "economic war" with the United States. For example, the real purchasing power of Japanese consumers is 30 percent to 40 percent lower than that of American consumers. Thus, the Japanese are at least one-third poorer than Americans.
<p>	Japan's lower standard of living can be attributed partly to managed trade and industrial policies that drive up the costs of consumer goods.  For example, policies that restrict agricultural imports force the average Japanese family to spend about 25 percent of its disposable income on food, compared to less than 12 percent for Americans.
<p>	Advocates of managed trade argue that closed overseas markets are the chief reason for America's trade deficit. But if American companies are so beset by closed markets overseas, why is America the world's largest exporter?  The United States exported more than $697 billion in goods and services in 1994.  By contrast, Germany exported $607 billion and Japan only $395 billion.  Clearly, most U.S. exporters find overseas markets for their goods.
<p>	Many trade-deficit "hawks" argue that the United States has an open market, while Japan restricts U.S. imports. Thus,  Japanese protectionism is the cause of the U.S. trade deficit with Japan. In truth, Japan and the United States have relatively equal levels of protectionism.
<p>	Most Americans don't realize that Japan is the largest overseas market for U.S. goods and services. Last year alone, Japan imported $51 billion in goods from the United States.  That was more than America exported to the United Kingdom and Germany combined ($25.9 billion and $18.7 billion, respectively).
<p>	Moreover, on a per-capita basis, Japan buys more from the United States than the United States buys from Japan.  For example, on average, each Japanese citizen bought $444 worth of U.S. goods and services in 1994, while each American citizen purchased $441 worth of Japanese goods and services.  But because Japan's population is about half of America's, a deficit exists.
<p>	Trade deficits are not harmful to the economy.  If they were, America would not be the economic powerhouse it is today.

<p>
Opposition to President Clinton's boldest foreign policy initiative -- U.S. military intervention in Haiti last year with 21,000 troops at a cost of $3 billion --  has now come full circle. With the defection of former president Jimmy Carter as an uncritical supporter of the administration's effort to "restore" democracy to the Caribbean island, the White House's touting of Haiti as its greatest foreign policy "success" is sounding pretty silly.
<p>
The former president, who provided crucial political cover last year for Clinton's decision to dispatch U.S. forces to Haiti,  recently issued a devastating critique of the political process imposed under the lethal protection of U.S. guns by Haitian president Jean-Bertrand Aristide.
<p>
The report, issued by the Atlanta-based Carter Center, exposes Aristide's one-party "Lavalas" rule, with its widespread corruption, mismanagement and ballot manipulating, particularly in the June 25 election. Aristide's allies swept local and parliamentary seats in that balloting.
<p>
President Carter's critique of Aristide is especially startling, considering the long political association between the two. When Aristide won Haiti's 1990 presidential election, the Carter Center was at the forefront of groups supporting the results.
<p>
But relations began to sour within months after Carter personally helped pave the way for Aristide's triumphant return in October 1994. By year's end, it was apparent to all but the most ideologically driven that Aristide was personally turning Haiti into yet another one-man dictatorship -- his own. This should surprise no one, considering Aristide's political personality and his Marxist beliefs.
<p>
A critical part of Aristide's plan for seizing total power in Haiti has been his illegal and authoritarian command of the Provisional Electoral Council (CEP) that conducted the fraudulent June election. Sensing trouble in March, Carter visited Haiti and was formally rebuffed by Aristide. Unofficially, he was greeted by hostile crowds and vicious graffiti, all engineered by Lavalas street gangs intent on embarrassing the former U.S. chief executive.
<p>
The Carter Center report on the ensuing election -- written by Carter confidant and former National Security Council advisor Robert Pastor -- documents the disgraceful conduct of the Aristide government and his Lavalas party. "Of the 13 elections I have observed, the June 25 Haitian elections were the most disastrous technically, with the most insecure count," Pastor  said in the report. "I personally witnessed the compromise of one-third of the ballot boxes in Port-au-Prince."
<p>
According to the report, the election was riddled with graft, fraud and chaos, with widespread irregularities, ballots burned, hundreds of voting stations never opened and tens of thousands of people never able to vote.
<p>
As an observer of the election on behalf of the International Republican Institute, I also observed the burning of ballots, counting irregularities and intimidation of  people seeking to vote by Lavalas groups. This was indeed a sham, a complete denial of democratic rule.
<p>
As might be expected, former President Carter is still looking for ways to "fix" Haiti. His report includes several constructive suggestions, including criteria for re-running the June election under  a revised CEP that includes more members who are independent of Aristide, improved ballot worker training, and creation of a new national task force on political reconciliation.
<p>
All of these are good ideas. But recent experience and a long history of corrupt Haitian politics indicate that the problems encountered by the Clinton-led U.S. intervention are deeply embedded in Haiti's political culture.
<p>
Thus, if nothing else, Aristide's rigged elections may at least have served the useful purpose of magnifying Haiti's long-standing problems for the rest of the world to see in something closer to their true light. 
<p>
As another former president said more than a century ago, "democracy is not created by aspirations or by new faith." Rather, said Woodrow Wilson, democracy "is built up by slow habit." By this time-tested measure, Haiti can hardly be called a democracy.

<h3>Networks Search for Victims in the Wake of Second Budget Stalemate<br>
The Shutdown Soap Opera</h3>
<p>
December brought a second shutdown of the federal government, and with it came the networks' ratings-grabbing specialty: hanky-waving sob stories of shutdown "victims."
<p>
On December 22, a week into the shutdown and before paychecks were delayed, Jack Smith mourned on World News Tonight: "The shutdown now has a human face. Joe Skattleberry and his wife Lisa both work for the government. Both have been furloughed. They can't afford a Christmas tree."
<p>
NBC's John Palmer warned on the December 29 Today: "The shutdown is affecting more people's lives every day in places like Grand Teton National Park, where furloughed park employees worried about mortgages, car payments, and  credit card bills have begun filing unemployment benefits. In California and in dozens of other states, serious cutbacks in food programs are threatened unless the budget crisis is resolved soon." Later, David Bloom added: "The shutdown continues. The pain spreads. The pressure grows for Washington to end America's worst budget crisis."
<p>
On January 2, CBS Evening News reporter Scott Pelley compared budget negotiators to bombers: "In April, terrorists tried to kill them. Today, politicians stopped their paychecks. In Oklahoma City's Social Security office, they're being ordered to work for nothing....The bomb broke Beverly Rankin's ankle. Politics is breaking her bank." 
<p>
That night NBC Nightly News anchor Tom Brokaw mourned: "Far from the marbled halls of Congress and the elegant furnishings of the White House, this government shutdown is about a lot more than politics. It's about people and their real needs."
<p>
NBC's George Lewis found an Indian health clinic in San Diego: "Two-thirds of the clinic's budget, $95,000 a month, comes from the federal government. Without that money, the clinic can't meet its payroll. The people who run this clinic fear that if it has to close its doors, many of the 4,000 patients who seek treatment here will not look elsewhere. Ron Morton says traditionally, Native Americans do not like to accept handouts." But didn't NBC just say the clinic is two-thirds funded by the federal government? Morton later asserted that "if this budget is not signed there are people who are going to die."
<p>
Bryant Gumbel preached at the start of the January 4 Today: "Although some politicians have foolishly suggested the fact that we are going on about our business despite the absence of the workers says maybe they weren't needed anyway, we will show you how some average Americans are suffering each and every day as a result of what is now 20 days of the government shutdown."

</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
MADAM CHAIRMAN, DISTINGUISHED MEMBERS OF THE COMMITTEE, I am pleased to have the opportunity to offer the testimony of the Family Research Council on the nomination of Dr. Henry W. Foster to be Surgeon General of the United States.  The Family Research Council is a nonpartisan, nonprofit organization dedicated to analysis of the impact of public policy on the traditional family.  We place particular emphasis on the ways in which society can preserve and strengthen the two-parent family, and maximize the benefits that stable, intact family structure can confer on this nation's economic vitality, social well-being and spiritual strength.
<P>
     We believe that the position of Surgeon General of the United States now, more than ever, requires an individual who understands these dimensions of public policy.  Evolu- tion of the office of Surgeon General in the past two decades has diminished its direct policy-making and admini- strative role.  Evolution of the nature of many of the public health threats facing this nation today has magnified the importance of the Surgeon General's office in articulat-ing the essentials of healthy behavior.  The intersection of individual health and moral responsibility has never been more obvious.
<P>
     For this reason, it is critical that the office of Surgeon General be occupied by a person who has worked comfortably within that intersection.  That person must possess a clear, and consistently expressed, vision of public health.  He or she must be alive to the profound ethical dimensions of health issues in the late 20th century, and have a proven track record of responding cor-rectly to issues as they arise, not merely riding with the tide of public or professional opinion.  In short, he or she must be a leader, not a follower, intellectually and instinctively true to the highest standards of ethical behavior in medicine.  
<P>
     As a threshold matter, a Surgeon General must know and be able to articulate who he is and what he believes.  From the very beginning, when President Clinton announced his choice of Herny Foster on February 2, this nominee has been unable to articulate from one day to the next a consistent account even of his own career.  At every turn, members of this committee, of our own organization, and of the press have elicited from Dr. Foster and the administration new and revised accounts of various dimensions of his creed and his practice.  To this day, not one of these accounts fully squares with the other.  To this day, not one of these accounts amounts to a full disclosure by the nominee regard-ing his personal involvement in the most wrenching health policy questions of our time.
<P>
     The course of this nomination resembles a tent in spring rain.  Touch its soggy canvas anywhere and more revelations seep through.  It is hard to imagine an individual who has been implicared in more major public health controversies than Dr. Foster.  From the Tuskegee syphilis experiment, to involuntary sterilization of men-tally handicapped women, to the performance of abortions and advocacy of abortion on demand, to distribution of condoms and other birth control devices to children, to the school-based clinic debate, to involvement with radical sex education programs, Dr. Foster has been on the cutting edge -- and nearly always on its wrong side.
<P>
     As this testimony is written, it is impossible to say with assurance that he hasn't <B> always </B>been on the wrong side, because nothing of what is known about Dr. Foster's role in each of these controversies is the result of the nominee's frank and full disclosure.  Everything that is known about them is the result of examination of the nominee's record and repeated questioning of that record by others, our-selves included.  The Administration has been reluctant to take the first step to volunteer accurate information about any of the issues that have placed this nomination in jeopardy.
<P>
     Before discussing those issues in detail, I want to make one final point.  This nomination has not been, and is not being, "Borked."  No one has led an advertising campaign distorting the nominee's record, impugning his character, or implying dreaded, unnamed consequences for the nation if he takes office.  No one has scrolled through a list of his tastes in videos. The debate over this nomination is first and foremost about profoudnly important questions of public policy, and this nomination is in difficulty first and fore-most because the nominee himself has been unable to provide a consistent and accurate account of where he has stood and what he has done regarding these questions.  Even Robert Bork's most vociferous opponents will agree, I think, that he did not leave anyone in doubt about the authenticity of his beliefs.
<P>
     Doubt, on the other hand, is the essence of Dr. Foster's nomination.
<P>
<B> Biographical Omission</B>
<P>
     The difficulty with Dr. Foster's nomination began with the refusal of the White House to share with the public, and with this committee, his basic philosophy.  The biography of Dr. Foster released by the White House mentioned his chron-ological affiliations, but totally ignored his lifelong ties to Planned Parenthood.  That this would be the occasion for controversy can hardly be something the Administration would not recognize.  The <I> Chronicle of Philanthropy </I>has noted on several occasions that the Planned Parenthood Federation of America is among the top 10 most frequently objected to "charities" in the United States.  The <I> Chronicle </I>has reported that no nonprofit in the United States is more commonly eschewed through "restricted" gifts to the nation's United Way agencies.
<P>
     The reasons are simple, and to express them is to belie the White House's claim that Dr. Foster is a "mainstream" nominee.  The nominee claims that he is committed to absti- nence as the primary approach to sex education.  Planned Parenthood has led the ideological and legal assault on abstinence education programs in the United States.  The nominee claims that he desires to make abortion "safe, legal and rare."  But he has served as a "Public Policy Advocate" for the Planned Parenthood Federation during a time when its national leadership had dedicated itself to opening 75 abortion clinics across the United States<I> merely to meet a numerical goal consonant with the 75th anniversary of its founding</I>.
<P>
     Dr. Foster has sought to portray himself as an advocate for the family, and for parent-child communication.  But during his time as an official of Planned Parenthood of Nashville, that organization filed suit against a Tennessee law requiring parental consent for abortion.  Far from being a strict statute, that law provided for a judicial bypass procedure by which teenagers could seek abortions under court auspices without parental involvement.  Such an arrangement was not liberal enough for Planned Parenthood, which has led the national legal fight to exclude parents from involvement with their minor children's abortion decisions.  Again, this is not a mainstream position -- Americans support parental consent for abortion by margins of 2-1 or 3-1.  Parents themselves show an even higher rate of support for such laws.
<P>
     It is possible that Dr. Foster was and is ignorant of these positions taken by organizations with whom he has been associated for nearly two decades.  But it is not likely. Ignorance is a valid defense in some circumstances, but it is not a valid credential for someone who seeks to become the "nation's doctor," and the leader of a national crusade against teenage pregnancy.
<P>
     The American people had a right to know of Dr. Foster's association with this organization and its ideas.  The White House had no right to omit it from the biographical informa-tion it provided the Congress and the nation.
<P>
<B> Tuskegee Institute</B>
<P>
     "Ignorance" is also the nominee's defense against the circumstantial evidence, and the direct testimony of one individual, Dr. Luther McRae, that, as Vice President of the Macon County Medical Society in 1969, Dr. Foster partic-ipated in a Public Health Service briefing on the infamous Tuskegee syphilis experiments.  It is not in dispute that Dr, Foster spoke out against the experiments in 1972, when they were publicly revealed in media accounts.  It is pre-cisely that public expression of outrage that provoked the reaction of Dr. McRae, who has stated that he is willing to testify to this committee under oath that Dr. Foster was indeed present at the meeting on May 12, 1969 where PHS officials sought the "surrogate informed consent" of the MCMS for continuation of the Tuskegee Study.<P>
     McRae is categorical, and here is what he told Carl Ramsey of Family News in Focus:
<P>
<UL> The most striking thing about it, when
         the news broke . . . I saw on television
         and read in the papers that Dr. Foster 
         was involved in the public outrage about
         the study having been conducted.  And I
         was struck by that, in that I knew he was
         at the meeting . . . I asked myself why
         Henry didn't go ahead and say something at
         the meeting that night in 1969. Because he
         had every opportunity, nobody had a muzzle
         on him.i</UL><P>     McRae is also specific, recalling where Dr. Foster sat.  Moreover, he holds no animus against his colleague and believes -- in contrast to my view -- that he would make an excellent Surgeon General.  This fact lends added weight to his assertion regarding Dr. Foster's knowledge of the Tus-kegee experiment in 1969.
<P>
     Dr. McRae insists that Henry Foster did know about the existence of the experiment.  But it is equally important to recognize that he should have known, and that the May 12 meeting at a restaurant outside Tuskegee was not his only opportunity to inform himself about a PHS study that had been under way for nealry four decades.  First, the study had been described in the medical journals; as an obstetric-ical chief working in a county with one of the nation's highest rates of syphilis (indeed, this was one reason PHS originally chose Macon County as the site of the nontreat-ment study), at perhaps that county's most prominent ob-gy
center, Dr. Foster would have reason to be well read in the literature of venereal disease.
<P>
     Dr. McRae has noted, as does James Jones' account of the Tuskegee experiment, Bad Blood, that PHS officials supplied the Macon County Medical Society with a list of the individuals "participating" in the study, to assure that they would not obtain treatment, particularly antibiotics, by other means from local physicians.ii  Given the "zeal," as Jones puts it, with which PHS officials pursued the cooper- ation of Macon County physicians, it seems unlikely that distribution of this list to the Vice President of the Society's Vice President would be overlooked.<P>    Jones also points out that in 1970the PHS "also reestablished something of its former working relationship with medical personnel at John A. Andrew Hospital."  A representative of PHS, Dr. Joseph G. Caldwell, met with the hospital's administrator and medical director and contracted to have the surviving men's X-rays taken there in the hospital's new facility.  Again, it is possible that the presence of PHS officials, and the conduct of examinations of the syphilitic men, in the facility where he was chief of obstetrics would have entirely escaped the notice of Dr. Foster.  
<P>
     Assuming as much, however, it is hardly a flattering protrayal of Dr. Foster's engagement with public health issues when the most significant events of his time took place in his immediate vicinity, with the cooperation of the Medical Society of which he was Vice President, without his taking cognizance of them.  Such a lapse may not amount to much for a physician who simply desires to continue his work serving the general population; it is a fatal failure of responsibility in an individual who claims to have the ability to serve as the nation's top spokesman on public health.  Dr. Foster says that he did not know of the exper- iments.  The key is that nearly all his colleagues did, that at least one says that he himself did, and that, in any case, he should have known.
<P>
<B> Dr. Foster and Abortion</B>
<P>
     On the issue of abortion, Dr. Foster has taken the fifth.  That is to say, he has taken at least five posi- tions on the number of abortions he has performed or guided to completion.  He has misstated not merely his own involvement in abortion, but inaccurately described the guidelines on medical education under which, he claims, a study of prostaglandin suppositories was conducted during his tenure at Meharry Medical School.  Worse, he has used language in documents officially released by the Department of Health and Human Services that finesses the question of his involvement in abortion.  These finesses put his vera-city not merely in question, but in grave doubt.  
<P>
    Let me summmarize:<P>
<UL> <B> Late January.  </B>A White House official informs<BR>
      Chairman Kassebaum that Dr. Foster had per-<BR>
      formed one abortion during his medical career.<BR>
      ("Foster Says He Performed Abortions,"<I> The Wash-<BR>
      ington Post</I>, Feb. 4, 1995).
<P>
 <B> February 3, 1995.  </B>The Department of Health<BR>
       and Human Services releases a statement by<BR>
       Dr. Foster which states, " I believe that I<BR>
       performed fewer than a dozen pregnancy term-<BR>
       inations." (Statement by Dr. Henry Foster,<BR>
       Nominee for U.S. Surgeon General.)
<P>
 <B> February 6, 1995.  </B>The International Foundation<BR>
       for Genetic Research/Michael Fund releases a<BR>
       transcript, first disputed by the White House<BR>
       but then acknowledged to be genuine, in which<BR>
       Foster states, "I have done a lot of amniocen-<BR>
       tesis and therapeutic abortions, probably near<BR>
       700." (Department of Health, Education and Wel-<BR>
       fare, Office of the Secretary, Ethics Advisory<BR>
       Board, Meeting V, Friday, November 10, 1978<BR>
       Seattle, Washington, p. 180, 197).
<P>
       The Foundation also releases a story from the<BR>
       November 1980 <I> ObGyn News </I>describing an abortion-<BR>
       pill study conducted by Dr. Foster at Meharry on<BR>
       behalf of Upjohn Pharmaceuticals that resulted in<BR>
        59 completed abortions on patients in the trial.     <BR>
<P>
 <B> February 8, 1995.  </B>Appearing on ABC's<I> Nightline</I>,<BR>
        Dr. Foster acknowledges performing 39 abortions, but<BR>
       notes that this does not include any abortions he<BR>
       may have performed before 1973.  Foster tells Kop-<BR>
       pel that this total also does not include the 59<BR>
       abortions carried out under the trial he super-<BR>
       vised, because he did not personally perform them.</UL>
 <P>
     Thus, in little more than a week, Dr. Foster deployed five different versions of his record regarding abortions.<P>
Volatility like this makes the Mexican peso look stable by comparison.  It prompted even the spokeswoman for the Department of Health and Human Services, Avis LaVelle, to remark, "The next time we utter a number [of Foster's abortions], it won't be based on Dr. Foster's recollec-tions."iii  But if you take a closer look at the February 3 statement released over his name, it appears amply crafted to disguise the information that was released on February 6 by the International Foundation for Genetic Research.<P>     As <I> The Washington Times </I>pointed out on February 7, Dr. Foster's artful February 3 statement offered circumlocu- tions regarding his term as chief of service at Tuskegee and Meharry.  Of the "wide variety of medical procedures and research" performed at both, "all," he wrote, "were in accordance with the law and educational requirements."iv  As the <I> Times </I>observed, "Abortion . . . has been legal for many years, and thus had Dr. Foster performed hundreds of abortions as chief of service - as opposed to acting in his capacity as a private physician - that fact would not have been actually lied about, given the statement's careful wording."
<P>
     The same can be said about the prostaglandin supposi- tory trial, which Dr. Foster was compelled to elaborate upon the following night in his exchange with Ted Koppel.  There he launched the "educational requirements" explanation, citing alleged accreditation requirements as the justifi- cation for seeking grant money to test the abortion suppos- itory for Upjohn.  There are two issues here.  One is the intended evasion by Dr. Foster of a full accounting of his abortion activity in his February 3 statement.  The second is his misunderstanding -- or possible evasion -- regarding the rationale for the prostaglandin trial.
<P>
     As chief of obstetrics at two major medical instituti- tions, Dr. Foster surely should have known that nothing in the then-extant accreditation guidelines from the Accredi-tation Council for Graduate Medical Education required any medical school to offer training in performing abortions, much less to conduct trials of experimental abortion drugs.  In relevant part, the guidelines state that:
<P>
<UL> Resident education [in obstetrics and<BR>
         gynecology] must include, but not neces-<BR>
         sarily be limited to the following:<BR>
<P>
         1. Obstetrics<BR>
         a. The full range of obstetrics, includ-<BR>
            ing high-risk obstetrics and medical<BR>
            and surgical complications of pregnancy.</UL>
<P>
     Arguably this standard could be interpreted as requiring training in the management of complications resulting from botched abortions, although the term "abor-tion" (or any euphemism for it) is nowhere mentioned in the standards.  Even under this reading of the standard, however, it would clearly be unethical for a program to arrange for a botched abortion to give the residents a training opportunity.  Conducting a trial of a new drug (one that never did reach the market) would just as clearly be an unethical way to fulfill such an obligation.
<P>
     But the bottom line is that no such obligation existed in the late 1970s when the trial was conducted, nor does one exist now, when Dr. Foster cites it as justification for Meharry's participation in the Phase 2 trial and uses it as a mask for a major abortion activity he obviously did not want disclosed.  It is only an added insult to common knowl- edge when Foster continues to cite this erroneous account of accreditation requirements to justify a project that was clearly taken on because of Dr. Foster's lifelong commitment to abortion.
<P>
     Finally, it should be pointed out that as of the date of this testimony, March 24, 1995, a complete accounting of Dr. Foster's activity on behalf of abortion is still not in the public record.  He has specifically excluded revelations regarding any abortions he may have performed prior to 1973, when he began his association with Meharry.  His basis for the exclusion is the unavailability of records prior to that date.  Given how well Dr. Foster's "recollections" have served him and the administration on other issues, it's just as well.
<P>
<B> Involuntary Sterilization</B>
<P>
     Dr. Foster's involvement in the possily involuntary sterilization of four mentally handicapped women is the only controversial issue in his background that was placed before the public by action of the White House.  Its discovery, however, was inevitable, as Dr. Foster himself described the prcedures in an article entitled "Removal of the Normal Uterus" in the <I> Southern Medical Journal </I>in 1976.v  Dr. Foster states in the article only that he had "begun to use hysterectomy in patients with severe mental retardation.  Hysterectomy," he noted, "can be done <I>eithe</I>r [emphasis added] for sterilization or to eliminate the menses[.]"vi<P>     Whatever the presumed indication for the procedure, obviously hysterectomy eliminates both fertility and the menses.  This is important because hysterectomy carries significantly higher risks to the mother than the conven-tional means of sterilization (salpingectomy, i.e., removal of the Fallopian tubes).  As Stephen Trombley's valuable history of coercive sterilization makes clear, the United States in the early 1970s experienced a "sterilization explosion."vii  At least part of the impetus for the proce- dure (besides the desire of Planned Parenthood and other population control groups to promote permanent methods of sterilization, particularly on eugenic grounds) was the desire to provide medical students with the opportunity to perform hysterectomies.viii<P>
     This "sterilization explosion" did not go unnoticed or unopposed.  In fact, by 1973 the Health Research Group, affiliated with Ralph Nader's Public Citizen, Inc. had pub-lished a major report on sterilization abuse.  The report documented the sudden rise in sterilization, particularly targeting the indigent, the uneducated and the young, and called for federal regulation, especially to ensure informed consent.
<P>
     This report provided the statistical and anecdotal basis for federal interest in sterilization reform, but as Trombley writes, the report attained its full effect "only after the problem of sterilization abuse was heightened by the personal tragedy of the Relf family."ix<P>     Interestingly, the Relf case took place in Alabama in 1973.  Once again a major public health controversy brewed virtually under Dr. Henry Foster's nose, without his being aware of it, and at a time when had begun to perform hyster- ectomies.  The Relf case deserves a brief synopsis.  A poor balck family living in Montgomery, the Relfs had three daughters, ages 12 to 16.  At the behest of the local family planning service, the three girls were injected with the contraceptive drug Depo-Provera.  In March 1973, the oldest girl, Katie was taken, without her parents' consent, to a family planning clinic, where an IUD was inserted over her objections.
<P>
     A series of events then brought the remaining two girls, along with their mother, to a local hospital, where the mother, unable to read or write, was induced to place an "X" on a document authorizing them, without hr knowledge, to be sterilized.  A subsequent effort by the family planning service to sterilize Katie failed.  
<P>
     That summer, the Relf case came to the attention of Sen. Edward Kennedy, who on July 10, 1973 invited the Relfs to his office.  By happenstance, Sen. Kennedy's committee was at that same time engaged in the hearings on health care and human experimentation spawned by the Tuskegee incident.  The Relfs proceeded to file suit against the Department of Health, Education and Welfare, resulting in a judgment requiring the federal government to issue guidelines providing for the protection of minors from sterilization and for informed consent.
<P>
     Contemporaneous with <I> Relf </I>was the <I> Wyatt </I>case, in which a federal court declared unconstitutional an Alabama law that permitted the sterilization of mentally retarded inmates of state institutions.  Although compulsory steril-ization remained legal in many states during the 1970s, the issues raised by the Health Research Group and debated in the federal courts in Alabama had risen to national prominence two to three years before Dr. Foster's article appeared in<I> the Southern Medical Journal</I>.  Despite this fact, Foster's article makes no mention of these develop- ments, and betrays no awareness of any kind that, even in his own state, he was part of a rapidly dying consensus that such sterilizations as he had "begun" to perform were med- ically and morally unacceptable.
<P>
     As columnist Charles Krauthammer wrote on February 17, the circumstances surrounding these surgical sterilizations (why higher-risk hysterectomies were performed, whether informed consent was obtained, and from whom) involve serious questions.  The apologia that Foster performed only four such sterilizations does not answer these questions; in fact, as Krauthammer notes, "It breyas an obvious discomfort with what Foster did.  It reinforces the sense that the moral climate of the 1970s was not nearly as alien as some pretend and that even in that ancient time surgically sterilizing the retarded was a morally troubling act."x<P>    I only note in passing that Dr. Foster's first account of abortions he performed was one.  Once again, Foster failed to notice a major public health controversy that sprang up largely as a result of incidents just down the road from the institutions he helped to lead.<P><B> I Have a Future</B><P>     The plausibility of Dr. Foster's commitment to abstinence as his first priority in educating young people about sexuality was discussed above.  One example should suffice.
<P>
     In 1987 the Planned Parenthood Federation of America distributed a report written for it by Marie Haviland-James, apparently affiliated with Michigan Planned parenthood.  The report was an ideological assault on "Sex Respect," one of the most venerable abstinence education programs in the United States.  The following account of the Haviland-James report appears in an analysis of sex education programs written and published in 1991:
<P>
<UL> The Haviland-James report provided guidance<BR>
       to Planned parenthood sex educators opposing<BR>
 <I> Sex Respect </I>and seeking its removal from the<BR>
       schools.  The memo urged opponents of <I> Sex <BR>
       Respect </I>to argue that it "violates the separa-<BR>
       tion of church and state" and risks litigation<BR>
       from the American Civil Liberties Union {whose<BR>
       late counsel, Harriet Pilpel, once represented<BR>
       both organizations].  It charged that the pro-<BR>
       gram is faulty because it contained "many refer-<BR>
       ences . . . to a 'spiritual' dimension of sex-<BR>
       uality; contained use of the word 'baby' for<BR>
       fetus"; expressed "bias . . . against people<BR>
       who are sexually active and unmarried"; "com-<BR>
       pared stealing of money continually with con-<BR>
       tinued sexual activity'; contained " a descrip-<BR>
       tion of a woman haunted by guilt"; omitted <BR>
       "pro-choice material"; and, of greatest inter-<BR>
       est, included "unsubstantiated claims" such as<BR>
       "abstinence has future benefits for teens" and<BR>
       "because of the special nature of human sexual-<BR>
       ity, there's no way to have premarital sex <BR>
       without hurting someone."  The memo concluded<BR>
       that <I> Sex Respect </I>"appeals . . . to the lowest <BR>
       common denominator of mentality."xi</UL><P>     Once again, the most chartible interpretation that can be put on Dr. Foster's involvement with an organization that takes this aggressive a stance against abstinence education is that he is wholly unaware of it.  Fortunately, there is more direct evidence of Dr. Foster's approach, which is at best "abstinence-plus," with the abstinence part thrust with embarrassment up his sleeve.
<P>
     The Family Research Council has obtained a copy of the eight-page brochure produced by Foster's "I Have a Future" program to introduce the program.  Over a couple of thousand of words of text, the word "abstinence", or its equivalents is not mentioned once.  The phrase, "delaying the initiation of sexual activity," common in all true abstinence materials, is not mentioned once.  On the other hand, the brochure repeatedly stresses the objective of the program to enhance "contraceptive availability," to address the problem of "poor" "contraceptive practices," and to promote "distribution of contraceptives."xii<P>     Efforts by the Council and the media to obtain a full copy of the "I Have a Future" curriculum have been rebuffed.xiii  If the currciulum is as its sponsors say it is, this reaction to public curioisity is itself curious.  In fact, one would expect that, upon his elevation to Surgeon General, Dr. Foster would proudly promote the "I Have a Future" curriculum as a model abstinence program.  His pride should be just as great before this committee votes.<P><B> Conclusion</B><P>    These are but a few of the issues that attend the nomination of Dr. Herny Foster.  Ther common link is that in 1995, the United States deserves to have in this position of authority an individual with a clear vision of the public health consequences of personal behavior, an abiding commit- ment to marriage and the family, an alertness to the ethical dimensions of today's contemporary controversies in medicine and public policy, an unblemished record of candor and truth-telling to the American people, and a concern for every mother and child.  
<P>
     Henry Foster has shown that he is not that person.

<html><title>Medicare Miracles -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h2>MEDICARE MIRACLES</h2>
By Rep. Dan Miller<br>
Commentary: <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
10/12/95<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>	Those who say the Age of Miracles ended centuries ago must have missed the opening stages of the Medicare reform debate. In recent weeks, some miraculous events have been witnessed by millions of Americans.
	<p>First,  there has been a big change in public opinion on the issue. Until fairly recently, nobody would believe there is a problem with Medicare. Now, when you ask, 63 percent of the public say there is a problem.
<p>	Second, those of us in Congress seeking to reform Medicare are making miraculous progress in explaining what we are trying to do and why. Until recently, it was difficult for people to understand that we are not cutting Medicare spending. We're reducing the growth of Medicare spending. There is a big difference. Whenever you hear House Speaker Newt Gingrich saying Medicare is going bankrupt, he always notes that we are going to spend more money on Medicare, not less. Remarkably, this message is now even getting through to the national media.
<p>	I was struck several weeks ago when Tom Brokaw and NBC News came to my district -- which has more senior citizens in it than any other in the country -- to attend a town hall meeting with my constituents. A few days later, when Brokaw introduced the town hall segment on the national news, he said "Republicans want to reduce the growth in spending." Did you get that? Not "cut spending."
<p>	The following week, ABC News did something on the same topic, and Peter Jennings introduced a segment about how different lawmakers are handling the Medicare issue by saying "Republicans want to reduce the growth in spending on Medicare." Bingo.
<p>	Then, as if to top it all off, I was watching the news and saw a segment with President Clinton, who said during a talk with Speaker Gingrich that Republicans want to reduce the growth of spending on Medicare. Surely, when Brokaw, Jennings and Clinton all get it right, we have truly witnessed a miracle!
<p>	Of course, it shouldn't take a miracle. The numbers speak for themselves: Under the "heartless" Medicare reform plan we have proposed, yearly spending on the average Medicare recipient will increase from the current level of $4,800 to $6,400 in seven years. It really drove us crazy when our opponents called that a "cut." The reason they did was because the $6,400  is less than they wanted to spend.
<p>	If we do nothing to slow the growth of  Medicare spending, we will have to impose a huge tax hike on working families or increase premiums dramatically for seniors. There is no escape. To stick with the program as currently structured,  you would have to raise the Medicare payroll tax more than $1,700 over seven years for somebody making $40,000 a year . That is a 100 percent increase. Or you have to raise the Medicare premiums paid by seniors by an astounding 300 percent.
<p>	Instead, we should restructure the program by allowing elderly citizens greater choices in medical coverage, which will force health-care providers to compete for their services. Such a system would be similar to the Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) which covers 9 million federal workers, retirees and their families.
<p>	Under FEHBP, competition between insurance companies, health maintenance organizations (HMOs), retirement groups, professional organizations, and labor unions has consistently held premium costs below levels in the health-care market at large. Plus, unlike Medicare's "one-size-fits-all" approach,  FEHBP enrollees can choose from a wide variety of health-care plans, including many that Medicare doesn't offer. That way, enrollees are able to tailor their coverage to their own medical and financial situations.
<p>	Of course, pushing our plan through won't be easy. Medicare is a paperwork monster backed by fierce special interests. But I believe we can ready Medicare for the 21st Century. 	<p>Maybe we'll need another miracle to get there. But who would have predicted six months ago that we would see the amazing things that already have happened in our effort to fix Medicare?<p>

<title>Meese - "Conference of the States" -- Heritage </title>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h3>WHY WE NEED A "CONFERENCE OF THE STATES"</h3>
By <a href="http://www.townhall.com/heritage/staff/meese.htm">Edwin Meese</a>
</center>
<p>
When Congress failed to pass a constitutional amendment to balance the federal 
budget -- something an overwhelming majority of Americans say they want -- it showed 
the power of Washington to derail ideas it doesnt like.    
<p>
Thats why 50 state governors are calling for a "Conference of the States": To 
hold Washington accountable to the people. But they are meeting stiff opposition from 
groups on both sides of the political spectrum. These groups have succeeded in 
convincing 14 state legislatures to reject or defer plans to attend the first such conference, 
forcing planners to postpone it until next year. 
<p>
Those on the left fear the Conference of the States because it might influence 
Congress to restrict federal power. They are correct; it could, and probably should. 
<p>
Others, mostly on the right, are concerned that the Conference of the States could 
become "a constitutional convention in disguise." These people -- most of whom favor 
balanced budgets and fiscal restraint -- fear that big-government liberals could take 
political control of such a gathering, call a constitutional convention, and alter Americas 
founding document along lines that would further entrench Washingtons power. Its 
important to set the record straight on what a Conference of the States is all about.
<p>
Its true: As Attorney General under President Reagan I learned firsthand that the 
federal bureaucracy is hostile to ideas like government accountability, civic participation, 
and federalism -- conservative values most Americans hold dear. Washington isnt going 
to reform itself. But that is precisely why a Conference of the States is a good idea. The 
only way America is going to re-assert control over a federal government that has 
overstepped its proper authority is if the states begin to assert their rights.
<p>
The balanced budget amendment is a case in point. Creating dependency by 
spending more money than it has -- and then leaving taxpayers with the bill plus interest -
- is one way Washington has been able to extend its tentacles of power. Voters are on to 
this game, and want the budget balanced. But Congress is under tremendous pressure --
from special interests that feed at the Washington trough -- to reject anything that would 
restrict the federal governments expansion. 
<p>
Which side usually wins out? Congress has consistently opposed balanced budget 
amendments in 1980, 1982, 1986, 1990, 1992, 1994, and on March 2 in the Senate. 
<p>
This is why reform must be driven by the states. Sponsored by strictly bipartisan 
bodies such as the Council of State Governments, the National Governors Association 
and the National Conference of State Legislatures, the Conference of the States will be 
convened if 26 state legislatures vote to send delegations. It will bring together the 
nations 30 Republican and 20 Democratic governors, and all the nations state 
legislatures. The delegations then will try to figure out the best ways to go about re-
establishing a proper balance between state and federal power. 
<p>
The conference then will send its recommendations in the form of a "States Petition" back to the states. If a majority of legislatures approve the petition, it will then 
be sent to Congress, as non-binding advice on what federal lawmakers should do. The 
political consequences of ignoring such a petition would assure that it receives a fair 
hearing in the nations capitol. 
<p>
Renowned conservative jurists such as Judge Robert Bork assure us that it is 
impossible for the conference to become a constitutional convention. Article V of the 
U.S. Constitution says Congress must call any such convention, after it receives "the 
Application of the legislatures of two-thirds of the several states." In the Conference of 
the States, Congress will play no role at all.     
<p>
Indeed, the principal architects of the Conference, Republican Govs. Michael 
Leavitt of Utah and Tommy Thompson of Wisconsin, and Democratic Govs. Ben Nelson 
of Nebraska and Howard Dean of Vermont, came up with the idea as a way to bring the 
states together without having to call a constitutional convention. By opposing this idea,  
conservatives may actually be helping ultra-liberal groups that dont want the conference 
because they want to keep Washington in control of  public policy.
<p>
Americas founders believed the fastest road to tyranny for the new United States 
would be if the prerogatives of state and local governments were usurped by a distant and 
overpowering national government. America has teetered on that precarious slope for 
decades. States now realize this, and are trying to restore balance. 
<p>
A Conference of the States could be an important step in that process. It deserves 
support from everyone.

<center><h2>Front Page story, from the February 1996 MediaWatch</h2></center>
<h3>CBS Reporter Bernard Goldberg Charges Colleague, <br>Media with Liberal Bias
Reality Check for Eric Engberg</h3></center>
<p>
This month MediaWatch planned to include an article about CBS reporter Eric Engberg's February 8 CBS Evening News "Reality Check" attack on Steve Forbes' flat tax. But one of Engberg's colleagues beat us to it. In an unprecedented February 13 Wall Street Journal op-ed, CBS reporter Bernard Goldberg said that "Mr. Engberg's report set new standards for bias." Reaction was swift: CBS News President Andrew Heyward tagged the charge "absurd." 
<p>
Goldberg began by observing that one reason fewer people are watching network news "is that our viewers simply don't trust us. And for good reason. The old argument that the networks and other `media elites' have a liberal bias is so blatantly true that it's hardly worth discussing anymore. No, we don't sit around in dark corners and plan strategies on how we're going to slant the news. We don't have to. It comes naturally to most reporters."
<p>
Reciting the story, he noted that Engberg showed Forbes saying the "economy can grow twice as fast if we remove `obstacles,' starting with the tax code. Mr. Forbes may be right or wrong about this, so Mr. Engberg lets us know which it is. `Time Out!' he shouts in his signature style. `Economists say nothing like that has ever actually happened.'"  
<p>
Next, Engberg showed Forbes asserting "A flat tax would enable the economy to grow. That would mean more revenue for Washington." To that "Engberg tells the audience: `That was called supply- side economics under President Reagan. Less taxes equal more revenue. It didn't work out that way.'" Engberg then allowed an economist from the Brookings Institution, which he failed to label as liberal, to predict the same thing would happen again. 
<p>
Goldberg wondered: "But haven't other experts argued that we wound end up with `hideous deficits' not because of the tax cut but because of increased spending?"
<p>
Engberg offered this snide hit: "OK, how about Forbes' number one wackiest flat tax promise?" In a clip, Forbes explained how "parents would have more time to spend with their children, and with each other." Goldberg queried, "can you imagine, in your wildest dreams, a network news reporter calling Hillary Clinton's health care plan `wacky?'" Engberg concluded: "The fact is, the flat tax is one giant untested theory. One economist suggested that before we risk putting it in, we ought to try it out someplace, like maybe Albania." 
<p>
"Reality Check," Goldberg explained, "suggests the viewers are going to get the facts. And then they can make up their mind. As Mr. Engberg might put it: `Time Out!' You'd have a better chance of getting the facts someplace else -- like Albania."

<i>It was a great comfort to feel, all during the
last days when affairs looked doubtful, that no matter how things
came out the really important thing was the lovely life I have
with mother and with you children and that compared to this home
life everything else was of small importance from the stand point
of happiness.

Dear Friend:

<p>

Christmas comes to Washington, D.C., much the
same way it comes to your hometown.  Street lights come on earlier,
stores stay open later, there are smiles on more faces, and bell-ringing
members of the Salvation Army brave the cold and take up their
posts.  Around the city seasonal decorations are hung from every
pillar and post, multi-colored bulbs burn in windows and on trees.
Fervent prayers for safe travel go forth, as we remember Christmases
past and eagerly anticipate the arrival of family members, including
sons and daughters from college or military assignments around
the globe.

<p>

Yes, Christmas comes to Washington as it does
to every other city, but it comes here with a rather peculiar
force.  Partly it's because of the history of our nation's capital,
but even more significantly, I think, it's because of the political
nature of this city.  Throughout most of the year, an air of aggressive
secularity reigns in Washington.  Faith is not absent here, but
it too often takes a backseat to the public business being conducted.
Not so at Christmas-time, however.  As an anonymous writer once
noted about Christmas in Washington, &quot;Officially, the government
of the United States does not celebrate religious holidays.  Unofficially,
of course, it does.&quot;

<p>

That &quot;unofficial&quot; celebration of the
birth of Christ has irresistible power.  The white columns of
government buildings are festooned with wreaths and ribbons.
Christmas trees are lit at both ends of Pennsylvania Avenue.
On the open Ellipse just south of the White House the National
Christmas Tree stands proudly, established by President Calvin
Coolidge and lit every year since 1923.  Each year, thousands
of visitors come to visit the tree and to see the life-sized Nativity
scene that even the Scrooges at the ACLU have been unable to dislodge.

<p>

On one occasion our National Christmas Tree
was nearly darkened -- not by church-and-state lawyers, but by
the nightmare of a nation at war.  On December 7, 1941, Japanese
forces attacked Pearl Harbor.  America entered the war and Nazi
Germany and Fascist Italy declared war upon us.  In those first
days of the conflict blackouts were declared along the East Coast
as American leaders feared the worst.

<p>

In Washington, too, a blackout was ordered.
Our military and the Secret Service compiled a list of actions
they wanted taken to protect the Executive Mansion and the Congress,
including even the repainting of the White House in standard Army
Air Corps camouflage.  President Franklin Roosevelt resisted many
of their recommendations, rightly sensing that they would seriously
depress the indomitable American spirit.  But one security demand
made him bristle the most:  <I>no Christmas Tree on the Ellipse</I>,
the agencies said, <I>it would be too obvious a target</I>.

<p>

But Roosevelt refused to give in, and on Christmas
Eve, 1941, President and Mrs. Roosevelt stood on the south portico
of the White House and threw a switch to light the National Christmas
Tree, as a national radio audience tuned their receivers.  In
the midst of the blackout, the tree provided the only light for
miles around.  Beside the Roosevelts on the portico stood Winston
Churchill, who had traveled secretly to Washington and arrived
only that morning to encourage his American partners.  That night,
the British leader delivered a message that captured the essence
of the symbol Roosevelt was defending in lighting the tree.  Churchill
spoke to (and for) all Americans when he said:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Let the children have their night of laughter . . . Let us
grown-ups share . . . in their unstinted pleasures
before we turn again to the stern tasks and the formidable
years that lie before us, resolved that by our sacrifice
and daring these same children shall not be robbed
of their inheritance or denied their right to live in
a free and decent world.</i>

</blockquote><p>

Today, of course, the clouds of war are not
gathered on every side.  But Churchill's words, and the meaning
of Christmas, retain all of their urgency.  Sacrifice and daring
are still needed in this fight, fought with words of persuasion
and prayers of petition, for the right of our children and our
grandchildren to live in a free and decent world.  If I have any
goal at the Family Research Council, it is to continue to frustrate
the Scrooges and the nay-sayers by keeping the lights burning
brightly on the Christmas trees of family, faith and freedom all
throughout this great land.

<p>

Christmas truly is the feast of childhood.
On this holy day, we mark the event where our God in heaven came
to us as a child, with a message that we must come to Him as children
if we want to see His face.  The words of Teddy Roosevelt that
I quoted at the beginning of this letter offer us another reminder
of the meaning of our work in this life.  Teddy was a remarkable
president, but an excellent book about him called <I>A Bully Father</I>
reminds us of the priorities that ruled his life even in the midst
of political turmoil. Teddy Roosevelt placed his family first,
no matter what the season.

<p>

His ardent devotion to conservation led him
to refuse to place a freshly cut Christmas tree in the White House.
But during his White House years he turned a blind eye when his
sons carried a tree up into the residence and hid it in their
closet.  On Christmas morning, his letters to his children reveal,
he rejoiced in the family custom of gathering in his and Edith's
bedroom as the six children romped and peered into their stockings
and opened their presents.  These events recalled for TR &quot;just
such a Christmas&quot; as he had known in his youth, and it was
&quot;just such a Christmas&quot; he endeavored to reproduce exactly
for his own family.

<p>

This Christmas season, I'm sure your family
has its own traditions to relive, customs you seek to renew time
and time again.  It doesn't really seem to matter what they are:
large or small, children remember and treasure each one.  My prayer
is that you will enjoy each and every moment that you have together.

<p>

For my family, Christmas will be particularly
special this year.  For a short while, life once again will be
exactly as it was ... Carol and me coming down the stairs each
morning to find all of our children under our roof.  Our daughter
Elyse will be home from college after a long semester.  She hasn't
chosen a major yet, but increasingly she feels drawn toward political
science and law.  On campus, she really enjoys her involvement
in the Fellowship of Christian Athletes.  Our high school sophomore,
Sarah, is learning to drive.  In addition to that excitement,
every Tuesday she and a dozen classmates gather at our house at
6:30 in the morning to pray and share their love for God and His
Son Jesus Christ.  Our son, Zachary, just celebrated his 10th
birthday.  He continues to grow in his faith, while he uses his
God-given talents and abilities to play every sport possible.
His soccer season just ended and basketball practice has already
begun.

<p>

Now that I have filled you in on my family,
it occurs to me that we would like to have an update from you, too. 
A few years ago, I asked readers of my monthly letter to send us
a family picture and tell us about their family.  We still treasure
the pictures and letters we received.  With permission, many of
those letters and the incidents they relate have found a place
in one of our publications, like <I>Reunion</I> or <I>Let Freedom
Ring</I>, or in the military exhibit at our new location in 
Washington.

<p>

If you have a moment -- perhaps while you're
sending out your Christmas cards or in the quieter days after
Christmas -- could you send us an updated photograph and tell
us how your family is doing?  If you haven't written before or
are new to my letters, we're all the more anxious to learn something
about you and your family.  Your photos and letters mean a lot
to all of us at FRC.  They remind us, just as Teddy Roosevelt's
letter to Kermit does, why we're here and whom we represent. They
also remind us that our happiness rests on a foundation that no
one can take away.

<p>

Thank you for all you do in partnership with
us to help build and preserve that &quot;free and decent world&quot;
of which Churchill spoke.  Next month, I'll be writing to share
with you the specific policy steps we will be pursuing with the
105th Congress to help achieve that &quot;world&quot; -- steps
to protect the sanctity of human life, to clean up our polluted
culture, to ease the economic pressures on families, and to promote
education reforms that help ensure that every child hears the
kind of historical truths that are recounted in this letter.

<p>

From all of us at FRC to all of yours, both near
and far, we wish you a peaceful and blessed Christmas.  May God
be with you this holiday season and throughout the coming year.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S.  End-of-year gifts represent a major portion
of the funds the Family Research Council receives from our supporters.
As you consider the gifts you intend to make this Christmas,
I sincerely hope you will consider FRC worthy of your continued
support.

<p>
<h3>Networks Scared of Flat Tax<br>
Furious At Forbes</h3>
<p>
The higher Republican presidential candidate Steve Forbes rose in the polls, the more reporters felt compelled to discredit his flat tax proposal, often by trying to stir class envy.
<p>
In the February 8 Investor's Business Daily reporter Thomas McArdle uncovered the agenda. In mid-January ABC News interviewed Alvin Rabushka, a Senior Fellow with the Hoover Institution and an architect of the flat tax idea, for a Peter Jennings piece. 
Rabushka told McArdle that "the cameras rolled for an hour, and throughout the hour, over and over again, he kept trying to get me to agree it would be a tax on the middle class, if not in the long run, then at least in the interim period. And over and over I wouldn't say it." Rabushka concluded that Jennings just wanted to "get me to say the 18-second soundbite he wanted to use to discredit Steve Forbes."
<p>
Indeed, Rabushka did not appear in Jennings' January 15 World News Tonight story in which he tagged the flat tax as "a very radical notion." Jennings wondered "Will plumbers be hurt more than plutocrats? President Clinton believes that middle class homeowners will see the value of their homes go down if there is no mortgage deduction. And charities worry about how generous folks will be if their contribution is no longer deductible. Certainly the rich would do better than the middle class."
<p>
Two days later NBC's Mike Jensen looked at three families, concluding as fact: "For poor and middle class families, critics say the 17 percent flat tax is a cruel hoax, that to avoid big deficits, it would have to be much higher than 17 percent. So not only would it fail to help the poor, it would increase taxes for most middle class Americans."
<p>
Nightline devoted its February 1 edition to a 30-minute assault. Robert Krulwich went through four supposed benefits of the flat tax, concluding each was wrong. As for fairness, he decided that "it doesn't seem fair that while" millionaire candidate Morry Taylor "pays zero tax on his $15 million" in stock sales, "his employees -- because they're not getting stock, they're on a salary -- they pay a 17 percent tax on their money; but that's what happens when you eliminate capital gains."
<p>
As for whether it's simpler, Krulwich decided it's not because not everyone will really be able to do their taxes on a postcard. Moving on to the third claim of lower taxes for everyone, he countered: "Sounds wonderful, but then Forbes' tax helps some more than others, especially wealthy families. Still, somebody must lose and the government could be the big loser. Forbes' tax could cut government revenues by $40 billion a year or $180 billion, depending upon who you ask, which means deeper cuts in programs" or bigger deficits.
<p>
On the last claim, that it "will be good for the economy," he explained how "Forbes is an old-fashioned, kick-up-your-heels optimist. He believes if you don't tax savings, people will save a lot more. If you don't tax investment income, people will invest a lot more, and in the end, the economy will grow a lot more." He countered that "history does not bless Steve Forbes' optimism." For the rest of the show Ted Koppel interviewed two opponents: Newsweek columnist Robert Samuelson and the magazine's Wall Street editor Allan Sloan, who sneered, "when I first heard it, I almost fell on the floor laughing wondering how anyone could take it seriously."

<CENTER><B><FONT SIZE=6 FACE="Century Gothic">The Decline of the
Family Hour<BR>
</FONT></B></CENTER>
<P>
Not so long ago the first hour of each night's prime time television
schedule -- the so-called Family Hour -- was reserved for wholesome
programs. This is now a thing of the past, mostly crowded out
by sexy sitcoms and steamy soaps, the likes of which as a rule
used to air later at night.
<P>
How much has the family hour changed since it was dominated by
such series as <I>Little House on the Prairie</I> and <I>The Cosby
Show</I>? In September and October of 1995, the Media Research
Center examined four weeks of 8-to-9-p.m. programming to determine
how much of it was, in fact, suitable for the entire family. We
found that very little of it was.
<P>
Among the study's findings:
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Monotype Sorts">n</FONT>  Vulgar language,
usually unheard even late in prime time a few years back, is now
constant in the 8 p.m. hour. In 117 hours of programming, 72 curse
words were used. &quot;Ass&quot; (29 uses) &quot;bitch&quot; (13)
and &quot;bastard&quot; (10) were the most popular.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Monotype Sorts">n</FONT>  NBC was by far the
most vulgar of the networks. It had 1.26 obscenities for every
hour of &quot;Family Hour&quot; programming, more than double
the ratio of any other network. NBC's worst offenders were <I>Mad
About You</I>, with seven curse words, and <I>JAG</I>, with six.
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Monotype Sorts">n</FONT>  Sexual material that
formerly was restricted to the 9-to-11 slot has migrated to the
&quot;Family Hour,&quot; where premarital sex is not only common
-- outnumbering portrayals of sex within marriage by a 8-to-1
ratio -- but almost always condoned. 
<P>
<FONT SIZE=1 FACE="Monotype Sorts">n</FONT>  Fox had the most
sexual treatments per hour of any network (0.88), though all four
major networks were closely bunched in this category.
<P>
The networks' attempt to appeal to young adults has left children
(and their parents) underserved. The study's first recommendation
is a short-term, partial solution to this problem: one network
should counter the adult trend by offering family-oriented programming
between 8 and 9 throughout the week. 
<P>
In the long term, however, the goal should be for all networks
to voluntarily provide the viewing public with the across-the-board
haven it once counted on, and to broadcast in the first hour of
prime time only shows that parents and children can watch together.

<TITLE>FEULNER - LAW OF OUR LAND -- Heritage </TITLE>
</head>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<hr>
<center>
<h2>Law of Our Land</h2>


By<br><a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Dr. Edwin J. Feulner, Jr.</a></center>
<p><hr><p>
	When the government favors the "rights" of snails, owls and rats over the constitutional rights of property owners, it's time to question Washington's priorities.
<p>	The Supreme Court ruled recently in Babbitt vs. Sweet Home Chapter Communities for a Great Oregon that the feds can keep private landowners from developing their property if disturbing the land might bother the bugs or animals living there. The ruling was a setback for property owners who have been trying to save their land from environmental extremists who see endangered species under every rock. Once a listed species -- anything from a Kangaroo rat to the infamous spotted owl  --  is found, your property rights may be in serious danger.
<p>	The Constitution's Fifth Amendment says no one will "be deprived of life, liberty or property without due process of law; nor shall private property be taken for public use without just compensation."
<p>	Because these rights aren't adequately codified in law, it has been left to the courts to provide protection.
<p>	The courts' rulings have been a mixed bag in recent years.  In 1992, for example, the Supreme Court held, in Lucas v. South Carolina Coastal Council, that denying an owner productive use of his or her land requires appropriate compensation.  This was a step in the right direction.  But litigation is costly.  Not everybody can afford to sue the government.  And victory is anything but guaranteed.
<p>	Consider the Walker family of Oregon.
<p>	Donald Walker Jr. had worked as a logger for 30 years until August 1989 when his timber company was forced to shut its doors. He received a notice from the Forest Conservation Council informing him he could no longer log the land he, his father and grandfather had worked. The spotted owl must have a place to roost  never mind the Walker family.
<p>	"I have never seen a spotted owl on our place, and I have never met anyone from the Forest Conservation Council. So far as I know, it's never even been on our farm. But I do have a typewritten, single-spaced, four-page letter from their lawyer saying that what we have been doing on our tree farm for 60 years is no longer legal ... The pressure on us now is hard to describe," Walker is quoted as saying.
<p>	Congress clearly needs to balance the legitimate rights of property owners against the continued encroachments of regulators.
<p>	According to Nancie Marzulla, president and chief legal counsel for Defenders of Property Rights, the Constitution's "just compensation" clause was meant to avoid making individual property owners bear the costs of "social goods," such as environmental protection, deemed to benefit society as a whole.
<p>	The choice, she stresses, does not have to be an "either-or": a livable environment or rapacious development. Bureaucrats must use common sense when designing environmental rules. And if the government feels it has a compelling need to keep business owners or individuals from using their property, it should compensate them -- just as the Constitution requires.
<p>	The House of Representatives earlier this year passed legislation as part of the Republican "Contract with America" allowing property owners to seek compensation for losses caused by federal restrictions on their land. Hearings have been held on a stronger companion bill in the Senate, known as the Omnibus Property Rights Act of 1995. A vote is expected in the fall.
<p>	These first steps toward recognizing property owners' legitimate rights is welcomed. Americans will know their government is just only when a new land law -- one that protects landowners -- becomes the law of the land.
<p>Dr. Feulner is president of <a href="/heritage/"> The Heritage
Foundation.</a>

<title>Janet Cooke Award, from the January 1996 MediaWatch</title>

<center><h2>Janet Cooke Award, from the January 1996 MediaWatch</h2></center>
<p>
<h3>CNN Describes Speaker as "Too Extreme" and "Scary," A "Clown Prince" with "Fits of Pique"<br>
Newt Gingrich, Political Liability?</h3>
<p>
Time selects its Man of the Year not by picking its favorite person, but the person with the most historical impact in that given year. In 1995, certainly, Newt Gingrich had a powerful impact on America's political debate. But that didn't mean Time had to like him -- and neither did CNN in producing a December 17 CNN Presents to announce the pick. For maligning the Speaker as a politically damaged and morally questionable figure after celebrating Time's choice of Bill Clinton in 1992, CNN earned the Janet Cooke Award.
<p>
CNN split its show between interviews with Gingrich and documentary segments. In the first segment, host Judy Woodruff used loaded language to describe Gingrich's "Path to Power," calling his ambition to be Speaker "An obsession that shaped almost every decision, every alliance, what some saw as every betrayal on his path to power." Woodruff relayed a rumor about Gingrich's first wife, Jackie: "It has become part of the Gingrich legend that he would later go to her hospital room where she was being treated for cancer to discuss a divorce." 
<p>
Woodruff described how Gingrich first came to the capital's attention: "In late-night tirades on C-SPAN, he needled then-House Speaker Tip O'Neill, painting ruling Democrats as corrupt thugs." Woodruff called him "a clown prince of an out-of-favor group." She concluded: "His self-ordained mission to save Western civilization is becoming overshadowed by a barrage of accusations that the most powerful Speaker in history illegally used political money." While CNN followed with Rep. David Bonior charging Gingrich's ethics are "in the toilet," Woodruff did not explain any of the charges, most of which were dismissed by the House ethics committee days later.
<p>
Another segment, titled "Homefront," explored Gingrich's hold on his constituency in Georgia: "Cobb County -- the soul of Newt country, Republican, white, well-educated, and affluent. The man who would wield the federal budget ax represents a county that exploded into suburban sprawl because of billions of federal dollars. Unemployment is low here, at 3.4 percent. It's well below the national average. And only a scant five percent of Cobb's population is on public assistance. The social fallout of the Contract with America if it passes will have little consequence here, but those hit will be hit hard."
<p>
CNN talked mostly to social service providers, liberal activists, and projected victims: "For the Hogan family, some cutbacks are the wrong thing to do. Daughter Kimberly, disabled from birth, has spent most of her life in a hospital. Thanks to Medicaid, this year has been different." Protesters held up signs reading "Newt: Your Plan Will Kill Us."
<p>

These documentary segments were heavily salted with Gingrich opponents: "The Path to Power" featured five negative talking heads (including three from Rep. Pat Schroeder and one of Bonior) to only three positive. "Homefront" featured twelve anti-Gingrich soundbites to four defenders. A segment called "Report Card" focusing on his future balanced the talking heads six to six, which included Bonior predicting that Gingrich's ethics problems were "so severe" he wouldn't be in office much longer.
<p>
If that hostility weren't enough, there were Woodruff's interview questions to the Speaker: "There's something we saw that was kind of interesting, the latest CNN-Time poll, they asked people what they thought about you and a lot of people said, most people said, very intelligent. A number of them said he has a vision for the future, but they also said -- a large number of those same people said, and I thought this was interesting, they agreed you were too extreme, 66 percent -- and out of touch, 52 percent, and even scary 49 percent. Where does that come from?"
<p>
When Gingrich suggested that things like being portrayed as Scrooge on the cover of Time didn't help, Woodruff replied: "But there's also been, in addition to that, what many people look at as the effect of the Republican budget cuts, and most of the people -- what they see is that most people, according to the studies we've seen, who would lose under the combined budget cuts and tax changes are the very poorest Americans, and people have a hard time understanding that."
<p>
Gingrich challenged that spin, but Woodruff reacted: "The study I'm referring to came out I think in the last week or so, by the Urban Institute, highly respected group, supposed to be nonpartisan -- and they set aside Medicaid and Medicare, they just looked at the budget cuts separate from Medicare and Medicaid and tax changes, and their conclusion was that the families that would lose under the Republican plan, two-thirds are in the poorest fifth of the population." The Urban Institute has often disseminated research that concludes with the need for more federal social spending.
<p>
Woodruff concluded the program with a decidedly negative spin: "He couldn't have envisioned the blizzard of ethics charges or the stir his fits of pique would cause. Now that they've gotten to know him, more than half of all Americans say they don't like him. More than half say they don't trust him. The irony is that Time's Man of the Year may wind up the biggest liability to the revolution he launched."
<p>
This program was a 180-degree change from the show CNN aired on December 26, 1992, when Bill Clinton was named Time's Man of the Year. The 30-minute show featured at least 18 positive talking heads, including Clintonites Robert Reich, Ron Brown, Dee Dee Myers, and Betsey Wright, Democratic Reps. Tom Foley and Lee Hamilton, Democratic consultant Bob Squier, and black academic Henry Louis Gates. Only one soundbite from conservative Arkansas editorialist Paul Greenberg offered any balance. 
<p>
The narration by CNN's Lou Waters and Natalie Allen said nothing about Clinton's troubled private life, nothing about ethics, nothing about overweening ambition. Allen began the show with a quotation: "He was not born a king, but a child of the common people who made himself a great persuader, therefore, a leader by dint of firm resolve, patient effort, and dogged perseverance." Chimed in Waters: "The words were written by Horace Greeley a century ago to describe Abraham Lincoln. They apply as well to this persevering young man from Arkansas, now leader of the Free World." Allen continued: "The election of 1992 was a leap of faith in a sour and unpredictable year. American voters were angry and disgusted and often afraid of the future. They took an enormous risk and made a fascinating choice." 
<p>
CNN prepared a response to MediaWatch questions, but it did not arrive by press time. It will appear next month. CNN may have contributed to the effect its polls have noticed: viewers were instructed that the Speaker was politically extreme, even scary, while Clinton was Honest Abe.

<title>Time To Say Goodbye To Dollar Bill -- Heritage Commentary</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center>
<h3><i> Time To Say Goodbye To Dollar Bill</i></h3>

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
November 30, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>

	Let's talk money. No, this is not a solicitation. Nor is it another one of those stories about how Washington wastes your tax dollars. Rather it's about all those $1 bills in your wallet, and why we should replace them with a new dollar coin.  
<p>
	You're probably wondering what a conservative is doing resurrecting one of the many failures of the malaise-laden presidency of Jimmy Carter. "Didn't we try this dollar coin experiment in the late 1970s?" Well, yes. But like much of what the government did in the 1970s, it didn't do it right. So maybe it's time to try again.  
<p>
	Some 273 million Susan B. Anthony dollar coins (affectionately called "Carter's quarters") are still in circulation, according to the U.S. Mint and Federal Reserve. Mostly the coins are used by mass-transit systems in major U.S. cities, including Chicago, Dallas, Baltimore, and St. Louis. It is also popular with vending machine companies. 
<p>
	It wasn't the concept of a dollar coin that caused the public to reject the Anthony dollar. What ruined it for Susan was her flawed design, her rather quick introduction into the public's psyche, and the politicians' unwillingness to stand by her. The design had a number of flaws.
<p>
	Because of its similar silver color, size and ridged edge, the Anthony dollar was too easily confused with the quarter. Another drawback: The Susan B. Anthony coin coexisted with the paper dollar, causing problems for many retailers who didn't want to deal with both dollar bills and dollar coins. 
<p>
	If we were to do it all over again, the politicians would need to support that decision as fully as the Canadian government did in 1987 when it switched from a paper dollar to a dollar coin.  
<p>
Th are are good reasons for making the switch. For one, it would save taxpayers like you and me a ton of money. 
<p>	For example, mass-transit systems across the country would save an estimated $124 million annually by processing dollar coins instead of dollar bills.  According to a young colleague of mine who lives in Baltimore, every time he rides a city bus or the Baltimore "metro" system, he puts a dollar bill into a vending machine, which then gives him a Susan B. Anthony dollar to use as a token. My friend points out, correctly, that having a dollar coin in the first place would save time and money. 
<p>	Studies show that the cost to Baltimore's taxpayers of going to the bank, stocking the Anthony dollars and processing the dollar bills exceeds $300,000 a year. This money could be saved if the public had dollar coins in the first place.
<p>	In Chicago, the money saved would be even greater. The Chicago Transit Authority (CTA) handles about 410,000 dollar bills a day. The cost of sorting these bills is about $22 per thousand. But coins can be counted for just $2. Switching to a dollar coin could save the CTA $2.4 million per year in bill-processing costs.
<p>	 New York City has solved the problem of high paper-dollar processing costs: The bus system simply does not accept dollar bills. That's right. The greenback is no good on a bus in the Big Apple.   
<p>	The bottom line is this: Coins are more convenient, and because they last much longer than dollar bills, they are less costly to produce over the long run.
<p>	The time has come for Washington to lay the paper dollar to rest in favor of a dollar coin.

<title>Gary Bauer's October, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

October 16, 1996

<p>

Dear Friend,

<p>

<i>Last month, just before the Congress adjourned, the Senate held its 
historic debate on partial-birth abortion.  At the end of an incredible 
day on Capitol Hill, I sat down at 1:00 o'clock in the morning to write 
you this "eyewitness account"</i>:

<p>

It's nearly 1:00 o'clock in the morning as I write this month's letter to 
you. I have just finished an unbelievable 20-hour day in which my emotions 
have run the gamut from exhilaration to deep despair.  The focus of 
today's events was the vote in the United States Senate to overturn 
President Clinton's veto of the partial-birth abortion bill. We lost that 
vote, but in the process we may have taken a giant step toward stopping the 
ongoing tragedy of abortion on demand.  Let me share with you a few excerpts 
from the roller coaster ride I was on today as we spoke the truth about the 
sanctity of human life to the powerful elites here in Washington, D.C.

<p>

My day began on the <i>CBS Morning News</i>, where I debated Kate Michelman 
of the National Abortion and Reproductive Rights Action League.  As is 
usually the case, the morning talk shows only give us four or five minutes 
to present our views on an issue -- this morning was no exception.  I knew 
I had to have my arguments down pat, for there is little time to hesitate 
or reflect when you're sitting in a TV studio under a bank of hot 
lights.  I also knew a sharp debater like Michelman would be sure to 
quickly fill any time I didn't use.

<p>

I often feel frustrated after such a debate because I don't usually get 
enough time to fully express my views or because I don't think of the 
best way to articulate some arguments until the debate is over.  But 
this morning was a "home run."  The CBS anchorwoman was fair, and she 
gave me equal time.  I was able to establish for the millions of people 
watching that partial-birth abortions <i>do</i> occur thousands of times a 
year -- most of them for purely elective reasons rather than because of 
health problems of the mother or her baby.  Kate Michelman presented few 
relevant arguments and seemed unusually low-key.  It had to be tough for 
her to defend the position that it could ever be okay to abort a baby in the 
eighth or ninth month of pregnancy by stabbing it in the back of the head.

<p>

But there was no time to relish the debate victory. I was immediately 
rushed from the CBS studio to attend an extraordinary prayer breakfast 
on Capitol Hill.  Pro-life senators led by Rick Santorum of Pennsylvania 
hosted the gathering to pray that senators' hearts would be touched 
before they voted.  The solemn gathering in that small room included 
some of the real "stars" of the pro-family/pro-life movement -- proven 
crusaders like Chuck Colson and my good friend and colleague Jim Dobson 
of Focus on the Family. We took turns asking God for His wisdom and 
strength for the tough hours of lobbying ahead.  More importantly, we 
prayed that God would have mercy on our country as it slips further 
and further into the culture of death.

<p>

A few minutes after breakfast, the ecumenical group gathered again -- 
this time in the office of Senate Majority Leader Trent Lott.  There 
we participated in a press conference on the upcoming vote.  Fourteen 
pro-life leaders made individual statements before a bank of TV cameras 
and a forest of microphones.  The room was jammed from one wall to the 
other, and the hot TV lights glared down on us all.  We were expecting 
the usual hostility of the liberal Washington media.  But again, 
strangely, there were no real arguments -- no hardball questions. Only 
one reporter even asked a question, and I was given the opportunity to 
answer.  He asked whether I was satisfied with the attention Bob Dole 
had paid to the issue. My response was clear: I told the reporter 
that Bob Dole was not responsible for partial-birth abortions.  I said 
we were here because Bill Clinton had vetoed a bill passed overwhelmingly 
by the Congress to stop these horrible procedures.  I then urged Senator 
Dole in the remaining days of the campaign to emphasize the issue and to 
draw the stark comparison between himself and his opponent so the 
American people could clearly understand their choice.

<p>

After the press conference, we all fanned out on Capitol Hill to buttonhole 
lawmakers.  We met Senator Arlen Specter of Pennsylvania as he got off the 
Capitol subway, and, even though he is usually pro-abortion, we ultimately 
won his vote. A few minutes later, we encountered Senator Joe Biden of 
Delaware, and he ended up voting with us too.  Unfortunately, other senators 
were harder to convince.  Senator Nancy Kassebaum of Kansas refused to hear 
us out when we appealed to her in the Senate dining room.  She said she 
didn't even think the Senate should be discussing the issue.  My good 
friend Kay James, who is a black American, told Mrs. Kassebaum that she was 
glad that her attitude didn't prevail in our country when slavery was 
being debated over 100 years ago!

<p>

As we walked the halls of the Capitol, the abortion debate was raging on 
the floor of the Senate.  Good friends, senators like Dan Coats of Indiana, 
John Ashcroft of Missouri and Don Nickles of Oklahoma, led the floor debate 
while a hushed gallery of visitors looked on.  The pro-abortion side was 
led by Barbara Boxer of California.

<p>

We sat in the Senate gallery together to watch the proceedings -- myself, 
Dr. Dobson, Kay, Beverly LaHaye of Concerned Women for America, Anthony 
Cardinal Bevilacqua of Philadelphia, Rabbi Daniel Lapin and a dozen other 
allies.  As I looked around, I couldn't help but wonder what was going on 
in the minds of tourists from all over America who had brought their 
children there with them.  They seemed subdued, almost shocked, as they 
heard senators describe this terrible procedure.  At one emotional moment, 
one pro-life senator pointed to a picture of a baby and shouted in 
exasperation, "This is not an appendix; this is not a lump of tissue; this 
is a baby!"  Here's what happened next as reported by <i>The Washington 
Post</i>:

<p><blockquote>

<i>And then, impossibly, in an already hushed gallery, in one of 
those moments when the floor of the Senate looks like a stage set, with its 
rich wooden desks somehow too small for the matters at hand, the cry of a 
baby pierced the room, echoing across the chamber from an outside hallway.

<p>

No one mentioned the cry, but for a few seconds no one spoke at all.</i>

</blockquote><p>

No one knows whose baby it was that brought the Senate to silence that day, 
but I can't help but believe that God chose that moment for this child to 
cry and, by so doing, to remind the Senate that "choice" in this case means 
the death of <b>real</b> human beings.

<p>

Soon the voting began.  As I am sure you know by now, our efforts helped 
win a clear majority, but we still fell short of the 66 votes needed to 
overturn Clinton's veto.  It was a tragic day, but even in the midst of 
our disappointment and heartbreak, there were some encouraging developments. 
I am convinced that something is stirring among God's people.  The 
cooperation of a large number of religious leaders from different 
denominations and from all parts of the country was unprecedented.  I'm 
convinced, too, that a new level of coalition building has been achieved 
and that the groundwork has been laid for better communication and 
cooperation in the future.

<p>

As the day wore on, my message was the same in every press interview. I 
told reporter after reporter that America is better than the vote that just 
took place.  I also told them that our nation was founded as a "shining 
city on a hill", that we are a unique experiment in liberty under God 
with rights and responsibilities that come only from Him. And this vote 
to allow the outright killing of nearly-born children through the promotion 
of abortion-on-demand sticks in our throats.  It will never go down easy 
with Americans because it violates every tenet of our founding.  Our 
conscience will not rest easy as long as we continue to allow the sacrifice 
of these children.

<p>

More than ever, I believe our beloved nation is at a crossroads, with the 
question Lincoln posed at Gettysburg still before us. As he stood on 
hallowed ground, he said we were conceived in liberty and asked whether 
"this nation or any nation so conceived and so dedicated can long endure?"

<p>

This is the great question facing our nation as we go into the next century. 
How we resolve the issues of life, family and marriage will determine whether 
America during the next century can still be that "shining city on a hill".

<p>

Even though the hour is late for our country, we must never cease our efforts 
to protect our spiritual heritage.  As God told Solomon, "if my people, who 
are called by my name, will humble themselves and pray and seek my face and 
turn from their wicked ways, then will I hear from heaven and will forgive 
their sin and will heal their land." (II Chronicles 7:14 NIV) We must 
redouble our prayers seeking God's mercy as the elites of our nation look 
farther away from Him. I want you to know that my staff and I are committed 
to do everything in our power to defend the values that have made our 
country great.

<p>

The Family Research Council is here to represent and serve you.  But I have 
to be honest. In recent weeks we haven't been hearing from enough of you. 
We need your encouragement, and your prayers, and we need to know if you 
stand with us in the battle for family, faith and freedom.  We also pray 
that, if you are able, you will choose to help FRC financially, <b>after</b> 
you have met the needs of your family and your church.

<p>

In closing, it's my prayer that God will richly bless you and your family. 
I look forward to hearing from you soon.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. FRC is preparing a special analysis of the upcoming elections 
focusing on how the results will impact you and your family.  To receive

you and may God bless America.

<H1>Helping to Build a Sustainable Next West</H1>
<P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>The Gallatin Institute links writers of the West with environmental economists.  Last weekend poets, novelists, historians and essayists spent three days exploring ideas and ideals with policy analysts at the Gallatin Gateway Inn, a beautifully restored railroad hotel between Bozeman and West Yellowstone, Montana.    </P>

<P>Such communication is something new because the participants come from disparate tribes.  Their brains seem programed to see and process different kinds of information.  Artists and analysts seldom mingle easily.  A shared commitment to help build a sustainable next West, based upon local communities and respect for the lessons of our history and bio-geography, brought them together.  </P>

<P>Why intermingle artists and economists?  Mixing cultures is difficult and dangerous.  It's a risky venture but one worth undertaking.  Writers sensitize us to values and to new ways of seeing them.  Analysts help us understand how we might better cooperate to realize those values.</P>

<P>I've known sensitive people who define economists as those who &quot;know the price of everything but the value of nothing&quot;.  At best, they are only half right; as Thomas Sowell observed, the variables which economists can measure are not those that matter most.  </P>

<P>This is inherent to the nature of the world.  No matter how smart, how well funded, or how powerful their computer, analysts will never put a good metric on friendship, beauty, trust or peace.  Good economists know the limitations of their discipline.  </P>

<P>Yet microeconomics, the study of choice in public and private arenas, has important explanatory power.  This discipline has great potential for improving environmental policy.  Any proposal for reform that violates economic principles or the laws of nature is doomed.</P>

<P>When we apply these economic principles to problems, we can make predictions.  Specifically, if some behavior's cost, in terms of reputation, comfort or money, increases, and the benefits of that behavior remain constant, then we'll see less of that behavior.  For example, if litterers were subjected to the lash and branded on their foreheads with a L, then we'd see less littering.   Conversely, if landowners were rewarded for attracting and harboring endangered species, rather than penalized as they are now, more species would be safe.  The principles are quite simple but have profound implications.</P>

<P>It is likely that the evolutionary process has hard-wired these responses into our nature; they are strong survival characteristics.  People who act in accordance with these principles are more likely to do well and enjoy a good life than those who do not.  I have long argued that economics so understood is merely a division of the more general field of evolutionary biology.  </P>

<P>Understanding of economic principles helps us separate hopes for the future from expectations about that future.  As smart people experience life, they are ever better at making these distinctions.  </P>

<P>This ability to distinguish hopes from expectations is an important measure of practical intelligence.  Those who lack it are most charitably described as naive.  But some old-line paleo-enviros still reject economic analysis.  As one said, &quot;the word economics makes me hiss like The Hobbit's Gollum: I hates it, I hates it, I hates it forever.&quot;</P>

<P>Is it ethically or intellectually responsible to remain willfully ignorant?  Thanks to the work of researchers such as Lynn Scarlett, Randal O'Toole and Tom Power, sincere environmentalists increasingly see the value of political economy and policy analysis. </P>

<P>This helps explain why environmentalists have become skeptical about utopian schemes.  As smart people experience life's successes and failures, they develop an intuitive sense of these economic principles.  They recognize that there are no perfect solutions, only many competing tradeoffs.   </P>

<P>Learning by trial and error is grossly inefficient.  Explanation of principles by sensitive and empathetic teachers works much better.  However, economists are selected for analytical skills and abstract logic, not empathy and sensitivity.  Economists are among the few who find Calculus a compelling form of communication.  Few economists communicate easily with artists.</P>

<P>Economists' powerful analytic leverage can help us deal with problems, but only if they connect and communicate with those who care deeply about environmental quality.  Most people need to know how much you care before they care how much you know.  If economists are perceived as calculating not compassionate, their contributions will be resisted.  </P>

<P>Rejection of analysis and economic reasoning retards environmental reform.  The success of dialogues, such as the one hosted by the Gallatin Institute, gives us prudent optimism as we contemplate the next West. </P>

<h3>Brinkley Agrees Media are Liberal<br>
Paula Zahn is "Overloaded"</h3>
<p>
In a December 7 appearance on CNBC's Cal Thomas, David Brinkley reacted with dismay when read a quote from the MRC's Best Notable Quotables of 1995: The Eighth Annual Awards for the Year's Worst Reporting.
<p>
Thomas, one of the judges who voted on which quotes deserved inclusion in the year-end issue, asked: "Could you get away, for example, with asking a question like this, that was recently asked by a major network anchor of Pat Buchanan...`You've got political enemies out there calling you an isolationist, a bigot, you're anti-gay, and some even go so far as saying your social stands are reminiscent of Nazi Germany.' Now that's the kind of ideologically loaded stuff that turns a lot of people off, isn't it?"
<p>
Brinkley agreed: "That is so loaded, it's overloaded and it destroys itself in its own excess. Nobody would ever take that question seriously, I wouldn't even bother to answer it." Though Brinkley didn't know it, the quote, first runner-up for the "Damn Those Conservatives Award," came from Paula Zahn's July 5 CBS This Morning interview.
<p>
Earlier in the show the former NBC anchor and current This Week host acknowledged liberal bias."Well, it's there and it doesn't show itself in everything that is printed or broadcast but it is there, and I think we're all used to it, we discount it. Some of the press also is more conservative and it's just the way the action is in this country and I don't know any way to change it. You just have to live with it."

<h3>Today Gushes Over Hillary<br>
"Really Terrific" Book</h3>
<p>
As questions swirled around Hillary Clinton's veracity on Whitewater and the travel office, NBC News gave her a gift: a January 16 Today interview by Maria Shriver, who campaigns for and donates to her uncle Ted Kennedy's Senate campaigns. Shriver served more as political flack than journalistic inquisitor. Shriver opened the show by calling Clinton's new book, It Takes a Village, "really terrific."
<p>
Her first question: "What's this last week and a half been like for you personally?" She followed up about daughter Chelsea: "What has she said to you about these attacks?...This is beyond the territory....This is your mom that someone's talking about." After wondering if she'd be willing to testify before the Senate and posing one question about the travel office, Shriver showed sympathy for Clinton's plight: "Whitewater, I know you've been answering questions on this subject for four years, thousands of pieces of documents have been handed over, but they still want even more. As you look back on this, do you wish you'd never worked for Madison Guaranty?"
<p>
Shriver did ask: "Regarding these billing records that came about that had been subpoenaed two years ago, people say, `Gosh, how could a woman as smart and politically savvy as Hillary Clinton not know where these records were these past two years? Why didn't she make that her priority to find them, particularly when they were found in her own home, under an assistant's desk?'"
<p>
Shriver returned to softballs: "You also quote a letter in there that Nelson Mandela wrote to one of his daughters while he was in prison, and I'm paraphrasing a bit, but he wrote that there is no personal misfortune that one cannot turn into a personal triumph if one has the iron will and the necessary skills. You clearly have an iron will, you clearly are skilled. How are you going to turn this personal misfortune into a personal triumph?"
<p>
Shriver then stumped for liberalism: "You think government should do a lot more than it's doing in terms of making children a priority, doing things for kids. We're clearly living in an age where people are anti-government. How do you get across the message that we all need to see everybody's kids as our own, we need to have more programs, the government needs to be more involved?"

<title>Federal Health System is Medicare Refoerm Model -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>

<h3><i>Federal Health System
Is Medicare Reform Model</i></h3>
By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
October 26, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
	As Congress debates competing proposals for saving the Medicare system, reformers on Capitol Hill need look no further than their own Federal Employees Health Benefits Program (FEHBP) to find a model for getting the job done.
<P>	There are some extremely valuable lessons to be learned from FEHBP, which covers more than 9 million federal workers and retirees, including senators, representatives and congressional staff.
<p>	First, unlike Medicare's "one-size-fits-all" approach, FEHBP gives enrollees the freedom to choose from among nearly 400 private health insurance plans during an annual "open season." The ensuing competition between insurance companies provides an incentive nowhere to be found in the current Medicare setup: An incentive to provide the most and best health care for the lowest cost.
<p>	The numbers tell the story: The average FEHBP premium actually went down 3.4 percent in 1995, and will go up by a mere four-tenths of one percent in 1996. A quarter of the plans in FEHBP will actually cut premiums next year. By contrast, Medicare costs have gone up more than 10 percent annually in recent years.
<p>	Also helping FEHBP keep costs under control is the fact that the program is based on a "defined contribution" by the government, unlike the "defined benefit" nature of Medicare. There's a big difference. In FEHBP, the government pays about 72 percent of the average premium. Everything above that is paid by the enrollee. That provides a real incentive to choose your coverage wisely.
<p>	By contrast, under Medicare -- a "defined benefit" program -- the government pays for a set of benefits and medical procedures selected by Washington bureaucrats -- nothing more, nothing less. The payments are made according to a fee schedule  -- also set by bureaucrats -- that defies comprehension and ignores the ups and downs of the health care market. You are out of luck if you need a benefit Medicare doesn't cover -- like prescription drug coverage -- that is widely available under FEHBP.
<p>	Under the federal employee program, fierce competition for new enrollees forces traditional firms like Blue Cross/Blue Shield, as well as health maintenance organizations (HMOs), professional groups and labor unions, to tailor their coverage to fit the particular financial and medical needs of their customers.
<p>	An important example here is catastrophic coverage, which is not available under Medicare, but could be under an FEHBP-style Medicare system. This crucial benefit would protect senior citizens against the type of costs associated with unexpected catastrophic accidents or illnesses that can easily wipe out a lifetime of savings. Other services not covered by Medicare but widely available to federal retirees under FEHBP include preventive screenings, routine physical exams, annual serum cholesterol tests, home nursing care, smoking cessation programs and home physician visits, to name just a few.
<p>	And here is something else to think about: FEHBP requires only 164 federal employees to administer, and there are less than 100 pages of federal regulations associated with the program. Compare that to the more than 4,000 Health Care Financing Administration (HCFA) employees creating miles and miles of frustrating red tape and bureaucracy for the Medicare system.
<p>	In other words, FEHBP provides far more choices at lower costs and involves far fewer bureaucrats and regulations. With such a model to guide them, there is no reason Congress can't fix Medicare for generations to come.<P>

<title>Gary Bauer's November, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

November 6, 1996

<p>

Dear Friend,

<p>

I know that your first reaction to yesterday's election returns 
is to be disheartened. I found myself recalling the words of Thomas 
Jefferson, who suggested that we should tremble for our country as 
we consider that God is just.

<p>

But, my friends, as people of faith devoted to the family, there must 
be no room in our hearts for demoralization.  It is not just that 
there were many bright spots on Election Day, including the 
strengthening of pro-family forces in Congress.  No, it's the fact 
that we are obliged in conscience to carry on our fight for the family, 
no matter what one day's election returns suggest. The worst thing we 
could do now is to retreat from the public square.  Instead we must 
advance the pro-family banner boldly and without shame.  I have hope 
for the future -- because the truth is on our side, 
the lessons of history are on our side, and, I believe, the will of 
the people is on our side.

<p>

I am not naive.  In the coming year, the principles that unite us -- 
traditional values, the sanctity of human life, smaller government, 
and lower taxes -- will be under political and cultural attack as 
never before. Regarding these threats, I can speak only for me and my 
"house" at the Family Research Council: "We will redouble our efforts to 
speak for your values and to bring the truth to the American people."

<p>

With that in mind, as election day approached, my staff and I put 
together a six-point plan of action.  Today, as the final vote is 
still being tallied we begin to implement this plan, with you at our side.

<p><ul>

<li>Pro-family Americans have been too passive -- not <i>too active</i>! -- 
in their approach to public life.  Too often we've waited for our party system 
to produce for us candidates who will subscribe to some portion of our 
world view, candidates who, by design and default, always seem to fail 
us at the finish line.  The truth is, our movement should be producing 
and promoting leaders of its own.  I want you to know that achieving 
this goal is at the top of my personal priorities for the coming year. 
In my capacity as a private citizen, I will be organizing a political 
action committee, which I believe you'll be hearing a lot about in 
the near future.

<p>

<li>Each month 250,000 American homes receive our monthly publication, 
<i>Washington Watch</i>.  With your help, <b>FRC will double the 
circulation of this publication within the next 12 months</b>. Early 
next year <b>FRC will unveil a new and expanded version of <i>Watch</i></b>. 
We must make it our goal <b>to reach every American home in which 
there still burns a spark of love for this land Lincoln called 
"the last, best hope of Earth."</b>

<p>

<li>FRC will launch a youth leadership program here in Washington, 
D.C.  If the family is to survive (my friends, it <i>will</i> survive), 
if religious values are not to be completely routed from the public 
square (my friends, they <i>will</i> not), <b>we must act now to foster a 
new generation of leaders with a profoundly Christian world view.</b> The 
darker this night of cultural amorality becomes, the more youthful 
flames we must light that will kindle hope for our country.

<p>

<li>Our very self-government is at stake when the acts of duly elected 
legislatures, or of the people themselves, to restrict abortion, protect 
parental rights, and safeguard the institution of marriage are trampled 
by our runaway judges.  Judicial tyranny must end.  I pledge to you 
today <b>a sweeping campaign to check and balance our out-of-control 
courts.</b> We must become again a people who insist that <b>no one govern 
us without our consent.</b>

<p>

<li>The power to tax is the power to destroy.  How many of our 
government's destructive schemes would be possible if it did not 
seize nearly 45 cents of every dollar that hardworking families 
earn? There will be no freedom without tax freedom. <b>Today I am 
launching, in partnership with key economic conservative organizations, 
a massive push for across-the-board tax relief.</b> We will begin with 
tax credits for families with children and end the double taxation 
that occurs when government taxes the estates our families have 
shored up over a lifetime of sweat and sacrifice. <b>Our families 
built this capital; the meddling Washington establishment must be 
stopped from hauling it away.</b>

<p>

<li>Early in the new year, FRC will convene a summit of leaders of 
major pro-family groups and religious leaders who share our profound 
concern for the cultural decay now gripping the Western world. We will 
pool ideas and, where possible, resources to provide an effective 
counter to the forces of cultural disintegration.  Our response will be 
as global as the threat we face.  In the coming months and years, it is 
imperative that pro-family groups work together. <b>I pledge my total 
effort to help achieve this goal.</b>

</ul><p>

One final word. I do not view these steps as an ambitious plan. This 
is the <b>minimum</b> we must do to give this generation, and the next 
generation, of American families a fighting chance.  I cannot promise 
you we will succeed at everything we do, but I can promise you that we 
will try as never before. FRC has been positioned -- I pray by 
God's grace -- in the nation's capital to be here for the family at 
such a time as this.

<p>

In the coming days, please consider this plan and let me know if I have 
your support.  Your prayers and encouragement mean so much, and your 
financial support is FRC's very lifeblood.  I know that you are counting 
on the Family Research Council.  We will do everything we can to be worthy 
of the trust you place in us. God bless you.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<title>Gary Bauer's August, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

August 13, 1996

<p><br><br>

<ul><ul>

<i>He giveth power to the faint; and to them that have no might
he giveth strength. Even the youths shall faint, and be weary; and 
the young men shall utterly fall. But they that wait upon the Lord 
shall renew their strength; they shall mount with wings as eagles; 
they shall run, and not be weary; and they shall walk, and not 
faint.</i>

</ul></ul>

<p><center>

<i>- Isaiah 40:29-31</i>

</center><p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

While watching the Olympic games last month, I couldn't help
but recall these poignant words from the prophet Isaiah.  These
verses play a pivotal role in the classic film <I>Chariots of
Fire,</I> the true story of Scottsman, Eric Liddell, an Olympic
runner.  Liddell recites this passage from Scripture at a church
service held on a day he was supposed to run a race in the Paris
Games. <I>Chariots of Fire</I> tells how Liddell, a dedicated
Christian, refused to run on the Sabbath, standing by his personal
conviction in the face of intense pressure from the future King
of England and others.

<p>

Even though my athletic ability won't get me into the Olympics,
I must tell you that these hectic summer months have all of us
at Family Research Council (FRC) running hard.  Time and again,
we are led back to God's promise that He will renew our strength,
that he will enable us to effectively run the race and that His
strength will never fail.  FRC's staff has truly been pressed
to the limit in recent days, and just like Olympic athletes, we
have experienced the thrill of victory and the agony of defeat.
Let me share with you, some of the many hills and hurdles FRC
has encountered.

<p>

This month, the major events requiring our attention are the
conventions of national political parties.  The Republicans met
first in San Diego, followed by the National Taxpayer's Party,
Ross Perot's Reform Party, and finally the Democrats.  The Libertarian
Party has already nominated its presidential candidate.  As a
non-partisan organization, FRC continues to focus its energies
on providing each of these parties with a detailed agenda for
families. As I reported to you last month, FRC has advocated
the pro-family agenda in a wide variety of public forums and we
will continue to do so regardless of  the response we receive
from party leaders and the media elite.

<p>

As you read this, chances are I'll be returning to Washington
after having taken the pro-family message to the GOP Convention
in San Diego.  We have urged each of the nation's political parties
to make America's families a priority.  We want Democrats, Republicans,
and the smaller &quot;third parties&quot; alike, to see &quot;family&quot;
<b><i>not</i></b> in terms of election cycles, but in terms of daily
responsibilities and everyday needs.  We have urged them all to
adopt platforms that strengthen marriage, recognize the sanctity
of human life, cut taxes for families, and to pay increased attention
to the cultural decay undermining our society.

<p>

In San Diego, I addressed a rally at Sea World designed to urge
the GOP to uphold its commitment to the sanctity of life, to lower
taxes on families and to work for economic opportunitiy and growth.
I made our case to convention delegates and to the national media,
who always crowd these events.  In the weeks before the conventions,
my schedule was crammed with appearances on network and cable
talk shows to discuss the issues at stake during this election
year.  Incredibly, FRC was cited more than 1,500 times in the
print media nationwide in June.  Needless to say,  FRC Press Secretary,
Kristi Hamrick and her quality staff are incredibly busy.

<p>

For my part, there was CNN's &quot;Inside Politics&quot; to discuss
the GOP platform plank on abortion, an appearance on &quot;Crossfire&quot;
with former Gov. Carroll Campbell to discuss the presidential
campaign, another visit to the weekly commentary show, &quot;The
Capital Gang,&quot; an interview with Ollie North on his daily
radio show and numerous other media opportunities.

<p>

Meanwhile, on Capitol Hill, FRC has provided in-depth research
and related resource materials to lawmakers who are concerned
about the attack on traditional marriage. Our recent full page ad in
<I>USA Today</I>, which I described in my June letter, was just 
the opening move in our effort to inform citizens
about the potential impact of an expected court decision in Hawaii.
This decision would recognize same-sex marriages and potentially
impose similar recognition on other states.

<p>

To most Americans, I suspect, the reason that one man/one woman
marriage is so vital to the survival of our society almost goes
without saying.  But in these times, people need regular, convincing
reminders about the fundamentals.  That's why FRC recently hosted
a briefing on Capitol Hill, which gathered together a group of
distinguished scholars, physicians, and public policy experts
to discuss the far reaching implications of  &quot;same sex&quot;
marriage.  The briefing was carried live on C-Span, and was re-aired
several times during the next 24 hours.  As a result, millions
of Americans had the opportunity to join with legislators and
congressional aides to see and hear the powerful testimony that
was presented.

<p>

The arguments against homosexual marriage are convincing and
familiar -- so familiar, in fact, that many of us have forgotten
how to effectively articulate them.  FRC's briefing brought together
people like adoption expert Mary Beth Style, former homosexual
Anthony Falzarano (who now leads Transformation Ex-Gay Ministries
in Washington, D.C.), Amherst Professor of Jurisprudence Hadley
Arkes, psychiatrist and former Yale University Fellow, Jeffrey
Satinover, and FRC's own Bob Knight, each of whom drove home the
essential values that are at stake in this debate. <i>(To help
you understand and articulate the arguments, FRC has condensed
this briefing into an hour-long video -- see the enclosed
reply card for information on how to obtain a copy for your church
or action group.)</i>

<p>

One week after the briefing, I found myself in the thick
of things again as I testified before the Senate Judiciary Committee
in favor of the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).  Disappointingly,
most of the senators who attended are very liberal and they are
also in favor of allowing same-sex marriages.  Before I testified,
Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.), a primary opponent of DOMA, used the
hearing to attack the bill.  His central point was that marriage
laws traditionally have been made by the states, and that DOMA
would violate the principle of &quot;federalism,&quot; which says
that Congress will not interfere with the powers of state government.
Unbelievable! Ted Kennedy, quoting &quot;states rights,&quot;
while he has been the major proponent of bigger and bigger government
here in Washington. Maybe cows really can fly!

<p>

Kennedy left before I testified, but as I was finishing my remarks
he returned to the hearing room, so I couldn't resist a jab.
&quot;Senator Kennedy,&quot; I said, &quot;this is the first
time in your career you've made such an outstanding defense of
federalism.&quot;  The usually somber hearing room broke into
raucous laughter, and the liberal senator from Massachusetts sank
back into his chair speechless.  The irony is, DOMA makes a powerful
statement in support of the right of each state to ignore the
radical judicial inventions of other states.  It's true federalism
all the way.

<p>

On the day after my testimony, the full House of Representatives
voted for DOMA 342-67.  This 5-1 margin of victory makes it clear
that DOMA <b><i>is</i></b> mainstream and that the aggressive ambitions
of the homosexual lobby <b><i>are not</i></b>.  In the coming days, FRC
will continue scrambling to help ensure that DOMA passes the Congress
without amendments and goes to the president for signature.  We
intend to do everything we can to send the Hawaii courts -- and liberal
judges everywhere -- a powerful message.

<p>

Here are several other fronts on which FRC has been fighting
for America's families:

<p><ul>

<li>FRC Director of Legal Policy, Cathleen Cleaver, has been in
the thick of the raging debates over computer pornography, cable
porn, and social issues from assisted suicide to religious liberty.
Cathleen played a key role in the recent adoption of the Communications
Decency Act, a bill passed by Congress earlier this year that
will help keep distributors of computer porn away from our children.
A federal court in Philadelphia struck down this law, but Cathleen
has begun work on FRC's legal brief to the Supreme Court, which
is likely to hear the case this fall.

<p>

FRC is also fighting for the right of citizens to offer sidewalk
counseling to women seeking abortions.  Cathleen prepared a brief
to the Supreme Court in the <I>Schenck v. Pro-Choice Network</I>
case and she is working with other lawyers to prepare oral arguments
to be made before the Court. Two major assisted suicide cases
are also getting our attention.  Either one could lead to a landmark
Supreme Court ruling which would protect human life, or put millions
of elderly and handicapped Americans at risk.

<p>

Finally, Cathleen is taking her effective debating skills before
some very tough audiences, and more than holding her own.  This
summer she has debated cable porn with Elliott Mincberg of People
for the American Way. She also locked horns over computer porn
with the government relations director of America On-line (a
longtime lawyer for the porn industry.) The computer porn debate
was shown on C-Span to a national audience.

<p>

<li>Robert Maginnis, FRC Policy Analyst has continued to spearhead
our Military Readiness Project. Bob came to FRC from the U.S. Army,
following his retirement, with the rank of Lieutenant Colonel.
Together with Melissa Wells-Petry, the Armed Forces' acknowledged
expert on the policy banning service in the military by homosexuals,
Bob has guided FRC's work this summer on three major court cases
regarding the ban. One of these cases, <I>Thomasson v. Perry</I>,
may soon be considered by the U.S. Supreme Court.

<p>

Bob has been working diligently on the drug issue as well, and
one glance at the trends will tell you how urgent this is.  In
the past three years, drug abuse has spiraled, especially -- and
most disturbingly -- among elementary school-age children using
gateway drugs like marijuana.  Bob recently attended a major
international drug conference in Sweden, and in early August he
met with Gen. Barry McCaffrey, President Clinton's drug czar,
to lay out FRC's specific concerns.

<p>

<li>Then there's Marty Dannenfelser, FRC Director of Government
Relations, and his excellent staff who have worked long and hard
on the effort to override the Clinton veto of the partial-birth
abortion ban. A vote in Congress, on this issue, is expected
soon after Labor Day. Marty's experienced team also played a
major role in the passage of a new bill which creates a national
commission on gambling, working in conjunction with our friend,
Congressman Frank Wolf (R- Va.).

<p>

<li>FRC has also been blessed to have the talents of Bob Morrison
and Jennifer <i>A</i>. Marshall on education issues, Jennifer
<i>E</i>. Marshall (that middle initial is not a misprint -- the
mail-sorting staff at FRC has its hands full!) on welfare reform
and voluntarism, Ryan Dobson (Jim Dobson's son) on youth issues,
and Steve Knudsen, our new director of state and local affairs,
who helped put together our recent press conference with state
family policy councils to endorse laws barring same-sex marriage.

</ul><p>

These are just a few of the activities that have kept FRC moving
at a sprinter's pace this summer. I wish I could tell you more
about the work of each and every member of our dedicated staff
members in Washington, D.C. and in Holland, Michigan, where our
constituent services and information systems teams are located.
FRC's team is top-notch, and it includes you, our beloved supporters.
Working together, we can make a significant difference in the
future of our country... in the way our families, our children,
and our grandchildren will spend their lives.

<p>

Thank you for all you do to help keep FRC moving forward. Your
involvement in our work is essential to our success.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. While we've been busy running the race, financial support
for our work has fallen into the typical summer doldrums.  Your
help would give FRC a special boost right now, so please consider
making a contribution if you possibly can. Again, thank you -- and
God bless you.

<h3><i>BROWBEATING AARP</i></h3> 
By <a href="/heritage/staff/wittmann.htm">Marshall Wittmann</a> and Charles P. Griffin<br>
Commentary: <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
October 25, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>
	A few weeks ago, just prior to a House vote on the issue, the American Association of Retired Persons (AARP) suddenly announced it was launching a massive grassroots campaign to oppose Medicare reform proposals in Congress. Media reports indicated that AARP, after months of soft-pedaling on the issue, would be establishing "campaign-style" field offices in "key presidential states," including New Hampshire and Iowa. 
<p>	The House approved its Medicare reform package, and now the Senate must come up with its own reform plan. But every American taxpayer should note the significance of AARP's late entry into the fray. This last minute activist turn by the nation's largest senior citizens' lobby was motivated by fear: Only six days before AARP's announcement, liberals in Congress had publicly browbeat the group into mounting a more offensive strategy opposing Medicare reform. 
<p>	The message was clear: We liberals have siphoned off huge portions of the taxpayers' money to help subsidize your lobbying activity for years -- now it's payback time. 
<p>	Groups like AARP that receive taxpayer funding even though they conduct lobbying activities (that means they use your money whether you agree with their cause or not) are now finding themselves captive to the politicians who give them your money. They're responding to veiled threats that their funding could be withdrawn if they don't dance to a particular political tune. 	Taxpayer funding of lobbying groups would be sharply curtailed under an amendment sponsored by Rep. Earnest Istook, R-Okla., and Congress is expected to take final action in the next few weeks. If it fails passage, political arm-twisting over issues like Medicare will continue. <p> 	The St. Louis Post-Dispatch reported on Sept. 28, that House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., "suggested this week that the AARP was making a mistake in not already mobilizing its 33 million members against Republican plans to slow Medicare spending." Gephardt's Senate counterpart, Tom Daschle, D-S.D., bemoaned that "it has been somewhat surprising that they've waited this long" to voice opposition.
<p>	Now, to you and me, those don't sound like doomsday proclamations. But in the nomenclature of official Washington they went off like cannon shots. In just six days, AARP announced the opening of anti-reform campaign offices nationwide, to disseminate the message that proposed changes in Medicare were "draconian." The group's Iowa spokesman -- apparently unconcerned that the group's grassroots organizing is supposed to be non-partisan -- reminded reformers in Congress that AARP members compose 10 percent of that state's population and thus represent a major voting bloc.
<p>	Of course the reason congressional liberals can browbeat this powerful special interest into action is because AARP is a major beneficiary of taxpayer financing. In fact, the $86 million AARP acknowledged receiving in federal funding in 1993 through various grant programs represented approximately one-quarter of its annual expenditures. AARP's sources of federal funding range from programs for the elderly to millions of dollars annually to provide clerical support for the Environmental Protection Agency (EPA).
<p>	From July 1993 to June 1994, AARP's largest single source of taxpayer funding was the Department of Labor/Employment Training Administration's "Senior Community Service Employment Program." This one program provides about $49 million per year to AARP's bank account. More than $300 million of the $400 million appropriated for Program Year 1994 went to 9 seniors' organizations and the Forest Service, with the remainder going to the states.
<p>	AARP was also a major beneficiary of the EPA's "Senior Environmental Employment Program." The annual appropriation is $45 million. With that money, approximately 265 grants are made. The AARP receives approximately $20 million from this program. It provides support to almost every regional office of the EPA, as well as most divisions within the Washington headquarters. This particular program permits AARP to benefit from the inflow of funds and the EPA to benefit from low-cost labor to promote its agenda.
<p>	The group also received approximately $4.6 million per year under the Treasury Department/Internal Revenue Service's "Tax Counseling for the Elderly Program." This represents the lion's share of the grant's annual appropriation. Ironically, AARP could have used some of its own tax counseling, since they were recently forced to settle with the IRS for tens of millions of dollars in back taxes.
<p>	The browbeating of AARP into active opposition to Medicare reform symbolizes the arrogance and corruption created by 40 years of taxpayer-funded political patronage. Nobody asked the taxpayers whether they favored the causes AARP or literally hundreds of other groups espouse in their lobbying efforts. Yet, over the decades, Congress has handed them billions in taxpayer funding in ever-increasing increments. 
<p>	It's time for this "welfare for lobbyists" -- and the arm twisting it encourages -- to end.

<h3>Global Warming Shtick Returns<br>
The Heat Is Off </h3>
<p>
Snow in Arizona, ice in Mississippi, and record low temperatures in between? It must be global warming. So said Newsweek's January 22 cover story: "The Hot Zone: Blizzards, Floods, & Hurricanes: Blame Global Warming."
<p>
Senior Writer Sharon Begley promoted Goddard Institute scientist James Hansen (an early and influential exponent of global warming). The story included a graph claiming, "The average surface temperature of the earth has risen more than 1.5 degrees in the last 135 years."
<p>
Begley noted how some scientists are skeptical, but didn't detail their evidence. Instead, she concluded by endorsing Hansen's theory of immenent climate change, writing "to many people trudging along streets lined with urban Himalayas last week, it already has."
Reporter Bob Dotson fingered the same suspect to explain the weather on the February 2 Dateline NBC: "Despite the cold, last year was the hottest on record. Mix those two extremes, says Dr. Michael Oppenheimer, and stir with global warming." Dotson failed to tell viewers that Oppeheimer is a long-time promoter of warming scenarios for the liberal Environmental Defense Fund. 
<p>
Both got their data from the University of East Anglia, whose climate researchers anointed 1995 the warmest year ever after measuring the Earth's surface temperature for the first 11 months of data, making an "educated guess" about December.
<p>
Oops.
<p>
Reporter Kathy Sawyer in the January 26 Washington Post pointed out "Temperatures in the Northern Hemisphere plummeted in December by almost 1.3 degrees Fahrenheit," a drop "unprecedented in the 17-year satellite record." She cited figures from NOAA, whose satellite data showed that out of 17 years included in their research, "1995 was only about the eighth-warmest year." 
Ronald Bailey, producer of Ben Wattenberg's Think Tank on PBS wrote in the February 5 Weekly Standard that "One climate scientist at NASA speculated that the East Anglia group was afraid that if they waited, December temperatures might plummet and they'd lose their opportunity for a scary headline." Bailey suggested a more accurate headline: "'95 Eighth-Warmest Year on Record."

<h3><i>GIMME A (WELFARE) BREAK</i></h3>
By Mildred (Annie) Hambleton<br>
Commentary: <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
10/26/95<br>
<hr width=50%></center>
<p>	
	It's almost a year since the 104th Congress was voted into office to shake things up. And, if you judge such things by the volume of complaints, they seem to be doing just that.
<P>	In the process, they also have done a number of things President Clinton had promised to do when he was campaigning for the White House -- promises he soon forgot. For example: "end welfare as we know it." 
<p>	I'm a middle-aged receptionist. To the tens of millions of us around the country who get up early in the morning every day and punch a time clock (figuratively, if not literally), welfare has become a costly joke. But the joke's on us: We pay our hard-earned wages so millions of others don't have to get up each morning and punch a time clock.
<p>	According to studies, the welfare system has cost us taxpayers more than $5 trillion since the War on Poverty was begun by President Johnson 30 years ago. How much is $5 trillion? I looked it up in the 1995 "Information Please Almanac." It is an amount equal to the combined economies of Austria, Belgium, Brazil, Chile, France, Great Britain, Greece, India, Ireland, Israel, Jamaica, Mexico, Netherlands, Panama, Philippines, Poland, Saudi Arabia, South Korea, Spain and Sweden.   
<p>	That's an awful lot of money, especially when it is obvious to almost everybody that we have lost the War on Poverty. All over the country -- from the "hollers" in my late husband's home state of West Virginia, to inner-city Chicago, where I grew up, and right down the street from The Heritage Foundation building where I work -- two and three generations of the same family have been raised on welfare: the mother, her mother, and the kids.
<p>	The new Congress seems serious about ending this. The liberals already are screaming about the fraying of the "safety net." I say: Fray away. Welfare was intended to provide temporary help to people down on their luck; it was not supposed to become a way of life. 
<p>	Not everybody on "welfare" is down-and-out and poor. For example, lots of film-makers -- graduates of UCLA and NYU and other expensive schools -- would have to go out and get real jobs if the National Endowment for the Arts and Corporation for Public Broadcasting stopped giving them our money. There are also hundreds (probably thousands) of artists, composers, musicians and writers of one sort or another who are  dependent on government grants. 
<p>	This is welfare for the well-to-do. And it also needs to end. There's no reason on earth that when the creators of Miss Piggy bring home the bacon, it has to be mine. I don't get a free ride -- why do they?
<p>	After more than 40 years of working, I know what they mean by the term "wage slave": I earn the money and Washington decides how much I get to keep.  Whenever tax cuts are mentioned, you hear something like this: "If we cut taxes, the Treasury will receive $160 billion less." 
<p>	So? What's wrong with that? It means you and I will get to keep -- and spend on ourselves and our families -- $160 billion more. The new Congress has put the focus back where it belongs. This is not and never was "the Treasury's" money. It's my money and your money.
<p>	If Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole's 104th Congress successfully slows down government spending, it will be a banner year for the working people of America. As many of my fellow wage earners know, it is real hard to get excited about working hard when 40 cents out of every dollar is going to the tax man.
<p>	The young families in the apartment complex where I live want the opportunity to save for a home of their own and their kids' education. They don't have their hands out, saying "gimme, gimme"; they don't feel anybody owes them a living.
<p>	All we really want Congress to give us is a break. So to Newt Gingrich and Bob Dole I say, "Carry on. You're doing the right thing. Keep up the good work."
<p>	Let's end welfare as we know it, for people who won't work, artists who can't support themselves, and big business alike. The "gimme" times are over. And none too soon.
<p>

<title>Gary Bauer's June, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

June 7, 1996

<p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

June is fittingly called &quot;the month of weddings.&quot; 
As the first real warm days of summer finally arrive, skies are
blue, flowers are blooming, and brides and grooms are seemingly
everywhere.  Marriage is never out of season, but I can think
of no better time than the month of June for our nation to reaffirm
the value and meaning of marriage.

<p>

As this letter is written, a reaffirmation of marriage is taking
place all across our land.  You can hear it in the peal of church
bells and read about it in wedding announcements and church bulletins.
You can even see it in brightly decorated cars parading by on
dazzling June days.  But this reaffirmation is taking place in
another way, too.

<p>

In Washington, DC, and in over 30 states, legislators are stepping
forward to make sure that marriage is protected in American law.
My letter is brief this month because the Family Research Council
is in the thick of this essential effort.  The reaffirmation of
traditional marriage is coming <b>just in time</b>.  Even as I
write this, an organized assault is in progress to redefine marriage
to allow men to marry men and women to marry women.

<p>

Let me recap quickly what has happened.  In 1993, the highest
court in Hawaii handed down a shocking decision.  Liberal judges
there said that Hawaii's law limiting marriage to one man and
one woman (similar to laws in every other state) was a form of
sex discrimination -- unless the state could somehow show that it
had a &quot;compelling interest&quot; in reserving marriage to
couples of the opposite sex!  Hawaii is a very liberal state politically,
but this ruling sparked immediate outrage even there.

<p>

Nearly three quarters of Hawaii's citizens told pollsters they
<I>reject</I> making Hawaii a haven for homosexual couples to
&quot;marry.&quot;  In 1994 the Hawaii legislature responded and
passed a law reaffirming that marriage is intended for &quot;man-woman
units&quot; -- not two men or two women.

<p>

Despite the findings of this poll, and subsequent efforts to
convince the courts that Hawaii does have a &quot;compelling interest&quot;
here, most experts believe that traditional marriage in Hawaii
will be struck down -- perhaps as soon as this August.  If that happens,
homosexual couples from every state in the Union are ready to
fly to Hawaii and find &quot;chapels&quot;or Justices of the Peace
to marry them.  They will then return to their home states and
demand recognition of these marriages from their state and local
governments, from their employers, from the courts, from their
churches (and from you)!

<p>

The worst news is that these demands have a good chance of succeeding.
Under what is known as the &quot;Full Faith and Credit&quot;
clause of the U.S. Constitution, each state is required to recognize
the &quot;Public Acts, Records and Judicial Proceedings&quot;
of every other state (Article IV, Section 1).   States that refuse
to recognize these Hawaiian &quot;marriage&quot; licenses as valid
are likely to find themselves being sued in court, with the outcome
uncertain.  Unbelievably, the action of a single court -- or even
a single judge -- in Hawaii could lead to a revolution that undoes
the sanctity of the marriage bond in every corner of the United
States.

<p>

<b>We must not -- and cannot -- allow this to happen!</b> When Hawaii's
Supreme Court ruled in 1993, FRC responded with alerts and issue
papers pointing out the devastating impact that would follow.
We and other groups encouraged states to respond by reaffirming
the traditional definition of marriage to insulate it from attack.
The word has spread rapidly, and a wide coalition of religious
and family groups and legislators of all political persuasions
is currently pushing for marriage protection laws.

<p>

Such laws have now been enacted in at least eleven states, and
more may be signed into law by the time you read this.  In addition,
the Congress of the United States is set to respond to this challenge.
With FRC's help and through the dedicated efforts of legal experts
on Capitol Hill, legislation has been introduced to protect marriage
in federal law.  This legislation is called the Defense of Marriage
Act, or DOMA.  It was introduced in the House of Representatives
on May 7 by Reps. Steve Largent (R-Okla.) and Bob  Barr (R-Ga.).
Senate introduction of the legislation followed on May 8 with
Don Nickles (R-Okla.) and Bob Dole (R-Kans.) as co-sponsors.
The respective bill numbers are H.R.3396 and S.1740.

<p>

Make no mistake, this bill is vitally needed.  Sen. Dan Coats
(R-Ind.) issued a powerful statement endorsing the bill and explaining
the importance of marriage.  His quote is worth sharing at length:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Marriage is the institution that civilizes our society by 
humanizing our lives. It is the social, legal and spiritual 
relationship that prepares the next generation for its duties and 
opportunities.  An 1884 decision of the Supreme Court called it 
&quot;the sure foundation of all that is stable and noble
in our civilization.&quot;

<p>

The definition of marriage is not created by politicians and judges, 
and it cannot be changed by them.  It is rooted in our history,
in our laws, our deepest moral and religious convictions, and our 
nature as human beings.  It is the union of one man and one woman. 
This fact can be respected or resented, but it can't be altered.

<p>

The institution of marriage is our most valuable cultural inheritance. 
It is our duty -- perhaps our first duty -- to pass it intact to the 
future . . . It is amazing and disturbing that the debate should even 
be necessary.  It is a sign of the times, and an indication of a deep 
moral confusion.  But events have made the definition of traditional 
marriage essential.  The preservation of marriage has become an issue 
of self-preservation for our society.</i>

</blockquote><p>

With Senator Coats' words, the case for marriage rests.
Be assured that the Family Research Council will continue to
work with him and other like-minded legislators in both parties
to secure passage of this bill as soon as possible -- before a final
decision is reached by the Supreme Court in Hawaii.  Americans
need to be heard before our courts intervene and disturb yet another
legal ideal.  Our goal is that DOMA will swiftly reach President
Clinton's desk and that he will have no choice but to sign it
into law.

<p>

<b>The need for passage of this bill could not be more urgent.
On May 20, the U.S. Supreme Court struck down the state of Colorado's
Amendment 2, which would have blocked special rights for homosexuals.
One leader of the homosexual movement bragged, &quot;This is
a joyous day for gay, lesbian, bisexual and transgender Americans.&quot;</b>

<p>

Please join with us in this effort.  Use the enclosed card, or
call us at 1-800-225-4008, to obtain a free copy of our information
packet on saving the institution of marriage.  Take note of the
enclosed copy of the full-page advertisement we placed in the
May 19 <i>Washington Post</i>.  Feel free to make copies or contact
us to arrange to run this ad in your local newspaper.

<p>

Be assured that your prayers and financial support of the work
of the Family Research Council are what sustain us.  Your involvment
and commitment to FRC will enable us to continue in our efforts
to defend the divine institution of marriage.  As always, thank
you for your friendship, and may God bless you.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

By <a href="/heritage/staff/feulner.html">Edwin Feulner</a><br>
President, <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
October 26, 1995<br><hr width=50%></center><P>

	What is the "dirty little secret" of the welfare state?
<p>
	Just this: Across the country there are more than 40,000 hurting, adoptable children languishing in foster care, waiting for moms and dads -- and plenty of would-be moms and dads are waiting to adopt them.
<p>
	Yet, standing between the two -- seemingly hell-bent on keeping them apart -- is an army of highly paid welfare bureaucrats who don't like adoption and have erected a practically insurmountable array of barriers against those who wish to adopt.
<p>
	Why? According to <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/mom2.html">Conna Craig</a>, president of the Institute for Children and a former adopted child herself, there are <a href="/heritage/p_review/summer95/thcraig.htm">three reasons</a>.
<p>
	First, the public adoption system rewards and encourages foster care over adoption. When foster parents are paid between $200 and $530 per month, based on the number of children they care for, it creates a financial incentive to keep children in temporary homes. Private adoption agencies, by contrast, are paid by the number of successful adoptions they arrange. In other words, the cash flows in the direction of adoption, not foster care.
<p>
	Second, since adoption often is put forward as an alternative to abortion, feminist groups and their allies have succeeded in inculcating an anti-adoption bias in the social service community and mainstream media. Magazines, ranging from Good Housekeeping to Playboy, have painted adoption as a traumatic event that can cause psychological damage to both mother and child. In fact, the benefits of adoption far outweigh long-term foster care. A study by the Search Institute of Minneapolis has shown that adopted children rate their relationship with their parents even more positively than a national sample of non-adopted adolescents.
<p>
	Third, the social service community has placed the whims of irresponsible parents above the well-being and happiness of children. Too many kids are repeatedly returned to abusive or unfit parents, as if "family reunification" is more important than the physical safety of children. Craig says one-third of all children returned to their "birth families" eventually must be returned to state care.
<p>
	Reforming this system won't be easy. Eliminating barriers against transracial adoptions -- as if white parents would be worse for a black child than no parents at all -- would be a step in the right direction. Because of these barriers, black children make up 40 percent of the foster-care population, even though they are only 15 percent of all children.
<p>
	The government shouldn't be funding permanent foster-care situations, but rather encouraging families to adopt and making it easier for them to do so. One way would be to enact a means-tested, inflation-adjusted tax credit of up to $5,000 to help pay the expensive one-time cost of adopting a child. By contrast, the government spends, on average, $13,000 per year to care for a foster child.
<p>
	Why not spend less than half than that on the better alternative -- adoption?

<title>What's Really At Stake In the Medicare Debate -- Heritage</title>
<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg"><center>
<h2>WHAT'S REALLY AT STAKE IN THE MEDICARE DEBATE</h2>
By Grace Marie Arnett<br>
Commentary: <a href="/heritage/">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>

10/12/95<br>
<hr width=50%></center><p>
	Strip away the rhetoric and accusations about Medicare reform and the historic importance of the issue becomes clear: The debate over $270 billion in spending represents a pivotal decision over the role of government in the lives of free citizens.
<p>	The coming showdown presents both Congress and the American public with a clear choice: Either continue with a program based on government central planning and control, or give smart consumers operating in a competitive marketplace the chance to reform the system from the bottom up.
<p>	The Soviet Union and Eastern Europe have made their decisions about which way to go; now it's time for the United States to follow suit.
<p>	Liberals already are waging their battles to protect this dinosaur of a program that even the Clinton administration admits is unsustainable as currently constructed. Medicare is going bankrupt. It must be changed. There is no argument about that. The question is how: Do we want to raise taxes -- again! -- to pay for the program, or cut services and restrict choices -- again! -- to seniors? Or do we want to make changes that put trust in the somewhat messy and unpredictable genius of consumers operating in a competitive marketplace?
<P>	In this choice lies the whole battle. Raising taxes is how the Washington establishment has for decades "solved" problems. But this would leave in place a program that would continue to expand over time and suck in more and more tax dollars.
<p>	Restructuring the program so it operates more like business -- providing better services at lower cost -- is the solution that puts ordinary Americans back in charge.
<p>	Fortunately, the public has grown wary of big government. The public rejected  the Clinton administration's health-care plan, which would have put virtually the entire health-care system under the government's thumb through employer mandates, health-service alliances, draconian regulations, fines, penalties, and jail terms. Even though citizens knew -- and still know -- there are fundamental problems in the health-care system that need to be addressed, government control was and is not the answer. It wasn't the answer for the private sector, and it isn't the answer for Medicare.
<p>	After the voters overwhelmingly rejected the Clinton bill, they threw out many of the liberals in Congress who supported the plan. Now, liberals warn that the tables could turn on conservatives who dare to touch the sacred Medicare program.
<p>	Conservatives should not back down. Senior citizens are no different than other Americans who do not want government to run their lives; they want responsible government, and they want a government that recognizes their right to choose for thenselves.
<p>	Republicans won the battle against the Clinton health plan, and now they need to begin challenging the programs, like Medicare, that were built upon the same foundation. Major change cannot and should not come overnight. But conservatives should start now by making decisions that will lead to a more sustainable, more responsible, more efficient Medicare program in the next century.
<p>	Liberals know they can't win an open debate challenging Republicans' goals of cutting taxes and balancing the federal budget. They have to use a back door like Medicare to preserve paternalistic government programs. But conservatives can reform Medicare, balance the budget, and cut taxes, just as voters demanded.
<p>	The free market can easily give seniors better health care more efficiently than the government can. The big secret is: If we reform Medicare -- one of the few weapons left in the liberal arsenal -- the bigger battle will practically be won. A new course will be charted, and we will sail into a new era where government serves its citizens -- not the other way around.

<title>Gary Bauer's May, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

May 15, 1996

<p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

You probably read about the incredible speech Supreme Court Justice 
Antonin Scalia delivered at a prayer breakfast in early April at 
the Mississippi College School of Law in Jackson. Scalia delivered 
a stirring defense of the role of Christians in public life. The 
reaction was a prolonged standing ovation. But there was no ovation 
for the speech inside the Washington Beltway, where FRC fights 
every day on behalf of your family, or among America's cultural 
elite.

<p>

&quot;Justice Scalia: Defender of the Faith,&quot; sneered the
headline in the <I>International Herald Tribune.</I>[1]

<p>

The speech &quot;clearly undermines public confidence in [Scalia's]
objectivity regarding religious controversies,&quot;[2] said Barry
Lynn of Americans United for the Separation of Church and State.

<p>

&quot;This is a disturbing view for a Justice to have,&quot;[3] said
Elliott Mincberg, legal director of Norman Lear's group, People for
the American Way.

<p>

The speech should have set off &quot;alarm bells,&quot;[4] charged
political columnists Jack Germond and Jules Witcover.

<p>

In a few pockets of liberalism outside the beltway the reaction
was even harsher:

<p>

Humor columnist Art Buchwald fired away: &quot;When a Justice
is hearing a case, no secular person can feel comfortable with
a member of the court who is thinking, 'If this lawyer doesn't
believe in the &quot;burning bush,&quot; he has a serious constitutional
problem.'&quot;[5]

<p>

<I>Des Moines Register</I> writer Donald Kaul, suggested that
Scalia &quot;occupies the outermost reaches of the right of the
court (some days you can only reach him by dogsled).&quot;[6]

<p>

What words could have possibly sparked such -- there's no other word
but <I>scornful</I> -- reactions from so many elements of the working
press? Scalia spoke to the crowd of 650 fellow Americans about the 
difficulty of upholding Christian beliefs, especially a belief in miracles,
in our increasingly secular society. He pointed out that the word
&quot;cretin,&quot; or &quot;fool,&quot; is derived from the French
word for &quot;Christian,&quot; and added:

<p><blockquote>

<i>To be honest about it, that is the view of Christians taken
by modern society. Surely those who adhere to all or most of these 
traditional Christian beliefs are to be regarded as simple-minded.</i>[7]

<p>

The &quot;worldly wise,&quot; he went on:

<p>

<i>just will not have anything to do with miracles . . . [they
assume] that everything from Easter morning to the Ascension had to 
be made up by the groveling enthusiasts</i> (the disciples - ed.) 
<i>as part of their plan to get themselves martyred.</i>[8]

</blockquote><p>

In the midst of this cynicism, he concluded, &quot;We must pray
to endure the scorn of the sophisticated world.&quot;[9] Justice 
Scalia's prayers came not a moment too soon. Those
who immediately attacked the speech, calling it contrary
to American tradition and inconsistent with his role as a judge,
seemed blissfully unaware that they were only confirming the truth
of what he said.

<p>

One professor of constitutional law at American University in
Washington, D.C., blasted the speech and remarked, &quot;We expect
our Supreme Court justices to be the most secular of our public
servants.&quot;[10] <b><i>We</i></b>? Where in our
Declaration of Independence and Constitution is it written that
judges must be less endowed with a sense of religious conviction
than other officials? The professor could only have been speaking
for that group of Americans who agree with <I>his</I> own expectation.
Most Americans <i>still</i> believe that every citizen, regardless
of their religious belief, is equal before the law. It is that
very equality -- the right of Christians to bring their full convictions
into the public square -- that Justice Scalia, and we at FRC, believe is 
under attack.

<p>

Don't let me leave the impression here that Scalia was without
defenders. Among them was syndicated newspaper columnist Cal Thomas,
who eloquently reminded readers that it was a rather
well-known &quot;public servant,&quot; Abraham Lincoln, who said,
&quot;But for this Book [the Bible], we would not know right from
wrong.&quot;[11]

<p>

Is there a difference between Presidents and Supreme Court Justices
in this regard? Our history and tradition say otherwise. The
Supreme Court begins each day of oral argument with the bailiff
stating, &quot;God save this honorable court.&quot; As you enter
the Supreme Court building, there is, on the right side of
the portico, a statue of Moses holding aloft the tablet of the
Ten Commandments.

<p>

The critics say, &quot;Those are mere symbols, devoid of meaning.&quot;
They believe that Scalia crossed a line that Justices must never 
cross -- expressing his religious faith. But once again, they 
don't know our history! Justices of our Supreme Court have time 
and again pronounced themselves about religious faith in general 
and Christianity in particular.

<p>

John Jay, the first Chief Justice, said in 1777:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Providence has given to our people the choice of their rulers,
and it is the duty, as well as the privilege and the interest, of a 
Christian nation to select and prefer Christians for their rulers.</i>[12]

</blockquote><p>

Imagine any public official saying something similar today! No
Christian leader or politician would echo Jay's observation today,
but the point is, such beliefs were not extraordinary among the
men and women who founded this nation. Daniel Webster is esteemed
as one of the five greatest senators in U.S. history, by resolution
of the Senate.[13] At the bicentennial of the Pilgrims' landing at
Plymouth Rock in 1620, Webster's keynote address included these
words:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Our ancestors established their system of government on morality
and religious sentiment. Moral habits, they believed, cannot safely be 
trusted on any other foundation than religious principle, nor any 
government be secure which is not supported by moral habits. Whatever 
makes men Christians, makes them good citizens.</i>[14]

</blockquote><p>

In July 1835, when Chief Justice John Marshall died, the Liberty
Bell was rung, sustaining the crack that is one of the keys to
its fame.[15] Are American traditions affronted by the fact that the
Liberty Bell, one of a handful of supposedly secular American
&quot;shrines,&quot; bears the words of Leviticus 25:10: &quot;Proclaim
liberty throughout all the land unto all the inhabitants thereof&quot;?
In 1852, Justice John McLean wrote a letter asserting that &quot;Aside
from Revelation, darkness rests upon the world and upon the future.
The Bible has shed a glorious light upon the world.&quot;[16]

<p>

To all of these examples, dozens more could be added, from
Lincoln to McKinley to Coolidge, to TR and FDR, to John F. Kennedy,
to Jimmy Carter, to Ronald Reagan. Candid assertions of the importance
of religious beliefs to democratic institutions transcend partisan
divisions. It was Justice William O. Douglas, perhaps the Supreme
Court's leading liberal for nearly four decades, who wrote
that, &quot;We are a religious people whose institutions
presuppose a Supreme Being.&quot;[17]

<p>

In short, what Justice Scalia said is in keeping with
a long line of statements by American jurists and statesmen. But
what about the substance of what he said? Do Christians face any
special level of scorn in modern society? Sadly, I believe they
do. Among the Beltway publications, the liberal <I>Washington Post</I>
published the most hostile appraisal of Scalia's speech. Of course, 
just a few years ago, they printed a front-page story suggesting 
that Christian voters are &quot;poor, uneducated and easily led.&quot;

<p>

Just a few weeks ago, the <I>Los Angeles Times</I> printed a cartoon
showing a crucified Bob Dole. A crown of thorns was depicted lacing
his head, with the crown composed of letters spelling out, &quot;Christian
Coalition.&quot;[18] That same paper, on Easter Sunday, refused to
print the regular Johnny Hart comic strip called &quot;B.C.&quot;
because it referred positively to the Resurrection of Christ.
&quot;B.C.&quot; was out, and PC, political correctness, was in!

<p>

Perhaps the real scourges in our society today are reserved for
sincere religious believers <I>of any kind</I>. Consider what
happened to Marian P. MacDonald and Teen Challenge. Marian spent
32 years building an outstanding record as a public school teacher
in Greensboro, North Carolina. She was forced to resign her post
last month under pressure from the school system. The reason?
She invited members of Teen Challenge to one of her health and
physical education classes. Teen Challenge is an extremely effective
drug rehabilitation organization that incorporates religious principles
in its program.

<p>

The visiting teens told MacDonald's class they believed God had
helped them overcome drug abuse, but added, &quot;We are not here
to push our religion off on anybody.&quot; Apparently, that disclaimer
was not enough. The school principal sent a note home to parents
apologizing for the teens' &quot;insensitive comments.&quot; An
investigation followed, and MacDonald was essentially fired.[19] 
Stories like this are all too common.

<p>

I believe that Justice Scalia, whose sense of fairness and level
of scholarship are without match in the federal judiciary, has paid
religion the high compliment of taking it seriously. As I reported
to you last month, Christian convictions <I>are</I> cause for
persecution in many lands around the globe. Bigotry against
Christians in American, by comparison, seems mild; but that bigotry
is real nonetheless. Moreover, the aggressive, secularizing forces
in our nation today are committed to keeping you and me out of 
government, law, and the public debate on all the great issues.

<p>

True religious tolerance <i>is</i> the American way. But Justice
Scalia's critics would have you believe that the sanctity of human
life, traditional marriage, equal access of religious speakers
to the public square, and dozens of other ideas are merely a religious
creed and not the common code of civilization. In a healthy society,
Scalia's articulation of his private thoughts in the setting of
a private prayer breakfast would not have been news. That
they are news at all tells us a great deal about the crisis facing
America today.

<p>

I can assure you that, with your help, the Family Research Council
will continue to speak calmly, but passionately, in behalf of
moral values and true religious liberty. We hold with Daniel Webster
that good Christianity and good citizenship go hand in hand. And
we invite all Americans of goodwill to join with us in honoring
and preserving the values of family, faith and freedom.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. We'd love to hear from you this month. Many of you are already
aware of the &quot;Compact with Our Fellow Americans&quot; included
in my book <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams.</I> The Compact is designed
to renew the spirit of cooperation among our citizens. Its final
provision states, &quot;In our personal lives, we promise to honor
the Creator, who made us and endowed us with such unalienable
rights as life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness. We will
practice our faith on a daily basis and will gather with others
to worship regularly. Without resorting to coercion or vilification,
we will encourage faith, and the fruits of faith, in others.&quot;

<p>

Just check the enclosed reply card if you would like a free copy
of the Compact, suitable for framing. Thank you for your support
of our efforts on behalf of America's families and for reading
my letter this month. God bless you.

<center><h2>Janet Cooke Award, from the February 1996 MediaWatch</h2></center>
<p>
ABC Promotes A Green "Demonstration" That Didn't Happen, Ignores March for Life
<p>
The Evangelical Right Wing That Wasn't 
<p>
Pro-life activists gather together in the nation's capital every January 22 to mark the anniversary of the 1973 Roe vs. Wade decision that legalized abortion nationwide. This year, 60,000 came to Washington for the annual March for Life, but the networks didn't pay much attention.
<p>
NBC Nightly News and CBS Evening News each gave the event 19 seconds. CBS followed up with a long story about the federal investigation into anti-abortion violence. CNN also had an anchor brief, although reporter Anthony Collings did a story the night before. On the day of the march, CNN's Inside Politics didn't mention the march, but devoted more than seven minutes to an interview with pro-choice Republicans Ann Stone and Julie Finley.
<p>
ABC's World News Tonight didn't even mention the march. But just nine days later, on January 31, Peter Jennings announced a "major demonstration on behalf of the environment designed to pressure those congressional Republicans who wish to eliminate or dilute many of the country's environmental laws. ABC's Barry Serafin reports that the pressure comes from a group of the Republican conservatives' strongest supporters." For ignoring the march of religious conservatives against abortion and then promoting the activities of a small group of religious liberals as if they were conservatives, ABC earned the Janet Cooke Award. 
<p>
Serafin explained: "Protecting the environment is a relatively new issue for evangelical Christians. But a group called the Evangelical Environmental Network [EEN] says it will spend a million dollars on a campaign to block efforts by congressional conservatives to weaken the Endangered Species Act, starting with a television commercial in 18 states." ABC aired a section of the ad which asserted: "The Endangered Species Act has rescued dozens of God's creatures from extinction. But today, the Act itself is threatened."
<p>
Serafin added that the group encouraged children to write letters lobbying Newt Gingrich to stop the GOP bill, before concluding: "The evangelical delegation in Washington delivered some of the children's letters, but it was unable to meet with Gingrich today. Gingrich's position on the Endangered Species Act is still a question. A bigger question is how congressional conservatives will deal with opposition from those they usually consider political allies." 
<p>
ABC's report was grossly misleading for a number of reasons. Despite Jennings' insistence, there was no "major demonstration." ABC showed no video of a demonstration, only a shot of a few professionals in overcoats walking outside the Capitol. In other words, ABC had ignored a major demonstration of 60,000 pro-lifers, only to cover one that did not even occur. The Environmental Information Center (EIC), which other news accounts identified as the million-dollar funder behind the evangelical group's ads against GOP reform of the Endangered Species Act, told MediaWatch there was no demonstration, only a press conference. 
<p>
In an August 19, 1995 Washington Post story about the activities of the liberal environmental groups Greenpeace, U.S. Public Interest Research Group, and the Sierra Club to stop Republican proposals to strengthen the rights of property owners, reporter Gary Lee noted the liberal strategy behind the founding of EIC: "The major conservation groups and a few private donors and foundations pooled their resources last spring to create the Environmental Information Center, a new lobbying organization charged with doing whatever it takes to stop the anti-environmental tide in Washington." 
<p>
The Post noted EIC spent $1.3 million during last year's House debate on regulatory reform on TV ads saying "Don't let Congress roll back 25 years of environmental progress." But ABC identified these liberal activists as "a group of the Republican conservatives' strongest supporters" and "those they usually consider political allies." 
<p>
Not only has the Environmental Evangelical Network taken sides on the environmental issues, it has taken sides against the religious right as well. The February 1 San Diego Union Tribune noted EEN leaders "were critical of the environmental stands of some conservative Christian groups, such as the politically influential Christian Coalition." ABC aired a soundbite of Ron Sider, President and founder of Evangelicals for Social Action, the EEN's parent organization. But they did not note he signed a document last May called the "Cry for Renewal." The primary authors of the letter, leftist Sojourners magazine editor Jim Wallis and Clinton friend Tony Campolo, declared their intention to create a "progressive evangelical caucus" to challenge traditionally conservative evangelical events and hold town meetings to address community problems like "gay bashing." ABC did not reconcile Sider's partisan press conference with his signature on the "Cry for Renewal" document, which declared "religion as a political cheerleader is inevitably false as religion."
<p>
ABC denigrated Republican stands with pejorative adjectives ("eliminate," "dilute," "weaken") without allowing the GOP to explain their side of the debate. Rep. Don Young (R-Alaska), chairman of the House Natural Resources Committee, and Rep. Richard Pombo (R-Calif.) issued a press release the day after the ABC telecast asking the Evangelical Environmental Network to be honest in their characterization of the Republican bill, which currently has 126 co-sponsors in the House. Among the major provisions of the bill is an actual increase in funding for Endangered Species Act programs. 
<p>
ABC's blindness to opposing views extended to free-market environmental experts like Ike Sugg of the Competitive Enterprise Institute, who told MediaWatch the Young-Pombo bill "doesn't go nearly far enough. They tried to pre-emptively compromise, and Gingrich is seeking to water it down further. The Republicans are not guilty of what they're accused of."
<p>
Sugg added: "The Young-Pombo bill is a step in the right direction since it weakens the federal government's power over private land use. But the current Endangered Species Act has created perverse incentives for property owners to remove any possibility of endangered species appearing on their property. It creates an enmity between wildlife and land owners. The ESA's supporters care more about saving the act than saving wildlife." 
<p>
Serafin did not return phone calls to discuss his story. ABC's story contrast suggests the irony of their biases. Their focus suggests heart-tugging concern for the kangaroo rat, but not the unborn child. ABC sometimes labels the religious right as "ultraconservative," but the religious left receives no label, or worse yet, is portrayed as conservative. But the worst characteristic of their reporting is the absolute refusal to acknowledge that issues they advance with partisan passion have more than one side.

<title>Gary Bauer's July, 1996 Letter</title>

<body>

<center><h2>A Message From Gary L. Bauer</h2></center>

<p><hr width=75% height=2><p>

July 12, 1996

<p>

Dear Friend:

<p>

The Bauer family had a close call last month.  An unusually strong
summer thunderstorm ripped through the Washington area, bringing
with it 150-mile-per-hour winds.  To make matters worse, a tornado
touched down on our street, knocking down trees and sending limbs
flying through walls and onto rooftops.  Fortunately, our house
was largely spared, but a neighbor's home was badly damaged.

<p>

My daughter, Elyse, and I were driving home through the storm
when the tornado hit.  I'll never forget the sight as we turned
down our street and saw how the severe weather had rearranged
the familiar objects of our daily lives.  The storm was gone in
a little more than an hour, but it was incredible how quickly
so much raw destruction was wreaked on our community.  Human beings
are no match for the forces of God's Creation.  We were struck
with a sense of awe -- and our hearts were filled with thanks that
the destruction was not worse and that no one was injured or killed.

<p>

That twister wasn't the only storm I encountered last month.
Throughout the month of June, I found myself caught up in a whirlwind
over the Republican Party Platform and the sanctity of human life.
Debate over the GOP's pro-life plank has been going on for years,
but this new storm kicked up suddenly and unexpectedly.  It came
about when Sen. Robert Dole, the certain GOP presidential nominee,
called for the addition of  a &quot;declaration of tolerance&quot;
to the platform, and suggested that it be applied <I>only</I>
to the abortion language.  That current language in the existing
platform says that the unborn child has a fundamental right to
life that cannot be infringed, and calls for a human life amendment
to the Constitution.

<p>

Let me say right up front that Sen. Bob Dole and I have known
each other for years.  I consulted with him last fall, at his
request, before he delivered his speech in Hollywood calling on
the entertainment industry to reverse its tide of sex-and-violence
for profit.  We have collaborated over the years on many other
issues.  A few weeks ago, Jim Dobson and I prayed together with
Bob in his Capitol Hill office.  I consider him a friend, and
I believe he would say the same about me.

<p>

But, in my humble opinion, Bob Dole is wrong about the pro-life
plank. It cannot and should not be changed.  Talk about revising
the plank has been swirling, of course, for months in GOP circles.
Some prominent pro-abortion Republicans, like Govs. Christine
Todd Whitman and Pete Wilson, have insisted on removing it altogether.
To do so would repeat the discussion that took place in the Democratic
party some years ago. The 1992 Democratic Platform endorsed an
abortion on demand philosophy.  A previous statement tolerating
the presence of pro-life Democrats in the party was stripped from
the platform.  As a result, President Clinton has vetoed every
attempt to restrict abortion, including those in the 7th, 8th
and 9th months of pregnancy.

<p>

All during the early summer, I was among a number of pro-life
leaders who were kept abreast of negotiations taking place among
leading Republicans.  After weeks of discussion, an agreement
was reached to include &quot;open door&quot; language in the preamble
to the platform.  That language would only state the obvious:
that the GOP platform stands for a set of principles, and that
not every member of the party agrees with every one of those principles.
The sanctity of human life would not be singled out or in any
other way watered down.  The current pro-life plank, powerful
and unequivocal, would remain as written. No deletions.  No dilutions.

<p>

This solution was acceptable, but within 24 hours Bob Dole himself
overturned it. He used a television interview to declare his
intention to put the tolerance language right in the pro-life
plank. Talk about a twister out of the blue!  This so-called
solution was totally unacceptable, and I said so publicly.  The
sanctity-of-life plank is among a handful of essential statements
in the GOP platform.  To attach &quot;tolerance&quot; language
directly to that plank would signal to the world (and the media
immediately interpreted it this way) that the Republican Party
regards it as one of the least important issues facing the nation,
when in fact the issue goes to the heart of the fundamental purpose
of liberty.

<p>

Just consider the impact of including tolerance language on another
subject, say, taxes:  &quot;We favor tax relief for overworked
Americans, but we recognize that many people disagree with us.&quot;
You would instantly recognize that the party which said this
wasn't serious about cutting taxes.  The same holds true for the
profound question of whether unborn children and their mothers
should be protected from the exploitation of abortions.

<p>

What followed my public criticism of Sen. Dole's proposal was
uncomfortable for both of us.  The senator took me on by name,
and major newspapers were happy to splash the dispute across page
one.  I kept my comments focused on the issues at stake, but it
was an awkward moment for me anyway.  Disputes among friends will
always draw a crowd of spectators.  But this fight, gut-wrenching
as it was, has an upside.  First, I have high hopes that, by the
time you read this, the dispute over the pro-life plank will be
resolved with an agreement that makes it clear that our children
deserve the full protection of the laws of the United States.
Second, this public argument gave me a rare chance to address
the nation on why the sanctity of human life matters so much.

<p>

National Public Radio, as liberal a media outlet as there is,
interviewed me in drive-time, and my comments were carried fairly
and without censorship.  <I>The New York Times</I>, <I>Washington
Post</I> and other major papers accurately reported my defense
of our children.  The following weekend, I was invited to appear
on the prestigious CNN public policy show, <I>The Capital Gang.</I>
I was able to tell large segments of the American people what
our nation's abandonment of the sanctity of human life is doing
to the fabric of our society.  All of this came on the heels of
unprecedented media opportunities for the Family Research Council
(FRC), including appearances on <I>This Week with David Brinkley</I> 
and <I>Face the Nation</I> and a write-up in <I>Time</I> magazine
featuring our principled stands.

<p>

Since all of this happened, I have heard from many people who
say they don't necessarily agree with FRC on every issue, but
that we give them something to think about.  This is vital to
remember.  Where &quot;tolerance&quot; language goes in the Republican
platform -- whether it's there at all -- isn't just a matter of dotting
&quot;i's&quot; and crossing &quot;t's.&quot;  If an issue isn't
important enough to appear in any party's platform, then it's
not worth a national conversation.  How we address the sanctity
of human life will determine whether this nation endures, or whether
it is torn away forever from the ideals that motivated our Founders.

<p>

Let me take a moment here to thank you.  In the middle of this
hot debate, hundreds of you called, wrote and faxed me your support.
Countless friends prayed for my family and for FRC.  Believe
me, we felt that encouragement.

<p>

My relationship with Washington leaders in both parties, including
Bob Dole, matters very much to me.  But the Family Research Council
is committed to speaking the truth:  on the needs of families,
on neglected children, on coarseness in the culture, on the virtue
deficit, and on the violence corroding our common sense of neighborliness.
We will speak the truth in election years and non-election years.
We will speak up when it pleases our friends, and when it doesn't.
To do otherwise would be to convert this organization into just
one more nest of political hired guns in the nation's capital.
I won't have that.  The issues facing America are bigger and
more enduring than one presidential race.

<p>

You will be happy to know, for example, that we are working with
a courageous band of Democrats in Congress who are struggling
to add &quot;tolerance&quot; language to the 1996 Democratic Platform.
This is &quot;tolerance&quot; language we <b><i>can</i></b> support
because it moves in the opposite direction:  it would say that
there is room in the Democratic party for people who champion
the &quot;little guy&quot; in the womb.  Unfortunately, I am not
optimistic about a change in their platform even though 40 percent
of registered Democrats hold pro-life beliefs.  For nearly a decade
now, the party has turned a deaf ear to their pleas.  Instead,
they have allowed radical feminists, the ACLU and gay rights groups
to turn the party into a vehicle for radical social change.

<p>

As I've emphasized many times before, FRC does not endorse candidates,
but we do work diligently to keep the issues affecting America's
families at center stage.  Toward that end, we will work with
anyone, anywhere, who is genuinely willing to espouse family-friendly
public policy.

<p>

While I'm writing to you, let me give you an update on another
&quot;contest&quot; in which I've been involved.  This is the
competition I proposed last January between two visions:  the
big-government philosophy of Hillary Rodham Clinton's book, <I>It
Takes a Village</I>, and the family-centered ideals of my book,
<I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams.</I> This spring, Family Research Council
placed advertisements in newspapers and magazines challenging
the American people to compare the visions in these two books
and to choose the one that best represents their hopes for the
next generation of American children.

<p>

So here are the results to date.  The first lady's publisher
reports that 360,000 copies of <I>It Takes a Village</I> are in
print.  Those figures do not necessarily reflect actual sales.
A similar number of copies of <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> have
now been sold, enough to put this little paperback on the Top
Five list of Christian best-sellers for the past three months.
In short, my competition with Mrs. Clinton is neck-and-neck.

<p>

I realize that this has happened only because thousands of faithful
supporters like you have bought multiple copies of <I>Our Hopes,
Our Dreams</I> and shared them with neighbors, friends, and fellow
believers.  I can hardly ask you to do more.  But consider this:
<I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> was written as a straightforward,
easily understood summary of what has drawn pro-family Americans
into the public policy arena in record numbers.  Can you think
of anyone -- an acquaintance or business associate -- who would benefit
from the couple of hours it takes to read this statement of pro-family
principle?

<p>

If you can, it's easy to use our &quot;800&quot; number to order
<I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> directly from us.  Better still,
however, you can take a step that will aid a vital voice in your
community and help boost the ranking of <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I>
on the best-seller lists.  Visit your local Christian bookstore
and obtain or order a copy there.  Christian booksellers play
an irreplaceable role in spreading the Word, attracting new Christians
and encouraging &quot;old&quot; ones.  Many of these establishments
exist on a shoestring, and they struggle at this time of year.
Please take a moment to drop by and let them know you appreciate
their presence in your community.

<p>

Have a blessed and enjoyable summer (may it be as storm-free
as possible, too!).  From all of us at Family Research Council,
thank you for your support, and God bless you.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. Summers are a great time for families, a time for vacations
and building memories for a lifetime.  The only problem is that
cagey Washington insiders know that grassroots Americans are distracted
from their handling of critical issues. <b><i>This summer, FRC especially
needs your help</i></b>. The Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA) <I>must</I>
be passed before a Hawaiian court acts in August.  The
Partial-Birth Abortion bill <I>must</I> get a powerful vote in
the House this month to override Bill Clinton's veto.  And we
<i>must</i> push for desperately-needed tax relief for families with
children before Congress adjourns for the fall election campaigns.
I hope you will prayerfully consider giving us your financial
support this month.  With your help, I am convinced that we can
stay in the fight and win. Thank you and God bless you.

<center><h2>Revoving Door, from the January 1996 MediaWatch</h2></center>
<h3>If You Can't Boost 'Em...</h3>
<p>
Just weeks after writing a piece for The New Republic denouncing Republican efforts to shut down AmeriCorps, Newsweek Deputy Washington Bureau Chief Steven Waldman decided he could do more good helping run the government program than he could as an external advocate. In mid-January he became senior adviser for policy planning and evaluation for former Senator Harris Wofford (D-Penn.), the new Chief Executive Officer of the Corporation for National Service, overseer of AmeriCorps and VISTA. 
<p>
Waldman "explained that the program's recent change in leadership convinced him that the move would be ethical even though he's written extensively about the program," National Journal reported.
<p>
"Republican attacks on AmeriCorps have been bizarrely hyperbolic," Waldman charged in the November 13 New Republic. "The GOP has also practiced gross statistics-abuse in order to portray AmeriCorps, inaccurately, as a boondoggle." He predicted that "when Republicans calm down and start picking bits of safety net from their teeth, they will undoubtedly feel silly. They will realize that AmeriCorps -- which gives college scholarships to young men and women who do full-time community service -- was the solution to their dilemma of how to dismantle the welfare state without seeming cruel."
<p>
Earlier in 1995 Waldman, part of Newsweek's Washington bureau since 1987, wrote The Bill, a book detailing the creation of AmeriCorps. It grew out of a "behind-the-scenes" look at the program for the September 20, 1993 Newsweek, in which he concluded: "John F. Kennedy attracted to his Peace Corps a narrow group of mostly white, well-educated Americans. Clinton's plan is far more ambitious, seeking to regenerate fragmented American communities and break down rock-hard barriers of the heart. Because Clinton must confront the emotional issues of race and class, he is more likely to fail. But should he succeed, Clinton will have accomplished something far more significant than his hero ever did."
<p>
AmeriCorps is hardly the only area in which Waldman has been a liberal advocate. He co-authored a September 19, 1994 piece headlined, "The Lost Chance" with the subhead, "The Clintons: Newsweek reveals how they set out to reform a broken health care system -- and squandered a historic opportunity." One impediment: those who spent money "on blatantly untrue advertisements meant to scare the public."
<p>
A few issues later his byline accompanied a story on the Contract with America: "The problem is that the Contract's main idea has already been tried and discredited. House Republicans are now pledged to tax cuts, increased defense spending, and a constitutional amendment to balance the budget. Sound familiar? `This was a dopey political move,' [Rep. Fred] Grandy says. `We were holding the high ground on welfare, foreign policy, so why would we go back and shoosh down the Laffer Curve? This is like giving the Democrats a nuclear weapon.'" 
<p>

<h3>Being Frank</h3>
<p>
A CNN veteran is the new Deputy Press Secretary to Senator Frank Lautenberg. Ken Jaques, an off-air reporter in the CNN political unit from 1992 to 1994, has come aboard the New Jersey Democrat's staff, Roll Call reported December 21.

Early in 1995, Miss Marshall joined the Family Research Council's 
public policy team to contribute her research skills and experience 
in the field of welfare. Her responsibilities as policy analyst 
include tracking, analyzing, and writing about proposed legislation 
on welfare reform. In addition, her analysis and research benefit 
FRC in educating key decision makers in the U.S. Congress and at the 
grass roots nation-wide.

<p>

Through her studies at Rice University, in various internships 
throughout her undergraduate experience, and most recently, at the 
American Enterprise Institute with Charles Murray, Marshall has 
developed a keen understanding of compassionate welfare reform and 
school choice as well as a familiarity with the U.S. Congress and 
the formulation of public policy. 

<p>

Miss Marshall began her career in Washington as an intern in the 
Office of Congressman Tom DeLay in the summer months of 1990 and 
1991. In 1992, she served an extended internship in the White 
House Office of Political Affairs during the critical months of 
the campaign. She moved on to work in the Office of the Deputy 
Convention Manager at the 1992 Republican National Convention, with 
particular responsibility for caucus teams. Since then, she has worked 
in the Houston office of George Bush and, in 1993, in the office of 
the Deputy Executive Director at the National Republican Senatorial 
Committee.

<p>

Through the years, she has volunteered time for local Republican 
party activities and campaigns, both local and Presidential. Her 
campaign experience includes a stint as opposition research 
coordinator for a Congressional candidate in Houston. 

<p>

Native of Texas, Marshall graduated <I>Summa Cum Laude</I> from Rice 
University in 1994 with majors in Policy Studies and English. She is 
a member of Phi Beta Kappa and Rice Fellow.

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In Philadelphia, federal judge Norma Shapiro prevents judges from detaining many violent defendants before trial by prohibiting them from considering a defendant's prior criminal record, mental-health history, or drug dependency. The federal court also refuses to allow any pre-trial detention for such "non-violent" crimes as stalking, carjacking, robbery with a baseball bat, burglary, drug dealing, vehicular homicide, manslaughter, terrorist threats, and weapons violations. State and local judges in Philadelphia are prohibited from forcing defendants to appear at trial, and the city now has 50,000 fugitives from justice. Instead of being in jail, these individuals have gone on to commit numerous other crimes. Between 1994 and June 1995, Philadelphia police rearrested 9,732 of these criminals (previously released under federal court orders) for 79 murders, 959 robberies, 2,215 drug deals, 701 burglaries, 2,748 thefts, 90 rapes, 14 kidnapping charges, 1,113 assaults, 264 gun-law violations, and 127 drunk-driving incidents.

<center><b>THE TOP FIVE REGULATORY RECOMMENDATIONS FROM THE 1995 WHITE HOUSE CONFERENCE ON SMALL BUSINESS</b></center><ul>
<p><li><b>Congress should amend the Regulatory Flexibility Act,</b> making it applicable to all federal agencies, including the Internal Revenue Service and the Department of Defense, to include cost-benefit analysis; grant judicial review of regulations; require small business representation; and require the use of negotiated rulemaking with small business representation.
<p><li><b>Congress should reform the Comprehensive Environmental Response,</b> Compensation and Liability Act (CERCLA) to apply prospectively as well as retrospectively to clean up sites. This includes eliminating retroactive and strict liability prior to January 1, 1987; and requiring sound science and realistic risk assessments to assess health and environmental hazards.
<p><li><b>Congress shall mandate a complete review of current laws and regulations relating to public health and safety,</b> such as the Resource Conservation and Recovery Act, the Clean Water Act, the Clean Air Act, the Endangered Species Act, and the National Environmental Policy Act.
<p><li><b>Congress and the President should propose and enact legislation that reforms civil justice and product liability legislation</b> that include: 1) returning to a fault-based standard of liability; 2) eliminating joint and several liability; 3) limiting non-economic damages to three times the economic damages or $250,000 which ever is greater; and 4) providing for periodic, instead of lump sum payments for future medical or lost income.
<p><li><b>Congress shall enact legislation and appropriate enforcement</b> that includes: 1) requiring that all agencies provide a cooperative/consulting regulatory environment; 2) requiring that fines take into consideration the severity of the infraction; 3) requiring that regulatory agencies put the fines that they impose and collect into the general treasury fund to be used toward retiring the national debt; and 4) requiring that enforcement actions comply with American due process concepts.

<h2>MRC Membership</h2></center>
Membership in the Media Research Center is a tax-deductible contribution of $20 per year. <BR>
<P>


Currently, we are offering <B>FREE</B> Membership Sign-up to inform as many people as possible about the 

media's assault on conservatives and conservative issues. <BR>
<P>


The $20 annual membership contribution is purely optional. If you include your Visa or Mastercard  

number for a contribution to the MRC, we will promptly send you a note that we are in receipt of your 

generous contribution. <BR>

<A HREF="/townhall/FRC/insight/is95c2dr.html">Legalization of Drugs: 
The Myths and The Facts</a>: an article by Robert L. Maginnis

<p>

After a distinguished career in the U.S. military, Lieutenant 
Colonel Robert (Bob) L. Maginnis, USA Ret., joined the Family 
Research Council in 1994 to handle one of the most difficult 
social problems facing American society and American families 
today -- the crisis of crime.  In addition, Colonel Maginnis' 
skills as an analyst, writer, speaker and team leader will be 
applied to family issues impacted by military/foreign affairs 
policy and cultural issues. Already nationally known as an expert 
on the Pentagon and a spokesman on military issues, Colonel 
Maginnis brings to FRC a broad perspective on today's toughest 
issues.

<p>

In his many roles, Colonel Maginnis has appeared on ABC, NBC and 
CBS evening news shows, CBS "This Morning," "The MacNeil/Lehrer 
Newshour," CNBC "Cal Thomas," CNN's "Crossfire" and "Larry King 
Live" as well as other programs, such as "Donohue," and on numerous 
networks.  He has been quoted many times in newspapers across the 
country from the <I>New York Times</I> to the <I>LA Times</I>.  
His editorial pieces have been published in the <I>Washington 
Times, Orange County Register, Chicago Tribune, The Miami Herald</I> 
and elsewhere. And the colonel has been featured on most major radio 
shows nationwide.

<p>

In July 1993, Colonel Maginnis retired from an assignment in 
the Pentagon where he served as an Inspector General.  He is 
an airborne-ranger infantry officer with an assignment history 
that includes Korea, Germany, Alaska, and several posts in the 
continental United States.  He served in command and staff 
positions in four infantry divisions from platoon to division 
level.  The colonel was the chief for the U.S. Army Infantry 
School's leadership training branch.  He developed curricula, 
taught, participated in leader development research and consulted 
with leaders and soldiers throughout the Army. He is the author of 
more than fifty articles published in professional military 
journals concerning ethics, leadership, and personnel matters 
impacting the military.

<p>

In the last eight months of his military service, Colonel Maginnis 
was a member of the Army's study group examining the homosexual 
ban.  He also was advisor to the Defense Department Military 
Working Group on homosexuals in the military.  In that role, he 
debated the issue in the media as well as speaking in various forums 
-- including testifying before a House subcommittee. Because of his 
expertise, Colonel Maginnis is also, on occasion, a spokesman for 
the Defense Readiness Council, a non-profit organization that led 
the fight to keep the homosexual ban.

<p>

Colonel Maginnis' service in the armed forces was commended with 
the Legion of Merit, the highest peacetime decoration, as well as 
with five meritorious medals and four commendations. Among his over 
fifty letters of commendation is one from former President Jimmy 
Carter who honored the colonel for inventing a laser training 
device, at great savings to the armed forces.

<p>

Colonel Maginnis received his B.S. from the United States Military 
Academy, West Point, New York in 1973 and a M.S. from the Naval 
Postgraduate School, Monterey, California, in 1983.  He is also 
a graduate of many military schools, including the Command and 
General Staff College.

<p>

Long active in his community and in many organizations, the colonel 
now coordinates his church's participation in homeless shelters. 
He, his wife and two children live in Northern Virginia.

<a name="chicken">CHICKEN LITTLE IN REVERSE</a>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
The bad news to the contrary notwithstanding, a small group of educators who are getting increasingly favorable play in the media are beginning to argue that the bad news is not bad news at all -- what is bad are the people (mostly conservatives) who report the bad news. A full-length book devoted to this subject, The Manufactured Crisis, was reviewed by the New York Times as though it were accurate (suggesting that even Times reviewers do not always read the books they are asked to review).
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
On December 22, 1995, The Washington Post ran an op-ed, "US Students: Better Than Ever." Author Gerald A. Bracey, a professional critic of the critics, argues that things have never been better, that "scores on many commercial achievement tests" and "the proportion of students scoring above 650 on the SAT mathematics test (on the old scale)" are "at an all time high." He does not tell the reader that commercial achievement test scores are the classic example of the "Lake Woebegone effect," named for Garrison Keillor's mythical town where the "children are all above average." Nor does he tell the reader who is pushing the SAT math scores higher (mostly Asian and Asian-American students). The real issue, of course, is not whether scores are higher or lower, but whether they are high enough. To say that higher is better is no different from saying that a 1970 Ford is better than a 1950 Ford; it may be true, but it is irrelevant.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
No responsible educator or policy analyst believes that today's academic performance is good enough. Indeed, the sharpest critic of American academic performance is none other than Albert Shanker, president of the American Federation of Teachers. Candidates for public office should not be fooled by fatuous assertions that test scores are "climbing" or that "kids today know more than kids did a generation ago." The problem is they still do not know enough. Today there is much more to know, which is all the more reason to demand more of the system.

<p>

<a name="anyone"> ANYONE WHO SUPPORTS SCHOOL DISCIPLINE AND HIGH ACADEMIC STANDARDS CAN'T BE ALL BAD </a>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Albert Shanker, President of the American Federation of Teachers, has launched the AFT on a high-profile national campaign in support of high academic standards for all children and school discipline, primarily to protect the integrity of the learning environment. According to recent surveys and analyses by the Public Agenda Foundation, most Americans support straightforward academic standards and discipline. They believe increasingly that the problem is not in "somebody else's school" but in the school their children attend.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Incredibly, other elements of the education establishment not only refuse to support Shanker, but actively oppose him and the AFT program. The Council of Great City Schools sent a letter to Shanker denouncing his program, asserting that members would not support such initiatives in their districts and arguing that "if these concepts are the unpinning's of educational [sic] reform... we seriously doubt that the national education goals will ever be met." According to Teacher Magazine, Shanker said the letter is "a justification of the current, failing system," adding that "the reasoning embodied in this letter is exactly what has given us school systems where children fear to come to school." The AFT deserves to be criticized for its position on school choice but should be commended for its position on discipline and standards.
<p>

<a name="isthe">IS THE EDUCATION CRISIS A FRAUD?</a>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<I>"A small group of outraged revisionists charges that a cabal of highly placed conservative leaders has conspired, with the help of the media, to destroy America's public schools."</I>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Thus opens the lead article on a new book, <I>The Manufactured Crisis,</I> by David Berliner and Bruce Biddle in <I>Teacher Magazine</i> for November-December 1995. The article shows why modern education is in so much trouble. It has been taken over by people like Berliner and Biddle, who apparently cannot think, write, or even develop a convincing conspiracy theory.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Berliner and Biddle charge that former U.S. Secretary of Education William Bennet and former Assistant Secretaries Chester E. Finn and Diane Ravitch, among others, have conspired to defame and ruin American public education through "organized malevolence." Such charges utterly trivialize a serious and well-intentioned debate by trying to demonize serious reformers. The book embodies a major irony, too subtle to be apprehended by its authors: As Ron Wolk, editor and publisher of <I>Teacher Magazine,</I> notes, "By defending the present system against an imaginary conspiracy and demolishing straw men they created, Berliner and Biddle distract attention from the central question ... and may make it harder to bring about the fundamental change needed if the system is to survive."

<a name="vouchers">VOUCHERS IN MILWAUKEE</a>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Milwaukee is the home of a nationally recognized voucher plan for low-income children. Spearheaded in 1990 by State Representative Annette "Polly" Williams, a Democrat, and signed into law by Governor Tommy Thompson, a Republican, the plan permits up to 1,000 low-income Milwaukee students to use an annually adjusted amount ($2,967 for the 1994-1995 school year) in state funds to attend a private, non-sectarian school of their parents' choice. The Milwaukee program began operation during the fall of 1990 with 300 children using vouchers at 6 private schools. In 1994, the program expanded to 832 students attending one of 11 participating private schools.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	In response to an August 25, 1995, Wisconsin State Supreme Court injunction halting Governor Thompson's expansion of the Milwaukee Parental Choice Program to include religious schools, residents of Wisconsin donated more than $1.4 million, as of September 22, 1995, to help give the children of Milwaukee the ability to stay in the private schools chosen by their parents. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The campaign to keep these children in school was led by Partners Advancing Values in Education, Milwaukee's privately funded scholarship program. Of the $1.4 million raised for the fund, $1 million came from the Bradley Foundation in Milwaukee and $75,000 was donated by the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The court's ruling left more than 2,300 children stranded after they already had signed up for classes in religious schools. They await the court's final ruling on the lawsuit that brought on the injunction, which was backed by the state and local teachers' unions and the American Civil Liberties Union.


<p>
<a name="charter">A CHARTER SCHOOL IN ACTION</a>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Yvonne Chan, founder of the Vaughn Street Next Century Learning Center in Los Angeles, runs one of the most promising charter schools in the nation. Once part of the burdensome bureaucracy of the Los Angeles City Unified School District, the old Vaughn Street School won a $750,000, three-year, RJR Nabisco Next Century School Award five years ago. Thus empowered to act independently, Chan began significantly improving the education of her students and drawing the community into the life of the school. In 1994, Vaughn Street enjoyed a $1.2 million "windfall," the administrative overhead that the central office-HQ used to claim. The per-pupil allotment now goes directly to Vaughn Street, which spends the money on program improvement.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;One of Chan's most dramatic accomplishments was the removal of a crack house next to her playground. Before Vaughn Street became a charter school, all Chan could do was call the police. Dealer and users would scatter, only to return within hours. As head of a charter school, Chan was able to buy the crack house, and, with the PTA's approval, hire a bulldozer and level it one Saturday afternoon. She plans to extend the playground into the newly vacant lot.

BADEN </P><P>           CLINTON'S appointments of two strong environmentalists to the posts of secretary of the interior and administrator of EPA have alarmed many business leaders. But the choices of Bruce Babbitt and Carol Browner for these key environmental positions accurately reflect the &quot;greening of America.&quot; They reconfirm the practical necessity for business to act in environmentally sensitive ways.</P><P>       Clinton and Gore's environmental moves signify a definitive break with the tradition of resource development. While there may be a more kind and gentle future for America's bears and bunnies, the businesses upon which our prosperity depends can expect more stringent environmental standards.</P><P>       An important new mission for business is to demonstrate how this greening of America can coexist with increasing efficiency and productivity.</P><P>     This challenge is especially critical to the Northwest. Here in America's  &quot;ecotopia&quot; the conflicts between economy and ecology are pronounced. The economies of the Northwest developed when culture and institutions were oriented toward resource exploitation. Our history is largely a story of damming, logging, mining and ranching. Yet more than any other region, the Northwest is home of the environmentally conscious.</P><P>     With our mix of resource-based industries, changing the environmental behavior of business is neither costless nor smooth. Environmentalists have a vital stake in a successful transition, for if our businesses are not able to adapt to the new standards, we will lose the standard of living upon which our willingness and ability to pay for environmental quality depends.</P><P>     Economist Don Coursey has pointed out that in the United States and other  developed nations, when the income of a state or community rises by 10 percent, its willingness to pay for environmental quality rises by 25 percent. And if a state's income falls 10 percent, this willingness to pay drops by 25 percent. On the basis of this comparative data, we can expect relatively prosperous regions to place greater emphasis on the health of the environment.</P><P>     How can we preserve the environment while continuing the economic progress that fosters environmental quality? One important key lies in preparing tomorrow's business leaders to be environmental managers. Harry E. Teasley, president and CEO of Coca-Cola/Nestle International has noted &quot;After 20 years of interviewing MBAs, I have concluded that most are well trained in the functional areas of finance, accounting and  marketing. These same students, however, have only a superficial or topical understanding of the relationship of business with the environment, the market economy, and public policy.&quot;</P><P>       The University of Washington addresses this problem with a new program to train future decision-makers attending the School of Business. The Environmental Management (EM) Program for MBA students, was established by people who anticipated that the environment would be a high priority on the national agenda and who understand the link between prosperity, environmental concern, and the ability to effectively address this concern.</P><P>     Major universities scattered throughout the United States are developing environmental MBA programs. What makes the University of Washington's effort unique is its emphasis upon market incentives and entrepreneurial innovations.</P><P>        As Dean Leventhal of the Business School notes, &quot;The environmental courses in most business schools are often taught by people who identify with the corporate guilt/social responsibility/command-and-control schools of thought. While we fully consider regulatory approaches to environmental management, our EM Program stresses property rights and market incentives as keys to harmonizing business and the environment.&quot;</P><P>       According to Professor Jonathan Karpoff, Director of the EM Program, the curriculum is built on three intellectual perspectives:</P><P>       --  The &quot;tragedy of the commons,&quot; made famous by ecologist Garrett Hardin, applies to many of today's environmental problems, such as atmospheric pollution;</P><P>     --  The prosperity that comes from successful, productive businesses fosters the achievement of environmental goals;</P><P>     --  Successful environmental policy must include not only regulation, but also market-oriented incentive-based approaches, such as the use of tradeable permits to curb pollution.</P><P>     Sue Mecklenburg, associate director of the EM Program, explains that it &quot;is designed to teach students how to use the current knowledge of environmental concerns to make better business decisions for both their company and the world. And this July, a week-long seminar at the University of Washington will give today's business executives an overview of environmental management principles.</P><P>     Vice president-elect Gore's book, Earth in the Balance, previews the new political climate under which businesses must operate. Fortunately, some politicians are beginning to understand environmental economics; specifically that environmental concern and the ability to effectively address that concern are dependent upon prosperity.</P><P> ____________</P><P> John A. Baden, Ph.D., is chairman of the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment (FREE) and teaches in the environmental MBA program of the University of Washington Business School.

<center><h2>Study, from the January 1996 MediaWatch</h2></center>
<p>
<h3>Networks Mourn Victims of Second Shutdown, Single Out Republicans for Blame<br>
Same Liberal Song, Second Verse</h3>
<p>
As a second partial government shutdown descended on Washington, network coverage once again favored President Clinton's arguments  over those of House Republicans. Last month, MediaWatch examined coverage during the November 13-20 shutdown and found not a single story noted how much more than the GOP  Clinton wanted to spend. No story questioned his rhetoric about "destroying" Medicare even though the GOP plan called for hikes. Reporters conveyed the Democratic spin about the disastrous impact upon federal workers and the public.
<p>
As a new budget impasse began in mid-December, MediaWatch analysts reviewed all 131 budget-related stories on evening newscasts (ABC's World News Tonight, CBS Evening News, NBC Nightly News, and CNN's World News) from the evening before the shutdown (December 14) through the day it ended (January 5).
<p>
After President Clinton vetoed several spending bills, not one story blamed Clinton for the shutdown, but nearly two dozen declared the GOP culpable. Furloughed workers and other "victims" were featured in half the stories while no story explored the "Washington Monument" stategy or the financial boost offered by a balanced budget.
<p>
Blame. To fund the government, Congress passes appropriation bills which the President must then sign. Clinton vetoed spending bills on December 18 and 19 that would have kept open six cabinet departments. But on the question of who caused the shutdown, reporters exclusively pointed a finger at the Republicans. In the 48 stories in which reporters allocated blame, 23 assigned blame to the Republicans, but not one held Clinton culpable (25 blamed both).
<p>
On December 16, when the government's temporary spending authority ran out, Bob Schieffer led off the CBS Evening News like a disappointed father: "Well, they've done it again. Nine days from Christmas, Republicans have forced another partial shutdown of the government because they cannot come to an agreement with the White House on how to balance the budget." The next night, ABC's Jerry King also blamed the GOP. "There's no indication from House Republicans, whose budget-cutting zeal started all of this, that they are ready, Christmas season or not, to end it."
<p>
During the negotiations that followed the vetoes, reporters repeatedly blamed Republicans for not compromising. On December 23 CNN's Wolf Blitzer pined for an earlier time: "In the old days, the two sides would simply have split the differences, but House Republicans say they are proud to be revolutionaries...From the White House perspective there's still one very big wild card: the most militant House Republicans say they're in no mood to compromise. The question remains whether Speaker Gingrich can reign them in, or wants to."
<p>
Even as Clinton delayed agreement by breaking his promises to release a seven-year balanced budget, the networks still blamed the GOP. ABC's Peter Jennings intoned on January 4, "We begin in Washington tonight, where the Republicans and the Clinton administration may be inching their way towards a partial resolution of the government shutdown. President Clinton and the Republican leaders in Congress have been meeting almost daily this week, but today the Republicans apparently felt the need to reassess their position, which has kept a quarter of a million government employees off the job."
<p>
Spending. None of the 131 stories compared the higher levels of spending both sides proposed. Only two mentioned the levels of spending in the President's plan or the Republican plan, one coming not in a news story, but in a CBS commentary by Joe Klein.
<p>
Federal Workers. Only 280,000 workers were placed on furlough, just 15 percent of the work force. Still, the media focused on the issue in nearly half the stories (62), while only three reports focused on overburdened taxpayers. ABC's John Martin examined those angry at the de facto paid vacation on December 18: "This time government workers have an added worry -- Congress has been hearing from people who do not want to pay furloughed workers as they were paid after last month's shutdown."
<p>
"Victims." Sixty-seven of 131 stories mentioned a victim of the shutdown. Thirty stories called attention to families being turned away from National Parks or Smithsonian Museums. On December 22, CBS looked at how the stalemate canceled a re-creation of an Olde English Christmas banquet. John Blackstone reported, "For thousands of people, a Christmas dream is a traditional Christmas in Yosemite National Park. But the budget stalemate has closed the park gates and Yosemite's old fashioned Christmas is slipping away....The valley has somehow been drained of a seasonal joy it's known for almost 70 years." Although not by a reporter, in this story both sides were blamed as one of the participants wrote a poem about the cancellation in which she referred to Newt Gingrich as "slimebucket" and Clinton as "sleaze."
<p>
"Washington Monument." Not one report brought up the "Washington Monument" game being played when high profile services, like national parks and passport offices are closed in order to maximize inconvenience. No report questioned why these services were stopped even though, as The Wall Street Journal found, one-third of the federal workers at the Interior Department and two-thirds of State Department employees were considered essential and thus were on the job. 
<p>
Upside to the Shutdown. If you relied exclusively on the evening news, you would never have thought there was an upside to the shutdown. Only twice did a report call attention to a positive effect of the shutdown. Both were on CNN and dealt with the airline ticket tax expiring at the end of 1995. Anchor Linden Soles announced on January 1, "Washington's budget battle has reaped a windfall for air travelers," saving these travelers $12 million a day. But NBC anchor Brian Williams saw just the opposite the same day: "We have this footnote to the mess here in Washington tonight, because of it a tax on domestic airline tickets expired at midnight so while the budget negotiators are arguing about the best way to save money, the government is actually losing money."
<p>
Similarly, never mentioned were the benefits of a balanced budget. The Washington Post reported January 4 that experts estimated a balanced budget would give $1,000 annually to families through lower interest rates.  
<p>
For years, the media have complained about politicians ducking the tough issues; debating slogans, not substance. Finally, a substantive policy dispute presents itself. Unfortunately, the media aren't able to overcome their biases and look beyond the very bumper sticker politics they formerly decried.

<P>

<b>AN EXAMPLE OF THE BREAKDOWN OF SOCIAL INSTITUTIONS: WASHINGTON, D.C.</b>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Because Washington, D.C., is a unit on which federal statistics are available, and because of the city's out-of-wedlock birth rate with all its concomitant costs and effects, it already illustrates where the rest of the country is heading. These statistics -- some of the best available on any of America's urban areas -- dramatically illustrate the breakdown of our social institutions.
<p><b>Illegitimacy:</b><ul>
<li>In 1990, the percent of births to unmarried women in Washington, D.C., ranked as the very highest in the nation -- 64.9 percent of all births, 25 percentage points higher than Mississippi's second highest ranking of 40.5 percent.
<p><li>In 1990, the percent of births to teenage mothers in Washington ranked as fourth in the nation -- 17.8 percent of all births. For the highest-ranking state, Mississippi, the figure was 21.3 percent.
</ul><p><b>Abortion:</b>
<p><li>In 1988, the abortion ratio -- the number of abortions per 1,000 live births -- in Washington, D.C., was 1,248, the highest in the nation. In the second-highest state, New York, the number was significantly lower: 629 abortions per 1,000 live births.
</ul><p><b>Infant mortality:</b><ul>
<li>In 1990, the infant mortality rate in Washington, D.C., was the highest in the nation: 20.7.</ul><p>
<b>School performance:</b><ul>
<li>Per pupil public primary and secondary education expenditures: $8,057 - Rank: 2
<p><li>Pupil to teacher ratio: 14.4 to 1 - Rank: 1
<p><li>High school graduations: 60.2 - Rank: 49th out of 51
<p><li>SAT combined scores: 849 - Rank: 49th out of 51
</ul><p><b>Poverty:</b><ul>

&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Nothing illustrates the nature of the breakdown of communities better than a story from Mrs. Elayne Bennett, who runs a very successful program for young girls in the poorer part of Washington D.C., that helps them get their lives on track and avoid teen pregnancy. One of the young women working in her organization, Best Friends, was being courted by a good young man. Mrs. Bennett was looking forward to the wedding so that the girls could be invited to the church. None of them had ever seen a wedding. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	With illegitimacy rates so high for so long, a high proportion of the District of Columbia's young men have no fathers at home, or grandfathers at their grandmother's home. The boys have no real men in their lives. It is no wonder they end up in jail and out of work. The same story is repeated in all of America's major urban centers.

Dear Friend:

<p>

A few weeks ago Carol and I drove our oldest daughter, Elyse,
back to college for her second year of studies.  It was wonderful
to have her home for the summer, and saying good-bye was really
hard.  The summer months flew by, reminding us once more how precious
is the time that we have together as a family.  Even though Elyse
attends college only a few hours' drive from our home outside
Washington, D.C. -- close enough for us to see her on some weekends -- 
she's still much farther away than we would prefer.

<p>

Millions of families go through this emotional ritual each September,
and it doesn't really matter that much whether your child is heading
off to college, high school, or to a nearby elementary school
classroom.  Each fall mothers and fathers face the same anxieties
and pressures:  how will my children fare in school?  Will their
teachers recognize their special qualities?  Will teachers honor
and respect their talents and beliefs or will they try to convince
them to &quot;question authority&quot; and reject the values they
have been taught?  What about their classmates?  Will they make
friends?  Will those friends help uphold their faith?  Or will
their faith be weakened?  Or worse, will our children be lead
into trouble?  Is there anyone out there besides us who really
understands the worth of our beloved children?

<p>

Today, questions like these are being asked by every parent and
they unfortunately have a special sharpness to them.  Many of
our nation's schools are no longer the &quot;common ground&quot;
of shared values and aspirations that generations of families
counted on them to be in the past. All too often, today's classrooms
are laboratories for radical ideological experimentation. The
teaching profession has been politicized as never before. Textbooks
and lesson plans routinely foster a liberal world view. Attempts
to isolate, intimidate and confuse religiously inclined students
continue. Violence and illegal drugs are found even in elementary
schools. The &quot;safe sex&quot; philosophy still dominates
sex education.

<p>

I'm sure you're familiar with the statistics on educational decline,
so I won't repeat them here.  The public education establishment
routinely goes out of its way to question the depth of the problem,
but, in the same breath, rushes to endorse the latest reform plan,
a tacit admission that our schools are falling short.  Let me
be especially clear here:  many, if not most, of our teachers
are dedicated educators who are motivated by a love of learning
and of children.  Many, if not most, are disturbed by the same
education fads that distress parents.  Like parents, these teachers
are ill-served by education leaders who are constantly reinventing
the wheel and interfering with what works in real classrooms.

<p>

In fact, the education policy debate of the last few years has
been dominated by the <I>illusion</I> of reform. With every fiber
of their being, the leadership of the nation's massive teachers'
unions, the National Education Association (2.2 million members)
and the American Federation of Teachers (900,000), have opposed
nearly every change in the way our schools are financed and operated.

<p>

Bogus education reform schemes come and go.  Many of them have
impressive-sounding names and a stellar line-up of sponsors.
Desperate for signs of improvement that will give their children
hope, parents are sold various reform packages under such brand
names as Outcome-Based Education, Goals 2000, character education,
mandatory voluntarism, New American Schools and restructuring.
These schemes have different details, but they have at least
two omissions in common:  they leave the basic method of funding
public education untouched, and they leave parents at the margin
of education decision-making.

<p>

The Family Research Council (FRC) is keenly aware of the concerns
expressed by America's families about education, and we are dedicated
to reversing these omissions.  We want parents to control their
education dollars.  We believe that the same hands that rock the
cradle, smooth the fevered brow, set the table, and clothe the
child should direct the funds that educate the child.  The centerpiece
of our campaign for education reform is massive tax relief for
families with children, coupled with genuine parental choice policies
that enable parents to select the school their children will attend.

<p>

Today, more than ever before, I am optimistic about our chances
for success.  School choice plans are gaining momentum and making
headway.  A new study by Harvard's Paul Peterson and Jay P. Greene
at the University of Houston shows that the City of Milwaukee's
parental choice plan has resulted in real academic gains for the
children enrolled in the program.  In August, state courts in
Ohio upheld the constitutionality of a school choice program that
includes religious schools.  Tax credits for families with children
will now be a centerpiece of this year's election debate.

<p>

Most importantly, I'm encouraged that, in the true spirit of
America, parents are not waiting for politicians to respond to
their needs.  They are moving in pioneering numbers to options
like homeschooling, classical education and parent-based education,
which are not so much novelties as rediscoveries of the art of
family-centered teaching and learning.  At the center of all of
this is spiritual renewal, the faith that moves mountains.

<p>

With all of the forces at work in today's education debate, FRC
has developed the <I>Moms' and Dads' School Survival Guide</I>.
This 64-page booklet is packed with resources to help you through
the coming school year.  Between its covers you'll find:

<p><ul>

<li>A glossary of education jargon -- what do the fancy terms 
<I>really</I> mean?

<p>

<li>Feature articles on major topics like Outcome-Based Education,
the religious rights of students, and parental rights in today's
schools.

<p>

<li>Addresses and phone numbers of key resources for homeschooling
and classical education.

<p>

<li>A reference section containing everything from newsletter sources
to web sites dealing with education issues.

</ul><p>

Our <I>Survival Guide</I> is designed to put a wealth of helpful
information at your fingertips.  It's yours for a donation of
any amount -- please use the enclosed reply card to order your copy

<p>

I had intended this letter to deal solely with education issues,
but drug abuse and educational failure feed off one another.
There is no way to dismiss the disturbing statistics: in the
war against teenage drug abuse, America is in full retreat. A
new federal survey shows that teen drug use has risen 105 percent
since 1992.  The sharp increases span every form of illegal drug.
Use of LSD and other hallucinogens is up 183 percent; cocaine
use, 166 percent (from 1994 to 1995 alone); marijuana, 105 percent.
One of every 10 teenagers has used an illegal drug in the past
month.

<p>

The tragedy here is that these numbers come after a decade of
progress.  By 1992, teen drug use had been driven to its lowest
point in decades.  The reason for that progress was and is easy
to understand. Our nation's policy was direct -- and repeated over
and over again in every forum where young people gather.  It said:
&quot;Drug abuse is wrong, dangerous, and stupid.&quot;  But
then, following a change in the Oval Office, we changed course.

<p>

The flow of anti-drug messages from our nation's capital dried
up.  The Clinton administration cut the office of National Drug
Control Policy some 83 percent.  MTV, and even the networks, began
to produce material that winked at the drug threat, or openly
declared the war on drugs a failure. Leaders in Congress turned
their attention to other issues. Treatment funds were reduced,
and &quot;civil libertarians&quot; ratcheted up their pressure
on highly effective social agencies like Teen Challenge that use
faith-based messages to help teenagers and young adults kick the
habit.

<p>

Let me say something here about the liberal versus conservative
debate about the treatment versus law enforcement approaches to
drug abuse.  In fact, let me say one word about it -- it is a 
<I>fallacy.</I> Both approaches are needed.  Drug abusers need treatment
if they are to re-enter society as productive citizens.  But the
truth is that even the best treatment programs are only partially
successful. Preventing the abuser from taking that first hit,
snort, or injection is crucial.

<p>

Who would propose that we eliminate hospital emergency rooms
to treat automobile accident victims?  No one, of course.  Then
again, who would argue that we eliminate speed limits, safety
belts, guard rails, and the like because, after all, we have emergency
rooms? But that's precisely what advocates of drug legalization
argue! Remember when then-Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders suggested
that problems like crime would be reduced if America legalized
drug use, saying it was time to study this option and rely on
treatment rather than law enforcement?

<p>

Elders, thankfully, is gone, but the legacy of permissiveness
she represented is reflected in what is happening now to our youth.
Last month, my senior adviser for drug issues, retired Army Lieutenant
Colonel Bob Maginnis, met with General Barry McCaffrey, President
Clinton's drug czar.  Gen. McCaffrey is a dedicated man, but he
has his work cut out for him.  FRC offered the general our heartfelt
support and suggested various ways to recapture the initiative.
New efforts to control the flow of drugs through Mexico and out
of Colombia are especially needed.

<p>

Again, we must not settle for illusion.  Attempting to treat
an ever-rising wave of drug-abusing youth will destroy our economy
and bankrupt this nation -- and, worst of all, waste the potential
of thousands of our children. Attempting to reform education
without putting parents back at the center of school decision-making
is doomed to fail as well. As always, on both of these issues,
FRC will continue to fight for the home truths that really matter:
we will work with legislators, government officials -- anyone of
goodwill, regardless of party -- who recognizes the need to strengthen
our education system and to gird our children against the sex-and-drug
culture.

<p>

We would really like to hear from you this month.  Your financial
gifts to FRC provide the lifeblood that enables us to advance
the pro-family cause.  Your prayers and involvement are essential,
too.  The cards and letters we receive provide a tremendous lift
to me and the entire FRC staff.  Because the work we do is both
draining and difficult, being able to associate names and faces
with the cause we are advancing makes our efforts all the more
meaningful.

<p>

Once again, thank you for your faithfulness.  As we continue
to work together, we can move closer to our hope and dream of
family renewal in our beloved nation.

<p>

Sincerely,

<p><br>

Gary L. Bauer<br>
President

<p>

P.S. As our <I>Survival Guide</I> illustrates, FRC is constantly
developing new materials that make the case for family values.
Let me close by mentioning another resource that you've helped
to make a household word: <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams.</I> This
companion book to the family values debate of 1996 has now reached
a total distribution of nearly 400,000 copies.

<p>

I conceived <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> as a vision for a pro-family
future -- a book that would make the case for our cause to a cross-section
of the American public. Earlier this year, FRC took out paid
advertising posing a challenge to Hillary Rodham Clinton, who
had just released her book, <I>It Takes a Village.</I> We asked
the American people to choose between the alternative visions
represented by these books.  I'm pleased to report that, thanks
to support like yours, <I>Our Hopes, Our Dreams</I> has held its
own in this contest of visions.

<p>

Our original goal was to distribute 1,000,000 copies of <I>Our
Hopes, Our Dreams,</I> and to get them into the hands of people
who may not know just how much today's cultural clash over the
family means to them. If you can help us make one last push to
reach this goal and to spread the pro-family message, please take
this opportunity to do so. The enclosed card has all the information
you need.

<P>
<H2>Public Relations: Popularizing Conservative Ideas</H2>
<P>
 <HR>
<P>
 An integral part of  The Heritage Foundation's marketing program,
the Public Relations Department has as its mandate to popularize
and legitimize Heritage policy prescriptions and the broader conservative
vision of government.  Understanding the importance of marketing
is one of the things that makes Heritage different from other
policy institutes.
<P>
 Providing the media with information and commentary on the issues,
ideas, politics and policies of Washington, the Public Relations
Department also flags key issues that are likely to dominate the
policy debate in the near future, and makes sure the media never
has an excuse for not quoting a credible conservative on a key
policy matter.
<P>
 A long-time favorite of  talk radio, Heritage, in 1994, opened
new broadcast facilities to meet the growing demand.  With state-of-the-art
equipment, the studio enables talk show hosts to do live broadcasts
from Heritage's Capitol Hill headquarters.  Heritage has become
a &quot;home away from home&quot; for dozens of talk show hosts
visiting the nation's capital to broadcast their shows.
<P>
 Heritage's work with talk radio, part of a broader broadcast
media program, began several years ago -- long before most other
organizations realized the potential impact of this alternative
communications medium.  Heritage experts have made literally hundreds
of guest appearances on radio talk shows, on major television
and  public affairs shows, and on the America's Talking, CNN,
CNBC, C-Span, and NET call-in shows.  Heritage lectures also are
frequently seen on C-Span.
<P>
 The Heritage &quot;op-ed&quot; page program gives Heritage analysts
and executives an opportunity to present their views on the important
issues of the day without having to go through the usual news
&quot;filtering&quot; process.  Heritage bylines regularly appear
in hundreds of  U.S. and overseas newspapers, including the <i>Washington Post</i>, <i>Washington Times</i>, <i>Wall Street Journal</i>, <i>Los Angeles Times</i>
and <i>New York Times</i>.
<P>
 While most Heritage public relations activities involve the mass
media, targeted communications are also an important part of the
program.  The Speakers Bureau, for example, helps bring Heritage's
conservative message to college campuses and business, professional,
and civic organizations (for more information see the <A HREF="/heritage/spkbur.html">Speakers Bureau</A>).  Heritage also is the home of  the
Washington Roundtable for the Asia-Pacific Press, an organization
of Washington-based Asian correspondents.

<TITLE>Entitlements and the Everglades Column</TITLE>
</HEAD><BODY BGCOLOR="FFFFFF" BACKGROUND="/free/Images/bluewhite_paper.gif"><IMG SRC = "/free/Images/flogo.gif" ALT = ""><P>2/28/96</P><H1>More subsidies in the age of corruption entitlements</H1><P>By John A. Baden</P>

<P>&quot;<EM>Don't Gore us with new taxes</EM>&quot;, picketters in Miami shouted last week.  They opposed Vice President Gore's plan to &quot;tax&quot; the sugar industry in Florida.  A sugar &quot;tax&quot; would be used by the federal government to purchase Everglades land for ecosystem restoration.  In addition to the penny-per-pound &quot;tax&quot;, Gore announced a $1.5 billion environmental cleanup initiative for the Everglades.</P>

<P>	The Everglades ecosystem is clearly degrading.  Environmentalists accuse the sugar industry of despoiling the Everglades.  Economists such as Jonathan Tolman of the libertarian <A HREF="http://www.cei.org">Competitive Enterprise Institute</A> counter that government subsidies have encouraged the destruction.</P>

<P>   	Predictably, environmentalists demand a higher tax, and sugar growers want lower taxes.  The debate misses the mark entirely, because the &quot;penny-per-pound tax&quot; is no &quot;tax&quot;.  It is a subsidy reduction.  Gore's plan reduces federal price supports by a penny per pound.  Over $250 million in sugar industry subsidies and an import quota on sugar cost consumers over $1.4 billion a year and harm the Everglades.  </P>

<P>	Subsidies foster destructive agriculture in the Everglades.  Such subsidized destruction of environmental quality is the norm, not an isolated exception.  But politicians of both parties remain blind to opportunities to link fiscal responsibility with ecological integrity.  They and their constituencies have a parasitic relation to taxpayers.  Recipients of wealth transferred from others think they have a right to handouts.  This exemplifies a disturbing trend in American political culture: the conversion of subsidies into entitlements.</P>

<P>	Robert Samuelson of the <CITE>Washington Post</CITE> describes this in his new book, <CITE>The Good Life and Its Discontents:  The American Dream in the Age of Entitlement</CITE>.  He describes the conflicting and paradoxical nature of entitlements--the notion that we are all entitled to progress and prosperity which government can provide.  The mirage of entitlements, he rightly concludes, shakes the very foundation of American culture.  The problem with entitlements, aside from their conflict with the American ideal of individual responsibility, is the logical consequences of assuming that government can and should provide.</P>

<P>	Should government guarantee us income security and high-quality health care?  If it does, and then what?  What are the predictable consequences of such entitlements?  Entitlements require that government take citizens' scarce resources and distribute them to various interests.  Once government allocates any valuable resource, corruption of purpose must follow.  Here's why: 	</P>

<P>We can never precisely specify what the bureaucrat must do. Some discretion must remain.  And that discretion will normally reflect a political calculus.  The decision maker has incentives to make those determinations that advantage himself, those he favors, and his cause.  <A HREF="gopher://gopher.npr.org:70/11/NPR_Online">National Public Radio</A> programming provides an excellent example.</P>

<P>	When spending the money of others, discretionary power corrupts.  We then see resources going to corporate welfare projects like Senator Bob Dole's ethanol subsidies for Archer Daniels Midland and to the Clintons' friends who wanted to handle travel arrangements for the White House press corps.  With a constituency in place, &quot;subsidies&quot; harden into &quot;entitlements&quot;.</P>

<P>	In the booming postwar years, Samuelson reports, Americans began &quot;to take propserity for granted.&quot;  Times have changed, but our expectations haven't.  We still demand our Social Security, Medicare, and subsidized housing.  These goals necessarily imply trade-offs among competing demands.  The 'right' to farm subsidized sugar comes at the expense of taxpayers and intact ecosystems.  Potential entitlements are endless, but resources are finite.  It's morally and intellectually irresponsible to ignore this reality.</P>

<P>	A century ago, the Progressives did just that.  They claimed that government can and should not only monitor, but also manage resources and provide material benefits.  They and their modern liberal followers believe that social problems can be fixed if only the &quot;right&quot; people were making the decisions.  They thought more discretion by the right bureaucrats will ensure good policy that advances the public interest.  This counsel of perfection was grossly naive.</P>

<P>	America's Founders knew better.  They believed mankind is not perfectible, but rather self-interested.  Therefore they designed institutions to prevent people from harnessing government as an engine of plunder.  They chose a constitutional, limited government with strong checks and balances.  The rights they &quot;entitled&quot; Americans to are found in the Bill of Rights -- mainly freedom from abuse of government power.</P>

<P>	Federal budget deficits, national debt, and actuarial deficits symbolize our Age of Entitlement.  This simply cannot continue indefinitely.  Samuelson suggests we return to the Founders' vision of a limited government that only makes promises it can keep.  Otherwise we'll crash on a runaway system that favors the election of opportunistic, short-sighted politicians with extraordinary abilities to lie in a convincing manner.  All competitive systems favor certain talents.  Political systems that run on claims to welfare favor the best liars.  </P>

<P>	When we consider reform in this Age of Entitlement, remember a constant of political economy: in all systems at all times, wealth and political power go together.  Expanding government entitlements ultimately hurts the poor and debases the moral quality of politicians.  In an Age of Entitlement, civic virtue is an endangered attribute. </P>

<title>Flat Tax Critique -- Heritage </title>
<center>
<h2>
A Friendly Critique Of The Flat Tax</h2>
By J.D. Foster, Ph.D.<br>
August 11, 1995<br>
<hr width=50%>
<p></center>
Many people would like you to believe the flat tax is so named because it will flatten your finances. That, at least, is the intended conclusion from a flawed study recently released by the National Association of Realtors. 
<p>
By eliminating personal deductions like mortgage interest payments, the study claims, the flat tax would reduce housing values in this country by upwards of 10 percent. But the study's methodology is shaky at best, and the jury on housing values is still out.
<p>
Despite the forces allied against the flat tax, tax reform momentum has grown steadily because the current tax system is so unpopular and the alternatives promise so much. The leading contender, the flat tax proposed by House Majority Leader Richard Armey, R-Texas, is easy to explain, addresses the need to increase savings and investment, and seems eminently fair to most people. House Minority Leader Richard Gephardt, D-Mo., is attempting to trump the Armey plan with a "flat tax" that sets up five tax rates to Armey's one. 
<p>
But in addition to the possibility of lower housing values, the flat tax poses several other serious problems too easily dismissed by its advocates.
<p>
Businesses may be the flat tax's second biggest obstacle. By reducing the cost of compliance with the tax laws and removing uncertainties about their tax situation, the flat tax would eventually benefit businesses. However, they would see their tax burden rise by about two-thirds, on average, from around 31 percent of the total tax burden to around 50 percent. This tax increase on businesses would result from the loss of deductions for state and local taxes and for employee fringe benefits, among other things.
<p>
Though businesses will try to pass on these costs to consumers and employees -- by raising prices and trimming fringe benefits, for example -- shifting the nation's tax burden to the business community will not produce successful tax reform. 
<p>
Next, the flat tax initially would raise taxes on the middle class by 20 percent. On average, a family with between $40,000 and $50,000 in adjusted gross income would see their taxes rise by about $700 -- to about $7,500. Of course, Mr. Armey's plan calls for the tax rate to decline to 17 percent in its third year, but this happy event is contingent on about $400 billion of additional spending cuts beyond what the Congress has already called for to achieve a balanced budget. Far easier said than done.
<p>
The flat tax appears also to have a major fairness problem. Consider two families. The Joneses have a combined salary of $50,000 in wages. Under the Armey flat tax, a 20 percent rate would cost this family $3,700. Now consider the Smiths, who in retirement consume every dollar of their $1 million in dividend income. Under the flat tax, the Smiths owe no tax at all because capital income is excluded from the tax base. To be sure, their dividend income was taxed at least once at the business level before they received it. But the perception would persist that a high-income family could pay no tax. Will tax fairness be defined so that individuals consuming significant amounts of capital income would pay little or no tax? 
<p>
Though difficult issues, they are not impossible to resolve. Moreover, the system's advantages could well outweigh its drawbacks. The flat tax could prove a boon for the economy by eliminating a passel of convoluted tax disincentives to saving and investing.  Economists will quibble over exact estimates, but there can be no question that saving and investment will improve in both the short and long run under a flat tax.
<p>
Advocates are correct to insist that the flat tax would be much simpler than the current tax system. The new system would tax only the income derived from individual labor, after allowing for personal exemptions. There would be no deductions. The flat tax would tax business' net cash income at the same rate that applies to individual income, while eliminating all the special tax provisions that penalize some businesses while benefiting others.
<p>
One big problem with the current system is that it costs from $150 billion to $300 billion annually to operate. The flat tax, by contrast, would cost about 1/15th as much once fully phased in. These cost savings are equivalent to more than a $100 billion tax cut for the American people.
<p>
No tax system is perfect, and no tax reform proposal is without flaws. In the end, the flat tax's greatest strength is that it would remove the current tax system's depressing effect on the economy. This, over time, could make up for all the problems mentioned above. 
<p>
But before it can pass, the problems will have to be addressed.

	Lt. Cdr. Kenneth Carkhuff was an outstanding Naval Academy graduate, ranked No. 1 in every command to which he was assigned after his 1982 commissioning, and only a year ago was praised by his commanding officer as "destined for command and beyond."<p>
	Now, the U.S. Navy wants to kick him out.
<p>	Why? Because Lt. Cdr. Carkhuff believes it is wrong to send women into combat. Such a view -- even if it doesn't affect Carkhuff in the performance of his duties -- is "not compatible with further military service," according to his now former commanding officer.
	<p>A Navy review board recently recommended that Carkhuff be discharged. Now President Clinton's Secretary of the Navy, John Dalton, must decide the future of an officer of obvious talent and firm faith.
	<p>Dalton faces no legal deadline to act, so he could simply allow the case to sit without comment on his desk. A Navy spokesman says, however, that this is "highly unlikely since we want a quality decision in a timely fashion."
	<p>Meanwhile, Lt. Cdr. Carkhuff and his family are twisting in the wind as legal bills pile up. If Secretary Dalton upholds the discharge, Carkhuff loses all Navy benefits, including his pension and health-insurance coverage.
	<p>This case raises disturbing questions about the Navy's hostility to those Americans who, like Carkhuff, base their opposition to women in combat on religious values.
	<p>Of Carkhuff's talent and devotion to duty there is no question. His commanding officer in the Navy's Helicopter Anti-Submarine Warfare (ASW) Squadron 44, based at Mayport Naval Air Station in Florida, said in 1994 that Carkhuff  "earned my strongest possible recommendation for early promotion ahead of his peers."
	<p>But then President Clinton ordered the U.S. invasion of Haiti, which involved the participation of Squadron 44 and the unit's two female pilots.
	<p>Squadron 44's commander claims Carkhuff told him privately a few days before the invasion that he opposed sending women into combat, and that he requested transfer to an all-male unit.
	<p>Steven Gallagher, a former Navy officer who is now Carkhuff's attorney, says his client made it clear he would still lead his unit into combat if ordered to do so. "However, as a Christian, he felt the moral obligation to express his views," Gallagher says.
	<p>Carkhuff's keel-hauling is the latest example of the Navy's abject surrender -- in the wake of the infamous Tailhook Scandal of 1991 -- to the demands of feminists. Against the recommendation of the 1992 Commission on Women in the Armed Forces, the Navy decided early in the Clinton administration's first year to put women in front-line combat positions on board ships and in aircraft.
	<p>Now, the Navy must cope with tragedies like that of Kara Hultgreen, the first woman promoted to fly a Navy fighter jet, who was killed earlier this year while attempting a carrier landing. After first claiming that "engine failure" caused Hultgreen's crash, the Navy later admitted that pilot error was involved. Now they say Hultgreen was qualified for flight duty despite errors in previous carrier landings that would have disqualified male pilots.
	<p>A growing number of critics, both inside and outside the military, think the Navy is sacrificing too much on the altar of political correctness, including the high training standards that might have saved Hultgreen's life.
	<p>It's time for Congress to demand answers from the Navy and the Clinton administration, beginning with why Kenneth Carkhuff is being persecuted for expressing views held by most Americans and consistent with hundreds of years of military combat experience.

Where would we be without, Seldy?  Almost a member of the family, Seldy is to us what R2D2
was to Luke Skywalker.   The Town Hall site runs on this high-tech piece of equipment.  What
this means to you is speedy access to our information.  So when you request an image by
clicking on a link, our friend, Seldy, delivers it.<p>
Seldy is a Digital Alpha Server 2100 model 4/275 running Digital Unix (OSF/1) 3.2.  It currently
is configured with one 275 MHz Alpha RISC processor, 128 Meg RAM, 5 two gig hard drives,
blah, blah, blah.  When the time comes, we'll pop in some more RAM, processors, and hard
drives.<p>


By the way, where did the name "Seldy" come from anyway?  Come up with your own theory,
send it to <A HREF="mailto:seldy@townhall.com">seldy@townhall.com</A>, and you could
win your very own tasty Moon Pie(tm)!  We will randomly select the winner from a pool of
correct<A NAME="contest"> answers.<p></A>

<a name="scrutiny">WHAT IS STRICT SCRUTINY?</a><p>
		There are two parts to the strict scrutiny standard:<ol>
<p><li>There must be a "compelling governmental interest" underlying an affirmative action measure; and 
<p><li>The measure must be "narrowly tailored" to serve that interest. </ol>
<p>	Courts typically look at six factors in deciding whether a race-conscious measure is narrowly tailored:<ol>
<p><li>Whether the government first considered race-neutral alternatives;
<p><li>Whether there is a waiver mechanism that limits the scope of the program to those who actually have been harmed by discrimination in the geographic region at issue;
<p><li>Whether race is the factor in determining eligibility for a program, or is just one of several factors in the decision-making process;
<p><li>The comparison of numerical targets with the number of qualified minorities in the relevant sector or industry; 
<p><li>Whether the program is subject to periodic review; and 
<p><li>Whether, and to what extent, the program imposes a burden on persons who do not belong to the favored groups and who are not personally responsible for the discrimination in question.
</ol>
<p>

<a name="section">THE SECTION 8(a) PROGRAM</a><p>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	One of the most controversial of the federal efforts to bestow an explicit advantage on favored racial and ethnic groups is the Small Business Administration's Section 8(a) program. The 8(a) program allows the SBA to channel federal procurement contracts to individuals and firms defined as socially and economically disadvantaged.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Under the law, members of minority groups wishing to participate in this program are presumed to suffer from social and economic disadvantage. In contrast, non-minorities hoping to be classified as disadvantaged must prove social disadvantage "on the basis of clear and convincing evidence."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;The Small Business Act defines socially disadvantaged individuals as "those who have been subjected to racial or ethnic prejudice or cultural bias because of their identity as a member of a group without regard to their individual qualities." Economically disadvantaged individuals are "those socially disadvantaged individuals whose ability to compete in the free enterprise system has been impaired due to diminished capital and credit opportunities as compared to others in the same business area who are not socially disadvantaged."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The Act establishes a government-wide goal for participation by these concerns at "not less than 5 percent of the total value of all prime contract and subcontract awards for each fiscal year" and requires the head of each federal agency to establish agency-specific goals for participation by these firms. In FY 1993, 5,414 companies participated in this program and received contracts valued at $4.5 billion.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	For a business owner to qualify for the Small Business Administration's disadvantaged business program, his net worth may not exceed $250,000. But in arriving at this calculation, the SBA does not include either the owner's equity in his companies and homes or the wealth of his spouse. In 1994, federal auditors selected five SBA district offices and examined 50 supposedly disadvantaged companies that had received at least $10 million each in federal contracts. Among their findings:<ul>
<p><li>35 of the 50 owners were worth more than $1 million each; 
<p><li>Five owners received salaries and bonuses totaling between $1 million and $2.5 million over a two-year period. Seven others earned more than $750,000; 
<p><li>Over a dozen reported equity stakes in their firms of between $1 million and $9 million; 
<p><li>Five had homes worth $800,000 to $1.4 million.</ul><p>

<a name="how">HOW RACE-NORMING WORKS AT HARVARD'S DEPARTMENT OF GOVERNMENT</a>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Applications from "underrepresented minorities" receive a bright green sticker and a pink status sheet, which are removed so the application can be read blind. A panel of professors narrows the 600-700 applications down to about 45. Then the stickers are reattached, and department officials review the applications to ascertain how many minorities were accepted. At this point, Harvard accepts any minority applicant who "would complete the program if admitted."
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	If this standard were applied to all applicants, the department would admit 200 to 300 students a year. Instead, it admits from 35 to 45. 
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	The numbers: 570 students applied to the government department in the fall of 1995. Of the 35 minority applicants, six (17 percent) were accepted. In contrast, only 27 of the 535 non-minority applicants (about 5 percent) were accepted.

<a name="economic">THE ECONOMIC BURDEN OF AFFIRMATIVE ACTION</a><p>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	Some economists have estimated the costs that affirmative action policies impose on the economy and on individual businesses:
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	<b>A 6.5 Percent Mandate.</b>  Economist Peter Griffin estimates that the cost of complying with affirmative action rules and regulations for firms that do business with the federal government amounted to 6.5 percent of all costs in 1980.*
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<b>A 4 Percent Burden on Gross Domestic Product.</b>  John Hunter, Professor of Psychology at Michigan State University, estimates that total U.S. output would be about 2.5 percent, or $150 billion, higher if every employer in the country subject to federal law were free to use employment tests and select on merit.** In addition, Peter Brimelow and Leslie Spencer estimate that the administrative costs associated with affirmative action since 1980 amount to approximately $113 billion per year, or another 1.5 percent of GDP. Thus, the total negative impact on GDP is estimated to be about 4 percent per year.***
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	<b>The Cost to California Taxpayers.</b> In a November 24, 1993, letter to State Attorney General Dan Lungren, the California Joint Legislative Budget Committee noted that the state government spends roughly $200 million per year on affirmative action and other race-based programs.

<h2>State Think Tanks Take Aim</h2>
<b>by Lawrence W. Reed</b>
</center><P>
<b>Ambush in the Ozarks</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Little Rock, Arkansas -- Higher taxes may be popular in Bill Clinton's White House, but back where Clinton comes from, they're about as welcome as subpoenas at the Rose Law Firm.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	By a whopping tally of 87 percent, Arkansas voters last January  rejected Governor Jim Guy Tucker's plan for a huge increase in state spending for highways. Tucker sought approval to issue $3.5 billion in bonds, to be repaid by hikes in the state's general sales tax and diesel-fuel tax, and by a new excise tax on wholesale gasoline. Thanks to voters, Arkansas motorists avoided having to pay the highest diesel-fuel and gasoline taxes in the South.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Tucker had barnstormed the state, attempting to convince voters that the additional state debt and higher taxes would yield better roads and a stronger economy. Opponents argued that the excessive growth of state spending over the years had crowded out funding for the roads, and therefore Little Rock should tighten its belt and finance highways by cutting general spending.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Proving that good research and persuasive ideas can move public opinion, the Arkansas Policy Foundation (APF) joined the fray and played a key role in the Tucker proposal's lopsided defeat. Together with Arkansans Against Unreasonable Tax Hikes, a grass-roots organization, APF offered a convincing case that:
<P><ul><li> The plan would cost the average Arkansas family $500 in additional taxes;<p>
<li> Tucker's rosy forecast of economic growth from new state spending was careless guesswork at best, political snake oil at worst;<p>
<li> With an annual budget one-seventh the size of the bond program itself, the bureaucracy at the state highway department was ill-equipped to administer so many massive new road projects at one time.</ul>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Voters were swayed by the argument that state government was too fat for its own good. The foundation showed that, from 1962 to 1993, total state government spending in Arkansas soared by 327 percent after inflation. The number of state employees grew by 189 percent during the same period. Government in Arkansas, APF declared, had become "the state's number-one employer, as well as its largest growth industry." <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Speculation is that the 13 percent who voted for the tax hikes were all state employees. <p>

<b>Revising Michigan's History</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Midland, Michigan -- If those who forget history are condemned to repeat it, then those who rewrite history are surely condemned to eat their own words. 
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Revisionist history is under fire in Michigan in a new study from the Mackinac Center for Public Policy. In "Are Michigan History Textbooks Reliable?" senior fellow Burton W. Folsom documents the biases and distortions that are shaping the way youngsters think about the development of their state and the role of government.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Courses on state history are typically taught at the fourth- and eighth-grade levels in Michigan schools. Almost every student reads one or two of only four texts on the subject. Folsom's review turned up several common and disturbing themes: Greedy private enterprise creates problems while always-helpful government solves them, labor unions are the worker's best friend and never harm the worker's interests, taxes enable worthy projects to be funded and produce few harmful consequences. Is it any wonder that American business spends $40 billion in remedial education programs?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Almost immediately after achieving statehood in 1837, Michigan's fledgling government embraced socialized railroads, canals, and other "internal improvements." The experience proved so disastrous that the state constitution was rewritten in 1850. Its replacement expressly barred the state from starting or owning any portion of any commercial enterprise, and even banned the state from having anything to do with further internal improvements. A liberated economy led to an explosion of entrepreneurship, producing world-class industries in autos, furniture, and breakfast cereal. That lesson is omitted entirely from all four books.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The worst of the four texts, Folsom found, is larded with politically correct multicultural themes. In <I>Michigan: The World Around Us</I>, the "struggles" of minorities and women are set against the backdrop of white males who seem rarely to do anything that isn't mean-spirited and selfish. In one instance, author JoEllen Vinyard rewrites the story of a famous 1763 massacre of British settlers at Fort Michilimackinac, informing her student readers: "The Native Americans fought bravely to defend the land and the freedom that the British were taking away from them." Every single sentence about events in Michigan since 1960 deals with civil-rights turmoil. One wonders how anybody in Detroit ever found time to make cars.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The study prompted extensive press coverage throughout Michigan and a cascade of orders from concerned parents and school-board members. One textbook author pledged to make corrections in his next edition. Parents in other states might want to ask, "What are our kids learning under the guise of history?"<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Dayton, Ohio -- An alliance of five state-based think tanks in the Midwest is working to bring an end to the War Between the States, a war fought not with bullets but with subsidies and gimmicks designed to lure businesses from one state to another.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Assembled by the Buckeye Institute for Public Policy Solutions, in Dayton, Ohio, the Mackinac Center for Public Policy, in Midland, Michigan, and other think tanks in Indiana, Illinois, and Nebraska, a group of more than a hundred distinguished economists and policy analysts recently signed a joint resolution calling for an end to state-run "industrial policy." The experts want states to compete with each other, but by reducing overall tax and regulatory burdens instead of by granting special favors to selected firms.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	"Government cannot pick winners and losers in the marketplace effectively," says economist Sam Staley, a vice president of the Buckeye Institute. "The best economic-development policy is one that cultivates a 'fair field with no favors,' in which states attempt to attract businesses by improving the general climate for enterprise and making government itself lean, unobtrusive, and inexpensive." Adds Bill Styring of the Indiana Policy Review Foundation, "States must recognize that each can foster superior and sustainable growth if they spend less energy on a few trees and care instead for the forest as a whole."<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The resolution urges state governments to "terminate targeted business assistance such as direct grants, selective tax incentives, and abatement programs and adopt comprehensive strategies of tax relief for all firms and citizens, deregulation, and competitive systems of education." Ohio state senator Chuck Horn, the chairman of the Economic Development Committee in the senate, is taking the advice of these distinguished economists one step further: He is planning a regional conference of legislators to address the problems created by state-sponsored "industrial policy." 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	The resolution is the latest volley of criticism launched against the economic war between the states. Studies show that harmful subsidies and discriminatory tax policies are proliferating, and governors like Michigan's John Engler are urging a cease-fire. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
Olympia, Washington -- All over America, limited-government advocates are way ahead of the Big-Government crowd when it comes to "the vision thing." They are churning out blueprints while the other side -- often demoralized and devoid of ideas -- campaigns to preserve a failed status quo.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	This hopeful trend is evident in Washington state, where voters in 1994 dethroned the Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives and elected Republicans in seven of the state's nine congressional districts. In the state legislative elections, voters handed control of the state's house of representatives to the GOP.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Taking advantage of the friendlier climate for conservative ideas, the Evergreen Freedom Foundation (EFF) has released "Reducing the Size and Cost of Government," a 115-page report that calls for sweeping change. Authors Bob Williams and Lynn Harsh outline broad principles for guiding virtually every aspect of government in the state of Washington, from tax policy to welfare reform. If public policy were to be consistently developed within the legal constraints and purposes of both the state and federal constitutions, they argue, the result would be a radical reduction in government itself.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Mike Lowry, Washington's Democratic governor, proudly calls himself a "liberal," but he lauds EFF as "an important source of ideas about how to make state government operate as efficiently and effectively as possible." The document addresses various proposals for "reinventing government," advances the principles for reform, and explains how to develop new accountability mechanisms for government.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	EFF calls on Washington to join the privatization revolution. In Washington, it's illegal for private contractors to wash windows in state office buildings even if that's the cheapest and best way to get the job done. Only state employees are allowed to mow lawns at public sites. No private firm can manage the state's mail rooms, maintain its computers, or assist in procuring supplies.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
The reason? Public-employee unions have secured ironclad provisions in state law that keep such work in the hands of overpaid, underperforming, unionized bureaucrats. For legislators and concerned citizens everywhere, the paramount question of the day is, "What should government do and what should it leave alone?" The answers are found in this latest volume from the Evergreen Freedom Foundation.<p>

<a name = "frustrating">FRUSTRATING THE ELECTORATE: THE BALANCED BUDGET AMENDMENT</a>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;
	The experience of the campaign for a balanced budget amendment is a clear demonstration of Washington's resistance to reform and its ability to outmaneuver the public. Despite overwhelming public support for an amendment to the Constitution to require Congress to balance the budget, Congress repeatedly has refused to send one to the states for ratification.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	In 1983, when a national movement to call a constitutional convention for the specific purpose of proposing such an amendment appeared within striking distance of the 34 states required, the congressional leadership finally moderated its long opposition and allowed a proposal for a balanced budget amendment to move through the legislative bureaucracy. This move succeeded in its primary purpose of killing the possibility of a convention, but the leadership still faced the problem of allowing a vote on a popular issue that it did not want enacted. Adroit behind-the-scenes maneuvering was necessary to allow Members who did not want to see an amendment pass, but for political reasons did not want to be seen as voting against such an amendment, to have it both ways.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;	This effort to prevent a successful vote continued throughout the 1980s and into the 1990s as the debt mounted and the voters increasingly demanded a balanced budget. The most egregious example was the 1994 vote on an amendment proposed by Senator Paul Simon (D-IL), which appeared to have the 67 Senate votes needed for passage. To stop this measure, the Senate leadership introduced a competing proposal of their own design. They knew this version had no chance of passage, and that was its main attraction: Its real purpose was to split the vote and thereby deny either version a sufficient majority. In this way, Senators who really opposed a balanced budget amendment could portray themselves as favoring an amendment, and even go on record as voting for one, because they were assured that none would pass. Such maneuvers are common, and the people, repeatedly frustrated in their demands but with little evidence as to who exactly is responsible, are left to wonder what really happened.

<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;<a name = "crime">In Philadelphia</a>, federal judge Norma Shapiro prevents local judges from detaining many violent defendants before trial by prohibiting them from considering the defendant's prior criminal record, mental health history, or drug dependency. The federal court also prevents any pre-trial detention for such "non-violent" crimes as stalking, carjacking, robbery with a baseball bat, burglary, drug dealing, vehicular homicide, manslaughter, terrorist threats, or weapons violations. Judges in Philadelphia are prohibited from forcing defendants to appear at trial, and the city now has 50,000 fugitives from justice. Instead of being in jail, these individuals have gone on to commit numerous other crimes. Between 1994 and June 1995, Philadelphia police rearrested 9,732 of these criminals (previously released under federal court orders) for 79 murders, 959 robberies, 2,215 drug deals, 701 burglaries, 2,748 thefts, 90 rapes, 14 kidnapping charges, 1,113 assaults, 264 gun-law violations, and 127 drunk-driving incidents.

<a name="demise"<b>THE DEMISE OF FEDERALISM</b></a>
<p><b>1913</b> The 16th Amendment to the Constitution removes restrictions on Congress's ability to levy income taxes directly on the population. In 1914, federal income taxes accounted for less than one-fourth of 1 percent of the average American family's income. In 1994, over 24 percent of family income went to pay federal taxes.
<p><b>1913</b> The 17th Amendment to the Constitution mandates the direct election of Senators by the people, instead of by state legislatures. As a result, the states lose their role in national policymaking and their ability to carry out their constitutional role of checking and balancing the national government.
<p><b>1933-1945</b> New Deal legislation greatly increases the power and reach of the national government, but states and local governments retain many of their traditional functions. Waging World War II expands central government and solidifies Washington's ability to control the economy.
<p><b>1937</b> President Franklin Roosevelt threatens to overcome the Supreme Court's resistance to the expansion of federal power by packing the Court with additional members who support his agenda. In response to this threat, the Court acquiesces to most New Deal legislation by declaring many constitutional restraints null and void and dramatically expanding the powers granted to Washington by the Constitution. 
<p><b>1938</b> The Fair Labor Standards Act federalizes most worker-management relations in the U.S.
<p><b>1941</b> In United States v. Darby, the Supreme Court says the 10th Amendment is only a "truism" and "nothing more than declaratory," and denotes no constraints that the federal government need heed.
<p><b>1942</b> In Wickard v. Filburn, the Supreme Court removes virtually all limits on the federal government's power to regulate the economy by upholding the fines levied against an Ohio farmer for growing non-commercial wheat for his own use. The Court rules that Washington has the right to regulate any activity that may affect interstate commerce, including activity wholly confined to a private farm.
<p><b>1960s</b> The War on Poverty and other welfare projects vastly expand federal programs and funding throughout the economy and society.
<p><b>1985</b> In Garcia v. SAMTA, the Supreme Court rules that state and local agencies must follow national labor standards. The Court disposes of the remnants of federalism by saying that the states' interests are fully represented by the Senate, and thus that any law duly enacted by Congress automatically has the states' consent.
<p><b>1960s</b> In a series of controversial decisions, the Supreme Court overturns and rewrites whole sections of long-established law in the name of expanded individual rights, dramatically expanding the power of the federal courts to reshape society by undermining law enforcement and public order, removing religion from public life, erasing all restrictions on the power of Congress vis--vis the states and society, rewriting state constitutions, taking over state and local administrations, imposing racial quotas, and so forth.
<p><b>1994</b> The Supreme Court decides in U.S. Term Limits v. Thornton that the people have no right to set term limits on elected federal officials.
<p><b>1995</b> In U.S. v. Lopez, in a five-to-four decision, the Supreme Court uses the 10th Amendment to restrict federal power for the first time in six decades, although it is still uncertain to what extent this decision will limit Congress's power under the Commerce Clause.

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="/heritage/paperh.jpg">
<center><IMG SRC="/heritage/thf_log2.gif"></a></center>
<P>
<H2>Educational Affairs Department</H2>
<HR>
<P>
 The Educational Affairs department includes <A HREF="/heritage/p_review/">
 <I>Policy Review: The Journal of American Citizenship</I></A>,
the quarterly journal of The Heritage Foundation, <A
HREF="/heritage/dept_writeups/95lect.html">Lectures and
Seminars</A>, and Academic Programs. The Heritage Foundation's academic
programs are intended to encourage the interchange of ideas between
scholars and policymakers, while building a national network of
conservative scholars and educational leaders committed to academic
excellence and the principles of liberty and constitutional order.
<P>
<B>The Bradley Fellows Program</B>
<P>
 The Bradley Fellows Program at The Heritage Foundation is intended
to enable scholars and academically rigorous journalists to conduct
a long-term research project in Washington, D.C., and to produce
a book important to the future of the conservative movement. 

<P>
 Each author is in residence at The Heritage Foundation for one
academic year, during which time he or she is expected to complete
all or most of their book.  In addition to their individual research
projects, Bradley Scholars hold roundtable discussions at Heritage,
and add their academic expertise to Heritage's general intellectual
environment. Each Bradley Fellow will receive a one year stipend,
plus funds to cover expenses and materials needed to support their
work.  During and after the scholar's residency at Heritage, our
marketing departments will communicate the author's ideas to Capitol
Hill and the media.  Books are to be published commercially.
<P>
 Current Bradley Fellows are writing on practical solutions to
the crime problem in American neighborhoods, black churches that
are successfully strengthening local communities; and a conservative
model of corporate social responsibility. The Heritage Foundation
is currently interested in supporting work in, but not necessarily
limited to, the following six subject areas: How Immigrants Become
Americans (An examination of the institutions that historically
assimilated foreigners into the American mainstream); The Economic
Revival of Communities (A look at communities whose economies
have revived after terrible social and economic setbacks ); The
Other Washington (An examination of civil society in Washington,
D.C. in the shadow of both federal and city government bureaucracy);
The Case for Raising the Retirement Age (Examining the economic
and medical benefits of a later retirement age); Family, City,
State, Nation (A major philosophical work, written for a large
audience, that would explore which areas of policy are appropriate
for the federal government, which should be left for state government,
which for local government, and which shouldn't be handled by
government at all); Alternatives to Federal Funding of Scientific
Research; and Alternatives to Federal Funding of the Arts.
<P>
 The Bradley Fellows are chosen in an informal competition, based
on individual qualifications and project proposals.  Please direct
further questions or mail your proposal directly to the Manager
of Academic Programs at The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts
Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002.  The Bradley Program is
made possible by a grant from the Lynde and Harry Bradley Foundation
of Milwaukee, Wisconsin.
<P>
<B>The Salvatori Fellows Program</B>
<P>
 Through the Salvatori Center for Academic Leadership, The Heritage
Foundation assists those faculty and educational leaders who are
committed to the renewal of academic excellence and the recovery
of our nation's founding principles so as to encourage an enlightened
patriotism and bolster the foundations of liberty in America.
<P>
 Each year the Salvatori Center selects twenty-five young faculty
and doctoral candidates in the social sciences and the humanities
to participate in a ten-day summer colloquium which takes place
in Washington, D.C., entitled &quot;The Foundations of American
Liberty.&quot;  The colloquium examines the fundamental principles
of American constitutionalism as articulated in the important
documents of the founding era.  In addition, the colloquium considers
the history and present workings of our political institutions
-- the Congress, the courts, the presidency and the executive
branch bureaucracy, the two-party system -- as a means of better
understanding the principles underlying contemporary political
issues.  It includes meetings with congressional leaders and other
policymakers to study the role of ideas in public affairs and
the character of political leadership in American society.
<P>
 Each Salvatori Fellow receives an honorarium, travel expenses,
and a per diem allowance as a participant in the colloquium. 
After the completion of the program, Fellows will continue their
affiliation with The Heritage Foundation as members of a national
network of adjunct scholars, colleagues in the ongoing work of
reclaiming our educational institutions and enlivening the public
discussion of American principles. 
<P>
 For application information, please call write to the Manager
of Academic Programs, The Heritage Foundation, 214 Massachusetts
Avenue, N.E., Washington, D.C. 20002.  Applications require a
vita, references, a writing sample and a pr&eacute;cis of the

<P>

<hr>
<P>
 Last April, after you finished doing your income taxes and sent
them off to the IRS, you may have needed a break.  So you may
have gathered up your family to go out to your favorite restaurant
for dinner.  What you probably didn't realize was how much you
were <a href="/atr/tax-presentation/mealoped.html">paying in taxes again</a> at the restaurant.
<P>
 In most places, you of course must pay sales tax on your bill.
 Many jurisdictions impose special, higher sales taxes on drinks
or food sold at restaurants.  So the sales tax can be as high
as 10% of your bill.
<P>
 But that is only the beginning.  Out of the amount the consumer
pays to the restaurant, the restaurant must pay Federal income
taxes, state income taxes, Federal payroll taxes, sales taxes,
capital gains taxes, unemployment insurance taxes, workmen's compensation
taxes, business license taxes and fees, utility taxes, local property
taxes, and any local income taxes.  The restaurant also must pay
Federal and state excise taxes on its telephones.
<P>
 Altogether, these taxes average 17.6% of a typical restaurant
bill.  Counting the sales taxes paid directly by the consumer,
this means about one-fourth, or as much as 27.6%, of what you
pay for a meal at a restaurant ends up going to the government
in taxes rather than to the restaurant.
<P>
 So if the bill for dinner for your family comes to $40, about
$10-$11 ends up going to the government in taxes.  The cost of
everything else going into your meal, including the food, its
delivery, its preparation, salaries for the restaurant employees,
and other restaurant overhead, is covered by the remaining $29-$30.
<P>
 These taxes are unfair to workers.  In a democracy, taxes should
not be hidden in the prices of products people buy.  They should
be explicit and clear, so that voters can determine whether they
think those taxes are worth what they are getting from their government.
<P>
 Thomas Jefferson wrote, &quot;Government should not take out
of the mouth of labor the bread that it has earned.&quot;  But
that is exactly what our greedy and overreaching government does
today.  It taxes you on your income when you earn it, and taxes
it again when you spend it, and taxes you over and over again
along the way.  As a result, the average family today actually
pays more in taxes than on food, clothing, and shelter combined.
<P>
 Tax relief for working people is long overdue.  Such tax reduction
would give workers more control over their own incomes and economic
future.  A major tax reduction would also greatly stimulate the
economy, leading to more jobs, higher wages, and expanded economic
opportunity and prosperity.

<center><h2>Newsbites, from the February 1996 MediaWatch</h2></center>
<p>
<h3>Tricky Dick's Tax Break.</h3>
When Rep. Jennifer Dunn (R-Wash.) filed an ethics complaint against House Minority Leader Dick Gephardt for possibly illegally evading capital gains taxes on a land swap, the story's hypocrisy angle seemed obvious. Insight reported last summer that Gephardt, who dem-agogues against capital gains tax cuts as windfalls for the rich, listed a beachfront property he was purchasing as an investment property, thus avoiding tax on a $79,500 capital gain. To obtain a loan to build on the North Carolina property, he signed a covenant pledging the house would be used as a second home, and not as an investment property. 
<p>
Reporters had two chances to make Gephardt's hypocrisy a news story, one when Dunn filed the complaint February 2, and another when Gephardt's lawyer denied the allegations a week later. Despite short stories in The Washington Post and The New York Times, in both cases the network evening news programs completely ignored the allegations.
<p>

<h3>Newt Left Hanging.</h3>
Last July, when the National Republican Congressional Committee printed a Wanted poster featuring targeted Democrats, CNN thoroughly covered the ensuing outrage from Democrats. The NRCC Wanted poster merely pictured Democratic incumbents up for re-election in 1996. CNN gave the most coverage overall of the poster, airing stories on the July 10 and July 15 Inside Politics as well as on World News for July 12 and 13. Declared anchor Bobbie Battista: "Some of the Democrats pictured on a Republican Wanted poster are complaining the ad is racist and could even put their lives in danger." The next day anchor Linden Soles reported, "Democrats say the poster is racist, anti-semitic and could even lead to physical attacks against them." 
<p>
So where was CNN when the Democratic National Committee (DNC) posted a Hangman game on its Web site that depicted Newt Gingrich as hanging from a gallows? According to John Pitney in the January 29 Weekly Standard, "For each correct guess, the site added a new part to a stick figure and displayed a different quotation from Gingrich. At the end of the game, the screen showed the stick figure hanging from a gallows, above the game's magic word: EXTREMIST." Surely, the lynching of the Speaker of the House on an official DNC computer Web page deserved at least a brief spot. But neither CNN's Inside Politics or The World Today aired a report on the Hangman game. A review of the three other major networks showed they also failed to mention the DNC's ghoulish depiction of Gingrich on the gallows.
<p>

<h3>PBS on Privates.</h3>
Are the personal lives of politicians relevant? Apparently, the PBS answer is "only if they're Republicans." On January 16, the tax-funded documentary series Frontline devoted an hour to the rise of Newt Gingrich, which included tales of how friends had to raise money to feed Newt's kids because he wouldn't pay alimony. Frontline also aired a man heckling Gingrich at a book signing: "You profess family values. This is hidden wisdom in the Holy Bible. And I want to know where it says oral sex doesn't count as adultery. I'd like you to sign it because, you know, you've been cheating on your wife. You've been crying family values. I don't know where it says oral sex is moral while you're trying to take away children's rights and children's benefits." 
<p>
But Frontline has almost completely avoided dealing with Bill Clinton's sex life. The only snippet came on March 3, 1992, in a documentary on racist David Duke, who declared: "I am not a wizard under the sheets. I have to leave that title to Bill Clinton from Arkansas." But that's about it. The October 21, 1992 Frontline titled "The Choice," a two-hour history of Bush and Clinton, leaped at the very end from Clinton's announcement speech in 1991 to the Los Angeles riots. There was no Gennifer Flowers. In 1995, Frontline aired "What Happened to Bill Clinton?" The answer: He hadn't been liberal enough. PBS said nothing about the allegations of state troopers or the sexual harassment lawsuit of Paula Jones. 
<p>

<h3>Another Travelgate Yawn.</h3>
While promoting her new book in January, First Lady Hillary Clinton defended her role in the May 1993 firing of the White House Travel Office staff. She said "financial mismanagement" justified the action. But a  recent audit by the General Accounting Office shows that whatever the situation in 1993, it has only gotten worse.
<p>
According to an Associated Press story that appeared in the January 30 Washington Post and Washington Times, an audit by the General Accounting Office found: "The current travel office rarely follows its own policy of paying vendors, such as airlines and telephone companies, within 45 days of the invoice date....office employees never balanced checkbooks from January through August 1995." The audit also found that the office's accounts receivable had soared to $5.6 million under the new management, while the employees that were fired had only $366,000. The new employees also forgot to enter over $200,000 in deposits into the office's checking accounts.
<p>
The audit drew little national media attention. The New York Times, Los Angeles Times and USA Today all failed to report the embarrassing revelations. With the exception of the NewsHour on PBS, no network evening news show ran a story. Neither did Time or Newsweek.
<p>

<h3>Hillary's Decade of Greed.</h3>
Newsweek's Martha Brant and Evan Thomas analyzed the duality of Hillary Clinton in the January 15 issue. Instead of condemning her as a hypocrite for trashing the "greed is good" 1980s in public while cashing in on her influence in private, the Newsweek duo marveled at her "missionary zeal" as a liberal crusader. "The same zeal that is so impressive in her fight for worthy causes," Brant and Thomas suggested, "can also lead her (at best) to be politically insensitive and (at worst) to be ruthless about getting her way." 
<p>
The article shows why Hillary never resorted to ruthlessness when dealing with the press on Whitewater; reporters like Brant and Thomas are willing to rationalize her behavior: "It has fallen mostly to Hillary to finance the Clinton's public service. (As governor, her husband never earned more than $35,000 a year.) To the outside world, her commodities trading -- a $1,000 investment to make $100,000 -- looks suspiciously cozy. And the family's lost investment in the failed Whitewater land development has the smell of a sweet deal turned sour...Although she would never admit it, she may feel that she was relatively restrained in Little Rock, given the temptations of her position and the culture of the place. For a governor's wife who was also a senior partner in a politically connected law firm, the opportunity for lucrative deals must have been huge."
<p>
Zuckerman's Zero Interest. Liberals often claim that media owners push the media to the right. Not so at U.S. News & World Report where owner Mortimer Zuckerman liked investigating George Bush, but is not so happy about probing the Clintons. Zuckerman used a two-page editorial on January 29 to lambaste Republican handling of the Whitewater hearings. He recalled Joseph Welch's famous dictum, "Have you no sense of decency?" from the Army-McCarthy hearings of the 1950s as he regurgitated the Clintons' public relations line that a report prepared for the RTC by former Republican U.S. Attorney Jay Stephens cleared the Clintons. On the issue of the billing records that were discovered nearly two years after being subpoenaed (and which contradict the RTC report), Zuckerman wrote: "What about the time sheets showing the amount of legal work that Hillary Clinton performed for the failed S&L?...Again, no. Her role...was minimal." 
<p>
The editorial led to a January 26 guest appearance on Michael Jackson's KABC talk show in Los Angeles. Talk Daily reported that "he called the charges against the Clintons `outrageous' (a term he used several times)," claimed that in the First Lady's Madison dealings "all transactions were legitimate," was "disgusted" by the investigation and considered much of the press coverage a "witch hunt." 
<p>
Zuckerman's U.S. News piece also attacked fellow journalists for investigating a Democrat: "The press has slipped its moorings here...The two questions now -- what did the President's wife know and when did she know it? -- seem a childish irrelevance by comparison [to Watergate]." However in his own June 22, 1992 editorial on Iraqgate, Zuckerman suggested the Bush administration obstructed justice, claiming: "Certainly the attempts to limit inquiries by Congress on the spurious grounds of national security smell of coverup....In short, what did the administration know and when did it know it?"
<p>

<h3>California Scheming. </h3>
Host Jane Pauley's introduction to the January 23 Dateline NBC dripped with sarcasm: "Do you feel that everyone is after your job, and they just might have an unfair advantage? That people can criticize you and it's OK? Are you a white American male? In California, two men have taken up the cause of the beleaguered species. They've written a ballot proposal that, if passed in November, would change affirmative action in California's state hiring and education admissions." Reporter Josh Mankiewicz charged, "They (Glynn Custred and Tom Wood) are portrayed as `genial scholars,' just two `apolitical professors,' an image Wood and Custred have worked hard to maintain."
<p>
Then Mankiewicz moved to discredit them: "The two are key figures in a conservative organization...very critical of many aspects of higher education, including black and women's studies, sexual harassment policies, the emphasis on racial diversity, and affirmative action." John Leo of U.S. News & World Report took exception to the Mankiewicz segment in the February 19 issue: "Senator Joe himself couldn't have phrased this better. It artfully left the impression that NAS [the National Association of Scholars, to which Wood and Custred belong] is a sinister, antiwoman, antiblack group." In fact, Leo noted that "a prominent Marxist, Eugene Genovese, sits on the board of advisers."
<p>
Mankiewicz criticized the men for not having statistics on how many white men have suffered discrimination, but Leo pointed out "Nobody has good statistics on this. Since a lot of reverse discrimination is legal under Title VII [of the Civil Rights Act], many who are hurt by it never bother to file any complaints and thus don't get counted."
<p>

<h3>Judge Baer Not Bared.</h3>
<p>
When Federal Judge Harold Baer threw out the key evidence  in a New York drug arrest, $4 million in cocaine and heroin, only one news magazine noted that the Clinton administration had appointed the judge. All four networks ran stories on the case, explaining how the judge tossed the evidence, which officers found in a duffel bag they earlier saw being placed inside a car, under the guise of it being obtained through an illegal search. A story on NBC's February 6 Dateline noted that the woman charged admitted to being a drug runner and that Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan (D-N.Y.) now regretted suggesting Baer be nominated. But none of the networks noted the Clinton link. 
<p>
U.S. News & World Report was the only news magazine to make the connection between Clinton and Baer. However reporter Ted Gest, writing in the February 12 issue, failed to tie Baer's ruling with any liberal leanings. Analyzing the administration's judicial choices, he wrote, "Clinton's Supreme Court choices, Ruth Bader Ginsburg and Stephen Breyer, are moderates, and so are most of his lower court appointees...Assistant Attorney General Eleanor Acheson...stresses diversity without sacrificing quality." Quality that let a $4 million admitted drug trafficker go free.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In recent years, the debate over gun policy has been dominated by two federal initiatives: the Brady bill's waiting period for the purchase of handguns and the ban on so-called assault weapons. While these federal issues have riveted the nation's attention, however, a quiet revolution in gun policy has spread throughout the states. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Ten years ago, only a half-dozen states routinely issued permits for trained citizens to carry concealed handguns for personal protection. Most states gave police departments wide latitude to issue such permits, which were rarely given to persons other than retired police officers and people with political connections. Today, however, 30 states comprising half the nation's population grant concealed-carry permits to law-abiding citizens. In the long run, this movement will be far more significant than either the Brady waiting period (which expires in 1998) or the ban on certain semiautomatics (which expires in 2004).	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This movement began in the early 1980s, when gun-rights activists in Florida joined with law-enforcement lobbies such as the Florida Chiefs of Police Association to reform the state's handgun law. They proposed legislation that entitled any citizen who clears a fingerprint-based background check and passes gun-safety classes to receive a permit to carry a concealed handgun for protection.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Although the legislature passed the concealed-carry bill several times, it was vetoed repeatedly by Democratic governor Bob Graham. But his successor, Republican governor Bob Martinez, signed the bill in 1987. Since then, a steady progression of states has adopted concealed-carry laws modeled on Florida's, and more are likely to follow.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Whenever a state legislature first considers a concealed-carry bill, opponents typically warn of horrible consequences: Permit holders will slaughter each other in traffic disputes, while would-be Rambos shoot bystanders in incompetent attempts to thwart crime. But within a year of passage, the issue usually drops off the news media's radar screen, while gun-control advocates in the legislature conclude that the law wasn't so bad after all.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In some respects, the concealed-carry movement has become a women's issue. In fact, about a quarter of those who apply for and receive carry permits are women. When Alaska governor Walter Hickel signed concealed-carry legislation in 1993, he explained that the constituents he found most compelling were "the women who called and said they worked late and had to cross dark parking lots, and why couldn't they carry a concealed gun?"	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Leading <a href="http://www.moa.sonnet.com/nvrpc/index.html">advocates</a> for concealed-carry laws include female victims of crime such as Suzanna Gratia Hupp, whose parents were murdered five years ago in a mass killing in Killeen, Texas; Rebecca John Wyatt, the founder of <a href="http://web.wn.net/~usr/chris/web/swarm.html">Safety for Women and Responsible Motherhood</a>; and Marion Hammer, the new president of the <a href="http://www.nra.org">National Rifle Association</a> and an activist in the Florida concealed-carry debate. Hammer once brandished her handgun to ward off a gang of would-be robbers.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Has this movement toward concealed-carry laws made America safer or more dangerous? In an article for the Tennessee Law Review, historian Clayton Cramer and I examined homicide rates in states that had adopted concealed-carry laws, adjusted for the effects of national homicide trends. In all but one state we examined, homicide rates did not appear to change as a result of the laws. We saw fluctuations, of course, but nothing out of the ordinary.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The lone exception was Florida, where the murder rate started an immediate, steady decline. Before the law, Floridians were about 36 percent more likely to be murdered than other Americans; after a few years, the Florida rate was equal to or slightly less than the national rate. As for other violent crimes, Florida was the worst state in the nation both before and after the new law. Florida's overall violent-crime rate, however, rose much more slowly since 1987 than did the national violent-crime rate.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;We also examined violent-crime data in California, where permit policies vary widely by county. Counties that issue permits liberally had lower violent-crime rates than counties with restrictive policies; restrictive counties had lower rates than counties with prohibitive policies. A graduate student at Southwest Texas State University compared states that adopted concealed-carry laws with demographically similar states that did not. This study found strong support for the hypothesis that concealed-carry laws reduce the homicide rate, and weak (but still positive) support for a reduction in robbery and serious assault.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Advocates of gun-control advocates sometimes cite a 1995 study of concealed-carry policies by three researchers from the University of Maryland. The study looked at five urban areas and found that in four of them, the handgun homicide rate rose after a concealed-carry law had been enacted. But David McDowall, one of the authors, says that the small set of data limits the conclusions to be drawn from the study. He also states that there is no evidence permit holders commit crimes. The study is a classic illustration of how changing the parameters of a "before-and-after" analysis can change the results. For each city, McDowall and his colleagues averaged the yearly crime rates from 1973 until the year before the law went into effect, and compared that figure to the average rate of all subsequent years. If, instead, we compare the year before the law went into effect with the most recent year for which we have complete data (1994), then the homicide rate declined in three of the five cities.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;All of the research about concealed- carry laws has been eclipsed by a comprehensive study by University of Chicago law professor John Lott, with graduate student David Mustard. Examining crime data for 3,054 counties, Lott and Mustard found that while concealed-carry reform had little effect in rural counties, in urban counties reform was followed by a substantial reduction in homicide and other violent crimes such as robbery. At the same time, there was a statistically significant rise in nonconfrontational property crimes, such as larceny and car theft. Apparently many criminals concluded that the risks of encountering a victim who could fight back had become too high.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Lott and Mustard estimated that if all states that did not have concealed carry laws in 1992 adopted such laws, there would be approximately 1,800 fewer murders and 3,000 fewer rapes annually. Thus the adoption or improvement of concealed carry laws in more than a dozen states since 1992 may be one of several causes for the current decline in murder rates.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Of course, data alone cannot measure the benefits of concealed-carry reform. If a gun permit helps a woman feel safe enough to go jogging, her increased sense of security is an important social benefit--even if she never has to draw a gun. If she does encounter a criminal, the chances are small that she will actually have to fire, and less than 1 percent that he will take the gun away. In the most thorough study ever done on this subject, Florida State University criminologist Gary Kleck found that most instances of a citizen drawing a gun in self-defense end with the assailant simply retreating.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Although solid proof of the effect of concealed-carry laws in reducing violent crime is relatively recent, it has long been clear that they do not threaten public safety. The most detailed information we have about the behavior of such permit holders comes from Dade County, Florida.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;When Florida's law went into effect, Miami's police chief ordered his officers to compile detailed reports of all police encounters with permit holders. In Miami, the number of permits increased from 1,200 in September 1987 to 21,092 in August 1992, when the police department decided that the behavior of permit holders did not merit further study. In five years, permit holders were convicted in these instances of criminal misuse of a firearm: two cases of aggravated assault involving a firearm, one case of armed trespass, and one case of a motorist shooting at another driver. In addition, one permit holder unthinkingly attempted to enter the secure area at Miami's airport with a firearm in her purse, and another accidentally shot himself in the leg. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The Dade County police also recorded the following incidents involving defensive use of licensed concealed firearms: two robbery cases in which the permit holder produced a firearm and the robbers fled; two cases involving permit holders who intervened to attempt to stop a robbery, but the robbers were not apprehended (and no one else was hurt); one robbery victim whose gun was seized by the robber; a man who shot a pit bull that was attacking him; two cases of a citizen capturing a burglar; three cases of a burglar who was frightened off but not captured; one case of thwarted rape; and a bail bondsman who fired two shots at a fleeing bail-jumper wanted for armed robbery. There were no reports of permit holders shooting innocent people by accident.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;In Florida as a whole, 315,000 permits had been issued by December 31, 1995. Only five had been revoked because the permit holder committed a violent crime with a gun. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Permit holders are not angels, but they are an unusually law-abiding collection of citizens. In Florida, for example, permit holders are about 300 times less likely to perpetrate a gun crime than Floridians without permits. Florida's experience has been copied nationwide. This should not be at all surprising: A person could carry a concealed handgun without a permit and, unless he gives himself away by committing some other offense, he would never be caught. Hence permit applicants tend to be those citizens willing to pay a large fee (usually more than $100) to comply with a law they could probably break with impunity.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Although 1 to 4 percent of the adult population exercises the freedom to carry a handgun for protection, a much larger group believes they should have such a choice. Polls usually show that one-half to two-thirds of the population supports concealed-carry laws. Higher rates are reported when respondents are informed about the various restrictions--such as training requirements--typically included in concealed-carry laws. These laws appeal to citizens who object neither to gun ownership nor to the use of force in self-defense, yet welcome moderate regulation to screen out undesirables.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Similarly, law-enforcement organizations in many states have supported concealed-carry laws. In Colorado, 53 of the state's 63 sheriffs voluntarily issue carry permits to citizens who pass a background check--even in liberal Boulder County. As these peace officers recognize, the government cannot in practice guarantee the safety of citizens in their daily lives. Therefore government must not prevent a responsible, trained individual from seeking to protect herself. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The concealed-carry movement is based on the principle that responsible citizens should not expect government to provide them with the essentials of life. Providing for the safety of one's self and one's family is first of all a personal duty.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Of course, everyone is a potential beneficiary of concealed-carry reform. Since criminals do not know which of their potential victims may be armed, even persons without carry permits would enjoy increased safety from any deterrent effect. Moreover, a Psychology Today study of "good Samaritans" who came to the aid of violent-crime victims found that 81 percent were gun owners, and many of them carried guns in their cars or on their persons.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Concealed-carry reform is no panacea for the high rates of crime in this nation, but it will be an important component of an anticrime strategy based on the right and duty of good citizens to take responsibility for public safety.

<b><a name="citizen">Citizen Initiatives Fertilize the Grass Roots</a><br>
By Lawrence W. Reed</b>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	There may be no better barometer of citizen involvement in politics than ballot initiatives, and this year's bountiful crop suggests that activism at the state level is surging. Grass-roots conservative activists are not waiting for the Republican Congress to take up their causes. From school choice to tax cuts to affirmative action, ballot issues backed by conservatives seem to outnumber liberal causes for the first time in recent elections.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Initiatives reach state ballots after aroused citizens surmount an obstacle course of petition requirements, filing deadlines, and occasional court or legislative challenges. Designed to amend state constitutions or enact statutory law, they allow disaffected voters in the 24 states that permit them to vent their frustrations and allow activists to force reforms past unwilling legislators.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;From 1981 through 1992, according to the Council of State Governments, 346 initiatives appeared on state ballots--more than in the previous 40 years. Eighty-eight more were put before voters in 1994. By early May of this year, 26 initiatives had qualified for the ballot of November 5, 1996, while petitions were still circulating on behalf of about 300 others. In the end, only a small fraction will actually make it onto the ballot. This year's proposals tackle some of the most contentious issues in American politics:	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Affirmative action. Kolt Z. Jones, an expert on initiatives at <a href="/atr/1.html">Americans for Tax Reform,</a> says that all points of the spectrum are represented by this year's initiatives. Liberals back measures to raise minimum wages in several states and to limit campaign spending; conservatives are pushing term limits, supermajority requirements for tax hikes, charter schools, and school vouchers. But "the mother of them all," he says, is the <a href="http://www.publicaffairsweb.com/ccri/">California Civil Rights Initiative (CCRI).</a> 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;CCRI would ban the state from discriminating against or granting preferential treatment to any individual on the basis of race, sex, or ethnicity in public employment, public education, or public contracting. It would effectively end affirmative action in California state government. Passage of the initiative, says Brian T. Kennedy of the <a href="/claremont">Claremont Institute's</a> Sacramento office, "would be more than a first step in rolling back affirmative action across America, it would be a giant leap in that direction." Similar initiatives to prohibit racial discrimination are circulating in Florida, Michigan, Oregon, and Washington, but the fate of CCRI  could decide the course of the movement to roll back racial and gender preferences.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Although polls have consistently shown strong support for the initiative, millions of dollars in attack ads may narrow the margin between now and November. Still, a strong antiquotas measure on the ballot cannot be good for Bill Clinton. Says Katherine Post of the Pacific Research Institute in San Francisco, "The California Civil Rights Initiative poses a big problem for the president, who has hedged on the issue of preference programs with a 'mend, don't end' policy. California is critical to the Clinton re-election strategy and if the president comes out on the popular side of the issue, he would alienate core constituencies of his own party everywhere." (For more information, contact the Claremont Institute at 909-621-6825, or the Pacific Research Institute at 415-989-0833. Also, see <a href="/heritage/p_review/jul96/pipes.html">"Smart Women, Foolish Quotas,"</a> by Sally C. Pipes and Michael Lynch, page 30.)	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Political reform. Two of the four initiatives that have qualified for the California ballot so far would cap contributions to political campaigns. The one backed by Common Cause would put stiff limits on personal contributions to local and state campaigns. Observers think the limits are so low that they would virtually end TV campaign ads in California. The other measure, pushed by Naderite groups, contains similar restrictions with a loophole that would permit unions to get around the limits.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;On the conservative side of political reform, the term-limits juggernaut has put initiatives on the ballot in Wyoming and Maine, while other measures still need signatures to qualify in Alaska, Florida, and Nevada. At least 22 states have already enacted term limits for state and/or federal officeholders, all but one through citizen initiatives. (For more information, contact Citizens for Term Limits at 703-421-8635 or <a href="http://www.termlimits.org/ustl.shtml">U.S. Term Limits</a> at 202-393-6440.)	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Minimum wage. The drive in Congress to raise the federal minimum wage to $5.15 an hour parallels a similar effort at the state level. Most economists agree that no legislature can make a person worth a certain amount by making it illegal to pay him less. One suspects that organized labor is more interested in attracting Democratic voters to the polls than in helping the downtrodden worker. 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;An initiative to raise the statewide minimum wage in California may qualify for the ballot. This proposal would hike the minimum wage to $5 in 1997 and to $5.75 a year later. The main sponsor, not surprisingly, is the <a href="http://www.aflcio.org">AFL-CIO</a>. A ballot measure in the District of Columbia, if approved, would raise the minimum to $6.75 over three years. A similar initiative in Oregon would boost the state's minimum wage from $4.75 to $6.50.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The preamble to the Oregon initiative touts the measure this way: "[T]o increase economic independence, to reduce the need for public benefits, to enable families to raise their children in dignity, to increase meaningful employment, to increase the purchasing power of low-income citizens, and thereby expand the tax base, Oregon law is revised to create a more livable minimum wage." Says Steve Buckstein of the <a href="http://www.cascadepolicy.org">Cascade Policy Institute</a> in Portland, "Makes you wonder why they didn't raise the minimum to $20 or even $50 per hour. The workers' paradise is just one election away!" (For information about these initiatives, contact the Cascade Policy Institute at 503-242-0900.)	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Tax reform and property rights. This year activists are pushing dozens of initiatives to limit or abolish taxes. Nevadans and Floridians will vote on whether to require a two-thirds "supermajority" vote in the legislature to raise taxes, and similar proposals are circulating in Arizona and Ohio. Proposed initiatives in Arkansas, California, Florida, Michigan, and Missouri would require voter approval, in some cases by a supermajority, of tax increases. Petitions to reform or eliminate property taxes are circulating in at least 10 states.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Florida may get a chance to vote on a measure that requires government to compensate property owners for state actions that harm property values. (For more information, contact Americans for Tax Reform at 202-785-0266.)	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;School choice. The country's hottest school-choice debate is likely to be in Washington state, where voters will face two initiatives that have riled the teacher unions. Jim and Fawn Spady, citizen reformers whose frustration with the public schools finally pushed them into political action, can take most of the credit for getting a charter-school proposal on the ballot. It would allow parents, teachers, or anyone else to organize an independent, deregulated, and publicly funded school, bypassing the local public-school bureaucracy.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Ron Taber, a candidate for state superintendent of schools, led the effort to put a voucher plan before voters. His plan would give parents a voucher worth $3,400 for each school-age child that parents could use at any public or private school with space available.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Bill Baldwin, the president of the Washington Institute for Policy Studies, in Seattle, is optimistic about the proposals. "For the first time in memory," he says, "the people of our state are fed up enough with the WEA [Washington Education Association] to pass one or both of these initiatives. If that happens, we'll break the monopoly grip of both the WEA and the Olympia bureaucracy on our children's education." Petitions to put school-choice measures on the ballot are circulating in Arkansas, Arizona, California, and Florida. (For information, call the Washington Institute for Policy Studies at 206-938-6300.)	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Parental rights. Colorado voters may be the first in the country to vote on a so-called parental-rights amendment, a state constitutional amendment guaranteeing that "the right of parents to direct the upbringing and education of their children shall not be infringed" by government action. This proposal is part of a movement, backed by the advocacy group Of the People, to counter unwanted government interference in such areas as sex education. (For more information, contact Of the People at 703-351-5051.)	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Direct democracy. Initiatives themselves are under attack in Colorado, where voters will decide the fate of a referendum initiated in the legislature. It would stipulate that the state constitution could be amended only by a supermajority of 60 percent of the voters, rather than the current simple majority. In the view of Dennis Polhill of the Independence Institute, in Golden, the plan is to "take power out of the hands of the voters and thereby allow the general assembly, the courts, and the executive branch to operate without fear of citizen initiative." 	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This hostility of legislators toward initiatives is not confined to Colorado. In fact, it may be the rule. Twenty-six states do not permit them at all, and many legislators in the states that do regard them as an unwarranted end run around their own authority. Sometimes, legislatures stymie the implementation of initiatives passed by voters.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;On the other hand, citizen initiatives have sometimes presaged nationwide movements in such issues as tax reform and term limits. State activists are currently circulating groundbreaking petitions that would allow public employees to avoid compulsory union membership, either grant or prohibit legal protections based on sexual orientation, and cap lawyers' contingency fees, among other things.	<p>

<h2>Clara's Heart</h2>
<b>by Laura Morrow</b></center>
<p>
	Clara Barton struggled with bureaucratic insensitivity all her life. Her biggest problem was 
getting official permission to do good.
<p>
	Born Christmas Day, 1821, Barton showed a talent for organizing charity when she 
established the first free public school in Bordentown, New Jersey. After enrollments soared, the 
local school board pushed her aside.
<p>
	When the Civil War erupted, she felt driven to help. After learning that soldiers from her 
home state of Massachusetts were quartered in the U.S. Senate chambers without beds or 
supplies, she brought items from her home and, with her own money, purchased and prepared 
food for them.
<p>
	Barton discovered that ambulances, medical supplies, and hospital construction were not high 
priorities for the Union military bureaucracy. Henry Halleck, the Army's general-in-chief, 
dismissed them as "effeminating comforts." (He felt the same about shoes and shirts.) Union 
soldiers commonly died on the battlefield waiting for treatment, yet the Medical Department, 
valuing bureaucratic ritual over need, refused to change policy. Frustrated, Barton collected 
supplies and personally arranged their distribution.
<p>
	Barton eventually accumulated three warehousefuls of supplies and persuaded the Army to 
help distribute them at the front. At great personal risk -- a bullet ripped through her sleeve at 
Antietam and killed the injured soldier she was aiding -- Barton fed troops and helped evacuate 
the wounded. Nearly two years into the war, the Army finally agreed to contribute supplies to her 
volunteer efforts. She devised a plan for each state to establish a distribution agency where it had 
a substantial regimental presence.
<p>
	Barton encountered bureaucratic resistance everywhere. When the War Department ignored a 
sergeant's requests for a furlough -- despite the fact that both of his arms had been blown off in 
battle -- an outraged Barton escorted him to the office of Massachusetts senator Henry Wilson. 
She then explained that his furlough request was being disregarded and handed the senator the 
necessary paperwork. When Wilson extended his welcome, Barton commented, "You will 
pardon the sergeant for not offering you a hand -- he has none." The soldier left on furlough the 
following day. 
<p>
Exhausted by such struggles, Barton sought rest in Europe. In 1870, the Grand Duchess of Baden 
enlisted her help with the International Red Cross's relief effort for civilian refugees and 
wounded soldiers in the Franco-Prussian War. Admiring the systematic organization and 
efficiency of the institution, Barton undertook a one-woman effort to found an American chapter 
of the Red Cross. She sought congressional approval for the organization's involvement in 
wartime humanitarian aid, but was initially thwarted by fears of foreign entanglements.
<p>
	To make the organization more attractive to an isolationist Congress, Barton expanded its 
proposed focus to include domestic peacetime disaster relief, an expansion later adopted by the 
International Red Cross under the "American Amendment." Finally, in 1881, Barton founded the 
American Association of the Red Cross in Washington, D.C. She was elected its first president.
<p>
	Barton kept the American Red Cross decentralized, giving hands-on authority to local 
chapters. Journalist Joel Chandler Harris (of Uncle Remus fame) praised the charity's efficiency: 
"There are no exhibitions of self-importance. . . . The perfection of its machinery is shown by the 
apparent absence of machinery." 
<p>
	Nevertheless, in 1904, at 81, Barton was maneuvered out of the presidency by socialite Mabel 
Thorp Boardman, who wanted to transform the Red Cross into a more centralized administrative 
structure based on new theories of "scientific management." After leading a failed coup against 
Barton, she vengefully instigated a congressional investigation into the organization. Once the 
investigation vindicated her, Barton resigned.
<p>
	For her life's work, Barton received the German Iron Cross, the Red Cross of Geneva, and the 
Empress Augusta medal, among other honors. "They do brighten up an old dress," she joked. 
She spent her last years caring for relatives, occasionally pinning her medals on her dress before 
going out to milk the cows. She died at 91, in Glen Echo, Maryland.
<p>
	Today, Barton's organization remains volunteer-oriented and decentralized; its ratio of 
volunteers to paid workers is about 50:1. In addition to collecting 6 million units of blood (nearly 
half the nation's entire clinical blood supply) each year, the Red Cross provides aid after natural 
disasters, processes emergency communications between military personnel and their families, 
and offers first aid and medical training.
<p>
	Barton learned early on that charities attract two kinds of people: those concerned with doing 
good and those concerned with looking good. The former want to help; the latter are primarily 
interested in social engineering and self-aggrandizement. Her persistence and character 
ultimately triumphed over bureaucratic interference, making the Red Cross an effective force for 
good -- and one worthy of the memory of Clara Barton.

<P>
<H2>The Heritage Foundation's Foreign Policy and Defense Studies
Department</H2>
<HR>
<P>
The department conducts research and publishes papers on a wide
variety of international political, economic, and security issues.
Because its primary audience is the U.S. Congress, it convenes
working groups; organizes lectures, debates and luncheon talks;
and conducts briefings on timely foreign policy and defense issues
for congressmen and their staffs. Heritage staffers also give
interviews and conduct briefings for radio, television, and newspaper
reporters. 
<P>
Recent major projects include: the publication of the <A
HREF="/heritage/library/categories/forpol/econ_index/toc.html.cgi"<I>Index
of Economic Freedom</A></I>, a quantitative analysis and ranking
of economic freedom in over 100 countries which will be used to
form a new approach to U.S. foreign aid based on free market economic
principles; the publication of  <a href="/townhall/townhall_shop/safe.html">A Safe and Prosperous America</a>,
Heritage's blueprint for future U.S. defense and foreign policy;
and the forthcoming publication of  <I>Defending America: A Near-and-Long
Term Plan to Deploy Missile Defenses </I>, which advocates the
rapid development and deployment of effective missile defenses.
Heritage staffers were instrumental in developing the defense
and foreign policy agenda items in the House Republican &quot;Contract
with America.&quot; Other high priority items include the  Asian
Studies Center , which analyzes political, economic, and security
issues relevant to U.S. policy in Asia; the Russian Reform project,
which seeks to aid the development of democracy and capitalism
in Russia; and the America Trader Initiative, which seeks to promote
global  free trade .

<h2>Bellwethers of Realignment</h2>
<b>By Bernadette Malone</b>
</center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;

Will the surprise election of a Republican majority in the 104th Congress prove to be the first cannonball fired in a full-scale conservative revolution in the federal government, or merely a brief surgical strike to redirect an overreaching president's imprudent agenda? That question, of course, will be determined by the historians.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Regardless of the outcome of the congressional races this November, state legislatures around the country are providing an irrefutable case for an emerging nationwide trend toward a conservative governing philosophy of traditional values, free-market solutions, and smaller government.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; Eighteen state legislative chambers have switched from Democratic to Republican control since the 1994 election -- either by direct election or their legislators' party-switching. (One of these, the Wisconsin senate, reverted back to Democratic rule, but only after a Republican senator was recalled by voters for his support of a tax increase.)<p>

&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	On the national level, conservatism and its standard bearers in Congress haven't had an easy year. Many voters who were enamored of the ideas of Republican candidates in November 1994 are expressing doubt to pollsters that the person they voted for should remain in office in 1997.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But the important thing to remember is that the left's attack on the 104th Congress has focused on the messenger of conservative government -- House Speaker Newt Gingrich -- and not the message. To their apparent advantage in polls, challengers to conservative members of congress lambaste their opponents' allegiance to the vilified and unpopular Speaker.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;This tactic won't work in state legislative races, where most conservative candidates have never met Gingrich, much less voted with him. State office-seekers are able to separate themselves from the government shutdowns and default threats that haunt many of their federal counterparts and concentrate on the local issues that characterize the devolution of Big Government.	<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Here are the key states to watch on November 5th for evidence of the conservative agenda's progress:<p>	<center><b>Florida</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Jeb Bush doesn't think it's necessarily the big changes in this state that highlight Florida's growing conservatism. "It's just a continued, constant march towards changing the relationship of government to the people," explains Bush, who came within 2 percentage points of defeating Lawton Chiles for the governorship in 1994. This past legislative session marks the first time since Reconstruction that Florida's senate is Republican-controlled. And come November, the house will go the way of the senate if the GOP can capture three seats. They are very optimistic: 11 of the 12 representatives retiring this year are Democrats, and most are from districts that Bush, the son of President George Bush, carried over Chiles in his narrow loss.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The mainstay of the Democrats' re-election strategy is their no-new-taxes votes and a record of holding growth in the state budget to only 2 percent this session, reports Susan McManus, a professor of public administration and political science at the University of South Florida. "Florida, like the nation at large, has become more conservative over the years," McManus wrote in a recent paper.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"There's no question Florida is shifting to the right, both philosophically and in terms of party registration," says John Smith, the vice president of the James Madison Institute, in Tallahassee. He cites as examples Florida's stringent welfare bill, which is currently awaiting approval from the federal government; tough crime measures; and a new charter-school system. If Republicans take the senate, a school-voucher bill that died during this session has an excellent chance of passage.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Most indicative of the conservatism blossoming in Florida is the slowing of the state spending machine. Since 1983, Smith says, state spending increases averaged $2.4 billion a year. But spending increases in the two most recent budgets have averaged just $500 million. According to Smith, the 1994 state and federal elections and the spending-cap amendment Floridians voted for (also in 1994) are responsible for this encouraging trend.<p><center><b>Iowa</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	The 1994 electoral tidal wave washed over Iowa's lower chamber, enlarging the Republicans' 51-49 majority to 63-37, but it left the senate in Democratic control by a margin of 27-24. Will the November election be a victory for conservatives in the senate?<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
"It will give them a Republican majority -- but not a conservative influence. That will probably take another election cycle," admits Secretary of State Paul Pate, a Republican and a rising prospect for the governorship. (Governor Terry Branstad is not seeking re-election in 1998.) As a member of the senate from 1989 until 1994, Pate struggled to shepherd conservative bills through his own Republican caucus. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But Pate is confident that some of the Republican candidates running to replace retiring Democrats are solid conservatives who will advance the ball next session. The death penalty, parental notification for minors seeking abortions, and regulatory relief are some major issues Iowa conservatives have been pushing, and all have been obstructed by the Democratic senate.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"The senate was the roadblock to getting any tax cuts at all," says Robert Solt, the research director of Iowans for Tax Relief, of the past legislative session. Under GOP rule, the House introduced an income-tax reduction bill that was supported by Branstad, but thwarted by the more liberal senate. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Eventually the senate compromised and passed a property-tax relief bill. Pointing to this year's state budget surplus of $200 million (compared to 1992's $400 million debt), Solt sees ample opportunity for tax cuts next session if Republicans capture the senate. And Pate cites capital gains and inheritance-tax relief as top priorities of the next legislative session, provided Republicans pick up two senate seats and majority control.<p><center><b>Maine</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Bethel Furniture Stock, located near Maine's border with New Hampshire, makes wood parts for furniture. Leon Favreau is the firm's president and part owner. Although he doesn't consider himself a conservative, he remarks that the country, and especially Maine, have grown more conservative over recent years. His biggest concern of late is a referendum put on the state ballot by environmentalists that would outlaw the harvesting of trees throughout most of the state. "It has the possibility of forcing our operation to close overnight," he says.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In a state supposedly growing more conservative, how does this threat to the economy gain so much steam? Freshman state representative Lisa Lumbra, a Maine native, explains that residents of the state tend to mind their own business, so the governing is usually left to liberal activists. But a bill passed by the state legislature in 1993 granting special rights to homosexuals served as a wakeup call. A recount after the 1994 election turned control of the senate over to the GOP, and left Republicans in the house one seat shy of a majority.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Lumbra is worried that the senate will not be able to retain its control with the retirement of two conservative stalwarts, but the chances of her party becoming the majority in the house are high. Even as the minority party, house Republicans were able to stop funding for a Goals 2000 bill, pass a 15 percent tax cut pending a budget surplus, and stop a $12 million state health program that covered family planning but not hospitalization costs.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	But even if Republicans lose the senate, "the conservative trend will be obvious," Lumbra predicts. There are a few conservative Democrats who will be instrumental in passing a tax cut independent of a budget surplus, deregulating the tree-harvesting industry, and scaling down the state's intrusive Department of Human Services, which Lumbra cites as her constituents' top complaint. Leon Favreau might not consider himself a conservative, but he is voting Republican this year.<p><center><b>Nevada</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;
	Serious welfare reform, mirroring Wisconsin governor Tommy Thompson's plan, was stalled in the assembly this year after votes on the bill were cast entirely along party lines. It tied 21-21. In its place, the assembly passed a welfare bill authorizing more money for employment programs and counseling.

<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Republicans and Democrats have shared the chairmanship over the assembly chamber, which was brought to parity in the 1994 election. All but one of the six representatives retiring this year are Democrats, however, and Republican registration in the state exceeded 50 percent this year for the first time. If all goes as planned, it's round two in Nevada for real welfare reform. Republicans will retain their majority in the senate.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Even if Republicans are unable to take the chamber, "there may be enough external pressure from the president's signature on the federal welfare bill for Democrats to support statewide reform," says Judy Cresanta, the president of the Nevada Policy Research Institute.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Cresanta also thinks that a Republican assembly would take a crack at nepotism in the teachers union and pass property-rights legislation, a winner with voters in a state where 80 percent of the land is owned by the federal government.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	And there's good news for Nevadans on the economic front, too. Carol Vilardo, the president of the Nevada Taxpayers' Association, says, "This is the first year we didn't have to go in [to the legislative session] looking to raise taxes." That's because in the 1991 session, the legislature put an end to automatic spending increases for the coming year based on last year's revenues. This is the first year the new policy's effects were felt.<p><center><b>North Carolina</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The booming Research Triangle and Charlotte metropolitan areas have attracted many urban Yankees over the past decade, which would lead one to assume that the land of Jesse Helms has taken on a liberal tinge. But judging from the size of the gains Republicans made in the general assembly and state senate in 1994 (when they took over the assembly and wound up two seats shy of a majority in the senate), one is prompted to reconsider.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Grassroots Research, a Charlotte-based public opinion company, recently conducted a poll of 500 registered North Carolina voters and found that 81 percent disapprove of the race-based admissions standards at the University of North Carolina, 76 percent favor a constitutional amendment for congressional term limits, and 74 percent believe that someone who earns twice as much as they do should pay no more than twice as much in taxes. This same sample of voters splits its support between Democratic challenger Harvey Gantt and Republican incumbent Jesse Helms in this year's U.S. Senate race. That indicates that, while North Carolinians have doubts about a person associated with conservative ideas this November, they cling faithfully to a conservative agenda.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"The trend in North Carolina to be more fiscally conservative and certainly more conservative all around has extended to the Republican Party," observes senate Minority Leader Betsy Cochran. She foresees her party capturing a slim majority in the senate this fall. If so, a pilot program for school vouchers has an good chance of passage, tough welfare reform will be introduced, and quite possibly, affirmative action will be addressed in a "methodical, deliberative manner," she says. <p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	These plans depend on Republicans retaining their majority in the Assembly, and at this point "it's very difficult to predict with any accuracy what's going to happen," says John Hood, the president of the John Locke Foundation, a think tank in Raleigh. Hood wonders whether Republicans can effectively make the case for their election to the public, given the popularity that Democratic governor Jim Hunt has won by cutting taxes after the 1994 elections jolted the legislature. If they really want to distinguish themselves from Democrats, Hood says, they need to go after affirmative action. They just might.<p><center><b>Washington</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	"I know every state claims to be the most liberal in the nation, but we've proved it over the years," laughs Bill Baldwin, the president of the Washington Institute for Policy Studies. But with the prospect of property-tax reduction and regulatory and welfare reform sailing through the legislature next session, Washington is looking a lot different these days.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	When asked about his state's facelift, Senator Dan McDonald, the majority leader, suggests it's "probably because the last million to million and  a half people who have moved to Washington state are more conservative than the people who were their predecessors." He cites an increase in the number of suburban voters and social conservatives in his state as reasons for this trend.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	In 1994, when Republicans picked up 25 house seats (a phenomenon widely attributed to the popularity of the term-limits movement), it was their biggest proportional legislative gain in the country. They control the house 62-36, and are only one seat away for a majority in the senate. Baldwin is optimistic that the policies his think tank endorses will be enacted next year, because twice as many Democrats as Republicans are retiring from the senate this year.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;	Washingtonians will also elect a governor this year, and if it's a Republican, says Baldwin, there is a good chance that the GOP will be able to repeal the state labor law and start privatizing some of its services. What would another Democratic governor do to Baldwin's agenda? "We'll just put referendum clauses on a lot of these things, bypass the governor, and bring these issues straight to the people," says McDonald.<p><center><b>Wisconsin</b></center>
<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;The 1994 gains made by the GOP suffered a setback when Republican state senator George Petak was recalled for breaking his promise and voting for a tax increase to fund a sports stadium. The GOP lost its fragile one-seat majority, and now the GOP must protect the assembly and take back the senate. Before Petak's recall, this legislative session's reform-minded agenda had attracted national attention. Governor Tommy Thompson's rise to the vice presidential short-list was due almost entirely to the welfare reform bill passed by the legislature. "Welfare reform never would have come up for a vote under a Democratically controlled legislature . . . but the final vote was overwhelmingly supportive," says Mary Jo Pauke of the Metropolitan Milwaukee Association of Commerce.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;Another issue that never would have been addressed is abortion, but under the Republican leadership parental-consent and waiting-period laws were passed into law. Pretty ambitious for one term, but conservatives aren't content to rest on their laurels.<p>
&#160; &#160; &#160; &#160; &#160;"For the first time in Wisconsin, people are actually going to see their tax bill go down," notes Steve Baas, the communications director for Assembly Majority Leader Scott Jensen. Republicans are campaigning on a $1-billion tax-relief package as next session's legislative centerpiece that would protect the property-tax cut passed this year, eliminate the marriage penalty in the Wisconsin tax code, give working families a tax credit, implement a supermajority rule for tax increases, and provide a 100 percent capital-gains exemption for family farms and business.

At least one government employee union -- the one representing state and local employees -- has labeled the Contract "evil" and lobbied against it in Congress earlier this year. Guess who paid for the union's lobbying? You did.
<p>
Washington gave the American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees (AFSCME) nearly $150,000 last year -- $150,000 that you and other taxpayers sent to Washington for the urgent needs of the nation.
<p>
You also sent Washington more than $250,000 that was given to the Child Welfare League of America (CWLA) so it could tell Congress that "more children will be killed, more children will be raped" if the Contract with America becomes law.
<p>
The government's generosity with your money goes way beyond groups fighting the Contract with America. For example, $250,000 of your money was given to Families USA, one of the chief backers of the Clinton administration's failed health-care "reform" proposal last year.
<p>
Did anybody from AFSCME, CWLA or Families USA thank you for your generosity? I doubt it, since the underwriting of advocacy groups is one of Washington's dirty little secrets. The government gives your money to political and ideological groups whether you agree with them or not.
<p>
And we're not talking about just a few dollars. American taxpayers provided more than $39 billion to groups championing one cause or another between June 1993 and July 1994, according to a recent Heritage Foundation study. And nobody asked you or any other taxpayer if you want to contribute to any of these causes.
<p>
The reigning champions of this game are the National Council of Senior Citizens, which got $71 million (out of a total budget of about $75 million), and the American Association of Retired Persons, which received $73 million. Other organizations sharing in this bonanza included the AFL-CIO ($2 million), the Environmental Defense Fund ($515,000), the Consumer Federation of America ($610,000), the World Wildlife Fund ($2.6 million), and the League of Women Voters ($611,000).
<p>
Many of these groups are among the most active and visible advocates of more federal spending, higher federal taxes and increased regulation. Their representatives often testify before Congress, routinely provide favorable "public comment" to federal agencies on the latest new regulations, and are quoted regularly as "experts" in the news media.
<p>
To be sure, groups at all points of the political spectrum receive federal money. But by far the majority line up on the "tax and spend" side of things.
<p>
The fact is that during the past 40 years, Congress has created a vast patronage network of organizations that enjoy tax-exempt status, receive billions in federal handouts each year and aggressively lobby on Capitol Hill for bigger government and higher taxes.
<p>
In the old days, it was the Boss Tweeds of the big-city political machines handing out generous political favors. Today, Tweed is the unelected federal bureaucrat handing out billions of dollars worth of federal grants to those who want to maintain the status quo in Washington.
<p>
It's time to get the advocacy groups' hands out of your wallet. Thomas Jefferson put this issue well when he said: "To compel a man to furnish funds for the propagation of ideas he disbelieves is sinful and tyrannical."
<p>
If special interests want your money, they should call and ask you for it. They shouldn't be allowed to take it out of your taxes.

Clinton worried needlessly: None of the network's January 10 evening news shows mentioned Clinton's veto, even after possible GOP opponent Bob Dole took to the Senate floor to criticize Clinton's betrayal. Although the media properly focused on criticism when George Bush broke his "no new taxes" campaign pledge, there was no focus on criticism of Clinton. The media missed another opportunity when Clinton held a press conference January 11. He was peppered with 18 questions, but not one raised the issue of his breaking his welfare promise, the crux of his effort to portray himself as a "New Democrat." 
<p>

<h3>Flattening Forbes. </h3>
At first glance, Steve Forbes' presidential campaign would seem to fulfill the media's standards for a proper Republican candidate: One with sufficiently soft stands on social issues to avoid the "divisive" label. Unable to attack Forbes as extremist (he has suitably "tolerant" stands on such issues as abortion and immigration), in the December 4 Time, Senior Writer Richard Stengel charged that "for all his patrician good humor, Forbes' message and his campaign have begun to show a hard edge." Stengel exploited a tenuous link between Forbes and Senator Jesse Helms' racially-tinged campaigns: "While Forbes generally shuns the politics of exclusion, he has nonetheless attracted to his organization two veterans of Jesse Helms' race-baiting campaigns." 
<p>
He also attacked Forbes' centerpiece flat tax proposal: "Despite his frequent protestations that he understands the needs of the average Joe, his flat-tax proposal would reward wealthy investors while leaving the burden on middle-class families." He added the plan would "do little to disabuse taxpayers of the notion that the rich get a better deal from the tax system." He cited data from the "generally liberal" Citizens for Tax Justice, stating a seventeen percent flat tax would produce a revenue shortfall of $200 billion. The group also claimed Dick Armey's similar flat tax plan would raise taxes on middle class families, estimating increases in the $1,740-$4,600 range on families earning between $45,000 and $85,000. 
<p>
Stengel didn't quote a conservative expert, but for a balancing view he could have referred to Time's very own flat tax analysis of April 17, when a CPA estimated how much tax a hypothetical family of four making $50,000 could expect to pay under the Armey plan. Time found the family's taxes would be cut by almost half, from $4,249 under the existing system to $2,244 under the Armey plan.
<p>

<h3>DeParle's Platform.</h3>
Twice in December, The New York Times provided a platform for reporter Jason DeParle's personal crusade against Republican welfare reforms. In the December 17 New York Times Magazine he depicted a post-welfare reform nightmare. DeParle wrote his story as an encyclopedia entry from the year 2015 that took a look back at the history of welfare. 
<p>
The fictitious excerpt presented welfare reform as an initial success when left to the states until a recession hit in 1999: "Faced with declining revenues and rising aid requests, states slashed their payments....With families crossing borders in search of aid, the `race to the bottom' ensued, with each state trying to be as tough as its neighbors." DeParle described an almost apocalyptic state where mothers were "arrested each year for locking their children in cars as they worked." DeParle predicted a million families would be "lining up at shelters, stealing into abandoned buildings and begging on street corners." DeParle continued his gloomy forecast: "Some became more reliant on abusive boyfriends, and reports of domestic violence rose. Abortion rates hit record levels and so did arrests for prostitution, leading several cities to decriminalize the practice in specified red-light zones."
<p>

DeParle's Other Platform. Two weeks earlier in a Times "Week in Review" piece, DeParle charged: "While the Republicans promise that the poor will prosper, the evidence does not. Indeed, most suggests the opposite: whether the economy or poor people are ultimately to blame, most will fail to replace their lost benefits. If the past is a guide, less will not mean more. Less will mean less, for those who already have little." 
<p>
DeParle criticized the GOP plan to let states run welfare, taking on supposed GOP arguments such as "The programs don't help much anyway," and "Earnings will improve with time." DeParle even refuted the notion that the poor actually "will be better off by working," answering: "Or will they? No one knows how many of the five million women of AFDC will be able to find and keep work. Many have few skills and lead the kinds of chaotic lives that interfere with full-time work: sick kids, dangerous neighborhoods, abusive boyfriends, broken cars."
<p>

<h3>Newt the Destroyer? </h3>
ABC previewed the Democratic strategy to hang Republican Tom Campbell with the "Newtoid" tag, but when the strategy backfired ABC ignored the results. In Carol Lin's December 10 piece for World News Sunday she highlighted Democrat Jerry Estruth's effort to defeat Republican Campbell in a special congessional election to replace retiring Democrat Norman Mineta. Anchor Carole Simpson introduced the story: "For all of Mr. Gingrich's power on Capitol Hill, opinion polls show his star is fading with American voters. So much so that one congressional candidate in California is using the Gingrich image to beat down his once-popular Republican opponent." 
<p>
Lin reported Campbell at one point had enjoyed a 43-point lead over Estruth. "Yet this political novice has managed to cut his popular Republican opponent's lead in half. By redefining the enemy. Estruth launched an ad campaign attacking House Speaker Newt Gingrich. And labeling Tom Campbell as a Gingrich clone." Lin pointed out that Campbell was more moderate than the Speaker on many issues, "But the strategy seems to be working. With more than a million dollars in donations pouring in." Lin continued, "Democrats hope Gingrich's negatives will be the central issue that can turn election campaigns across the country," before concluding: "Campbell is still the front runner in this race but only by a narrow margin. Democrats say that alone is still a victory for their party. Because they found their weapon. The man who started the Republican revolution may give frustrated voters reason enough to bring more Democrats back to office."
<p>
So, did ABC make it a big story when Campbell trounced Estruth by 23 points on December 12? No, not a word about the result on World News Tonight.  
<p>

<h3>Hot Media Air.</h3>
CBS and ABC have recently portrayed House Republicans as the catalysts to impending global doom, but have ignored scientific studies which back the GOP. "Some House Republicans are objecting to the global agreement to ban industrial chemicals widely believed to be depleting the earth's ozone layer," Dan Rather intoned on the November 23 CBS Evening News. Eric Engberg explained "that 150 countries have signed a treaty banning production of ozone depleting chemicals," but "to the number three Republican in the House, it's Chicken Little Stuff...Time out! Not proven? Didn't this year's Nobel Prize in chemistry go to Dr. Mario Molina and two others who discovered ozone depletion?" 
<p>
Over a month later, ABC's January 4 World News Tonight ran another alarmist warning. Peter Jennings began: "Two thousand scientists from all over the world agree the earth is getting warmer all the time, in part because the United States is not practicing what it has been preaching." Ned Potter followed, "scientists say if they [temperatures] keep going up as they have heat waves will spread across North America. A third of the world's glaciers will melt, flooding coastlines in dozens of countries. Tropical diseases will spread, exposing large parts of the U.S. to malaria." Potter charged that the Clinton administration "gave in to the petroleum and auto industries" and then he allowed Vice President Al Gore to blame the House GOP. 
<p>
But the need for action isn't so clear. Washington Post science writer Boyce Rensberger reported January 8 that of the three major studies of global temperatures during 1995 one reported an increase in average temperature, one called 1995 "ordinary," and one found some cooling. Guess which two the networks have ignored?
<p>

Moyers On Wages. PBS omnipresence Bill Moyers returned to Milwaukee for the December 19 Frontline to visit two families who suffered layoffs in 1991 at the motor company Briggs and Stratton. Moyers complained: "Good-paying jobs are heading south or out of the country and workers like Tony Neumann are searching desperately for new jobs that will support their families...In the early '90s, families like the Stanleys and Neumanns were thrown into a emerging new economy built on light manufacturing and service jobs. It was a time when unemployment hit record lows. But many of the new jobs offered only part-time work and no benefits, and they paid lower wages." Moyers concluded the show: "For working people all over America, real wages continue to decline."
<p>
But in a review on the morning before the show, a sequel to the 1992 program Minimum Wages, Washington Post reporter Steven Pearlstein told a story Moyers didn't: "In fact, today there are 12,000 more manufacturing jobs in the Milwaukee area than there were in the fall of 1991 when Claude Stanley and Tony Neumann were laid off, while the average hourly wage in manufacturing has climbed from $12.54 an hour to $13.98, just about keeping pace with inflation." Pearlstein added that Briggs and Stratton motors are now cheaper for consumers and the company is making money for its stockholders.
<p>

Rather Embarrassed. While on Denver's KOA talk radio host Mike Rosen's program, Dan Rather tried to defend himself and his network against charges of bias. Rosen questioned Rather's repeated use of the word "cut" when describing the Republican Medicare plan on the CBS Evening News. Rather shot back, "Some of the time we use the language, `Medicare cuts,' which is what the Democrats insist these are, and some of the time we use that these are, `cuts in the rate of growth for Medicare,' which is what the Republicans prefer. We try to walk that line, we try to call it one way one time, one way the next time."
<p>
A review of Evening News broadcasts from September 20, the night before the Republicans unveiled their Medicare plan, to November 28, when Rather appeared on Rosen's program, shows the CBS anchor should pay closer attention to what comes out of his mouth. During this period, Rather used the Democratic spin term `cuts' eight times such as when Rather announced as fact on September 20: "Democrats and Republicans in Congress late today came close to actual physical blows over proposed cuts in Medicare. That's the separate U.S. government health care coverage for 37 million older Americans of all income levels. There's no doubt that Medicare spending will be cut, the question is how much and for how many." On October 25 he claimed that "Republicans vowed to press for huge cuts in government spending and $245 billion in tax cuts. President Clinton vowed to veto it as too radical and extreme."
<p>

He applied the phrase that best described reality, "reducing the rate of growth," or "reducing spending" three times. He relayed the Republican spin, "making the plan solvent" just once; hardly the "one way one time, one way the next time" which Rather claimed.

BADEN</P><P>           EACH June, at the end of the academic year, I head back to FREE's office in Bozeman, Mont., and spend the summer on a nearby ranch. I cannot imagine a better &quot;commute&quot; than between Seattle and the northern reaches of the Yellowstone ecosystem. On these drives I always recall John Steinbeck's suggestion that Montana would be heaven if it only had an ocean. And I wonder how we can preserve these values.</P><P>       A hint comes from the recent Forbes magazine featuring Bill Gates. I respect Gates, not for his billions, but for his innovation and entrepreneurship. He has created value through a mix of intelligence, inspiration and force of will.</P><P>     Our environment needs such an entrepreneur, a person who can discover a new paradigm for recognizing those values, like biodiversity, which are outside today's market. But all too often there is no good link between our environmental values and large, bureaucratic institutions. Multimillion-dollar environmental groups lobby Congress for more laws while corporations lobby to resist.</P><P>     The losers in this environmental policy arena often end up in court in an effort to win what was lost in Congress. Environmental laws and backup bureaucracies slog along with unsatisfactory results. The options are discouraging.</P><P>     We need more innovation from small and quick organizations with site-specific information, and local as well as global concern. We need creative institutions whose leaders find ways to reach environmental values economically and economic values environmentally. Responsible liberty is a requisite to such success.</P><P>     Government can only do so much. It can change the rules of the game to the benefit of this group or that, but as the timber industry has learned, tides can quickly change. Since we can only rent - never buy - politicians, no battle is won, only prolonged. And government seldom creates. It seldom finds ways to make the pie larger, only different ways to cut it - often with a huge kerf in the form of overhead and inefficiency.</P><P>     From society's perspective, successful entrepreneurs are the</P><P> chefs who create new and better dishes from ingredients and combinations not previously seen or realized. They provide the closest thing we have to a free lunch, and they respond quickly to changing tastes and preferences.</P><P>     A small number of environmental entrepreneurs have long been with us. The Boone and Crockett Club, led by Teddy Roosevelt, was founded in 1887 by America's first conservationists.</P><P>     On my way to Montana I will pass near the club's recently established Theodore Roosevelt Memorial Ranch. The ranch's mission is to find ways in which wildlife and ranching can peacefully and productively coexist. It is to be a profitable ranch and a wildlife research center.</P><P>     If it is successful, and so far it seems to be, the ranch will be a model for others. By encouraging species to which many ranchers are hostile, and by succeeding, it can aid ecological balance throughout the West. Wolf reintroduction, for example, is unlikely to succeed if ranchers cannot manage their impact. My wife and I know from experience on our ranch how difficult predators can be. The Roosevelt Ranch may show ranchers how predators may be accommodated with minimal loss of livestock. If so, their presence surely would enhance the West.</P><P>     Closer to Seattle, The Village Conservancy is seeking new ways to insert environmentally sensitive housing into natural environments without diminishing those environments.</P><P>     A nonprofit group, the Conservancy seeks to bring landowners together to create low-impact communities in which individuals will have only minimal land for their homes while jointly owning surrounding acreage, which would be managed for aesthetic and conservation values. Such a trial project by The Village Conservancy for the North Fork Valley of Issaquah Creek was authorized recently by the King County Council.</P><P>     Governmental authorization of innovative land use is unusual and commendable. Such action implies intelligence and political courage.</P><P>     Environmental entrepreneurs produce social value by identifying new opportunities and motivating action. In this way, voluntary grass-roots cooperation fosters our environmental goals. The small associations envisioned by The Village Conservancy must, if they are to function effectively, be created by mutual consent and mutual interest. They are unlikely to be the solution for everyone.</P><P>     But with new options, like those envisioned by The Village Conservancy, the more likely we are to harmonize liberty, prosperity, and ecology.</P><P>     Whether it be integrating an old way of life with more recent environmental concerns, as on the Roosevelt Ranch, or creating new communities and associations centered around environment conservation with The Village Conservancy, environmental entrepreneurship shows its value.</P><P>___________ </P><P> John A. Baden, Ph.D., is chairman of the Foundation for Research on Economics and the Environment (FREE) and teaches in the University of Washington Business School.

<p>
<a name="mediscare">TAXPAYER-SUBSIDIZED MEDISCARE CAMPAIGN</a>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;In the summer of 1995, a myriad of taxpayer-subsidized special-interest groups joined together to frighten senior citizens into believing that attempts to reform the Medicare system are really attempts to "steal" their health care. In effect, elderly Americans were being forced to subsidize their own trip through the Haunted Medicare House.
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;A June 27, 1995, "Medicare Message" distributed by the House Democratic Leadership refers to six taxpayer-subsidized organizations involved in the effort to "talk about the devastating effects of the Republican Medicare cuts."  These organizations received nearly $80 million in federal funding between July 1993 and June 1994:<ul>
<p><li>AFL-CIO ($2,038,000)
<p><li>Families USA ($250,000)
<p><li>Service Employees International Union ($137,000)
<p><li>Save Our Security ($100,000)
<p><li>AARP ($76,000,000)
<p><li>American Federation of State, County and Municipal Employees ($148,000)
</ul><p>


<a name="congress">CONGRESS NOW LIVES UNDER THE SAME LAWS AS OTHER EMPLOYERS</a>
<p>The Congressional Accountability Act applied the following laws to Congress:<ul>
<li>Age Discrimination in Employment Act
<li>Americans With Disabilities Act
<li>Civil Rights Act
<li>Employee Polygraph Protection Act
<li>Fair Labor Standards Act
<li>Family and Medical Leave Act
<li>National Labor Relations Act
<li>Occupational Safety and Health Act
<li>Rehabilitation Act
<li>Worker Adjustment and Retraining Notification Act</ul>
<p>
&#160;&#160;&#160;&#160;Sponsors' hopes that Congress would be more attentive to burdens these laws place on Americans once the laws applied to Congress have been confirmed. Shortly after these laws took effect on Capitol Hill, the House and Senate began considering legislation to allow employers to offer compensatory time off rather than overtime pay for employees working extra hours.

<h2>On the Bright Side, from the January 1996 MediaWatch</h2>
<p>
<h3>Nightline's True Story</h3>
<p>
ABC News has never been eager to report the truth on GOP efforts to reform Medicare. Good Morning America anchor Morton Dean continually got the story wrong. On October 12 Dean relayed the Democratic line: "The Republican plan would cut $270 billion in Medicare spending over seven years." Exactly two months and scores of inaccurate reports later, ABC finally told the truth with a December 12 Nightline dedicated to exposing President Clinton's demagoguery.
<p>
Chris Bury explained the game, "`Devastate, destroy, dismantle` -- strong words, but in reviewing Mr. Clinton's performance on Medicare, Republicans have another word in mind: deceptive...The truth is, both President Clinton and the Congress want to spend more money, not less, on Medicare."
<p>
Reviewing Hillary Clinton's 1993 appearance before Congress, Bury showed the First Lady's testimony where she proclaimed that her health plan reduced "the rate of growth in Medicare from about 11 percent increase annually to about a 6 or 7 percent increase annually." Then Bury added, "But this year, when Republicans proposed to slow the annual growth of Medicare spending to 7.2 percent...President Clinton accused them of gutting the program."
<p>
Bury concluded his report: "Since August, when President Clinton cast himself in the role of Medicare's protector, his own standing in the polls has risen steadily, and though his performance has been a smashing popular success, many critics believe the price of admission has cost the country an honest debate."

When Republicans began to tinker with the welfare system, reporters were quick to point out the millions who would end up in poverty as a result. But on the November 19 60 Minutes, CBS' Lesley Stahl offered a different take when she profiled "a woman who knows as much about the subject as anyone. A woman on welfare? No, a woman on the subject of welfare."
<p>
She was Eloise Anderson, head of California's welfare division. Anderson knows what welfare is like; she was once on it. She  also supports Republican proposals. Stahl noted: "What Anderson wants to get rid of are the cash payments that go directly to welfare recipients, known as AFDC....It seems there's no argument for AFDC that she agrees with. The problem, she says, starts with the way welfare marginalizes men, because no poor man who makes the minimum wage, can compete with it."
<p>
Stahl pointed out: "Her critics have called her everything from mean-spirited to compassionless, but Anderson says it's a question of fairness to low-income workers who pay taxes."  As for fears of disaster, "Anderson says there will be no excuse for not taking a minimum wage job when the cash payments end, because poor people will still get help; with food stamps, medical coverage, and child care."

<title>Renaissance Man -- Heritage </title>
<center>
<h2> Renaissance Man</h2>
<p>

<a href="/heritage">The Heritage Foundation</a><br>
August 17, 1995<br>

	I was telling some of my colleagues the other day about the remarkable career of my friend J. William (Bill) Middendorf II, and it occurred to me how few renaissance men grace today's world. It's our loss.
<p>	Today, Americans seem most impressed by two-sport athletes, billionaire investors, tell-all sex therapists, and actors, models and politicians who can chew gum and tie their shoelaces at the same time. Deion Sanders of Atlanta is a hero because he plays both professional baseball and football. When I was in college, 6-foot, 10-inch Gene Conley played center for the Boston Celtics, and during the off-season threw fastballs for the Red Sox. Basketball superstar Michael Jordan of the Chicago Bulls gave baseball a try, but several hundred feeble at-bats later decided to return full-time to his specialty.
<p>	I mean no disrespect toward professional athletes, but if this -- or the professional politicians who inhabit Washington and our state capitals -- constitute America's vision of the heroic man (and I include the distaff side here, too, of course) we are in big trouble.
<p>	The classic renaissance man is rare enough. Thomas Jefferson, our third president, was an architect, diplomat, lawyer, political philosopher, scientist and brilliant writer. He founded and designed the original campus of the University of Virginia, near his beloved Charlottesville estate, Monticello. Benjamin Franklin was a scientist and statesman, founder -- in 1794 -- of the U.S. Post Office, and among the co-authors, with Jefferson, of the Declaration of Independence. Theodore Roosevelt was a politician, statesman, conservationist, and outdoorsman. In 1906, he was awarded the Nobel Peace Prize for his role in ending the Russian-Japanese War. 
<p>	A wonderful new book, "The Sign of the Golden Grasshopper," by the late Perry Gresham (Jameson Books, $24.95), tells the story of Gresham's ancestral hero, Sir Thomas Gresham, the merchant adventurer who served as financial advisor to four British monarchs, Henry VIII, Edward VI, Mary I and Elizabeth I. (Gresham's law: "Bad money drives out good.") 
<p>	The book takes its name from the Gresham family coat of arms. Once reputed to be the richest man in England, Sir Thomas, when not advising monarchs or amassing fortunes, was a spy, royal smuggler, diplomat and early philanthropist. He is credited with almost single-handedly saving the realm (a fancy term for "the throne" to us non-Anglophiles) from its wealthier rival, King Philip II of Spain. He had a helping hand, of course, from Sir Francis Drake, the global explorer who in 1588 led the British fleet against Spain's supposedly invincible Armada (much of which ended up on the rocks off the coast of Ireland, thanks to heavy seas and bad weather.)
<p>	While Bill Middendorf has never been a spy or smuggler like Gresham, to the best of my knowledge many other titles certainly fit: diplomat, financier and philanthropist. An investment banker, now in his mid-70s, Middendorf served three U.S. presidents, as U.S. Ambassador to the Netherlands, Secretary of the Navy, U.S. Ambassador to the Organization of American States, and U.S. Ambassador to the European Community.
<p>	But that's only the public man. He is also an art critic and historian, composer (of seven symphonies, an opera, and numerous marches, including the "Heritage Foundation March" and "U.S. Naval Academy March"), and an accomplished athlete: winning the national masters sculling championship in 1979 and the world masters rowing championship in 1985, at the age of 61. 
<p>	There are very few giants such as these on the scene today. Compared to the likes of Middendorf and Gresham, President Clinton is just another crafty lawyer turned career politician and Donald Trump is a four-bit speculator. 
<p>	What ever happened to greatness?

<title>Legislative Hotline</title>

<body>

<p>

<center><h2>Hotline for Week of January 31-February 7</h2></center>

<p>

Welcome to the FRC information line. This message will be updated
Friday, Feb. 7th at the close of business.

<p>

Although Capitol Hill has been relatively involved with confirmation
hearings for Clinton Cabinet appointees, several other issues
have continued to develop.  Among these issues is pro-family 
<a href="#social">Social Security reform</a>, 
<a href="#family">international family planning</a>, and continuing
oppression in San Francisco by <a href="#homosexual">homosexual 
activists</a>.

<p><a name="social">

<h3>Issue One. Pro-family Social Security Reform.</h3>

<p>

On Monday, January 20th, <I>The New York Times</I> ran an editorial by Gary
Bauer, President of the Family Research Council, calling on lawmakers
to preserve the pro-family provisions within our Social Security
system.  The editorial questioned the lack of protection privatization
would offer to America's widows, orphans, and our senior citizens,
and the tax increases average Americans would be saddled with
during the transition.  Bauer cautioned that Social Security does
need reforms and adjustments in order to safeguard its solvency
and prevent a budget crunch, but the ideas being pushed by some
Republicans and libertarian think tanks are bad policy and bad
politics.  Currently Social Security provides compensation for
couples who devote their early years to raising children and it
gives survivor benefits to stay-at-home moms and orphaned children.
Privatization plans leave these widows and orphans out in the
cold.  And they'd mean huge tax increases for over-taxed families.
Privatization also assumes, unrealistically, a booming stock market
for the next 20 years.  In opposition to the recommendations of
the Social Security Advisory Council, Family Research Council
proposes three reforms to save the pro-family policies in our
Social Security system.  First, we have proposed gradually downsizing
of the benefit structure to close the demographic deficit that
will come with the retirement of the baby boomers.  Second, the
current retirement age should be adjusted and indexed to reflect
change in life expectancy among those currently in the workforce.
Third, the payroll tax should be cut by 20% for both workers
and employers, with workers who benefit from the tax cut receiving
a commensurate reduction in growth of future benefits.  Families
work hard to make great sacrifices to raise their children.  They
deserve security when they retire.  While pushing for reform,
FRC will fight to save the pro-family provisions of the Social
Security system.

<p><a name="family">

<h3>Issue Two. International Family Planning.</h3>

<p>

The first pro-life
vote of the 105th Congress will take place mid-February, when
members decide whether or not to release an additional $123 million
to international organizations, of which many perform and promote
abortions as a method of family planning. Last year, the White
House rejected a congressional proposal which would have allowed
$300 million <I>more</I> to go to international family planning.
Why? Because the proposal stipulated that groups could not perform
or actively promote abortions. So essential was abortion to the
administration's &quot;population&quot; mission that population
groups sacrificed $300 million rather than accept pro-life conditions
to the money. From the development assistance budget, more money
is spent on population control than on child survival programs
and other foreign-aid priorities. Pro-life members of Congress
plan to offer an alternative measure which would allow groups
money for international family planning <I>but only</I> if they
agree not to perform or promote abortions. Please contact your
Congressman and Senators and urge them to vote AGAINST the Clinton
administration's resolution and FOR international family planning
restriction proposed by pro-life Members of Congress. Abortion
is not family planning.

<p><a name="homosexual">

<h3>Issue Three. Continuing Oppression by Homosexual Activists
in San Francisco.</h3>

<p>

Earlier this month, the San Francisco Board
of Supervisors instituted a new ordinance requiring companies
that wish to do business in San Francisco to offer &quot;domestic
partnership&quot; benefits to their homosexual employees.  The
Board blocked a United Airlines request for a lease at the San
Francisco airport because the carrier does not extend domestic
partnership benefits to its gay employees.  But now Archbishop
William Levada of San Francisco has asked Mayor Brown to exempt
Catholic Charities, a non-profit charity which provides $5.5 million
worth of services to the city, from compliance with the new ordinance.
Archbishop Leveda argued the ordinance violates the Church's &quot;ethical
tenets&quot; by mandating that it subsidize a lifestyle which
the Church teaches is intrinsically disordered, immoral, and in
no sense equal to a traditional marriage between one man and one
woman. The Catholic Archdiocese argues that the city's domestic
partnership ordinance violates Catholics' &quot;freedom of religion.&quot;
Mayor Brown argues that Catholic Charities is a service provider,
not a religious institution and therefore should not be exempt
from an ordinance which the city claims is about discrimination.
It is clear from this example that men and women of faith must
be engaged in the political process. What's happening in San Francisco
shows us that we're in a war over values that only one side is
going to win. Nothing less than freedom itself is at stake.

<p>

Thank you for calling the FRC Legislative Hotline.
