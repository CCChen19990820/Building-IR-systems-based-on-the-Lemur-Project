<p><font size="4"><strong>Bill would ensure N.D. pays share of
water tab</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">By Patrick Condon<br>
The Forum<br>
</font><font size="4">BISMARCK, N.D. - The Republican and Democratic
leaders of the House of Representatives will co-sponsor a bill to
ensure that North Dakota will step up to pay its share for the state's
various unfinished water projects.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The bill would allow the North Dakota Water Commission
to issue up to $20 million in government bonds to cover the
state's share of a federal plan to build an outlet out of
flood-stricken Devils Lake, and to complete Garrison Diversion, a system
of pipes and canals that would carry Missouri River water to
eastern North Dakota..</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Rep. John Dorso, R-Fargo, and Rep. Merle Boucher,
D-Rollete, on Monday signed on to the House bill introduced by
Rep. Mick Grosz, R-Turtle Lake.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The state plan is contingent on Congress
approving federal funding of the Devils Lake outlet and the Garrison
completion plan.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We need to have a mechanism in place to
cover the state's obligation should Congress come through on
these plans,&quot; Grosz said. &quot;This bill is a major
commitment on the part of the Legislature to address the
persisant flooding problems at Devils Lake and implement
statewide water projects like Garrison.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Boucher decided to sign onto the bill, despite
only having a few minutes to look at it, because he said he wants
to approach the state's nagging water problems in a bipartisan
way.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;It's necessary that the Legislature make
a good-faith commitment, to do what we feel is necessary to go
through with needed water development plans in North
Dakota,&quot; Boucher said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">After a brief inspection, Boucher said he has reservations
with some aspects of the bill, but he said he expects it to go
through heavy revision before it comes out of the Legislature.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I've never seen a bill come out of here
that was exactly the same as when it was introduced,&quot; Boucher
said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The bill allows the state to make a commitment without
immediately spending money out of the general fund. It proposes
that the Bank of North Dakota make payments of up to $2 million
to holders of the state-issued bonds. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">If the federal government comes through with a plan,
then the 1999 Legislature would be responsible for appropriating
money out of the general fund to cover the $2 million from the
State Bank, and to repay the rest of the bond debts..</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Dorso said passage of the bill would mean that there
would be no state delay when, or if, Congress approves any of the
plans.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;One thing I hear over and over from our Congressional
delegation is that members of Congress want some assurance North
Dakota will pay its fair share to complete these programs before
they support them,&quot; Dorso said. &quot;This bill shows our
good faith to do that.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The bill also contains a &quot;sunset
provision,&quot; which means that if the Congress fails to
approve either of the plans in 1997 or 1998, that the 1999 Legislature
would have to approve a new spending bill.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The bill will be referred to the House Natural Resources
Committee, of which Grosz is the vice chairman. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">A hearing will be scheduled in the next few
weeks.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Session rife with hunting, fishing
measures</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">By John Lohman <br>
The Forum <br>
</font><font size="4">Legislators have a way of making hunting
and fishing issues interesting.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">It has to do with the types of bills they offer -
some for the good of all, others to satisfy themselves or a
constituent.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">This year's North Dakota Legislature is no
exception.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">North Dakota has a law that restricts
nonresidents to 14 days of waterfowl hunting. There are bills in
the Legislature to modify the law or make some exceptions.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">One was offered by Rep. Dale Henegar,
R-Bismarck, who has a son who lives in Moorhead and hunts in
North Dakota.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Under Henegar's proposal, nonresidents who
could show a North Dakota birth certificate would be permitted
four four-day weekend hunting periods instead of the current 14
days or two periods of seven days.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">A bill by Rep. Richard W. Kunkel, R-Devils
Lake, would remove the 14-day nonresident restrictions for ducks,
but not for geese. It also would allow a nonresident hunter to
purchase more than one goose hunting license per year.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Another bill would give the state's senior
citizens over age 70 a guaranteed license in the state's deer
license lottery. The bill, offered by Rep. Ronald Q. Nichols,
D-Palermo, would guarantee the seniors a license for mule deer or
whitetail, whichever they apply for.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Paul Schadewald, chief of administrative
services for the state Game and Fish Department, says about 1,600
residents over age 70 applied in last year's deer license
lottery.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Nichols also has a bill to remove the cap on
the number of muzzleloader deer permits issued.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">When originally passed, 400 muzzleloader
permits were issued, and the number was later hiked to 700. Under
Nichols' bill the number of permits would be determined by the
governor's deer hunting proclamation.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Rep. Al Carlson, R-Fargo, would remove the
county auditors' role in issuing hunting and fishing licenses. If
passed, Schadewald says the Game and Fish Department would be
working with the state's 600 vendors instead of the auditors.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Carlson also has a bill to require a $50 fee
for anyone charging a fee for access to property to hunt, fish or
trap. The reason for the measure is to gain a record of
fee-hunting operations and to determine the impact and harvest of
wildlife.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Other bills would:</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="4">Permit the governor to designate a
        priority area in a moose hunting zone, with only
        landowners in the priority area being eligible for
        landowner licenses instead of all landowners in the zone.</font></li>
    <li><font size="4">Allow an unsuccessful elk hunter to turn
        in his/her license and remain eligible for future elk
        lotteries. Currently, a hunter is only allowed one elk
        license in a lifetime.</font></li>
    <li><font size="4">Allow a landowner who gets a lottery
        license to hunt land he or she owns or leases in an
        adjacent hunting unit.</font></li>
    <li><font size="4">Allow nonresident or foreign exchange
        students to fish and hunt small game on a resident
        license. The proposal is patterned after a similar law in
        Minnesota.</font></li>
    <li><font size="4">Change gratis deer license law to allow
        nonresidents who own or lease land for agricultural
        purposes to get a landowner's license. The license must
        be purchased at the nonresident license rate of $168. The
        license could only be used on licensee's land. It also
        allows nonresidents to get landowner turkey licenses for
        the $8 resident fee, but is valid on the licensee's land.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="4"><strong>NDSU head wants say in salary increases</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">By Patrick Condon<br>
The Forum<br>
</font><font size="4">BISMARCK, N.D. - North Dakota State
University President Thomas Plough on Friday asked the Senate
Appropriations Committee for more discretion in rewarding school
employees with merit raises.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I feel strongly that presidents should be
able to forgo any raise for an employee who is less than
satisfactory on performance,&quot; Plough said. &quot;Any
across-the board salary increases should apply only to
satisfactory employees.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">It was one of many requests Plough made as he
laid out before the committee NDSU's budget request for the next
two years. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Salaries for university faculty and staff, a
burning issue in the state, figured prominently in the school's
request. Craig Schnell, interim vice president for academic
affairs, said he knows of many cases where both faculty and
administrators have left NDSU for greener financial pastures.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;They are leaving for institutions that
are of less caliber than NDSU, but they are getting higher
salaries,&quot; Schnell said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Plough told the committee he advocates a 3
percent spending increase for salaries and he'd like it divided
two ways: either he'd like the discretion to dole out increases
or he'd like a 2 percent across-the-board increase and 1 percent
discretionary pool.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">For the most part, Plough said he supports the
decisions made in higher education spending contained in Gov. Ed
Schafer's budget. He said he realizes that NDSU will never get
all the state funding it desires.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I know you have 100 acres of revenues and
1,000 acres of requests,&quot; Plough said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But Plough made a hard sell on NDSU's behalf,
pointing out the many benefits the state draws from the
institution.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I know you respect NDSU, since NDSU and
the citizens of North Dakota through their legislative bodies
have enjoyed over a century of partnership in education, research
and extension,&quot; Plough said. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Plough laid out NDSU's three priorities in the
coming years, which he said will allow the school to thrive in
the community and grow larger. The goals are: </font></p>

<ul type="disc">
    <li><font size="4">To improve relationships between on-campus
        people and off-campus constituencies.</font></li>
    <li><font size="4">To enhance the quality of student, faculty
        and staff interaction.</font></li>
    <li><font size="4">To change teaching approaches, especially
        through technology, to fashion a more effective and
        efficient learning enviroment.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="4">Plough also applauded the inclusion in
Schafer's budget of several building projects on the campus,
including a new animal care facility, a health and wellness
center for students and an addition to the engineering and
architecture building.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Plough said that NDSU works under the
assumption that the institution will spend $2 of its own money
for every $1 from the taxpayers of North Dakota.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We'd like to up our share to $3,&quot;
Plough said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But he cautioned legislators to remember the
many tugs and pulls that NDSU has on its own resources.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;This is a struggle for all of us. We will
need to find some creative solutions and we will need your advice
on how to avoid a critical deterioration of our wonderful campus
facilities and infrastructure,&quot; Plough said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Training center may hit roadblock at
Legislature</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">By Patrick Condon<br>
The Forum<br>
</font><font size="4">BISMARCK, N.D. - The Fargo Skills and
Training Center, slated to open in the old north Fargo Kmart
store, ran into a few life-threatening roadblocks Friday at the
Senate Appropriations Committee hearing.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">North Dakota State University had requested $1
million in start-up costs from the Legislature to get the worker
training center on its feet.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But Gov. Ed Schafer's budget proposes that the
state spend just $300,000 on the center. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">And one Republican on the Appropriations
Committee said he might not want to spend any state money at all.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I have to say that I have a philosophical
difference with helping to provide infrastructure costs for this
type of local venture,&quot; said Sen. Ray Holmberg, R-Grand
Forks. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Holmberg said he is more comfortable approving
funds that would benefit a larger percentage of the state's
workforce. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">He said that he knows other Appropriations
members that share his sentiment.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The skills center is a joint venture of NDSU
and the State College of Science in Wahpeton. It would offer
training and retraining programs for workers in all stages of
their careers, but would not offer degrees.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The NDSU development foundation purchased the
abandoned Kmart store and planned to lease the building to users.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Backers of the center have argued that it is
the kind of public-private venture that higher education needs to
thrive into the future. Business leaders say they want the
opportunity to provide employees with skills throughout their
careers.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;This is a critical component of the
overall growth strategy of North Dakota,&quot; said Ken
Zagzebski, the chief operating officer of North Dakota Northern
States Power.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">For regular operations, the center would rely
on businesses and schools buying classes.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">NDSU President Thomas Plough said the center
would not rely on state funds for any regular operations, but
they need a large chunk of funds to get the center up and
running. He said NDSU needs the full $1 million, not the $300,000
Schafer proposed.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;It needs the start-up funds and we don't
know where else to get them,&quot; Plough said. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">College of Science President Jerry Olson added,
&quot;We have very little, if any, money in our budget to do
this.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Plough admitted that the center would primarily
serve people who live in a 50-mile radius of Fargo.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">That's what makes Holmberg uncomfortable.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;In the case of a statewide program like
Workforce 2000, we can take the services to where the demand is
at the time,&quot; Holmberg said. &quot;Next year it might be in
Grand Forks, but the year after that it might be in Belfield.
They are talking about investing in a permanent
infrastructure.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Appropriations Chairman Sen. David Nething,
R-Jamestown, added that &quot;it's a big budget item, and we
don't have much wiggle room.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">No decision was made Friday on the fate of the
center. It will likely come up again next week in committee
discussion.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Dorso wants bigger reserve</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">By Patrick Condon<br>
The Forum<br>
</font><font size="4">BISMARCK, N.D. - House Majority Leader John
Dorso, R-Fargo, wants Republican lawmakers to support a plan to
spend less state money than Gov. Ed Schafer proposed in his
1997-1999 budget.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Dorso said he fears the $10 million ending fund
reserve in Schafer's budget will not leave the state with enough
rainy day money, in case some kind of spending emergency arises.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I would like to see at least another 10
to 15 million dollars, an ending balance of about $25
million,&quot; Dorso said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In a House Republican caucus meeting Friday,
Dorso asked fellow lawmakers to look for budget areas that could
be trimmed.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In leaving the $10 million ending balance,
Schafer has pointed out that when he left a $40 million ending
balance in 1993, the legislators spent it down to $10 million
anyway. Lawmakers also left Bismarck in 1995 with a $10 million
reserve.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But House Appropriations Chairman Rep. Jack
Dalrymple, R-Casselton, said that the state cannot afford to be
quite as optimistic this time.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We're at record levels of oil production,
of grain prices, of car sales right now,&quot; Dalrymple said.
&quot;Are we comfortable with that as a prediction for the next
two years?</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;The folks on Appropriations are not
comfortable that we can sustain this growth for the next two
years, and we think we should move some of that money into the
ending fund balance so we're not in trouble two years from
now.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Dorso said that $10 million would only go three
days to support the total level of state spending. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;That's all the cushion we would
have,&quot; Dorso said. &quot;If we had to make up for that
later, the budget cuts would have to be deep.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Dorso on Friday did not offer spending areas
that the Legislature might jettison in order to build up the
ending balance. He asked the Republican membership to start
thinking of areas they could eventually suggest to the
Appropriations Committee for reductions.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Schafer: Sexual predator bill needs
work</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">By Patrick Condon<br>
The Forum</font><font size="4"><br>
BISMARCK, N.D. - Gov. Ed Schafer said Thursday that he is more
likely to support a law to lock up sexual predators if the current
version is scrapped in favor of one that is &quot;more likely to
pass Constitutional muster,&quot; Schafer said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Attorney General Heidi Heitkamp, after failing
to pass a similar bill in 1995, is one of the chief backers of
the new legislation. She lashed out at Schafer's remarks, saying
too much work has gone into the bill for the governor to demand
changes now.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;This bill has been around since 1995, and
it's now 1997,&quot; Heitkamp said. &quot;Representatives of
(Schafer's office) participated in putting together a new plan to
arrive at a Constitutional bill, which we did. Now he's saying at
the eleventh hour that he doesn't like the bill. Where has he
been all along?&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The bill, currently under consideration by the
House Judiciary Committee, would allow law enforcement officials
to instigate a &quot;civil commitment&quot; procedure against
people with long records of sexual misconduct, but for one reason
or another are on the street.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The offenders would be placed in indefinite
treatment, until a time when they were judged to be no longer a
threat to society.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Heitkamp and other law enforcement officials
testified that there are known dangerous offenders currently on
the street who will be committed under this legislation.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The bill hit a snag on Tuesday when the
Judiciary Committee learned that the $4 million funding for the
bill, which was originally supposed to come out of the Department
of Human Services (DHS), had been dropped from Schafer's
1997-1999 executive budget.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Sen. Donna Nalewaja, R-Fargo, one of the bill's
sponsors, said she had been misled by DHS officials into thinking
the civil commitment program was a budget priority. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">DHS Executive Director Bud Wessman, a Schafer
appointee, said the program simply did not make it to the top of
the DHS funding priority list.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I think the legislators misunderstood the
difference between testimony and commitment,&quot; Schafer
&quot;I think the interim committees need to understand that if
an employee gives testimony, and expresses support for an idea,
that doesn't mean it's definitely going to make it into the
budget.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But Heitkamp said officials who are trying to
build a program need a stronger commitment from the Governor's
office. She said since DHS is led by a Schafer appointee, he is
ultimately responsible for what comes out of the office.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Who does speak for the governor?&quot;
Heitkamp said. &quot;Who can we rely on? If we can't rely on the
governor's staff to tell us what the position of his
administration is, I think that's a tragedy. State government
cannot run effectively that way.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Schafer said he'd like to see the Judiciary
Committee redraft the bill, in light of Consitutional challenges
to similar bills in other states like Kansas.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I question if you can incarcerate
somemody for their thoughts, maybes and how-comes,&quot; Schafer
said. &quot;No one disagrees that sexual predators should not be
on the streets, but let's find out if we can generate a law that
works.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But Heitkamp said her office has spent
thousands of hours making sure that the bill passes
Constitutional muster, and is ready to defend what would be an
almost certain court challenge. She said the civil commitment
bill is closely based on a similiar Minnesota law, which did
survive a state Supreme Court challenge.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;The governor is right about one
thing,&quot; Heitkamp said, referring to a remark Schafer made at
his press conference. &quot;He's not a lawyer.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The status of the bill is now up in the air. It
will be reconsidered next week by the Judiciary Committee, which
seemed to generally support it in this week's hearing. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">But Nalewaja has said she is concerned that it
may fail in the Appropriations Committee hearing, not to mention
the full House and Senate, who may not be as receptive to the $4
million cost attached to the bill.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Senate Minority Leader Tim Mathern tried
unsuccessfully to pass the 1995 bill, even after the Human
Services Committee had recommended that it not pass. He said he'd
like to consider compromises that might bring down the $4 million
price tag.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;This shouldn't just be, 'let's do it all
the way or not do it at all,'&quot; Mathern said. &quot;It
shouldn't be $4 million, or zero, that's baloney.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But Mathern added that legislators who cringe
at the heavy cost need to consider what might happen without such
a law in place.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;This is a matter of where are priorities
are,&quot; Mathern said. &quot;If some priority needs to change
in order to fund it, then that's the way we have to do it.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size=4><strong>Dems: Schafer's handling of storms also a disaster</strong></font></p>
<p><font size=3>By Patrick Condon<br>
The Forum</font><font size=4><br>
BISMARCK, N.D. , The harsh blizzard winds that have plagued the state whipped into the halls 
of the State Capitol Wednesday, sparking a political confrontation between Gov. Ed Schafer 
and Democratic lawmakers.</font></p>
<p><font size=4>&quot;Gov. Schafer is dragging his feet&quot; on helping the state recover from the weather disasters, said 
House Minority Leader Merle Boucher, D-Rolette.</font></p>
<p><font size=4>Boucher said he is concerned that, while Schafer may have a plan for clearing snow emergency 
routes, there are still miles of township and county roads that remain buried under mountains of 
snow.</font></p>
<p><font size=4>&quot;The governor needs to put himself in residents' shoes,&quot; Boucher said. &quot;He addressed 
immediate concerns regarding snow removal, but failed to deliver a long-range plan for dealing 
with this disaster.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size=4>In response to Democrats' complaints, Schafer's office on Wednesday afternoon released to the 
media a four-page list of what is being done right now to alleviate the disaster. </font></p>
<p><font size=4>Schafer's communications director, Julie Liffrig, said the governor is &quot;very upset&quot; over what he 
thinks are attempts to score political points over a natural disaster.</font></p>
<p><font size=4>Schafer announced early in the week that, under the federal emergency declared by President 
Clinton, the state would receive financial assistance in plowing the emergency road routes that 
connect North Dakota's major cities and county seats.</font></p>
<p><font size=4>The plan to clear other clogged roads will be coordinated between county officials and the 
North Dakota Division of Emergency Management, which will try to prioritize requests and 
needs.</font></p>
<p><font size=4>On Wednesday, the Federal Emergency Management Association widened the scope of the 
federal disaster declaration, announcing that they will provide assistance for clearing township 
roads as well.</font></p>
<p><font size=4>But in a joint House and Senate Democratic caucus meeting Wednesday, Democratic legislators, 
especially those from rural areas, said that help is not arriving fast enough to those snowed into 
desolate corners of the state.</font></p>
<p><font size=4>&quot;The counties are getting depleted fast,&quot; said Sen. Steve Tomac, D-St. Anthony. &quot;I know it's 
hard to distinguish when you have everyone saying it's an emergency here and an emergency 
there, but what we have is an all-out crisis.&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size=4>Sen. Larry Robinson, D-Valley City, said some of his rural constituents have had to abandon 
their farms altogether, and plan to stay in town for the duration of the winter; Sen. Joel 
Heitkamp, D-Hankinson, said many of his constituents are being forced to dump milk their 
cows have produced into the ditch because milk trucks can't get to the farms; Rep. Pam 
Gulleson, D-Rutland, said she's had 10 cows on her own family farm freeze to death in the last 
few days.</font></p>
<p><font size=4>&quot;I think when we sit here in the capitol building, we tend to forget the farmer who is out in the 
field trying to save his cattle, or even just shovel himself out of his farm,&quot; Gulleson said.</font></p>
<p><font size=4>Several legislators, including Gulleson, expressed disappointment with the job the National 
Guard is doing to get the state up and running again.</font></p>
<p><font size=4>&quot;I've tried to find out what their priorities, what their plans are,&quot; Gulleson said. &quot;The answers 
have been very hazy. We're able to send the Guard to Bosnia, to Panama, why can't we more 
fully take advantage of their resources here?&quot;</font></p>
<p><font size=4>But Schafer's office said National Guard members are working &quot;around the clock&quot; to clear 
roadways of snow. They said 21 bulldozers are being deployed in 11 of the state's most rural 
counties, as well as a number of large rotary snowblowers.</font></p>
<p><font size=4>Department of Transportation crews are also operating 20 snowblowers around the clock in 
snowed-in areas around the state.</font></p>
<p><font size=4>&quot;While Democrat legislators are busy outlining problems, Gov. Schafer is activating all available 
state emergency resources and trying to shore up federal support to help North Dakotans 
recover from the severe winter weather,&quot; Schafer's office said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>N.D. sexual predator bill's fate
uncertain</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">By Patrick Condon<br>
The Forum</font><font size="4"><br>
BISMARCK, N.D. <br>
A proposed state law that would allow sexual predators to be locked
up, with or without a criminal conviction, received a warm response
Tuesday from the House Judiciary committee.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But one of the bill's main sponsors fears the
bill is already headed for defeat, just as a similar bill went
down in the 1995 session. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I am afraid there won't be a lot of
support for the bill this session, despite the great need,&quot;
said Sen. Donna Nalewaja, R-Fargo.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Nalewaja said the bill's prospects were
weakened when the it was not chosen as a Department of Human
Services (DHS) funding initiative for the 1997-1999 biennium,
leaving it a $4 million request with no stipulation as to where
in state funds the money should come from.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The bill sets up a program of civil commitment
for sexual predators; those offenders deemed too dangerous to
function in society would have to enter into indefinite
treatment, even if they are no longer being held for a specific crime. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The offenders would stay in treatment until
they are no longer considered a threat.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Attorney General Heidi Heitkamp strongly backed
the bill that failed in the 1995 session. At the time, she warned
lawmakers that Bismarck law enforcement officials knew of an
offender who would go free without the proposed law.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Her prediction came true: in March 1996, David
V. Anderson, at the time 21, was arrested for sexually assaulting
a 12-year old Bismarck girl. Anderson has a long history, dating
back into his early teens, of sexual misconduct.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We could have committed David Anderson
under the 1995 bill, and a 12-year-old girl would not have the
lifelong psychological scars she now has to deal with&quot;
Heitkamp said. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Anderson is currently serving time in the State
Penitentiary, but refuses to participate in sexual offender
treatment programs.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;If David Anderson were paroled today, I
can guarantee you that by the end of the session another child
would be having nightmares,&quot; Burleigh County States Attorney
Patricia Burke said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">After the '95 bill died on the Senate floor,
Heitkamp, a Democrat, assembled a task force to approach the
issue for the 1997 session. After months of work, the task force
introduced a study resolution, which eventually found its way to the
interim Criminal Justice Committee, chaired by Nalewaja. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Nalewaja said the interim committee received a
commitment from DHS that they would request $1.2 million in the
Governor's budget for the program.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We were told that there was a united
front, that we would be going ahead in cooperation with
DHS,&quot; Nalewaja said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Legislative Council staff drafted the
legislation at the behest of Nalewaja's committee, and it was
accepted for introduction in early November by the legislative
leaders.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Then, Nalewaja said, she read in the newspaper
that the DHS request did not make it into Gov. Ed Schafer's
executive budget.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Members of the Judiciary committee expressed
anger with the DHS decision.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I cannot express in strong enough terms
my disappointment with the Department of Human Services,&quot;
said Rep. Allan Stenehjem, R-Wahpeton.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">DHS Executive Director Bud Wessman said he
would very much have liked to bankroll the civil commitment
program with DHS money, but there were many other tugs on DHS
money.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;With all due respect, it's one thing to
support a concept and an idea,&quot; Wessman said. &quot;It's
another to get down to the grassroots of deciding what to fund,
and discover the money is just not there.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Wessman said he knew the chances were slim when
DHS listed it low on its list of funding priorities.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We gave it our best shot,&quot; Wessman
said. &quot;But there are so many other things we are committed
to fund by statute.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Nalewaja also discovered the $1.2 million cost
had ballooned to $4 million, based on new estimates of setting up
the program from the State Hospital Review Board, where the
program would probably be located.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Now, the proposed law must get past the major
stumbling block of containing almost $3 million in additional
spending over the initial proposal.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;That is going to be very hard to sell to
my colleagues,&quot; Nalewaja said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But Heitkamp and other advocates say the state
must swallow the costs and do the right thing.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;If we can save even one child from
permanent psychological damage, then it is worth the entire
cost,&quot; Heitkamp said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Schafer, who will ultimately sign or veto the
bill if it passes, is said to be carefully considering the merits
if the proposed law. His communications director, Julie Liffrig,
said there are concerns in the Governor's office that the bill
may violate Constitutional rights.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>NDSU next up for budget knife; UND officials
offer cuts</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4">By Patrick Condon<br>
The Forum</font></p>

<p><font size="4">BISMARCK, N.D.<br>
North Dakota State University soon will begin a review process aimed
at streamlining curriculum and services, including elimination of
some programs.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The results of a similar, ongoing downsizing effort
at the University of North Dakota were announced Monday by UND
President Kendall Baker. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">UND's months-long review has resulted so far in
the elimination of 254 courses, several college dean positions
and a number of full-time employee positions.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">North Dakota University System Chancellor Larry
Isaak told the Senate Appropriations Committee Monday that NDSU
will start a similar process soon, probably in the next few weeks.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We have asked NDSU to focus their resources,
in the face of 15 years of declining state support,&quot; Isaak
said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">He said all of the state colleges and
universities have been asked to make cuts, but that UND and NDSU
were asked to undertake a more thorough process since they are
the largest schools in the system.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Board of Higher Education does not mandate
how the schools should trim, instead simply asking for a set of
recommendations.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Each campus can do it the way they
want,&quot; Isaak said. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Dave Wahlberg, director of public affairs at NDSU,
said university officials are not yet certain what shape the NDSU
review team will take. UND formed a group of faculty and campus
officials to undertake the process.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Wahlberg said NDSU is behind UND because the
board wanted to wait until new NDSU President Thomas Plough was
comfortable in his job before beginning a large restructuring process.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Any time you look at a big soul-searching process
like this, you want your entire management team securely on
board,&quot; Wahlberg said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Plough could not be reached for comment Monday.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In his status report, Baker characterized UND's process
as &quot;exceedingly difficult.&quot; Among other recommendations,
Baker endorsed such committee directives as discontinuing
Bachelor of Science degrees in several foreign languages, biology,
chemistry, English, geography, mathematics and physics.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">He also supports the elimination of Bachelor of Arts
degrees in advertising, broadcasting, journalism and public
relations. These majors will be combined under the umbrella of a
B.A. in communications. Baker also supports the elimination of
the Master of Arts in political science.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Students currently enrolled in any eliminated programs
at UND will be allowed to finish their coursework and receive
their degrees.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Baker also recommended that UND and NDSU offer
a joint doctoral program in physics and engineering.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Isaak said he supports the efforts of Baker and the
restructuring committee.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;They are right on track,&quot; Isaak
said. &quot;The proposals are specific and thoughtful.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Board must approve all specific cuts proposed
by the schools. UND will present the cuts to the Board Thursday.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Bill would stiffen fine, penalty for
drivers interfering with plows</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4">By Patrick Condon<br>
The Forum<br>
BISMARCK, N.D. &#150; With North Dakota stuck this winter in what
seems like a perpetual blizzard, the state Senate is considering
a bill to provide stiffer penalties for drivers who interfere
with the work of snowplows.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Senate Transportation Committee held a
hearing Thursday concerning the bill, which is being sponsored at
the request of the state Department of Transportation.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The proposed legislation would punish anyone
who causes any damage to snowplows or injury to plow operators,
levying a fee of $30 and placing six points on the offending
driver's record.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Clearly, the obscene amount of snow that has
been dumped on the state in the last few months has tried the
patience of everyone, including legislators.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I wish we could do something about the
idiots who drive around the barricades when the roads are
closed,&quot; Sen. Carolyn Nelson, D-Fargo, said Wednesday in a
Democratic caucus meeting.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">So far this winter there have been 11 accidents
involving snow plows, causing over $35,000 damage to state
vehicles, and $42,000 damage to other vehicles. No one has been
killed, but two people have been injured.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;If this rate of incident keeps up,
someone is going to be badly hurt, or killed,&quot; NDDOT Deputy
Director Dave Rostad said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Most of the accidents occur when drivers who
are stuck behind plows decide to pass the plows, and are forced
to drive through the snow cloud kicked up by the plow.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Drivers need to exhibit some common sense
and not drive into a blind situation,&quot; Rostad said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Senators on the Transportation Committee
questioned whether the proposed penalties are necessary, since
the North Dakota Century Code already punishes drivers who crash
into snowplows at excessive speed. The only change in the
proposed legislation is that any interference with plows would be
an infraction.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I wish we could just legislate
patience,&quot; Sen. Elroy Lindaas, D-Mayville, said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The bill will come up for debate again next
Thursday before the Transportation Committee. It carries an
emergency clause, and if approved by a 60 percent majority of the
Senate and House, it will become law immediately.&nbsp;</font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><strong><tt>It's payback
time for N.D. schools<br>
Fargo among districts legislative panel votes to reimburse for
funding shortfall</tt></strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><tt>By Patrick Condon<br>
The Forum<br>
BISMARCK, N.D. <br>
A bill to reimburse Fargo and other major state school districts
for state payments lost through a computer glitch sailed through
the House Education committee Tuesday.<br>
The bill has been designated an emergency measure, which means
Fargo school districts could see the $177,000 reimbursement in
the next few weeks.<br>
The error came when a Department of Public Instruction computer
program for figuring aid payments in the 1993-1995 biennium
erroneously left out alternative school students in Fargo, Bismarck,
Grand Forks, Minot, Jamestown and Devils Lake. <br>
&quot;There was a programming error at some critical point, and
it excluded students that should have been included,&quot; DPI
Finance Director Tom Decker said. The six school districts were
shorted $624,000.<br>
The shortage was discovered well into the 1995-1997 biennium by
Fargo Schools Finance Director Dan Huffman. By then it was too
late to appropriate state dollars to cover the error and the
reimbursement had to be put off until the new biennium,
1997-1999. <br>
The shortfall will be paid with leftover transportation and state
aid dollars from the 1995-1997 biennium.<br>
Fargo School Board member Bev Nielson said that the Fargo
district never actually had to budget to cover the shortfall; it
was simply assumed at the time that the appropriation was
correct, and the district had to make due with what it received.<br>
Education committee members passed the bill unanimously to the
full House, and had few questions for Decker and DPI staff,
although Rep. Jon Nelson, R-Wolford, wanted to know how many
students were omitted, a question to which Decker did not know
the answer.<br>
&quot;It doesn't matter what the number is,&quot; Nielson said.
&quot;It's the principle of the thing. We deserve to be
reimbursed for the amount we lost.&quot;<br>
Nielson said the $177,000 that will be paid to the Fargo School
District will have to be used for one-time expenditures, such as
a new curriculum package, or a new line of textbooks.<br>
The bill, House Bill 1051, will go to the full House in the near
future; it may require Appropriations Committee approval, since
it involves the payment of state money. Since the bill is an
emergency measure. it requires a vote of 60 percent from the
House and the Senate to become law; but if it passes, the money
can be paid out immediately after passage.<br>
Nielson, representatives of the North Dakota Education
Association and DPI officials advocated making the payment from
leftover state funds a permanent method of giving schools money.<br>
&quot;It ought to be permanent policy,&quot; NDEA member Nancy
Sand said.<br>
Nielson said since state foundation aid payments to schools are
always based on estimates, the amount never exactly matches what
a school needs. Sometimes there are slight shortfalls. In cases when
money is left over, the schools should get it, Nielson said.<br>
However, education committee chairwoman Rep. Rae Ann Kelsch,
R-Mandan, said that is unlikely.<br>
&quot;Legislators are never likely to take an action that
permanently ties their hands like that,&quot; Kelsch said.<br>

appoints Butcher to post</tt></strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><tt>The Forum's Capitol
Bureau<br>
BISMARCK, N.D. </tt></font></p>

<p><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><tt>Gov. Ed Schafer on
Tuesday appointed Dina Butcher director of the Office of
Intergovermental Assistance.<br>
Butcher, currently Schafer's agriculture policy adviser, lost a
close race for agriculture commissioner in November to Democrat
Roger Johnson. Most of her leadership background is in agriculture,
including a stint as deputy commissioner of agriculture from 1981
to 1987.<br>
OIA functions as a link between government and communities,
designed to help people and businesses effectively use state and
federal programs. <br>
&quot;Dina brings broad statewide experience in private, public,
farm and non-farm sectors,&quot; Schafer said. &quot;She
understands the needs and concerns of people struggling to
succeed in the private sector, especially in rural areas, and is
well-suited to organize OIA into a facilitating agency that breaks
down barriers for public financing.&quot;<br>
In November of 1995 Schafer fired OIA Director Shirley Dykshoorn,
who had been appointed by his successor, Democrat George Sinner.
Schafer was criticized at the time because OIA had helped him
secure a federal loan for his troubled fish farm in Beulah.<br>
Schafer had defaulted on the loan, causing some to charge him
with firing Dykshoorn to ease inquiries about the loan.<br>
He maintained that he had a right as a Republican governor to
name a director who would work with him.<br>
In naming Butcher, he stressed that North Dakota law states the
OIA also is supposed to serve as a planning division for the
governor's office, providing recommendations for ways to leverage available
funding to address the state's needs.<br>
Butcher said she will use the position to provide support to the
state's businesses.<br>
&quot;This office can be a valuable source of assistance and
information to private sector individuals who are trying to make
their business or enterprise work,&quot; Butcher said.<br>

<p><font size="4"><b>&quot;North Dakota rocks&quot;<br>
Schafer offers 4 major initiatives in upbeat State of the State</b></font></p>

<p><font size="3"><b>By Patrick Condon</b> </font><font size="4"><br>
</font><font size="3">The Forum </font></p>

<p><font size="4">BISMARCK, N.D. - Drawing heavily from continued
reports of a strong economy and an upbeat citizenry, Gov. Ed
Schafer on Monday delivered his 1997 State of the State address, announcing
his priorities for taking North Dakota to the close of the
century. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I have been given an incredible
opportunity to help guide and shape this state into the next century,&quot;
Schafer said. &quot;I am confident the next four years will bring
growth and prosperity never before seen in our history.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Schafer, after being sworn in for his second
term, laid out before a joint session of the 1997 Legislature an
agenda that includes plans to streamline and revitalize the
state's system of roads and highways, to enhance international marketing
of North Dakota products, to set higher standards for public K-12
education and to focus public health efforts more tightly on
prevention. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Beyond those four major initiatives, Schafer
also pledged renewed dedication to improving and unifying the
North Dakota University System, and to continue revamping the
state's welfare programs from a system of permanent assistance to
one of temporary help. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Continually throughout the 40-minute speech, Schafer
referred to &quot;hope, faith and optimism&quot; throughout the
state, at times tumbling over into outright hyperbole. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;North Dakota rocks,&quot; Schafer shouted
at one point. &quot;Congratulations to us all.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Though Democratic legislative leaders said they share
Schafer's sense of optimism, they cautioned that lawmakers and
officials should not forget those left behind in the tide of
positive economic news. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We need to offer solutions for those
families that have not shared in the prosperity to which (Schafer)
has referred,&quot; House Minority Leader Merle Boucher,
D-Rollette, said. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Senate Minority Leader Tim Mathern, D-Fargo, also
cautioned that Schafer should be careful in taking too much
credit for the state's good economy. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Bipartisan economic initiatives, as well
as the economy of the nation as a whole, have contributed to the
state's positive economic picture,&quot; Mathern said. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Whatever the source of the economic good times, Schafer
proposed that they be seized upon and used, as he put it,
&quot;to shape tomorrow.&quot; The executive budget that Schafer
proposed last month for the next two years capitalizes on the state's
growing revenue collections, spending state money in some
neglected areas. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Schafer's main priorities for the next two
years are contained in his budget. But on Monday he proposed
several new initiatives, all aimed at increasing productivity in
the state. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Schafer proposed that the Department of Transportation
lead an in-depth study into the state's transportation
infrastructure. He directed the DOT to work with cities and
counties in prioritizing every road in the state's system, and to determine
the best way to maintain those roads. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We have more miles of roads per capita
than any other state in the nation,&quot; Schafer said. &quot;We simply
cannot afford this immense system.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="4">A member of Schafer's staff said he is not proposing
that any roads be shut down or eliminated; but simply that
municipalities decide what roads deserve more attention in the
face of dwindling federal funds. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Along the same lines of increasing trade and productivity,
Schafer proposed an effort to increase North Dakota's presence in
the international marketplace. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I say this not to downplay the importance
of North Dakota markets, but to emphasize the incredible
potential of customers and markets outside our state,&quot;
Schafer said. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">In an attempt to concentrate government assistance
in increasing trade, Schafer proposed that Pride of Dakota, a
trade-assistance program in the Department of Agriculture, should
be housed in the Economic Development and Finance Agency, which
is under his control. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Moving Pride of Dakota out of the Democrat-controlled
Agriculture Department may meet with resistance. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I would be opposed to that,&quot; Boucher
said. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">In the perennially important issue of
education, Schafer proposed a new set of standards for K-12
public school teachers. The effort to impose the standards will
be led by Lt. Gov. Rosemarie Myrdal, who delivered that portion
of the speech Monday. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;If we are really going to add value to
our education system, if we really want to give our children the
best schooling available, we must enhance the tools and skills of
our teachers,&quot; Myrdal said. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">First among the standards would be a clear definition
of what every student must learn, especially in the face of
ever-increasing access to electronic information all around the
world. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Myrdal will lead a task force that will report
a proposed set of standards to the 1999 Legislature. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Boucher said he finds nothing wrong with the
idea of standards for public schools. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I am for anything that provides a measure
of support to our schools,&quot; he said. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">But Boucher also made it clear that he thinks
the Schafer budget does not go far enough to address the funding
shortfalls between urban and rural schools. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;He has not adequately responded to calls
for changes,&quot; Boucher said. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Schafer also proposed a new set of standards
for public health, with a goal of teaching prevention as a remedy
for health problems. Schafer asked the Health Department to
develop a plan for the future of public health in North Dakota,
aimed at promoting long-term health and wellness. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;North Dakota has an opportunity to be a
national model for proactive public health programming,&quot; Schafer
said. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Democratic leaders said they were most
surprised that Schafer's speech lacked any mention of the water
problems facing the state, the flooding of Devils Lake and the
still-unfinished Garrison Diversion project. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I would have thought we'd hear something
about that,&quot; Boucher said. </font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Deer aid clears first step</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">By John Sundvor <br>
The Forum <br>
</font><font size="4">ST. PAUL - An emergency deer feeding
program was approved by a budget subcommittee of the Senate
Environment and Natural Resources Committee Wednesday, despite
strong opposition from the Minnesota Department of Natural
Resources.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The program, which could make between $1.1
million and $1.4 million available for the feeding program, is
built on a blend of legislation introduced by Sens. LeRoy Stumpf,
DFL-Thief River Falls, and Charlie Berg, I-Chokio.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">It borrows $1.1 million from the DNR's Game and
Fish Fund and repays it with a one-time, $2.50 surcharge on deer
licenses.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The license, now $23 for Minnesota residents,
already is saddled with a 50-cent surcharge to repay money
borrowed from the fund for a deer feeding program last year. The
new surcharge will push the cost of the license to $25.50. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">A second component of the bill is designed to
encourage private cash contributions to the deer feeding program.
</font></p>

<p><font size="4">It provides that the first 6,000 people who
give $50 or more will be able to buy a deer license next fall for
$5.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Berg proposed giving anyone who donated $50 or
more to the deer-feeding program access to a free hunting license
next fall.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Some opposed the bill, because the license
give-away would not only cost the state license revenue but would
also diminish the amount of federal aid the state receives for
game and fish programs.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The bill had no House companion and Berg
finally withdrew it, saying he did not want to slow down passage
of a deer feeding program.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But passage of the deer-feeding program is far
from certain. While groups like the Minnesota Deer Hunters
Association endorse the one-time license surcharge, DNR officials
strongly oppose it.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Tim Bremicker, chief of the DNR's wildlife
section, said the feeding program will siphon money and manpower
away from other important DNR programs. At least 8,000 hours of
staff time will be diverted from other important programs for
deer feeding, he said, adding that the man-hours needed for the
deer program could reach 12,000. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;What we are talking about here is
spending public money on something that likely will not
work,&quot; he said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Bremicker and other DNR personnel contend that
$1.2 million was wasted feeding starving deer last year. David
Schad, a DNR wildlife specialist, said the program had little
impact on the deer population. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Feeding helped in local areas that had highly
organized programs, he said, but the state's deer population
still sustained heavy losses last year because of unusually harsh
weather conditions. Even though deer herds around Roseau were fed
last year, he said, the deer population in that area declined by
40 percent. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We are dealing with a major natural
event,&quot; Bremicker told the Senate subcommittee earlier.
&quot;A major deer feeding expenditure does not result in a
significant reduction in deer mortality in the northern part of
the state.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">While the DNR has a deer feeding program under
way in the western farming areas with surplus corn from the
federal Commodity Credit Corporation, that program is designed to
stop deer from eating other farm stocks. In the forested areas
and northwest Minnesota, Bremicker said, the state should not
spend money feeding deer.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">That was the same message he delivered to the
House Environment and Natural Resources Committee Tuesday. It so
divided members of the committee that they could agree only to
send the companion to the Senate bill on its way without
recommendation.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;When it comes to protecting wildlife, you
(the DNR) don't seem to want to jump in the game,&quot; said Rep.
Tim Finseth, R-Angus. &quot;You're just dragging your feet
getting into this.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Others on the committee sided with the DNR. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We now have another year of experience
and there seems to be overwhelming evidence that it did not
work,&quot; said Rep. Alice Hausman, DFL-St. Paul. &quot;I think
there is a lack of urgency from the public this year that we felt
last year.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The House Environment and Natural Resources
budget subcommittee is scheduled to consider the bill next week.
The Senate Environment and Natural Resources Committee will hear
it Friday.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Panel approves $20 million snow aid
bill</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">By John Sundvor <br>
The Forum <br>
</font><font size="4">ST. PAUL-A $20 million package of emergency
snow aid was approved by a budget subcommittee of the Senate
Transportation Committee Wednesday, after the legislation was
stripped of its controversy.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The bill was approved without dissent, after it
was amended to make local governments throughout the state
eligible for some of the aid.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Last week, the bill was stalled in the Senate
Transportation Committee. Senate Minority Leader Dean Johnson,
R-Willmar, complained that Transportation Chairwoman Carol Flynn,
DFL-Minneapolis was refusing to give it a hearing. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">While Flynn assured Johnson on the Senate floor
that she had no interest in killing the bill, she made clear that
her committee would not be stampeded into approving it.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">She said her committee was waiting for
information from cities, counties and townships about actual
need. When that information is received, she said, the committee
will act.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I suspect that (the aid) will not be
confined to the 40 counties (included in a federal disaster
declaration),&quot; Flynn said, &quot;but to 87 counties, all of
whom have need.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">She said Hennepin County had already exceeded
its budget for snow removal by $1 million. Many other counties
not in the federal disaster declaration have similar budget
problems, she said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In its new version, the legislation contains
$14.5 million to help local governments throughout Minnesota pay
off their 1996 snow-removal bills. It contains $3.5 million that
will be used as matching funds for federal disaster aid to 40
western counties and $2.5 million to plan for floods that are
expected to wash across the state in the spring.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Johnson said the bipartisan legislation -
co-sponsored by Sens. Keith Langseth, DFL-Glyndon, Arlene
Lesewski, R-Marshall, and Jim Vickerman, DFL-Tracy - represents a
good faith effort to help people in need.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;It gives hope to the people of Minnesota
that this government will respond in their time of need,&quot; he
said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">And local officials said they have needs. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Many townships have depleted their budgets,
said John Dooley, legal counsel for the Minnesota Association of
Townships, and are trying to short-term borrow their way through
the disaster. Orville Fluck, a Hector Township supervisor in
Renville County, said without aid his township would exhaust its
funds and be forced to delay a number of needed projects.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Lester Frederickson, a Renville County
commissioner from Hector, said the winter has been so harsh that
the county spent $582,505 on road maintenance - triple its yearly
average - in the last three months. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;It's kind of getting on (people's)
nerves,&quot; he said, predicting an even worse calamity in the
spring. If the snow melt is late and mixed with spring rains, he
said, &quot;we will see water like we have not seen in 30
years.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Without some assistance, Frederickson said, the
county will be forced to abandon road repair and construction
projects for the next three years. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We are spending three years worth of
money in three months,&quot; he said. &quot;We are a
pay-as-you-go county. If we don't have it, we don't do it.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">His gloomy assessment only reflects what other
officials already are expecting.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Jim Franklin, director of emergency services,
said serious flooding can be averted if the snowpack is gradually
melted. But he and others don't expect that to happen. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">While weathermen are forecasting average
snowfall for the rest of the year, he said, temperatures are
expected to be colder than normal. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Because there is little snow on the ground in
Iowa, he said, the expectation is the spring warm-up will be
quick. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;There is more snow on the ground and more
moisture in the snowpack than there was in the 1993 flood,&quot;
he said, &quot;which is the worst we have ever had.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Officials at the Federal Emergency Management
Agency, he said, are very concerned about Minnesota, North
Dakota, South Dakota, northern Wisconsin, upper Michigan, and
several western states where snowfalls have been 200-300 percent
above normal.</font></p>

<p><font size="3">By John Sundvor <br>
The Forum <br>
</font><font size="4">ST. PAUL - The Minnesota Senate adopted a
plan for statewide student testing Monday while voting to remove
$337 million in funding caps that were put on schools two years
ago.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The surprise amendment offered by Senate
Majority Leader Roger Moe, DFL-Erskine, left some legislators
sputtering. While they liked the idea of student testing, they
argued that the issue is far too important to be included as a
last-minute amendment to a funding bill.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Among the critics, some said they do not
understand the motivation behind Moe's amendment. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Others said the student testing amendment and
Moe's proposal to earmark 10 percent of a district's revenue for
student readiness programs were Moe's way of positioning himself
to run for governor next year.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">They said the amendment allows Moe to claim
credit for statewide student testing and school reform. His
preschool readiness amendment, which he introduced and then
withdrew, was designed to appeal to the political left that
controls the Democratic Farmer-Labor Party and its nominating
process, they said. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Senate Minority Leader Dean Johnson, R-Willmar,
said he found the amendment curious. When he met with Moe last
Thursday, he said, he was told that statewide testing - raised
earlier by Gov. Arne Carlson - would be introduced on the Senate
floor as an amendment and then withdrawn. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Maybe they're realizing the change in
public attitude towards education,&quot; Johnson said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Moe conceded that he initially had intended to
withdraw the bill. But he said the Senate had an opportunity to
do something about statewide testing and it is important to take
advantage of that opportunity.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">He said his instincts told him the funding bill
was going to become law. Sometimes it is important to put things
not as popular in with a bill that is popular, he said. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I think the public is demanding greater
evaluation and accountability from all of us,&quot; Moe said.
&quot;Education is part of that.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">If the amendment remains in the funding bill
for primary and secondary education, school districts will be
required each spring to test students in grades three, five,
eight and 11 in accordance with guidelines established by the
commissioner of education. The test will measure academic
achievement in core subject areas and will be &quot;referenced to
national achievement standards.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The test is expected to cost the state $6.2
million a year to administer, but Moe said the money will not be
taken from the $337 million in funding that is being restored to
local school districts. The money should be part of a normal
school funding bill that the Legislature will put together later,
he said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Moe said the amendment is designed to move the
Legislature forward from its prolonged debate over whether to
have statewide student testing. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I want to move us off the debate of
whether there should be testing and on to what it should be
about,&quot; he said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">While Moe said the amendment should not slow up
restoration of funding for K-12 education in Minnesota, others
suggested that it would.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Sen. Keith Langseth, DFL-Glyndon, author of the
funding bill, said he is concerned about how the House would
react to the Senate bill. Everyone agreed to keep the bill free
of amendments, he said, and the House went to great pains to
comply with that agreement. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Langseth, himself a supporter of statewide
testing, said the idea should be discussed this year but not as a
last-minute amendment to a funding bill. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">He said the K-12 caps-removal bill &quot;did
not seem to be an appropriate vehicle&quot; for a discussion of
statewide student testing. &quot;It is just not the right way to
run a ball game,&quot; he said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Johnson said most of the 14 senators who voted
against the statewide testing amendment actually support the
idea. He said they simply objected to the process used to win its
approval.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">That process clearly irked members of the
House. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">House Majority Leader Ted Winter, DFL-Fulda,
told a morning news briefing that it is foolish to consider
statewide testing as a way to improve public education before new
high school graduation standards are given a chance to work. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Later, he said he is not opposed to statewide
student testing. But he said educators and parents should be
involved in setting up the program. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;The Senate apparently has decided to set
public policy without proper input and proper debate,&quot;
Winter said with some irritation in his voice.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">While the amendment does complicate a bill that
was expected to sail through the legislative process, the Senate
outcome could have been worse.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Moe also offered an amendment to require school
districts to dedicate 10 percent of their revenue to programs -
other than Head Start - that prepare children for school. Kids
are showing up for school &quot;with more and more
problems,&quot; he said, and &quot;maybe we need a culture
change.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">That amendment was quickly withdrawn, and an
amendment offered by Johnson to mandate school hours was
defeated.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Johnson, who wants to require schools to hold
classes between 8:30 a.m. and 3:30 p.m. daily, said students are
showing up for class too tired to learn. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">After the amendment failed 19-39 Johnson said
he intends to put it in bill form and bring it back to the Senate
for further consideration.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Lawmakers say bill is first step in
freeing kids of tobacco</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">By John Sundvor<br>
The Forum<br>
</font><font size="4">ST. PAUL - A bill that supporters say is a
first step toward taking tobacco out of children's hands won
approval of a Minnesota legislative committee and was sent to the
House floor Thursday.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">A companion bill has been introduced in the
Senate.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The 21-4 approval of the anti-tobacco
legislation by the House Tourism and Consumer Affairs Committee
surprised some and was clearly a setback for the tobacco
industry. For years, the industry has been fighting to ward off
new regulations. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">In 1995, proponents of a smoking ban for teens
failed to win House support. A year later, the tobacco industry
and retailers struck back, trying to win approval for a bill that
would pre-empt local anti-tobacco ordinances from springing up
around the state. They said the local ordinances were producing a
hodgepodge of regulations that were hard to deal with.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Rep. Ann Rest, a Plymouth DFLer who drafted
this year's bill along with Rep. Kevin Goodno, R-Moorhead, was
clearly pleased with the results. She said it was the third
attempt in three years to get anti-tobacco legislation through
the House.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The legislation prohibits the sale of tobacco
products to anyone under the age of 18.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Persons or companies convicted of selling to a
minor would be subject to a $50 fine for a first offense. An
administrative penalty of at least $250 would be imposed for a
second violation within 24 months. A $250 penalty and a license
suspension of no fewer than seven days would follow a third
offense.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Cities, however, would be empowered to impose
stiffer penalties. Goodno said the legislation represents a
statewide floor for tobacco enforcement.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">That is the nub of the fight. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Retailers and tobacco interests have complained
that simply setting a floor for compliance would produce an
unwieldy set of regulations around the state. They argued that it
would be far more effective to have one, statewide standard.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But supporters of the legislation argued for
local control. They said each community must have the flexibility
to deal with its own needs.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Rest said widespread support for the bill sent
a message to the Legislature that the bill represented good
public policy.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">For Goodno, the bill had special meaning. His
older brother died of lung cancer several years ago. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I know what tobacco use does to the
family and does to the person,&quot; he said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Goodno said his brother started smoking in his
youth and was never able to stop.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I saw the impact on his parents, on him
and on his kids,&quot; he said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But Goodno, like others on the committee, said
the bill is only a first step, not a panacea. Any solution, they
said, must include an education program that warns of the dangers
of smoking.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Lawmaker calls for crackdown on sale of
liquor to minors</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">By John Sundvor <br>
The Forum <br>
</font><font size="4">ST. PAUL - In an effort to crack down on a
liquor industry she says profits from underage drinking, a state
lawmaker will offer legislation this week that puts new
limitations on the industry. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Sen. Ember Reichgott Junge, DFL-Plymouth, said
the bill will target bars, liquor stores and restaurants that
have become lax in complying with the state's underage drinking
law. It is designed, she said, to curb the proliferation of
so-called &quot;kiddie booze&quot; and to regulate home delivery
of liquor.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;It is greatly disturbing to see surveys
showing that roughly two-thirds of underage drinkers are buying
their own alcoholic beverages,&quot; she said. &quot;We can do a
better job of denying alcohol access to teens and this
legislation will go a long way towards reaching that goal.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Junge, who announced her candidacy for attorney
general earlier this month, said a 1995 University of Minnesota
study found that almost 75 percent of the liquor outlets in
Minnesota and Wisconsin sold beer to minors at least once in two
attempts. Over 50 percent of the teen buyers with no age
identification were successful on their first attempt, she said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Underage alcohol consumption is linked to
many public safety concerns,&quot; she said. &quot;We see it in
violent juvenile crime, alcohol-related accidents on our
highways, snowmobile trails and lakes, as well as serious
problems in schools. It is also clearly linked to teen pregnancy,
risky sexual behavior and sexual assaults, and to youth
depression and suicide.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Junge said a snowmobile accident that killed a
10-year-old boy at Big Lake recently involved a 20-year-old who
was driving his snowmobile while drunk. Moreover, she said, the
snowmobile driver had an earlier citation for drunken driving on
his record.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Her bill will require cities and counties to
conduct unannounced spot checks at least twice a year of liquor
establishments in their jurisdictions. Violators must be
spot-checked again within six months.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The bill sets a minimum penalty of $250 for a
first violation, $500 for a second violation within two years,
and $500 plus a three-day license suspension for a third
violation.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;In some communities, we are finding
virtually no enforcement effort against serving alcohol to teens
and the consequences of getting caught do not discourage owners
from flouting the law,&quot; she said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The problem is statewide, not just in
Minneapolis-St. Paul, she said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Sweet-tasting liqueurs, slushes and other
alcohol packaged to appeal to the young are being carried into
schools in lunch boxes or hidden in student clothing, she said. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Some of the offending liquor includes colored
vodka in plastic test tubes that is sold as &quot;Bodacious
Kamikaze,&quot; a gelatinized rum that is made to look like
Jell-O or pudding; and &quot;Oatmeal Cookie,&quot; an alcoholic
beverage made to look like chocolate milk.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">A spokesman for Heublein Inc., which makes
&quot;Oatmeal Cookie,&quot; and other cocktails, denied that the
drinks are aimed at minors. Jack Shea said the drinks are popular
with bar patrons. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">John Berglund, a lobbyist for the Minnesota
Licensed Beverage Association, said the liquor industry already
is heavily regulated. It is often parents or friends who supply
liquor to minors, he said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">His assessment conflicts with the findings of
Alexander Wagenaar, a professor of epidemiology at the University
of Minnesota School of Public Health. Wagenaar said 38 percent of
minors who participated in one liquor survey were able to buy
alcoholic beverages at bars, grocery stores or liquor stores.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Junge wants to prohibit liquor packaging that
relies on cartoons and caricatures likely to appeal to children.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Her legislation would require liquor
deliverymen to demand identification from the buyer and then
obtain a signature on the delivery invoice. It would require the
owner or manager of an on-sale liquor outlet to complete a
six-hour training program geared to ensuring that liquor is sold
only to customers who are 21 or older.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Junge said her bill sets only limited standards
for combating underage drinking.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Communities will continue to have the
flexibility to step up enforcement or pursue stronger
penalties,&quot; she said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Snow aid legislation stalls in
Minnesota Senate</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">By John Sundvor <br>
The Forum<br>
</font><font size="4">ST. PAUL - Legislation to rush $20 million
in emergency aid to 40 western Minnesota counties with budgets
buried by a winter of heavy snow appeared stalled in the state
Senate Monday.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Senate Minority Leader Dean Johnson, R-Willmar,
complained at a morning news briefing that Sen. Carol Flynn,
DFL-Minneapolis, has refused to give his bill a hearing before
the Senate Transportation Committee.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Flynn said she had not talked to Johnson about
the aid package and insisted that the bill would eventually be
heard. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">On the Senate floor, Johnson pressed Flynn for
a hearing but was told only that she had no intention of turning
down the request for aid.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">She said her committee is waiting for
information from cities and counties about actual need. When the
committee receives that information, it will act, she said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I suspect that (the aid) will not be
confined to the 40 counties,&quot; Flynn said, &quot;but to 87
counties, all of whom have need.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">She said Hennepin County has already exceeded
its budget for snow removal by $1 million. Many other counties
not in the federal disaster declaration have similar budget
problems, she said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I understand the Twin Cities problems,
but your streets are open,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;Some
township roads are still closed. It is important to get some help
to them as quickly as possible.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Some legislators said privately that the
impasse is not over whether aid should be spread among all 87
counties. They said the issue is whether the Twin Cities should
be cut in for a share.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Some people are pouting around
here,&quot; one legislator said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But Sen. Jim Vickerman, DFL-Tracy, a co-sponsor
of Johnson's legislation, said he is not prepared to wait for the
Transportation Committee to get around to considering the aid
package. If the bill does not start moving, Vickerman says he
will introduce a second bill, one patterned after an aid package
approved last week by the House Committee on Local Governments
and Metropolitan affairs.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Vickerman intends to have the new bill referred
to his committee on Metropolitan and Local Government, thereby
bypassing Flynn and the Transportation Committee. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;That may not make me too popular with
some people, but I don't care,&quot; he said. &quot;Things are
serious out there.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In the House, Rep. Steve Wenzel, DFL-Little
Falls, said the $20 million appropriation would help but not
solve the problem facing many local governments. He said cities,
counties and townships throughout Minnesota need help beyond the
funds that will be made available as part of the federal disaster
declaration.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Wenzel said even worse problems may occur next
spring. Both Wenzel and Jim Franklin, director of the Office
Emergency Management, said the heavy snowpack and the possibility
of more snow in the next two months provide ready-made conditions
for spring floods. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;The forecast for spring is gloom,&quot;
Franklin said, predicting that spring floods this year could
exceed the record floods of 1993.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Wenzel said many local governments have already
drained their budgets paying employees time-and-a-half or
double-time to open roads after weekend storms. He said they
could face more bad weather next winter before their budget year
ends.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Wenzel's legislation gives money to the Office
of Emergency Management to disperse on a case-by-case basis. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">It empowers the commissioner to issue up to
$5,000 in aid to a city, county or township. If the grant is
between $5,000 and $10,000, it must also be approved by the
governor. Grants in excess of $10,000 must be approved by the
governor and reviewed by the Legislative Advisory Commission.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Wenzel's bill is headed to House Judiciary
Committee for its second committee hearing. After it clears that
hurdle, it will be sent to the House floor for a vote.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Bills introduced to help feed Minnesota
deer</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">By John Sundvor <br>
The Forum <br>
</font><font size="4">ST. PAUL - Two bills to rush food to
starving deer were introduced in the Minnesota Legislature Monday
by legislators who say the state must save the state's deer
population from the harshest winter in modern memory.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Sen. Charlie Berg, I-Chokio, formally
introduced a bill to stimulate private contributions to a deer
feeding program. In exchange for a contribution of $50 or more, a
contributor would be entitled to a free deer license for the
1997.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">A House companion bill has not yet been
introduced.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">A second bill introduced in both the Senate and
House would add a $2.50 surcharge to deer licenses and would
appropriate $1.5 million from the Game and Fish Fund for
emergency deer feeding. The bill is being carried by Sen. LeRoy
Stumpf, DFL-Thief River Falls, and Rep. Tom Bakk, DFL-Cook.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Our deer herd is starving to death and
freezing to death,&quot; Berg said. &quot;It is that
simple.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Berg, for years an outspoken critic of the
Minnesota Department of Natural Resources, argues that the DNR
has been lethargic in its response to the need of the deer.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">He said DNR officials told him last week they
didn't have enough money for a feeding program. They suggested
asking the federal Commodity Credit Corporation for surplus
grain, he said. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;This is the worst winter in
history,&quot; Berg said. &quot;If we're going to protect the
herd, we're going to have to feed it.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">He said farmers have been voluntarily feeding
deer in an effort to keep them away from their other commodities.
But he said there is only so much the farmers can do. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Berg, who expects his bill to be heard in
committee yet this week, criticized the DNR of being too
&quot;hide-bound&quot; by tradition to properly respond to the
need for a feeding program. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The department is reluctant to support deer
feeding, he said, simply because the DNR has always opposed it.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Berg agrees with DNR reservations about feeding
deer in hard-to-reach areas in northern Minnesota. But he
maintains that a feeding program can be effective in the
agricultural areas of the state, where feed can be brought to the
deer.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Even with help, Stumpf says, the herds may
dwindle to a point where it may be necessary to scale back fall
hunting seasons. In some northwestern Minnesota areas, he said,
the snow is so deep the deer can't move.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Stumpf said snowmobile clubs in the Thief River
Falls area have been asked to use their sleds to make trails for
the deer to walk on to feeding areas. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The DNR, however, has never been an advocate of
intervening in the natural selection process. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">When the Legislature began work last year on a
plan to spend $750,000 to feed starving deer, DNR officials
argued that it was a waste of money. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">They said the effort would save only a small
percentage of the starving deer.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">During committee hearings, DNR personnel said
the legislation is a futile effort to reverse the effects of
nature. They maintain that a statewide feeding program could
further endanger herds not accustomed to man-made feeds and would
save only 3 percent of the state's deer population from
starvation.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Stumpf said the DNR perspective was not popular
with hunters in his district. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">He thinks the DNR will be more supportive of a
feeding program this year.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Indeed, there is evidence of a different
mindset at the DNR. Earlier this month the department announced
that it would need more money from the Legislature for a new deer
feeding program.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;The $260,000 available in our budget for
deer feeding for the two-year biennium that ends June 30 was
spent feeding deer in northwestern Minnesota last year,&quot;
said Tim Bremicker, chief of the DNR's wildlife section. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The $750,000 appropriated by the Legislature
was spent feeding deer in the forests of northeastern Minnesota,
he said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">While last year's legislation also dedicated 50
cents from each deer license to a permanent deer feeding account,
the program does not kick in until July 1. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Bremicker said the 50 cents will eventually
generate $250,000 a year. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">But part of that revenue must be used to repay
the $750,000 that was borrowed from the Game and Fish Fund for
last year's deer feeding program. </font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Carlson reveals priorities</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">By John Sundvor <br>
The Forum <br>
</font><font size="4">ST. PAUL - Gov. Arne Carlson proposed a
$20.3 billion, two-year budget Thursday that he said can be
Minnesota's &quot;blueprint&quot; for the future.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The budget taps a $1.4 billion revenue surplus
to offer $535 million in tax cuts - including a $261 million,
one-time rebate for taxpayers, $94 million in business tax
reductions and $180 million in tax incentives for education.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">It is a budget that contains $1.5 billion in
new spending.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But it is also a budget with no surprises.
Pieces of the governor's biennial budget have been dribbling out
for months.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">He released his $58.4 million crime-fighting
initiative a month before last November's general election. He
announced his 88 percent increase in funding for the arts almost
a month ago. His welfare reforms have been used in various
briefings for at least two weeks and his $216 million technology
initiative has been common knowledge for some time.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;There aren't a lot of shockers in the
budget,&quot; Carlson said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Nevertheless, the governor said it is a budget
people can be proud of. It is a document that is structurally
sound, he said, one that does not commit governors and
legislators to pay for spending bills that come due in the
future.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">He said if the budget is accepted by the
Legislature, the state will have the last piece of its AAA bond
rating - a rating by Standard and Poors - completely restored by
summer. It will keep the growth in state spending below the
growth in personal income, he added, and it will provide adequate
budget reserves to see the state through tough economic times.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;When we took office and came into a
substantial deficit situation,&quot; Carlson said, &quot;we vowed
not only to turn the finances of this state around, but we also
promised that the next administration would not come in and
assume the kinds of problems that we came in to.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The budget commits 31.4 percent of the general
fund - $6.38 billion - to primary and secondary education, an
increase of $523 million.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Much of that increase, however, will be spent
removing the $337 million in caps put on K-12 funding two years
ago. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">It calls for spending $2.3 billion on higher
education - $1.041 billion on the University of Minnesota System
and $992 million on the Minnesota state colleges and
universities. Carlson said $40 million will be used to recruit
and retain &quot;blue chip&quot; instructors for the university.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">At the same time, it will spend $11.7 billion -
an increase of $1.2 billion - on welfare reform and health and
human service programs. The new money includes $90 million in
extra day-care funding for the working poor. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;As a general budget strategy, our goal
was to live within our means,&quot; Health and Human Services
Commissioner David Doth said. He said the new spending represents
an investment that will produce savings when the state's
benefit-based welfare system is converted to a work-based system.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Democrats and Republicans apboth applauded and
picked at the budget package. <br>
&quot;I think Carlson has some good policy ideas,&quot; said Rep.
Roxann Daggett, R-Frazee. She endorsed his Edvest saving program,
saying people who save for the future should be rewarded.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Rep. Kevin Goodno, R-Moorhead, the lead
Republican on welfare reform in the House, said the new money for
day-care funding is a necessary component for moving people off
welfare.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But like others, he criticized the governor's
plan to limit state revenue sharing to only a 1 percent increase
over the next two years.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Carlson said he wants to get rid of the Local
Government Aid program, saying the program is like going into a
restaurant, ordering a meal and sending the check to another
table. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We have some local governments that are
being paid to be in Minnesota,&quot; the governor said. &quot;We
have others that have to pay to be here.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Goodno said he does not understand Carlson's
inconsistent message.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In Carlson's State of the State speech last
week, Goodno said, the governor talked about Minnesota being one
community. Now, he said, Carlson is saying just the opposite.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Goodno said the Twin Cities has a booming
economy. He said it is appropriate for the Twin Cities to help
areas of the state that are not as well off. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Cities like Moorhead are still part of
Minnesota,&quot; Goodno said. &quot;It is not moving to North
Dakota.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The executive director of Minnesota Citizens
for Tax Justice, meanwhile, characterized the governor's budget
package as a &quot;blueprint&quot; for more property tax
increases.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;The governor is proposing only a 1
percent increase in local government aids,&quot; Wayne Cox said.
&quot;He short-changes cities, counties and schools as he has in
the past. That means they will have to raise property taxes to
make up the difference.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Cox said it is &quot;cynical&quot; for the
governor to offer taxpayers a modest rebate without telling them
he is paying for it with higher property taxes.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">While others liked parts of the budget, they
also criticized it.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Senate Minority Leader Dean Johnson, R-Willmar,
said he expects to find &quot;80 percent agreement in the
legislature on this document.&quot; It contains no tax increase,
it is balanced, and it provides for a return of the state's AAA
bond rating, he said. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Sen. Keith Langseth, DFL-Glyndon, a Finance
Committee chairman in charge of school funding, said the
governor's school funding proposal leaves &quot;room for a lot of
debate.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="4">He accused Carlson of trying to shift $40
million in school funding from rural Minnesota to the Twin Cities
by tinkering with the school aid formula. Most of that money will
come from school districts with declining enrollments, he said,
and they can't afford to lose the state aid.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Senate Majority Leader Roger Moe, DFL-Erskine,
said the budget proposal is a &quot;good start.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Nevertheless, he and others made it clear that
Democrats oppose one-time tax rebates, tax credits for private
schools or home computers, and Edvest. He said Democrats prefer
to give tax relief through property tax reform. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I don't know how many poor people can set
aside $2,000 to buy a laptop computer for their child,&quot; Moe
said. &quot;In the same way, it isn't realistic to expect them to
set aside part of their paycheck every two weeks for a college
fund.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>DFLers offer snowmobile safety bills</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">By John Sundvor <br>
The Forum <br>
</font><font size="4">ST. PAUL - DFLers in the Minnesota House, responding
to six snowmobile deaths during a Department of Natural Resources
safety campaign, vowed Tuesday to crack down on the popular winter
recreation industry. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I don't think there is any question that
we have a very serious situation,&quot; said House Speaker Phil Carruthers,
as he promised to bring interested groups together to make
snowmobiling safer. Carruthers said he has already been
approached by several legislators who want to impose tougher sanctions,
including reducing the blood-alcohol standard for driving while
under the influence from .10 to .08 percent.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">While he and House Majority Leader Ted Winter, DFL-Fulda,
talked about working with various snowmobile groups to solve the
problem, Rep. Doug Peterson, DFL-Madison, said he will do even more.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Peterson said he is drafting legislation that
will force a public dialogue on snowmobile safety.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">With 250,000 snowmobiles registered in Minnesota,
he said, the state recorded 26 snowmobiling fatalities last year
and 23 fatalities so far this year. The ratio of fatalities to
machines seems to be worse than it is with other motor vehicles,
he said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Peterson said some snowmobiles have the
capacity to go 100 miles an hour without modification. The industry
has to address that, he said, when the state's speed limit for
snowmobiles is 55 miles an hour. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The legislation Peterson plans to offer will
require snowmobile operators to carry a snowmobile endorsement on
their drivers licenses, similar to the requirement for motorcycle
riders. They will also be compelled to carry insurance. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The bill also would impose a $10 a year
surcharge on snowmobiles with 335-cubic-inch engines or larger.
The extra $2 million raised, he said, would be used for trail
grooming and tougher enforcement of the state's snowmobile speed
limit.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Peterson said when he returns to the Capitol
from his southwestern Minnesota district he cannot keep up with
snowmobilers driving in the ditches along Highway 7.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;This is not a move on my part to say to
the snowmobile industry that we are going to throttle you down,
we're going to hurt you, we are going to run you out of the
state. That's not my intention,&quot; he said, &quot;I want to
get some safety in this issue, and make sure that we have the
ability to ... enforce it and provide for a recreational quality
of life that befits Minnesota.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Peterson's proposal was joined by one from avid snowmobiler
and Senate Environment and Natural Resources Committee Chairman
Bob Lessard, DFL-International Falls.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Lessard would raise $3 million for the grooming and
engineering of snowmobile trails, which he said would improve
safety by keeping snowmobilers off roads and out of ditches. His
plan calls for raising the registration fee by $5 annualy on all snowmobilies.
He also wants to use $1 million of state tax money to pay for
trail grooming and he would adjust the formula that determines
how much snowmobilers get from the state gas tax to raise another
$1 million.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;The trail system is broke for all
practical purposes,&quot; Lessard said. &quot;We have been a
victim of our own success.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Currently, snowmobilers pay $36 every three
years to register.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Carlson calls for storm aid</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">By John Sundvor <br>
The Forum </font><font size="4"><br>
ST. PAUL - In a surprise move, Gov. Arne Carlson asked the
Legislature Thursday for a $20 million emergency appropriation to
help snow-choked areas of Minnesota.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The proposal clearly was a last-minute idea. It
was not included in the printed text of his annual State of the
State address that he delivered at noon to both houses of the
Legislature. And some members of his own political party were
unaware of his plan. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Senate Minority Leader Dean Johnson, R-Willmar,
who along with other outstate legislators introduced an identical
proposal in the Senate earlier Thursday, said he thought the
governor wanted a joint task force to look at the idea. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I was pleasantly surprised,&quot; he
said. &quot;It is good for the governor and it is good for
western Minnesota, where the winds still are blowing.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Senate Majority Leader Roger Moe, DFL-Erskine,
was less enthusiastic.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Moe, an Erskine DFLer whose district is in the
heavy snow belt, said he is open to the idea of emergency aid,
but he said the Legislature must be cautious.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The state, Moe said, can't have &quot;another
line of appropriation for every disaster that comes along, but I
suspect that one could make a case that this is probably an
extenuating circumstance.&quot; In northwestern Minnesota, he
said, a tough winter is usually followed by a spring of flooding,
&quot;so I think we can put it together and make some
accommodations.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Emergency aid was the one new proposal in a
speech that really confined itself to summarizing Carlson's
accomplishments as the state's chief executive, and laying out
legislative priorities that have been common knowledge for either
days or months.<br>
In his address, Carlson said &quot;the state of the state is
cold.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Minnesota, he said, is going through a most
difficult winter. The state has used all the manpower and
machinery it can find to deal with the heavy snow and
accompanying emergencies.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;The reality is we are only halfway
through winter,&quot; he said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">With a winter so severe, he said, there is the
threat of spring flooding. He said the state is already
&quot;partnering&quot; with agriculture to minimize any damage
caused by spring flooding. The goal, he said, is to &quot;ensure
that we pull together.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">That pulling together was a common theme in the
governor's speech.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Like Moe, he said Minnesota must return to the
days when it looked upon itself as one. He said the state must
work together as a community, rather than pitting rural Minnesota
against urban areas, northern reaches of the state against the
south, and the cities against the suburbs. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The governor pitched for a $500 million tax cut
and a new baseball stadium for the Twins, financed in part with
proceeds from a 10-cent-a-pack cigarette tax. He said St. Paul
should have a professional hockey team, that Minnesota should
have property tax reform, and that the state must move forward
with its plans to move people off welfare and into work.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">He reviewed his tough anti-crime program, and
said more should be done for children. He called for statewide
student testing, education tax credits that would give families
the freedom to send their children to private schools, and said
all children should be given the skills and technological tools
they will need to compete in an increasingly competitive world.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">At the same time, he said, the state must do
more to support the arts.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;A community must also have a soul,&quot;
the governor said. &quot;Our culture, our essence is captured by
the arts.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But the governor said Minnesota's identity is
also bound to its professional sports. If Minnesota does not
support a new stadium for the Twins, he said, the state will lose
the team. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I don't want future generations to tune
in the radio to hear the Memphis Twins,&quot; he said. &quot;They
are our Twins.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Carlson said critics who decry the use of
public money for private enterprise forget that the the state has
a history of committing public resources to private ventures.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">It was state aid that bailed out Northwest
Airlines and saved 20,000 jobs, he said. It helped establish a
potato processing plant at Park Rapids, he said, and an
exposition center in Worthington. Moreover, he said, by the year
2000 the state of Minnesota will have pumped nearly $100 million
in aid into the state's ethanol industry.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;If we were to allow our critics to define
who we are and where we are going, we would still be sitting in a
cave debating about whether to use fire,&quot; Carlson said.
&quot;The only era created by critics were the Dark Ages.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Republicans and Democrats generally liked the
speech.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Moe said there was much in the governor's
speech Democrats could support. Johnson said it was the best
State of the State speech he had heard while in the Senate.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;It was good enough to cross out Democrats
and Republicans and put in Lutherans and use it on Sunday
morning,&quot; said Johnson, a Lutheran minister.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But some took exception to the speech.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Demonstrators carried signs denouncing the
cigarette tax increase and held a &quot;smoke-in&quot; outside
the House chambers while the governor delivered his speech. They
said the governor was trying to make minorities and the poor pay
for the new stadium.<br>
House Majority Leader Ted Winter, DFL-Fulda, complained that the
governor's education initiatives were inadequate. He said Carlson
offered no new money to pay for improvements in public education.
By themselves, he said, statewide student testing and tax credits
for private schools will do little to help public education in
Minnesota.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Others embraced the speech but said it was at
odds with what the governor has said elsewhere.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">At the Minnesota Chamber of Commerce's annual
meeting, Carlson called for property tax reform that shifted the
tax burden from the Twin Cities to rural Minnesota and from
commercial-industrial to residential properties. During that
speech, he repeatedly criticized Moorhead, saying 70 percent of
the city's budget was based on state aid.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;It was a positive, upbeat speech that was
different from his speech at the chamber last week,&quot; said
Rep. Kevin Goodno, R-Moorhead. &quot;There he criticized Moorhead
twice. This time he mentioned Moorhead twice, both times
positive.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Sen. Keith Langseth, DFL-Glyndon, said, &quot;I
liked what he said today. If he will follow from here on it, we
will be just fine.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But Langseth said he could not get excited
about the governor's speech on community because he has never
really practiced it. Carlson has not talked about one Minnesota
in the past, he said. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;He said just the other night that what
Moorhead gets is bad for Minnesota,&quot; Langseth said.
&quot;I'm not excited when I heard just the opposite just a short
time ago.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Lawmakers seek snow emergency funds</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="3">By John Sundvor <br>
The Forum <br>
</font><font size="4">ST. PAUL, Legislation appropriating $20
million for emergency snow removal will be introduced in the
Minnesota Senate today by a delegation of outstate lawmakers.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The bill is tailored for the 40 hardest hit
counties in western Minnesota. But Senate Minority Leader Dean
Johnson, R-Willmar, the bill's lead author, said the money would
also be available to 38 other counties  including Ramsey and Hennepin
 burdened by heavier than expected accumulations of snow.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;The townships are literally out of
money,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;Their equipment has broken
down.&quot; The situation is dangerous in many parts of the
state. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Johnson and the other Senate authors  Keith
Langseth, DFL-Glyndon; Jim Vickerman, DFL-Tracy; Cal Larson,
R-Fergus Falls; Arlene Lesweski, R-Marshall, and Dennis
Frederickson, R-New Ulm  all told tales of hardship and grief
brought on by record accumulations of snow in the western third
of the state.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Schools are closed, Johnson said, and there are
stories of farmers unable to get feed to their cattle. In
Kandiyohi County alone, Johnson said, local governments are
paying $60 to $75 an hour on contracts with private companies for
snow removal. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;This is to give some hope to local
elected officials,&quot; Johnson said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Lesweski, whose district has been particularly
hard hit by the storms, said the storms are the worst she has
seen in her lifetime. And with the new winds, she said, roads
that have just been cleared will begin filling in again. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Lesweski said the weather already has produced
tragedies.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Lesweski said a woman in her district suffered
a heart attack during one of the storms. On the way to the
hospital, she said, the car the woman was riding in became stuck
in the snow. By the time the driver was able to return to the car with
help, Lesweski said, the woman was dead. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Larson said the snow accumulation has been so
great that its weight collapsed the roof of a building three
buildings away from his office in Fergus Falls. A major building
in Glenwood collapsed under the weight of the snow, he said. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Many areas of western Minnesota, Larson said,
have high concentrations of elderly residents. There is a
critical need, he said, to be able to transport people to medical
aid. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Langseth, who operates a dairy farm with his
son near Glyndon, said the deep snow is hard on cattle. It is
important to keep feeding the cattle, he said, but the snow
depths make it &quot;very wearing&quot; work.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;When I call home,&quot; Langseth said,
&quot;they're a little irritated because I'm down here.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Johnson said he has met with officials in the
governor's office and has been assured that Gov. Arne Carlson is
receptive to the idea of emergency aid. He said legislative
leaders also seem open to the idea.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We believe this is the most important
issue facing this Legislature,&quot; Johnson said. &quot;By their
phone calls and by their letters, people are asking for our
help.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But Jim Franklin, director of Emergency
Management in Minnesota, said neither the state aid nor the
federal disaster declaration that is expected in the next two
days will have little immediate impact on snow removal efforts.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The state may be able to use the aid to contact
with more private contractors, he said, but most of the available
equipment has already been pressed into service. The state really
has few places to go to get extra snow cleaning equipment, he
said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Snow blowers and other pieces of snow removal
machinery already have been sent to the area from Department of Transportation
districts in the eastern reaches of the state. Hennepin County
also has sent snow clearing equipment into the area, as has the
Minnesota National Guard.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Minnesota cannot ask for equipment from
Wisconsin or Michigan, he said, because those states have their
own snow problems. North and South Dakota, he said, have been
asking Minnesota for equipment. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I don't think we can do much better than
what we are doing,&quot; Franklin said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Carlson welfare proposal tightens work
mandates, residency requirements</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4">By John Sundvor <br>
The Forum <br>
ST. PAUL &#150; A tough welfare reform package filled with work
deadlines, and residency requirements was proposed Thursday by
Gov. Arne Carlson and the Minnesota Department of Human Services.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The package, only technically different from
the reforms introduced in the Senate earlier in the day, worries
some welfare advocates. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Affirmative Options for Welfare Coalition,
a coalition of more than 40 different groups, said the proposal
unveiled by the Department of Human Services represents a good
start. But Shawn Framsted, a member of the coalition, said she
worries that the child care and education components of the
initiative do not go far enough.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;There is a fear,&quot; she said, &quot;of
a race to the bottom with benefits.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Both the governor's and the reform plan offered
by Sen. Don Samuelson, DFL-Brainerd, rely heavily on work rather
than handouts to the poor.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Samuelson's plan, the first bill introduced in
the Senate, would require all first-time applicants to either
search for a job or do public service work for six months. In
return, the state would offer them child care, cash benefits and
vouchers for their rent and utilities. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The governor's plan calls for:</font></p>

<p><font size="4">A 30-day residency for welfare benefits. Until
that residency is met, applicants would not be eligible for
welfare aid in Minnesota. For six months, they would be eligible
for the same benefits they received in the state they left. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">A one year limit on educational benefits for
welfare recipients.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">A five-year, lifetime limit on benefits.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Immediate work for all two-parent families.
Single parents would be given six months to find work. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">More funding for child care. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">David Doth, commissioner of the Department of
Health and Human Services, and his assistant said the changes are
aimed at making the transition from welfare to work as humane as
possible. But they admitted there would also be pain involved.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;It would not be realistic to say there
would be no pain,&quot; said Debra Haskins, assistant
commissioner.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The governor's initiative springs from a 2
year pilot project called the Minnesota Family Investment
program. Tested in eight counties in central and eastern
Minnesota, the project encouraged welfare applicants to look for
jobs rather than handouts from the state.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Of the 4,250 who participated in the pilot
project, about 36 percent have found jobs, compared with 14
percent of the people on the state's traditional welfare
programs.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The governor's reform package seeks to make
that test project a statewide program. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;This isn't just about welfare
reform,&quot; Doth said. &quot;It is not just about putting
together a document that meets federal compliance issues in
federal law. In fact the starting point is much more important:
It is about how we invest in families and how we use our
resources in the most effective way possible to help the 120,000
children who are now in poverty out of poverty. It is about how
we use those resources to work with the families to place them in
jobs.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">That is what worries welfare advocates.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Carlson administration insists that now,
with the state at full employment, is a good time to make the
change. Over the next 10 years, they say, 300,000 new jobs and
600,000 existing jobs will become available to welfare recipients
willing to work. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">But welfare advocates, including the coalition,
worries there will be no safety net for the poor if the economy
sours and the poor lose their jobs. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Moreover, they complain that the governor's
workfare proposal actually cuts the benefits that were
incorporated into the MFIP test program. Framsted said if the
benefits are going to be cut back fewer recipients may end up
working.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;If you start ratcheting it down, you're
messing with the successful qualities of the program,&quot; she
said. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I don't think we could ever say that this
means there will not be pain anywhere,&quot; Doth said.
&quot;There is no magic answer for that.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Indeed, the program makes it clear that the
governor has no interest in having the state restore all of the
cuts made by Congress. For legal immigrants who lose their
federal welfare benefits, it offers them only enough aid to ease
their transition to work. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">For the next six years, Doth said, the state
will receive about $268 million a year in a block grant for
welfare. The state normally spends an equal amount. The
governor's proposal, he said, is structured to not increase that
spending.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;This program is a priority with the
governor,&quot; Doth said, &quot;But we have been told to live
within our means.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="5" face="Times New Roman"><strong><tt>Session
opens with promises of harmony<br>
</tt></strong></font><font size="4" face="Times New Roman"><tt><br>
By John Sundvor <br>
The Forum <br>
ST. PAUL <br>
The 1997 session of the Minnesota Legislature opened Tuesday with
promises of harmony, the election of a new House speaker and
welfare demonstrators screaming about changes not yet proposed.<br>
It was a day when pomp and ceremony superseded substance, when
expectation gave way to ritual.<br>
The speculation that for days swirled through the Capitol about a
possible floor fight for House speaker turned out to be just
that: speculation.<br>
Former House Speaker Irv Anderson of International Falls met
periodically with Republicans for days, hoping to forge an
alliance that would enable him to hold the speakership. <br>
Republican Minority Leader Steve Sviggum of Kenyon said Anderson
asked him late last week for enough Republican votes to re-elect
him over former DFL Majority Leader Phil Carruthers of Brooklyn
Center, the designated House Speaker of the DFL Caucus. Sviggum
said he rejected the overture. <br>
Nevertheless, the discussions continued.<br>
Monday night Anderson and about 20 House Republicans met again,
reportedly to discuss the bipartisan alliance. <br>
At an early morning media briefing, Sviggum discounted the
meeting. He said he told Anderson the alliance would not happen.<br>
Sviggum predicted that he would face Carruthers in an election on
the House floor and that Carruthers would win on a 70-64
party-line vote. The prediction proved accurate.<br>
Democrats took turns praising Carruthers for his ability to reach
consensus rather than confrontation. Rep. Carlos Mariani, DFL-St.
Paul, nominated Carruthers, saying the House needed a leader who
would bring more harmony to the deliberations. <br>
&quot;We have much work to do,&quot; Mariani said.<br>
Rep. Doug Peterson, DFL-Madison, said Carruthers had a history of
being a friend to education and supporting job development and
all things important to rural Minnesota.<br>
&quot;Those who live in outstate should feel more secure with
Carruthers as House speaker,&quot; he said.<br>
But perhaps the most telling moment came when Rep. Steve Wenzel
stood to second Carruthers' nomination. Wenzel, a Democrat from
Little Falls, is chairman of the House Agriculture Committee and
an ally of Anderson's<br>
He said Carruthers could reach out to diverse elements in
Minnesota. Even though Carruthers comes from an urban background,
Wenzel said, he reaches out to agriculture and family farmers.<br>
Democrats  including Anderson  fell in line to elect
Carruthers. The vote went strictly along party lines: 70 votes
for Carruthers and 64 votes for Sviggum  just as he had
predicted.<br>
The opening ceremony in the Senate was even less eventful. <br>
Senate Majority Leader Roger Moe, DFL-Erskine, called for
bipartisan and geographic cooperation, saying that the
Legislature is &quot;faced with a long list of important, complex
and controversial issues.&quot; It will require the attention and
commitment of everyone, he said.<br>
&quot;I hope we do this in as bipartisan a manner as
possible,&quot; Moe said. &quot;I think that is what the public is
asking us to do.&quot;<br>
It is time to bring more civility to the process. It is time, Moe
said, for Minnesotans to put aside geographic differences and
begin to think of themselves as one.<br>
&quot;As a state with 4.650 million people, we can't waste time
pulling ourselves apart,&quot; he said. &quot;We are one state
and one family, and we have to remember that.&quot;<br>
He said legislators must respond to everyone throughout
Minnesota, not just to their own constituents.<br>
It was a message that was echoed by Senate Minority Leader Dean
Johnson, IR-Willmar, who said urban and rural Minnesota are made
better when they appreciate each other.<br>
Johnson said Republicans are ready to work cooperatively with
Democrats on public policy.<br>
&quot;That does not mean we won't differ,&quot; he said,
&quot;but it will be done in a thoughtful manner. I hope the
media will be able to say when we go home May 19 that they worked
hard for the good of Minnesota.&quot;<br>
The messages were not unusual for the first day of a legislative
session. But they did conflict with the screams that came from
the Rotunda between the House and Senate, where Welfare Rights demonstrators
used the ceremonies to condemn any changes in welfare programs.<br>
&quot;The proof is in the pudding,&quot; Moe said, adding that
the trick will be to carry the theme of bipartisanship and
harmony through the session.<br>
That may be easier said than done. There are a number of
circumstances already in play that threaten to undermine that
effort.<br>
In the House, the DFL is still deeply divided by the caucus'
decision to dump Anderson as speaker. The Senate, meanwhile, is
flooded with Democrats and Republicans, each hoping to position
himself to be governor in two years.<br>

<p><font size="4"><b>Minnesota House leaders vow bipartisan cooperation</b></font></p>

<p><font size="4">By John Sundvor <br>
The Forum </font></p>

<p><font size="4">ST. PAUL - Minnesota House leaders vowed Monday
to pursue welfare reform and three other major initiatives on a
bipartisan, cooperative basis when the legislative session opens
today. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">House Speaker-designate Phil Carruthers, DFL-Brooklyn
Center, Democratic Majority Leader-designate Ted Winter of Fulda,
and Republican Minority Leader Steve Sviggum of Kenyon said
voters are demanding less partisanship and more cooperation in
setting public policy. And they said cooperation will be the
hallmark of the 1997 legislative session. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The two House caucuses will work together to remove
the budget caps from primary and secondary education, implement
welfare reforms that comply with new federal mandates, develop a new
code of ethics for legislators, and revise the state's 1993
anti-stalking law. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We hope the legislative session will be a productive
one for the people of Minnesota,&quot; Carruthers said. &quot;To
do that, we must cooperate and not waste time with partisan
squabbles.&quot; </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Carruthers and Sviggum said they hope the bipartisanship
the two caucuses will pursue on the four legislative issues will
lead to even more cooperation between Republicans and Democrats in
the five-month legislative session. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">But there are already signs that the
cooperation the two caucuses seek with each other and with their
own members could be elusive. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">There are indications that the wounds left from
a bruising election in November have not fully healed. Moreover,
the House DFL Caucus seems deeply divided as the 1997 legislative
session opens its doors for business. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">That division may be most evident in the
election of a new House speaker today. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Normally, the election of Senate president, the House
majority leader and the House speaker are routine matters that
are mixed into the pomp of the opening-day ceremonies. This year,
the House DFL allegiance is split between House Speaker Irv Anderson
of International Falls and Carruthers. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Carruthers narrowly unseated Anderson in a caucus
election shortly after the November general election. While the
election really only designates the majority caucus' choice for
House speaker, it is usually tantamount to being elected. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">But last week, Anderson met with Sviggum and asked
for enough Republican votes to defeat Carruthers when the
election is brought to the House floor. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Sviggum, who has often quarreled with Anderson, said
he rejected any proposed alliance with the outgoing speaker.
Instead, he said, he has aligned his caucus with Carruthers and
Winter to work in a bipartisan way for change. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I don't think anyone should see this as a
love-in,&quot; he said. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The two caucuses, Sviggum said, will continue
to have honest differences. But those differences will be based
on public policy, he said, not on personalities. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">At least one of those differences could
jeopardize the bipartisanship that Sviggum and the Democrats have
been promoting. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Republicans still believe the Democrats
resorted to lying in the fall general election campaign to retain
control of the House. They say an advertisement accusing
Republicans of voting to cut school funding by $330 million was
not true. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Sviggum said the House Republican Caucus has been
meeting with an attorney and still intends to file suit against
Democrats in at least two counties. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We'll see just how far this
bipartisanship goes when it comes to that lawsuit,&quot; Winter
snorted later. &quot;It is one thing to stand up here and talk about
bipartisanship and then stick a knife in your back with that
lawsuit.&quot; </font></p>

Hunter Halgrimson: Soup warms the spirit </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4">It's been a winter for soup, pots of soup,
buckets of soup. Soup's comforting warmth repairs spirits
fractured by an extremely savage season. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">While a bowl of soup may not be as exciting as
a trip to California, it's cheaper. And on most days, soup is far
easier to come by than transportation out of town.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The name chowder supposedly comes from the
French chaudire, a large, heavy pot used by fishermen to cook
fish stews and soups.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Chowders are among the coziest of soups. Maybe
it's because they are often milk based. Their chunky, rich
goodness fills the belly and sustains the soul.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The following recipes are gleaned from a number
of sources including a recipe from my late father-in-law, Ed
Halgrimson of Leeds, N.D., who learned to cook when he was
widowed.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Grandpa Halgrimson (as we called him) used salt
pork in his chowder rather than bacon and steamed the vegetables
in a little water rather than sauting them in butter.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">I usually add a bit more celery than called for
because I am particularly fond of cooked celery. Some cooks add a
cup or two of crab meat to the Corn Chowder. For a richer soup,
light cream may be substituted for part of the milk. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Chowder is as satisfying to make as it is to
eat.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Corn Chowder<br>
 pound bacon diced<br>
1 large onion chopped<br>
2 stalks celery, chopped<br>
1 small red bell pepper, chopped<br>
1 large potato, scrubbed and diced<br>
 cup dry white wine<br>
2 cups chicken stock (or water)<br>
3 to 4 tablespoons flour<br>
 cup cold milk<br>
1 cups hot milk<br>
2 cups corn kernels<br>
Chopped parsley<br>
Bay leaf<br>
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste<br>
Pinch of paprika</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In a large, heavy pot, fry bacon until crisp
and drain, leaving 2 tablespoons fat. Add leeks (or onion),
celery and bell pepper and cook until vegetables have softened.
Add potatoes and wine and cook briefly, scraping bottom of pot to
remove any bits of bacon.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Add chicken stock (or water). Stir flour and
cold milk until smooth and whisk mixture into soup stirring
constantly until soup begins to thicken. Add hot milk and corn
and season with parsley, bay leaf, salt, pepper and a pinch of
paprika.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Cover and simmer for about 30 minutes. If soup
seems too thick, add a little extra milk. Makes 5 to 6 servings.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Clam Chowder<br>
2 slices bacon, diced<br>
2 tablespoons butter<br>
1 or 2 leeks, white part only, chopped (or 1 onion, chopped)<br>
1 stalk celery, chopped<br>
1 large potato, scrubbed and diced<br>
2 to 3 cans (6 ounces each) minced clams, drained, juice reserved<br>
3 tablespoons flour<br>
4 cups warmed milk<br>
Bay leaf<br>
Salt and freshly ground pepper to taste<br>
In a large, heavy pot, fry bacon until crisp and drain off fat.
Add butter, leeks (or onion) and celery and cook until vegetables
have softened.<br>
Whisk in the flour, cook briefly and slowly stir in warmed milk.
When soup begins to thicken, stir in potatoes, reserved clam
juice and bay leaf.<br>
Cover and simmer until potatoes are tender, about 30 minutes.
Season to taste with salt and pepper. Makes about 4 servings.</font></p>

Hooked on coffee drinks </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4">Whether you have received an espresso machine
as a gift, or you regularly use the drive-through coffee bar,
you're probably hooked on cappuccino and caf latte Italian
espresso drinks.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Many of these new concoctions pack more than
caffeine. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Most contain sugar, added fats and &#150; on
the up side &#150; calcium. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Some actually are sugar free, or made with
sugar-free flavored syrups.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Coffee talk</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Can't tell your espresso from your au lait?
Check out the following guide:</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Espresso: Strong coffee made by forcing water
under pressure through finely ground dark roasted beans. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The crema (the frothy part of the espresso)
should be on top when espresso is correctly ground and packed in
the filter head. Espresso is served in a &quot;demitasse&quot;
(small) cup and usually can hold up to 3 ounces of liquid.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Cappuccino: The common recipe for a basic
6-ounce cappuccino is one-third espresso, one-third steamed milk,
and one-third frothed milk (the creamy foam from the steamed
milk).</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Caf Latte and Caf Au Lait: Latte (LAH-tay)
is Italian, and au lait (oh-LAY) is French. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Italian version is usually made with a
single shot of espresso. Add steamed milk to fill an 8- to
10-ounce mug. Lattes are frequently flavored with Italian syrups.
</font></p>

<p><font size="4">To make caf au lait, brew French roast coffee
using a coffee filter. Serve in a cup, with a separate pitcher of
heated milk. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">The nutrition angle</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Even if a java concoction looks irresistable,
think before you drink.</font></p>

<ul>
    <li><font size="4">A 12-ounce cup of cappuccino made with
        whole milk has 110 calories, 20 percent of the
        recommended daily intake of calcium and 74 milligrams of
        caffeine. Cappuccino made with nonfat milk has only 60
        calories and the same amount of calcium and caffeine.</font></li>
    <li><font size="4">A 12-ounce cup of caf latte made with
        whole milk has 180 calories, 35 percent of therecommended
        daily intake of calcium and 74 milligrams of caffeine.</font></li>
    <li><font size="4">A 10-ounce cup of plain coffee has 6
        calories, 0 calcium, and 164 milligrams of caffeine.
        Plain decaffeinated coffee has 0 calories, 0 calcium, and
        6 milligrams of caffeine.</font></li>
</ul>

<p><font size="4">When drinking out </font></p>

<p><font size="4">At your local coffee bar, cut the caffeine with
decaffeinated coffee. Request nonfat milk and sugar-free syrups
for specialty coffees.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">If you regularly use the cappuccino machines at
quick-stop gas stations, be aware of what you're drinking.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">An ingredient list for the most popular flavor,
French vanilla, contains: </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Sugar, non-dairy creamer, partially
hydrogenated vegetable oil (may contain one or more of canola,
coconut, soybean or palm kernel oils) corn syrup solids, sodium
caseinate, artificial colors, artificial flavor, nonfat dry milk,
instant coffee, cocoa, cellulose gum, salt, and other
preservative ingredients. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">To reduce diet saboteurs like sugar or palm
oil, combine a half-cup of cappuccino with a half-cup of regular
or decaffeinated coffee.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">It is a wonderful way to enjoy a full taste
with fewer calories.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Another option is to make coffee drinks at
home. Here's a favorite of mine from my book, &quot;Cooking
Healthy, Fast and Superfast&quot;:</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Home-flavored Brazilian Coffee</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Place 2 tablespoons instant cocoa mix in a cup.
</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Fill it with hot, strong coffee. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Stir with cinnamon stick.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Top with fat-free whipped topping.</font></p>

hspace="5" width="73" height="97"></strong></font><font size="4"><strong>Andrea
Hunter Halgrimson: Cauliflower arguably one of the best white
vegetables</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Of all flowers, I like the cauliflower
best.&quot;<br>
Dr. Samuel Johnson</font></p>

<p><font size="4">It is the flower I too like best, at least for
eating in a season when the closest we get to fresh garden blooms
are pictures in rapidly arriving seed catalogues.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The number of flowers available for winter
meals is limited, the greenhouse variety being inappropriate
because of chemicals. But the produce department of the
supermarket comes to the rescue.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Cauliflower is one of my favorite vegetables.
My heritage is Norwegian and we are known for our fondness for
monochromatic meals  white on white on off-white. And what's
whiter than creamed cauliflower soup or cauliflower with a
blanket of cheese sauce?</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Cauliflower is not only delicious in soups and
with sauces but simmered, steamed, stir-fried, baked and pickled
as well. Some people eat it raw. I want mine cooked, and cooked
long enough to pierce easily with a fork. Undercooked vegetables
are a hazard. They fly off of the plate when approached by a
fork, often maiming nearby diners.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The other part of my heritage is English which
may explain my liking for well- cooked vegetables. Except in
Chinese cooking when firmness is necessary for eating with
chopsticks.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">When buying cauliflower, look for firm, compact
heads with unblemished flowerets, also called curd. Leaves should
be crisp and bright green. Although both leaves and stems are
edible, most people trim them away. They take a little longer to
cook than the flowerets.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Cook whole heads (head down, uncovered) for 20
to 25 minutes and separated flowerets for about 7 to 10 minutes.
(Overcooking causes an unpleasant odor.)</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Adding _ cup of milk or a tablespoon of fresh
lemon juice to the salted boiling water prevents discoloration.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Cauliflower is in season from September through
January. Refrigerate and store tightly wrapped for up to three
days. Cooked cauliflower may be stored for the same length of
time.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Cauliflower is low in calories and high in
fiber, protein, vitamins B and C and potassium.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Cream of Cauliflower Soup</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Recipe adapted from &quot;Greene on

<title>grapefruit</title>
</head>

<body bgcolor="#FFFFFF">

<p><font size="4"><strong>Plump, round grapefruit is more than
just a diet food </strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4">Michael Bond, author of the Paddington Bear
stories for children, also writes mysteries for adults. His
grown-up stories concern a fictional restaurant reviewer turned
detective, Monsieur Pample-mousse, and his faithful dog, Pommes
Frites.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In French pamplemousse means grapefruit.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">I bring it up because I like the way some words
feel and sound when spoken. Pamplemousse, I can almost taste the
word  plump and sensual, round and juicy the way a grapefruit
is.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Like apples, cherries, grapes, melon and
strawberries, grapefruit has special tools that help make them
easier to eat.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">For those who like their grapefruit on the
half-shell, knives with short, supple blades having a curved,
serrated end and small narrow spoons with serrated tips, loosen
the segments and make eating a grapefruit relatively squirt-free.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">I prefer the full flavor of unchilled fruit and
enjoy grapefruit peeled and eaten out of hand. I let a few
sections dry out until the outer layer stiffens so the sections
pop when bitten into, filling my mouth with their sweetness.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">My mother sprinkled grapefruit halves with a
little sugar, browned them under the broiler and served them
decorated with a maraschino cherry. She also fried bananas and
broiled peach halves filled with blue cheese. No wonder I like
warm fruit.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Citrus fruits have been cultivated since
ancient times and are thought to be the first major crops raised
away from their indigenous soils in Southeast Asia. Citrus trees
were also the first to be grown indoors in cool climates.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Freshly picked fruit warmed by the sun is
always the tastiest. In frigid climates such as ours, this is
only possible if you have a fruit tree growing in your house.
(And some Fargo friends of mine do.)<br>
Or you can travel to Arizona, California, Texas or Florida. Or
you can fly to Jamaica where grapefruit originated.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Some scientists believe the grapefruit
developed as a mutation of the pomelo.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The pomelo probably originated in Malaysia. It
is also known as &quot;shaddock,&quot; for the British sea
captain who brought the seeds to the West Indies.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Others believe grapefruit is the result of an
accidental cross in nature between pomelo and citron.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Whatever the story, Jamaican grapefruit seeds
arrived in Florida in the early 1800s, and by the end of the
century grapefruit was being cultivated as a commercial crop.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">How the fruit came by its name is also in
question. Most reference sources claim that the name came from
the fact that grapefruit grows in clusters, like grapes.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Waverly Root, author of &quot;Food,&quot; says
that the first written reference to grapefruit stated that it
tasted like grapes, but since it doesn't, researchers later
created the grape cluster explanation for the name.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Grapefruit do not grow in grape-like
bunches,&quot; Root says, &quot;except in the minds of persons
endowed with flexible imaginations or obsessed by a need to
introduce human logic into nature ...&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The United States produces the majority of the
world's grapefruit, followed by Israel and Thailand.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Serving suggestions for grapefruit include
adding it to shellfish salads, using it in marmalade, sorbets and
compotes. The peel is often candied. It is delicious paired with
avocado.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">However, Tom Stobart, author of &quot;The
Cook's Encyclopedia,&quot; believes that &quot;It is unwise to
mix grapefruit with other fruits in salads ... and most of the
appetizers in which grapefruit segments are mixed with shrimps,
mayonnaise, and almost anything the magazine cookery writer can
think of are better forgotten.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">He adds that grapefruit does not go with wine,
which doesn't make any difference when it's served at breakfast,
where he seems to think it belongs.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">When buying grapefruit, look for firm fruit
with smooth, finely grained rind. The rind may have a red blush
or green hue.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">As with any fruit, select those that feel heavy
for their size. Grapefruit may be kept unrefrigerated for two
days or refrigerated (bagged in the crisper) for up to two weeks.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">A medium grapefruit contains 140 calories and
about 2/3 cup juice, which has 60 calories and provides vitamins
C and A. However, pink- and red-fleshed fruits contain more A
than yellow-fleshed fruits.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Oh, I almost forgot Monsieur Pamplemousse's
dog. In French, pommes frites are fried potatoes.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Marinated Flank Steak<br>
with Citrus Salsa<br>
Marinade<br>
</font></p>

<p><font size="4"> cup frozen grapefruit juice concentrate,
thawed<br>
 cup frozen orange juice concentrate, thawed<br>
1 jalapeo pepper, seeded and finely chopped<br>
1 teaspoon freshly ground black pepper<br>
1 teaspoon good chile powder<br>
 cup water</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Salsa<br>
2 tablespoons reserved marinade<br>
1 pound beef flank steak<br>
 cup chopped scallions<br>
2 tablespoons chopped parsley<br>
1 tablespoon lime juice<br>
Pinch of salt<br>
1 grapefruit, peeled, seeded, chopped<br>
2 navel oranges, peeled, seeded, chopped</font></p>

<p><font size="4">6 7-inch tortillas, warmed</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Jalapeo peppers for garnish</font></p>

<p><font size="4">1 grapefruit, sliced for garnish</font></p>

<p><font size="4">For marinade, combine grapefruit and orange
juice concentrates, chopped jalapeno, pepper and chile powder in
a glass bowl (not metal or unglazed ceramic). Reserve 2
tablespoons marinade for salsa and add water to remaining
marinade.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Score steak diagonally in a diamond pattern at
1-inch intervals on both sides. Place it in a plastic bag in a
shallow dish and pour marinade over steak. Seal the bag. Marinate
for 2 to 3 hours on the countertop or overnight in the
refrigerator, turning bag occasionally. (If refrigerated, bring
to room temperature before cooking.)</font></p>

<p><font size="4">In a glass bowl, combine reserved 2 tablespoons
of marinade, scallions, parsley, lime juice and salt. Add chopped
grapefruit and orange. Stir gently. </font></p>

<p><font size="4">Cover and let stand at least one-half hour to
blend flavors.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Remove meat from bag. Discard marinade. Grill
meat under a broiler or over hot coals turning once. Allow about
12 to 14 minutes total time for medium-rare.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Thinly slice meat and, if desired, garnish with
jalapenos and grapefruit slices. Serve with salsa and warmed
tortillas.<br>

<p><font size="4"><strong>North Dakota snowbirds flock together
in warm Arizona</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><em>Mesa, Ariz. (AP)<br>
</em>When meteorologists report that a blizzard is barreling
across the Plains, hundreds of North Dakotans shiver
sympathetically in Arizona's version of winter.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Snowbirds, the name given to those who go south
for the winter, often fraternize in Arizona, Florida and other
warm settings.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Desert sun dances on brimming coffee as
tattered copies of North Dakota newspapers are passed from hand
to hand.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;This is home,&quot; one person explained
at a recent get-together. &quot;But that's home-home.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Arizona has thousands of North Dakota
snowbirds. In many cases, they live in the same communities.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;There are a lot of North Dakota people in
certain pockets,&quot; said Bill Barker, a real estate agent in
Mesa. &quot;Everything sort of becomes a neighborhood again down
here.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Walter Renden, a former Bismarck, N.D.,
resident, said he has always felt at home in Arizona.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;All you have to do is go to Mesa and
throw a stone, and you'll hit a North Dakotan,&quot; he said.
&quot;In fact, when I was in Bismarck last, I remarked that there
were so many North Dakota license plates that I felt like I was
in Mesa.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Myron Atkinson, a Bismarck attorney and real
estate developer, owns a winter home in Mesa.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We really wanted a sense of
community,&quot; he said. &quot;We knew there were lots and lots
of North Dakotans in the East Valley.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Atkinson and his wife coordinate a monthly
Bismarck Breakfast at Luby's Cafeteria in a Mesa shopping center.
Gallons of coffee and a buffet-style meal disappear as up to 250
Bismarck natives share the latest news.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Former Bismarck mayors Evan Lips and Ed Lahr,
and former governor Art Link, each have given speeches at the
breakfast.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We're very current about what's going on
in Bismarck, the weather and so on,&quot; Atkinson said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Atkinsons also are among the thousands who
gather on the first Sunday of every March for a North Dakota
picnic at Mesa's Pioneer Park.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;They'll have 6,000 or 8,000 for
that,&quot; Atkinson said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;When you see that crowd, you'd swear
there wasn't anybody left in North Dakota,&quot; said Marion
Johnson, a snowbird from Rugby.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Across Arizona and beyond, there are other
several events that bring together North Dakota snowbirds.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;We speak the same language,&quot; Johnson
said. &quot;We can talk about the same things and understand each
other.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Atkinson said weather is a frequent
conversation topic. In recent weeks, photographs of North
Dakota's blizzards were splashed across the front page of The
Arizona Republic newspaper.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;It's just a very extraordinary
winter,&quot; Atkinson said. &quot;I hope, for everyone there,
that it lets up and doesn't get repeated for a very long
time.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Despite the fondness snowbirds hold for their
home state, they are glad to be get away for a while.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;It's just frozen over,&quot; Janice
Jaeger said of her summer farm near Rugby. &quot;It's not where I
want to be this time of year.&quot;</font></p>

align="left" hspace="6" vspace="5" width="75" height="112"></font><font
size="4"><strong>Kevin Schnepf: Fans love beer and a winner</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4">The sound of kids slapping miniature plastic
hockey sticks against wooden bleachers can be annoying. But a
couple of weeks ago in The Coliseum of north Fargo, it was sweet
music to the ears of the owners of the Fargo-Moorhead Ice Sharks
junior hockey team.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Did your kid get a stick?&quot; asked one
of the owners, Paul Noah, who was beaming over the fact that the
Ice Sharks finally drew a crowd of more than 1,500 on a Sunday
night.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Not only was the stick-slapping fanfare
building, so was the popularity of Ice Sharks hockey. Why? The
Sharks were riding a four-game winning streak, which they
extended to five that night.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">As of this past weekend, the Sharks were still
in contention for a playoff spot in the United States Hockey
League. And to boost their momentum, the Sharks got the OK to
sell beer for the first time Saturday and Sunday.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The brouhaha between the Fargo Park Board and
the Sharks has stirred up more noise than any kid could produce
with a plastic hockey stick. No doubt, being able to sell beer
will only help the Sharks attract more fans. Besides, allowing
the Sharks to sell beer was only the fair thing to do -
considering Fargo's two other &quot;minor league&quot; franchises
(F-M Beez basketball and F-M RedHawks baseball) can do it.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">You could hear the Sharks' owners clamoring:
&quot;PBR me ASAP&quot; - meaning park board reversal as soon as
possible. Now you can hear the Sharks' owners thanking the Park
Board members: &quot;I love you, man. This Bud's for you.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">But you won't hear them saying, &quot;It
doesn't get any better than this.&quot; The Sharks, the Beez, and
the RedHawks can tap the Rockies all they want, but they'll each
end up with bitter beer face if their teams don't win.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Fans may love their beer, but they love a
winner even more. This announcement is as ancient as the Pabst
Blue Ribbon logo. But it still holds true. Just ask the Beez.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Fargo Civic Memorial Auditorium was buzzing
one year ago when the Beez won the inaugural International
Basketball Association championship. The Civic wasn't packed by
any means when that season started. But when the Beez kept
winning and winning, the Civic became sold out.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">This past season, beer sales alone couldn't
pack the Civic. The Beez kept losing and losing and losing. And
the crowds kept dwindling and dwindling and dwindling.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Beez claimed everything that could have
went wrong did go wrong this past season. Last summer, everything
that could have went right did go right for the RedHawks' first
season in Northern League baseball.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">For starters, fans wanted to see the brand new
stadium. The fans wanted to see a caliber of baseball this area
hadn't been exposed to since the 1960s. The fans who didn't have
a lake cabin wanted something to do. The fans also were afforded
one of the most pleasant summers the Red River Valley has
experienced this decade.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">And as the RedHawks won two division
championships, the fans were not only having fun, but they were
able to see a winner.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">RedHawks management will be the first to admit
that's a pretty tough act to follow. Yes, they will be selling
beer. Yes, their beautiful stadium will draw fans. And yes,
RedHawks management is certainly regarded as the marketing
experts around the Upper Midwest.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;You can succeed without winning, but
obviously winning is ultimately the successful season,&quot; said
RedHawks general manager John Dittrich. &quot;If you sit back and
say 'I've got to win to be successful,' then you are
doomed.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Because of the established leagues that they
play in, the RedHawks and Sharks are far from being doomed. The
Beez, on the other hand, need to learn a thing or two from their
counterparts.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">If they don't, they won't draw the fans - fans
who love a winner.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The beer they sip may &quot;taste great.&quot;
But if their team doesn't win, the arenas will be &quot;less
filling.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4"><strong>Stars please their fans with a victory
over Ice Sharks</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><em>By Dave Kolpack <br>
The Forum <br>
</em>While it sounded like the Lincoln Stars had the largest
following of fans since the Grateful Dead, most of the weekend's
noise came from two distinct fan clubs. They came from Regina,
Sask., to watch Chad Mazurak and Marc Suderman. They came from
Roseau, Minn., to watch Bryan Lundbohm.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">A little hometown appreciation went a long way
on Sunday when all three players scored goals, with Lundbohm
notching a pair, to help the Stars over the F-M Ice Sharks 5-3,
giving the visitors a split of the United States Hockey League
series.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I think I save my goals for when my
parents see me play,&quot; said Suderman, whose goal early in the
second period gave the Stars a 3-0 lead. &quot;They've been able
to get to three of my series and I've scored in all three of
them.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Although there were several Saskatchewan
license plates in the Coliseum parking lot, including those on
the Mazuraks' motor home, Lundbohm's group bought the most
tickets.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;I think there were probably 30 or so
people who came from Roseau this weekend to watch me play,&quot;
Lundbohm said. &quot;It almost felt like a home game for
me.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Funny thing, because the Sharks felt like they
were on the road when they were forced to skate shorthanded for
nine minutes, including a five-minute major penalty, in the last
period. That's when the Stars cracked open a tie game with two
power-play goals, including the game-winner by Lundbohm.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;You're not going to win many games when
you give a team that much time on the power play,&quot; said
Sharks forward Toby Schneider. &quot;That means you've got your
penalty-killers, your best players, on the ice all the time.
Sooner or later you're going to run out of gas.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Sharks, starting slowly for the second
straight night, fought back from a three-goal deficit to tie the
game at 3-all on Benji Wolke's goal at 9:13 of the third period.
Wolke, charging in from the right side after taking a pass from
Jerry Gernander, fought off a Lincoln defender before flipping a
shot over the shoulder of goalie Jason Braun.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">One minute later, Sharks defenseman Josh Marino
was called for holding, giving Lincoln its second power play of
the period. Lundbohm made it count when he knocked down a Sharks
defender in the slot before converting a gimme rebound.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;That was big because our special teams
have been slumping a little bit lately,&quot; Suderman said.
&quot;And we felt terrible after losing that 3-0 lead.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Any further comeback plans by the Sharks were
dashed when they were called for a five-minute high-sticking
major with 4:14 left. Although it was the stick of F-M defenseman
Jim Gernander (No. 2) that drew blood on a Stars forward, the
penalty was assessed to Tim Murphy (No. 20).</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;Jimmy was trying to block the guy's shot
and his stick rode up on him,&quot; Schneider said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Sharks were forced to gamble while skating
on the short side for the rest of the game. They had one decent
chance to tie with 2:30 left when Jeff Panzer meandered into the
Stars' zone and slipped a backhander that skimmed by the right
post.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The Stars scored on their next trip into the
offensive zone when Rich Anderson knocked in a rebound to make it
5-3. It was the third power-play goal of the game for Lincoln.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;It was frustrating because I felt like
things happened that were beyond our control,&quot; said Murphy,
who spent the final five minutes in the locker room because of
the automatic match penalty. &quot;But I think we've shown we can
play with the best teams. We beat Green Bay, we took two here
from Des Moines and we beat Lincoln. But right now it doesn't
make this loss any easier to take.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">John Spicer and Chris Sikich also scored goals
for the Sharks. Jerry Gernander, who added a pair of assists, was
the game's No. 3 star behind Lundbohm and Mazurak and their fan
clubs.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">FIRST PERIOD: 1, L, Mazurak (Suderman), 12:01.

<p><font size="4"><strong>Computer deal miffs lawmakers</strong></font></p>

<p><font size="4"><em>By Dale Wetzel <br>
Associated Press<br>
</em>BISMARCK, N.D. - North Dakota's Department of Human Services
has not justified its spending plans for a computer system to
administer the state's welfare overhaul, federal regulators say.
As a result, $5.5 million in federal aid could be lost.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The potential money crunch has infuriated
legislators, who say agency director H.C. &quot;Bud&quot; Wessman
dawdled in telling them of the difficulty at a time when budget
deadlines are looming.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The House Appropriations Committee has less
than two weeks to finish its work on the department's $1.2
billion two-year budget before the Legislature takes a midsession
break late this month.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;What's happened here has really
jeopardized the relationship between the department and the
Legislature. How can it not leave us suspicious?&quot; said Rep.
Ken Svedjan, R-Grand Forks. Svedjan is vice chairman of a House
Appropriations subcommittee on human services.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Gov. Ed Schafer, Wessman's boss, said Sunday
the situation is less serious than lawmakers believe.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;What did they do when they found out?
They took the federal government's side. That burns me,&quot;
Schafer said. &quot;Those people should be saying, 'The state's
right. The feds are wrong.'&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">The incident is likely to heighten skepticism
about the computer project, which the Department of Human
Services launched more than three years ago. Wessman has
championed it as a way to speed handling of welfare cases and
keep administrators updated on program rules.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Last year, Wessman persuaded legislators to
approve $3.7 million in money transfers within his agency's
budget to keep the project rolling.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Wessman's problems are also expected to add
momentum to efforts to strengthen legislative review of state
technology purchases, despite resistance from other branches of
state government.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Rep. Janet Wentz, R-Minot, chairwoman of the
House Appropriations subcommittee dealing with the human services
budget, angrily confronted Wessman on Thursday when he informed
the panel of the federal grant delay.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Mark Ragan, an administrator in the U.S.
Department of Health and Human Services in Washington, had told
Wessman in a Jan. 29 letter the state has not proved the system
will be worth the expense.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;The state has not provided any
documentation that supports the cost-effectiveness of these
systems,&quot; Ragan wrote. &quot;The cost of these projects is
extremely high.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">When coupled with $4.5 million in federal aid
North Dakota has already received, the state's $10.1 million
money request adds up to roughly $200,000 per welfare caseworker,
he wrote.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Wessman said Ragan had long been opposed to
North Dakota's project, but had been overridden by superiors who
have since resigned. In his own letter to Donna Shalala, U.S.
secretary of health and human services, Wessman referred to Ragan
as a &quot;typical bureaucrat.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Although a week's delay in informing lawmakers
of the problem may seem minor, that much time is an eternity in
the Legislature, where lawmakers - particularly those in charge
of writing the state's budget - are under constant pressure to
complete their work.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Schafer said human services officials had
needed to gather other data first.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;They're (legislators) whining about not
getting the letter. Well, are we going to give them the letter so
they can go bonkers?&quot; Schafer said. &quot;It's better to
give them ... some information about what our plan of action
is.&quot;</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Svedjan said Ragan raised the same questions
state lawmakers have been asking. Only last week were they
provided with the department's budget analysis, even though it
was prepared in November, two months before the Legislature
convened.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;It's hard not to believe that there isn't
some stalling going on here, and that really bothers me,&quot;
Svedjan said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Included in the Department of Human Services
budget alone are requests for $35.9 million in technology
spending over two years, including maintenance and payments to
contractors, said Don Mueller, the agency's information
management director.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Agencies within the department plan to buy 863
personal computers and four computer network servers in the next
two-year budget period. During the current 1995-97 biennium,
plans were to buy 540 personal computers and 35 servers,
documents indicate.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">That total includes equipment for the agency's
eight regional human service centers, the state mental hospital
in Jamestown and the Development Center in Grafton.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">It is comparable to the $35 million spending
increase the state House is contemplating in per-student aid for
North Dakota's elementary and secondary schools.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">Schafer believes the state will eventually
qualify for most, if not all, of the $5.5 million. If there is a
shortfall, a portion of the state's federal block grant for
welfare programs could be used, he said.</font></p>

<p><font size="4">&quot;It's not lethal to the project,&quot;
Schafer said. Using part of the welfare grant &quot;certainly
wouldn't cut back any money going to people or programs, or those
kinds of things.&quot;</font></p>

Wendall Anschutz, KCTV's weekday anchorman, helps to make News 5 one of the city's best newscasts.

Wendall received his B.A. and an M.A. in Radio-Television-Film from the University of Kansas.  He helped finance his education as announcer and
newsman at KRSL in Russell, Kansas, and at KANU-FM, the KU educational station, where he worked as news director and chief announcer.  Wendall was
also faculty advisor at KUOK, the campus training station.<P>

During his years at K.U., Wendall received several awards.  His master's thesis was named the Best Student Film of 1967 by the Department of
Radio-Television-Film.  He also received the Richard Harkness Award for Excellence in Broadcast Journalism and placed second nationally in the Sigma
Delta Chi Student Writing Contest.<P>

In Wendall's 27 years with News 5, he has done extensive field reporting, a dozen documentaries, and an award-winning feature series called "Place to
Place."  His special assignments have included an exclusive one-on-one interview with President
Carter aboard air Force One; gavel-to-gavel coverage of five National political conventions; Pope John Paul's 1987 visit to New Orleans; the
recommissioning of the U.S.S. Missouri in San Francisco, and the 1992 Heart-to-Heart airlift of medical supplies to Russia (including the first
inspection of Moscow's Petroskya Prison by a western TV crew).<P>

When Hurricane Andrew tore through the Florida Panhandle a few years ago, perhaps
the only good thing it did was give Katie Horner a chance to shine.  Katie, then the weatherperson at WEAR-TV in Pensacola, provided Florida viewers
with ongoing updates around the clock as the storm blew through the viewing area.  It also proved to many that this vibrant woman knew her business
when it came to predicting weather.<P>

Katie Horner has been lighting up Kansas City television since May of 1994, when she made her first appearance on KCTV Channel 5.  Now anchoring
weather three weekday monrings a week and weekend evenings on News 5 broadcasts, Katie has shown local viewers she knows her weather here, too.<P>

Now a resident of Overland Park, Katie attended the University of Maryland, the University of West Florida, as well as Mississippi State University. 
She received her B.A. from UWF in Public Relations and Marketing in 1988, and is currently working on her Meteorology degree.<P>

Katie is notorious around the Channel 5 newsroom for being an athlete, where she
regularly awes the coffee-drinking and donut-munching news people with tales of her
running, skiing, and aerobic endeavors.  Katie also has been known to skydive and
bungee jump (adventures in physical daring that newsroom people generally avoid).  Katie Horner trivia:  the next time you rent the movie "Groundhog
Day" starring Bill
Murray, watch closely; Katie's national map from WEAR-TV is the one Murray "blows the front" across at the beginning of the movie.  Producers of the
film liked how it 
looked.<P>

Katie is married to Dan Horner and they have a daughter, Chelsea.<P>

Sports has always been a big part of William Jackson's life, and now Kansas City sports fans are benefiting from that experience.<P>

William Jackson was born and raised in Flint, Michigan.  He graduated from Eastern Michigan with a Major in Communications and a Minor in Journalism. 
He returned to his hometown of Flint immediately after college, where he joined the staff of WEYI-TV as a news and sports reporter.  In 1984, he was
promoted to Sports Director.  In 1986, William moved to WEAR-TV in Pensacola, Florida, where he covered such rising young stars as one Emmit Smith,
now a standout professional football player.  While at WEAR he also worked with Katie Horner, News 5's weekend and morning weathercaster.  In 1991 he
moved to WTVM-TV in Birmingham, Alabama as weekend sports anchor.<P>

In August of 1994 as William quickly made his mark in the minds of local viewers with his "spirited" sports broadcasts, sometimes almost shouting out
the play-by-play call
over sports highlights from the anchor desk on News 5 at 5, 6 & 10.  As a local newspaper columnist described William's presentation, "... he's
pumped."<P>

William believes strongly in not just professional sports coverage but in the importance
of covering local sports.  Since Jackson's arrival at KCTV, the station has instituted expanded high school basketball and football coverage
utilizing "Newshawk 5" ("Newshawk 5:  Above the Rim" and "Friday Night Football").  He also blocks out a
special section of his sportscast weekly for "The Jayhawk Report" and "The Tiger
Report".<P>

As an active participant in the community as well, William lends his name and efforts to fund raising for The Clymer Neighborhood Center, as well as
making numerous public appearances.  He's a member of the Kappa Alpha Psi fraternity.  And, when he's not busy at Channel 5, he enjoys working out,
playing golf and tennis, and spending time with his son, William and daughter, Eden Rose.<P>

<b>Gary Amble</b></font></center>
<hr size=1 noshade><br>

<!--Interview-->

He's been a waiter, a pole vaulter (?), a pharmacist, and almost became a Game Warden. News 5's Chief Meteorologist Gary Amble has never been one to sit still. In our Home Page Interview, Gary tells you how Television Meteorology became his passion, and a budding career in pole vaulting got left behind. Gary can be seen weeknights on News 5 at 5, 6, and 10PM.<p>

<center><img src="gsmile.jpg" border=0></center><br>


<b>Home Page: </b>Where were you born?<br>
<b>Gary: </b>I was born in Waterloo, Iowa.<p>

<b>Home Page: </b>Did you grown up there?<br>
<img src="young.jpg" border=0 align=left><b>Gary: </b>Actually, I have lived all over the Midwest, pretty much all my life.  I lived in Iowa for the first five years, then I lived in a little suburb outside Chicago for essentially a summer.  And then we moved back to Waterloo, Iowa again, until the second grade.  From there I went to a little town north of Minneapolis called Anoka, Minnesota.  I was there from the second grade until the ninth grade.  Then I moved down to Iola,
Kansas, about 100 miles south of Kansas City, and went through high school and college.<p>

<b>Home Page: </b>Where did you go to college?<br>
<b>Gary: </b>Well, I started at Allen County Community College, right there in Iola, Kansas.  I went there on a track scholarship.  I was a little more interested in just running track than I was doing my school work.  From there I went to Pittsburgh State, where I received another track scholarship -- I was a pole vaulter.  I got a little more serious about school then, knowing
that my pole vaulting career wasn't going to take me anywhere.<P>

<img src="track.jpg" border=0 align=right>It wasn't nearly taking me high enough to get me any further.<p>


<b>Home Page: </b>What brought you to that realization?<br>
<b>Gary: </b>Well, the fact that everyone else was going higher than I was.  I thought, "Well, maybe it's time I hang this up and really start to study."  So at that time I had a great interest in chemistry.  I thought I'd get into a medical field.  But biology was not a strong suit with me and I thought, "Where can I use my chemistry, without using as much biology?"  So I thought pharmacy was the way to go.  So I transferred to the University of Kansas in the Pharmacy program.  Actually, it's a program where you need to be accepted.  I was accepted and went into the Pharmacy program at the University of Kansas, and went there for a couple of years.  And the nice thing about KU, is that they make you go out and work in pharmacies, while you're going to school, and it's kind of a crash deal where it says, "Are you sure you want to do this for the rest of your life?"  And while I was working there, I would talk to different pharmacists and they would say, "You know, if I had this to do over again, I may choose a slightly different career."  And it didn't take too long to figure out why.  I think pharmacy is a terrific career to get into, the nicest thing about it is there is zero unemployment.  If you want a job, you've got one as a pharmacist.  Which is a big plus.  The bottom side is, is that any more pharmacies is kind of turning into "take it from a big bottle, put it into a small bottle," and then give it to
somebody who is sick.<p>

<b>Home Page: </b>What was you first interest in pharmacy?  Why did it appeal to you to go into pharmacy?<br>
<b>Gary: </b>Chemistry.  I thought well, chemistry is neat, and I like to compound.  And I liked working with chemistry and building molecular models.  I thought this is really neat.<p>

<b>Home Page: </b>You didn't put the people element into it at that
time?<br>
<b>Gary: </b>No, not at all.  And also, the model building element is taken out of it.  That's all done at a pharmaceutical laboratory.  It's done, it's mass produced.  And essentially by
the time it gets to you, it's a finished product.  And again, you take 50 of them out of a bottle of 5000, and put it into a small bottle, and put a label on it and give it to somebody. There is a little bit more to it than that.  For example you have to know which drugs will be contraindicated with another one.  But you know, that's all gone to computers. So you can just put in the medications that the patient is on, the medication that they are prescribing, and run it through a
computer and within seconds, even that decision is made for you.<p>

<b>Home Page: </b>So, somehow this realization happened as you were on the job working.  How did you get from there to your interest in weather?<br>
<b>Gary: </b>Well, actually it had to go another step.  I decided well I don't want to do this.  You know when you're in college,  a lot of things can kind of influence you , and change you, which is one of the neatest things about college.  So I thought, "Well what is it that I want to do?"  And by that time I said, "You know it doesn't matter if I go into a career where I make a lot of money anymore.  I just want to be happy.  I want to be excited about waking up in the morning, and doing something that I like.  So then I had to figure out what excites me.  What's really neat besides chemistry?  And I thought, well, I did kind of like biology, and in a way I  liked the outdoors, so I thought, I'll be a game warden.  That would be perfect.  So I applied for a warden position with the state of Kansas.  I sent the letter out to Pratte, Kansas.  They told me that I needed to take a test--a civil servant test. And I thought, well, o.k., I've taken enough of those in school.  So while I was waiting for that to take place, I took a job at the Alumni Center at the University of Kansas, which is really a great way to go back to
school again because I had left.  I had left school.  I walked away from pharmacy. While I was carrying one of my several very heavy, heavy books, one was a Remington's Pharmaceutical Sciences, and the other was Goodman and Gilman, I believe there was another one that made it weigh about 15 pounds.  So I was on my way to class one day, I just turned around halfway and went back home and said, "That's it, I'm not going to do this anymore."<p>
Anyway, while I was waiting to hear from the state of Kansas again,  I received a little application form, and on it it told you the salaries that different levels of game wardens
make.  And I saw the one that had no college degree was barely enough to survive on.  I thought,  "Well, if I just had a degree, it doesn't matter what it's in, I could be bumped up to
the next level or next level, and then I could get by.  At least I could eat.  So I decided to go back to school, and I thought well meteorology is interesting.  So I'll get a degree in
meteorology.  Something that I've always been interested in, but it never dawned on me to study it at the time.<p> 

<b>Home Page: </b>So once you realized that you wanted a college
degree, you went back and looked at the different subjects that
fit in with your interests and found meteorology.<br>
<b>Gary: </b>Sure, and I had enough science background to where if I
had this much science already, I could quickly get out, so I
could get into an occupation that I really like.  And it's
really a strange set of circumstances that got me from wanting
to work for the state of Kansas into meteorology, and eventually
on television.  Because television was absolutely the last thing
that I ever thought that I'd be doing.<p>

<b>Home Page: </b>So what were those strange circumstances?<br>
<b>Gary: </b>Again, this has to do with the Alumni Center where I was
working.  Every Friday night a group of theater departments
heads would get together and they would sit down at the end of
this long hallway, and a group of about 10 or 12 would gather
and have Friday afternoon drinks before they left for the
weekend.  I was their server.  I was the bartender.<p>

None of the other waitpeople really wanted to serve them
because they were a little bit demanding.  And I thought, "Well,
this is kind of neat."  It didn't bother me at all.  So I'd work
with them.  I'd go out and I'd serve them every day.  I got to
know them after a course of about eight or 10 months.  One of
them knew the News Director at the little cable station in
Lawrence, cable channel 6.  And they said, "Hey, you're in
meteorology, you ever thought about doing weather on
television?"  And I said, "Well, not really."  They said,
"There's a weather guy that needs to take a couple of days off
every now and then throughout the semester to study for tests. 
Would you just be willing to fill in for a couple of days?" 
Well, I can do that.  I was in college, I needed money, and I
said sure, it wouldn't be too bad.<p>

So I began to do that and come to find out it was I'd need
to take every Tuesday and Thursday night off.  So I was doing it
twice a week, which was even a little bit better.  After about
three or four weeks, he decided it was too much pressure, so he
quit.  Now, all of a sudden, I'm the main weather guy at this
little cable station.  I went from doing that to thinking, "Hey,
this wouldn't be a bad career, it could take me a little bit
further.  And that's simply how all that began.<p>

<b>Home Page: </b>So where did your career take you after college?<br>
<b>Gary: </b>Actually, while I was still in college, I was doing the
weeknight weather at six o'clock and 10 o'clock  at  the little
cable station in Lawrence.<p>

<img src="moustach.jpg" border=0 align=left>
And then I would do weekend weather for the NBC affiliate in Topeka.
So I was working seven days a
week doing this, and bartending at the same time, for about a
semester, or a  little more than a semester.  I was putting in
about 60 hours worth of work, and then carrying about 15 or 16
credit hours in college.  That was really a tough semester.<p>

<b>Home Page: </b>Did you go to the Topeka station after college as
your full-time job?<br>
<b>Gary: </b>Actually it was almost the same time that I ended up
graduating.  And I don't know, maybe it's just me, but I was
thinking, "I've got to sever my ties with Lawrence, Kansas in
order to feel like I'm out of college.  So as soon as the
semester was coming to a close, I started applying for different
jobs around the country.  One came up for a morning position for
the CBS affiliate in Amarillo, Texas.  And I thought, "That's
where I'll go."  That was my first real full-time job after
college was doing mornings in Amarillo.<p>

<b>Home Page: </b>Give us a brief overview of where you went from
Amarillo.<br>
<b>Gary: </b>That's very easy.  I was in Amarillo, Texas for about 11
1/2 months.  Nothing was really happening there, and I decided
to move on.  I wanted to get a little bit closer to the center
part of the midwest.  It was actually a dream of coming back to
Kansas City again.<p>
I was checking around and there was a job open for a noon
and a five o'clock position in Des Moines, Iowa for the NBC
affiliate there.  I thought, "Well, I'll give that a crack." 
And I ended up getting that job, which was great.  I didn't have
to wake up at 3:30 in the morning anymore I could come to work
at a normal time.  After about six months I was promoted from
the noon and five o'clock meteorologist to the chief position at
six and 10.<p>

<b>Home Page: </b>What are some of the stranger things that have
happened to you since this is live television.  I know that
sometimes you go out in the field on live remotes.  Has anything
unexpected happened when you've been on the air?<br>
<b>Gary: </b>Actually, unexpected things happen almost every single
night.  It's not really that bad.  There are minor little
things, and that's what differentiates a meteorologist or
weather caster with little experience with someone who does have
experience.  You can take the little things that happen and
smooth them over and make it look like nothing has happened, and
everything is going just as planned.<p>

There was one experience, this was while I was in Des
Moines, and we were getting ready to do an hour-long special
that happened right immediately following the newscast.  We had
a bout of nasty weather that lasted about a week.  It started
out with this tremendous ice storm that knocked out power to 20
or 25,000 home in the city.  Within a week, we had a rash of
tornadoes that broke out across the state.  So we really had a
nasty week.  We decided to combine the two storms and do this
hour-long news special on it.  How we ended up doing this, we
had a live pitch and this hour-long special, by the way, was a
live presentation with news anchors and myself and different
reporters that were pitching to their stories that they had run
throughout that week.
<p>
Coming right out of the
newscast, there was this big camera change.  They had to wheel
this camera, It seemed like it was 20 or 25 feet from the main
news set, over to my little weather area.  There was a small
young lady who was a camera operator who couldn't have weighed
any more than about 80 or 90 pounds, really a tiny gal.  And she
was moving this camera across the room and it hit some sort of a
bump in the carpet and it started to tip over.  I was behind my
wall, so I couldn't jump out to try to save the camera.  I knew
it was going to go down.  The anchors were on the set and they
were speaking, and it fell over with this tremendous crash. 
<p>
I'll never forget it because the sports guy happened to
be walking by at that time.  I really felt sorry for the camera
operator.  She was just panicking.  It's something else when you
knock a big camera like that over.  The whole thing, by the way,
was live.  You could hear the crash on the air and everything. 
Of course, the news anchors didn't want to break and let
everyone know what was happening.  They just tried to keep going
with what they were doing.<p>

<b>Gary: </b>(continued): Well, at the same time the directors were
trying to get the shot to pitch it over to the weather area so
we could kick off this hour-long special.  The one thing that
shocked me was the sports guy was walking right by, looks at the
camera fall over, and then he just continues to walk out the
door and leaves.  And this poor camera operator was looking up
and it looked like she was just ready to burst out in tears. And
I'm thinking, "Oh, Rick, how could you just walk away and leave
her hanging like that?"<p>

So, I just jump over the wall, help her pick the camera up
again, the teleprompter, which is how we can see ourselves, and
how we can see the words in the screen to read.  That was all
knocked off its normal position on the camera, so I helped her
pick the camera back up again.  She was shaking like a flea. 
She ended up getting the shot that she was supposed to get and
got it in time.  But I tell you what, we were putting mikes on
and scrambling all over the place.  That was kind of interesting.<p>

<b>Home Page: </b>You brought up something that maybe viewers don't
know about, about when you look in the camera.  You just brought
up the teleprompter.<br>

<img src="tracy.jpg" border=0 align=left>
What is it that you see?  When you look in
the camera, you're not just seeing a camera lens?  What is it
that you're seeing when you look into the studio camera?<br>

<b>Gary: </b>Well, I guess the best way to explain this, there's a
television set that sits upside down, so in other words this
screen is facing straight up, and that's directly underneath the
camera lens.  There's a piece of angled glass that angles from
just underneath the camera lens to about six or eight inches
ahead of the camera lens going from beneath the camera lens,
right under it, to over the lens and about eight inches out.  If
you can just kind of visualize that angle.<p>

What happens is you darken the area behind the glass
where the camera lens is.  It's like you looking out the window
in the daytime.  If you're inside your house looking out, and
the room inside your house is dark, you can see the daylight
outside just fine.  It's just the opposite at night.  If you
have the lights on in your house, you really can't see through
that glass very well, but the other side can into your house
very well.<p>

<b>Home Page: </b>So they're not able to give you an image of yourself
on screen?<br>
<b>Gary: </b>Right.  What the camera lens is doing, it sits back in
that dark little space looking through that angled glass, so it
can see everything just fine like there's nothing there.  Well
on the other side of it, if you bounce that lighted image from
that television screen, off that glass, it looks just like the
television screen itself as its looking right at you.  And you
can either run words through it, or you can run program or air
through that so you can see an actual television picture.<p>

<b>Home Page: </b>So if there is a script you need to read, you can
read your script off the teleprompter through the camera.<br>
<b>Gary: </b>Exactly.  And then when it comes time for the weather
guy, he doesn't get to be scripted, he gets to make it up as he
goes along.<p>

<b>Home Page: </b>That's you, you're ad-libbing.<br>
<b>Gary: </b>Right, and I can see myself and I can see my weather maps
behind me.<p>

<b>Home Page: </b>Let's talk about those weather maps behind you.  Is
there actually a weather map behind you.  We see the pictures
changing , we've heard about the word "chromakey".<p>

<img src="ckey.jpg" border=0 align=right>

Can you talk about what it is that you're doing up there?  How you're able to
point to things on the map if there's no map really there?<br>
<b>Gary: </b>The camera ignores the color green.  We've got a big
green wall right behind our weather casters.  So the camera
looks at us, because we're not green, the camera can see us, but
it does what the engineers call "zeroes out" the color green. 
So it ignores the color green.  The camera says "When I see
green, there's nothing there."  Well, all you have to do then is
just superimpose another image over the top of what the camera
sees and you have the weather caster standing in front of
computer graphics, a citycam picture, the neighborhood weather
network site, or anything that you want.  That's how that works.
 How we can tell where we are, we have television sets on both
sides of us, on our right side and on our left side. And the
teleprompter that we talked about before turns into a television
set itself, so we can see ourselves, and see our maps in three
directions.  The only direction we can't see is directly behind
us.<p>

<b>Home Page: </b>So that must take some getting used to.  Did you
find yourself in the beginning pointing to the wrong place?<br>
<b>Gary: </b>Really, it's not nearly as difficult as it might sound. 
I make things sound a little more complicated than they are. 
But it you stand out in front of that map you can acquaint
yourself to your surroundings probably within two or three
minutes.<p>

<b>Home Page: </b>We didn't talk about how you got from Des Moines to
Kansas City.  Was that a straight career shot for you?<br>
<b>Gary: </b>Yes, I was actually keeping up with how everything was
evolving in Kansas City, and there was a little bit of a shake
up.  It seemed to have started when Dan Henry left the market. 
That left an opening.  There was some shuffling around going on
within the city itself, and I was keeping tabs on what was going
on here.  Thankfully, things just fell in place to where I
happened to be that extra guy after a few other things had
happened in between.  There was an opening.<p>

One of the really nice things is that Channel
5 here in Kansas City is owned by the Meredith Corporation. 
They are based out of Des Moines.  In fact, they are right
across the street from the station  where I was working at in
Des Moines.  So I had a few people who could watch me on the
air.  So I think I had a leg up on most other people.<p>

<b>Home Page: </b>That worked out well.<br>
<b>Gary: </b>Oh, It sure did.  It couldn't have worked out better. 
Actually, if there was one station in Kansas City that I've
always wanted to work at, it was Channel 5.<p>

<b>Home Page: </b>And why is that?<br>
<b>Gary: </b>I knew enough about Kansas City while I was going to
school at KU, and I thought if I wanted to work in one place, it
would be Channel 5.  At the time they were the dominant, number
one station in the market.  We still have so many things going
for us that the other stations don't.  For one, we're set out in
this nice suburban setting.  We don't have to battle traffic to
get to work.  The people here seem to be so much more relaxed. 
And I tell you what, news environments can just be absolutely
hectic, at times it can be a very rough environment to work in. 
Channel 5 has always had a reputation of being a very easy, easy
place to work.  One reason why could also be that Meredith is a
very strong corporation.  They have great values.  They treat
their employees great.  That was one place that everyone who
lived in Des Moines wanted to get on with Meredith somehow
because it was a good solid company to work for.<p>

<b>Home Page: </b>Well, we've talked about the atmosphere when we
watch you on the air with <a href="http://www.kctv.com/anchors/tracy.htm">Tracy</a> and <a href="http://www.kctv.com/anchors/wendall.htm">Wendall</a> and <a href="http://www.kctv.com/anchors/william.htm">William</a>.  It
looks like you all really get along.  How do you like working
together?<br>
<b>Gary: </b>I think it's a great mix.  It's about the nicest mix that
I've worked with.  Everyone gets along just fine.  Obviously, I
think Wendall is great.<p>
<img src="wg.jpg" border=0 align=left>

 I've spent from the ninth grade up to the end of my college watching him.
 I thought the last thing
I'd ever do is sit next to him during a newscast, but I am, and
I'm really thrilled about that. Although Tracy is not a
newcomer, she is almost a newcomer to the prime time hours. 
William obviously came in just a short while after I did.  It's
like the three of us are the new kids on the block , and then we
have Wendall, this strong powerful source.  He is our pillar so
to speak, he gets us through our day.<p>

<b>Home Page: </b>So what about the behind the scenes relationships
that we don't see during the commercial breaks.  Is it a
laughing atmosphere?  Or serious?  What's it like that people
don't see.<br>
<b>Gary: </b>I think it's just a very comfortable and very relaxed
atmosphere.  We just sit around and talk just about anything. 
We don't have to put any pretenses or any airs on.  We're very
comfortable with each other.<p>

<b>Home Page: </b>What do you like to do when you're not at work?<br>
<b>Gary: </b>I like to do things outdoors.<p>

<img src="fishing.jpg" border=0 align=left>Kind of gets back to what
we were talking about before.  I like to do all sorts of outdoor
things.  But I'm also a big KU football fan.  It's been tough
for a lot of years, but I have season tickets to the KU football
games.  When I lived in Des Moines, I had season tickets to the
KU football games as well.  It would give me an excuse to come
back down to this area at least five or six times.<p>

<b>Home Page: </b>You were willing to travel for your team.<br>
<b>Gary: </b>Oh sure, it took about four hours from my front door in
Des Moines to get to the stadium in Lawrence.  It was really
nice, we really enjoyed that.<p>

<b>Home Page: </b>Let's talk a little bit about when you're not at
work, and you've got a family.  What kind of things do you do
with the family.<br>
<b>Gary: </b>I spend a lot of time with my son.  He's four years old
right now.  I have him every single morning.  He wakes me up by
no later than 7 :00 or 7:30.  He jumps up on top of me, and
says, "Wake up, Dad, it's time to start playing!"  So we play
just about all morning long.  I think that's a lot of fun.  I
did the same thing with my daughter before she was in school. 
Now she's in third grade and doing wonderfully in school.  She's
just a terrific student.  So my time with her is either during
the evenings during my dinner break, if I'm allowed to take one,
if the weather allows me to go home for a dinner break.  We play
during that time, and we also spend our weekends together.  We
like to go boating in the summer time.  We'll take the tube out,
we'll put it on the lake, and the kids will go ride on the 
tube.<p>

<img src="garykids.jpg" border=0 align=right>

We'll go swimming in the middle of the lake, jump off the
boat, and do that type of thing.  We just have a lot of fun
playing like that.<p>

<b>Home Page: </b>As a Channel 5 weather man, people, when you run
into them in the street, they must hold you personally
responsible for the weather.  How do you feel about that?<br>

<b>Gary: </b>Sometimes they do.  I think the vast majority of people
realize that you're just a messenger, and you're the guy giving
the bad news or the good news, as sometimes it turns out. 
Although I tell you one time in Des Moines, when we had a rash
of heavy rains in 1993, of course Kansas City had just about the
same thing, terrific rains that lasted for about a month and a
half.  It seemed like every day, if it wasn't raining, there
were forecasts for heavy rains coming within the next few hours.
 At that time, somebody had called up and said, "Gary, I think
that you are the worst weatherman ever."  I thought "I wish you
didn't say that."  They said, "You know you never get the
weather right."  Well, I did some checking, and I was doing some
of my most accurate work throughout that period.  It was just
weather that people didn't want to see, they didn't want to see
the continual rains.<p>

<b>Home Page: </b>When you hear about snow coming, do you try to
temper that so as not to get people fearful of too much snow?<br>

<b>Gary: </b>That 's been used by a lot of people when snow comes, to
really hype it up big and make it look like the sky is falling. 
It's one way for your name to get out.  People will say, "Hey,
did you hear so and so last night talk about the big blizzard
that's coming?"  But I don't think that works because when you
talk about the big snows that come in, if you know they aren't
going to come in with that much force,  you lose credibility
after several snowstorms.  Well this guy is a big Chicken Little
who says the sky is falling and then it never does.  What we try
to do is we try to be as accurate as we possibly can.  Our
problem with snow is, it is so difficult to forecast snow.  So
many different elements have to come together to make a
snowstorm into a snowstorm.  It's not so hard to get flurries,
it's not so hard to get even an inch of snow, but to get more
than that, it takes quite a bit.  And there's a very fine line
between getting an inch of snow and about eight inches of snow. 
And it's what makes meteorologists sweat more than anything.<p>

<b>Home Page: </b>Maybe we should briefly mention what it takes to be
a meteorologist.  Don't you have to do some special tests to go
from just studying weather to becoming a meteorologist?<br>
<b>Gary: </b>To be recognized as a meteorologist by the AMS (American
Meteorological Society), which is a group of my peers,  you need
at least a Bachelor of Arts at the very minimum.  And at least 
20 hours of meteorology within that group.  Nine of which has to
be in an advanced type of a meteorology, either synoptic
meteorology, physical meteorology, or dynamic meteorology.  So
you need nine hours at least in that.  Again, it takes a
four-year degree.  To get your AMS seal, it requires your
consecutive weathercasts to be judged by some of the top peers
within the society.  If they deem you acceptable in to the
program, then you are brought into the fold, and you are an AMS
certified meteorologist.<p>

<b>Home Page: </b>When did that happen for you?<br>
<b>Gary: </b>It happened while I was in Amarillo, Texas.  I didn't
receive it until I moved to Des Moines, Iowa.  The process takes
just about a year from start to finish.<p>

<b>Home Page: </b>Do you own a computer?<br>
<b>Gary: </b>At work, I have about 15! At home I have one as well, but
I can't get on the Internet to see this. Guess I'll have to now!<br>

<center><font size=+2><b><i>We talk to "News 5 This Morning" anchors</i></b><br>
<b>Valissa Smith and Brian Curtis</b></font></center>
<hr size=1 noshade><br>

<!--Interview-->
Valissa Smith and Brian Curtis spend 90 minutes a day on the air anchoring "News 5 This Morning" from 5:30AM until 7AM, Monday through Friday on KCTV. With that kind of on-air
exposure, working live in the "wee hours," they've gotten very good at anchoring a lengthy television program. The show not only brings the early-morning Kansas City newscast viewer all
the news and weather, it provides viewers with the refreshing personalities of the talent on the show. Valissa and Brian, along with Producer Jeff Field, and weather persons Katie Horner
and Chris Snyder, put on a show specifically designed to start off your day right.<p>

The KCTV Home Page Interview was held at 10:30AM in the office of Pete Barrett, Director of Marketing and Production for KCTV (who also did the interview). Valissa and Brian were wide awake
near the end of their work day.
<p>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<p>
<b>Home Page</b>: Here's the question everyone must ask you: What's it like to get up early enough to do a live, hour and a half newscast at 5:30AM?<br>
<b>Valissa</b>: You know what, I think the number one question that I'm usually asked is, "What time do you wake up in the morning?" and the second question is, "What time do you go to bed?"<p>

<b>Home Page</b>: Well, what's the answer to the first question?<br>
<b>Brian </b>: Well, my alarm goes off at three.<br>
<b>Valissa</b>: My alarm goes off at three too, so what time do you go to bed, Brian?<br>
<b>Brian</b>: I try to be in bed by 6:30PM, and I try to be asleep by 7PM. I have to have my eight hours, which may be easier for me because I don't have any children.<p>

<b>Home Page</b>:  How about you, Valissa?<br>
<b>Valissa</b>: Well, at 6:30 when Brian's crawling in, it's bath time at our house....<br>
<b>All</b>: (Laughter)<br>
<b>Valissa</b>: At 7, its snack time and at 7:30 it's bedtime and storytime, soooo, I'm lucky to get to bed by eight. So that's why on the Morning show sometimes Brian is much more with the
program than I am. I'm simply not getting as much sleep as he, Mr. Single Guy, is.<br>

<IMG align="left" vspace=5 hspace=5 src="int4.jpg">

<b>All</b>: Laughter<br>
<b>Valissa</b>: I really kind of cheat myself out of  it during the week, so I kind of "cram" on the weekend. I try and sleep in, say until maybe 5:30 or 6 in the morning.<br>
<b>Brian </b>: (Laughs) But I think everybody thinks that it's a really painful schedule and the truth of the matter is, for me anyway, being single and not having kids to worry about, I love my
schedule.<p>
Because when everybody else is coming in the door, my day is half over. I also find that going to bed early at night I don't miss all that much.<br>
<b>Valissa</b>: I agree with that.<br>
<b>Brian</b>: I really don't (miss that much). I've adjusted well to the schedule.<p>


<b>Home Page</b>: Do you have the afternoons available?<br>
<b>Brian</b>:  The whole afternoon to take care of business...go out and golf and whatever, so I really enjoy it.<br>
<b>Valissa</b>: I like it too, and I like it because I get to see them (the children). In some ways, it would be very difficult to work (a regular daytime schedule). I admire the moms who can work all day and then run home and you feed them and flop them in the tub and jump them in bed. My schedule gives us more time to be together and do fun things, and I like that. I really do, I like
being able to see the family right after school. I remember when I was a kid,  I wanted my mom was right after school, to talk about things, and I am able to do that with my kids. I like it, too.  You know, people say, (Valissa puts on a funny voice) "You must be a morning person"<p>

<IMG align="right" vspace=5 hspace=5 src="int2.jpg"><p>
<b>Brian</b>: (laughs)<br>
<b>Valissa</b>: (High pitched voice) "Well, no, I don't know that I am".<br>
<b>Brian</b>: I'm not. I know I'm not a morning person. When I took this job, and my family knew what my schedule was, my parents were saying, "How on earth are you going to do that," and  I think I've surprised them and surprised myself, actually, on how well I've done.<br>


<b>Home Page</b>: Earlier, you said "...when you took this job". Where were you before this?<br>
<b>Brian</b>: In Birmingham, Alabama, working as a reporter and an anchor....<p>

<b>Home Page</b>: ...and what shift were you working?<br>
<b>Brian</b>: (Laughing)   I was working all different kinds of shifts, and it wasn't a regular kind of schedule at all, maybe that's another reason why I enjoy this. Because it is more regular, I know that even though I have to be up at three in the morning, I know that at least I have a regular schedule, everyday. It's not 3:00 one day and 8:00 another day and 1:00 in the afternoon the day after that.<p>


<b>Home Page</b>: Speaking of careers and the professional realities of someone who works on the air in the television business, one thing that people might find hard to comprehend is that this isn't the type of business where many people start at one job or station and end at the same job or station.<br>
<b>Valissa</b>: Right.<p>

<b>Home Page</b>: Just thinking about what I know about you, Brian, and what I know about Valissa, you've both been in a number of different locations....<br>
<b>Valissa</b>: We've been around....(Laughs)<br>
<b>Home Page</b>: Well, I guess you could say that.(General laughter). But, Brian, if you could touch on some of  those places you may have stopped at along the way....<br>
<b>Brian</b>: I've been in the business for about 6 years now. I started in Columbia, Missouri and my first job was working as a full time anchor, which I think was unusual, you know starting
in the business doing that, but I did.  And I worked there for 2 years and then I packed up my belongings and dragged them off to Battle Creek, Michigan, where I worked full time as a
reporter.<p>

<b>Home Page</b>: Did you work with Barbra Porter ("News 5 This Weekend" co-anchor) there?<br>
<b>Brian</b>: I did. That was where I met Barbra Porter and we became close friends there. I was in Battle Creek for only about 6 months and then I went to Grand Rapids Michigan, about an hour
and half down the road, and worked at Grand Rapids about a year. Then I went to Birmingham, Alabama. I was there for a year and a half (at WBRC-TV) and then I came to Kansas City. So how many stops is that? One, two, three, four stops before I got to KC, all in all about 6 years. That is not at all unusual, especially in earlier stages in your career.<p>

<b>Home Page</b>: And what about you, Val?<br>
<b>Valissa</b>: I was from this area, and went to school at William Jewell in Liberty. This (the Kansas City area) is really kind of home for me, but my first TV job was at KQTV in  St. Joseph. In fact, when people ask me where I got my Masters (in Television), I say "KQTV," because that is really where I learned the business. I started out as the weather anchor, and
then within a year was in the news department. That's what I wanted to do all along, but weather was the only opening they had. Sometimes I can't believe I talked them into letting me do that (anchor the weather).

<IMG align="left"hspace=20 src="int3.jpg">
<p>
<b>Home Page</b>: So, you felt that you should take whatever was open?<br>
<b>Valissa</b>: At that stage in your life, when you have no experience, which was my case,  that is exactly what you do. So I did that for a year, but I really wanted to do news, so I (laughs) would, between the 6 and 10 news, drag the camera around and go do news stories just to show that I could do it. Anyways, I stayed for 4 years. I started out as weather anchor, did reporting, then went to the anchor desk, and eventually  became the news director (at KQTV) before I left. Then I went to Syracuse, New York for a couple of years. I did reporting and anchoring on the weekends.<p>

<b>Home Page</b>: Were you married at that time?<br>
<b>Valissa</b>: No.<p>

<b>Home Page</b>: While you were single, do you find it easier to uproot for a better professional opportunity?<br>
<b>Valissa</b>: Right, it is. Thankfully, I married a banker, because you see there are banks in EVERY community. It works out really, really well.<br>
(All Laugh)<br>
<b>Valissa</b>: So when I went to New York, we became engaged, he decided that, he was in St. Joe, he decided that....oh yes, it was one of those separation things. From there I went to Knoxville Tenn. in a prime time anchor position, and I was only there about a year and a half.<p>

<b>Home Page</b>: What station?<br>
<b>Valissa</b>: WBIR, Jim Swinehart's station (the new Station Manager at KSHB-TV, the NBC affiliate in Kansas City); in fact, he hired me. Then after a year and a half I got out of  TV and went to work for a management company. That was a blast, it was probably the greatest 2 years of my career, honestly. It was very much like TV because you were digging up the information and 
putting it together, and then you were presenting it. Just like what we do in TV news. It was a growth period for me, and then I had a baby, and I decided to get back into TV.<p>

<b>Home Page</b>: That's not quite how it usually works....(laughter)<br>
<b>Valissa</b>: That's when I found out that KCTV had not filled their opening for a anchor on the 5PM newscast. As you might recall, 6 years ago Lili Shank decided to go part time. So I shot off a tape and here I am. It worked out really well. I am just tickled, I am thrilled to be back here. I have family galore here.<p>

<b>Home Page</b>: Brian, what do you do when you're not anchoring the show or working at channel 5?<br>
<b>Brian</b>: Actually I travel a lot, people always say "... are you in town this weekend?" because I like to travel...<p>

<b>Home Page</b>: Like where, Birmingham?<br>
<b>Brian</b>: (laughs) No, actually I haven't planned that trip yet. I was just home, my parents live in Connecticut.  I go to Dallas a lot; I have friends in Dallas. I did my undergraduate in
Atlanta, so I have a lot of friends still in Atlanta. I go anywhere exciting where I have friends.<p>

<b>Home Page</b>: Brian, when I asked you that question, Valissa made motions like you were lifting weights...do you do weight training as well?<br>
<b>Brian</b>: I do; I spend a lot of time at the gym, working out. I do that because I know I should, more than because I want to --<br>
<b>Valissa</b>: "-- more then he wants too," (laughs) sounds like me. I am so ashamed, I go to occasional aerobics class. That's as much exercise that I get, other than...well, you know, pulling two kids in a wagon up the sidewalk. I do get my heart rate up once in a while, but honestly my time is spent with my kids.<br>
<b>Brian</b>: We talked about moving around a lot, this is the first time I've stood still in what, 6 years? My friends all joke about my living in boxes, because literally, that is what my
life has been about since Columbia, Missouri. Living in cardboard boxes, carting them around.... this is the first time that I've unpacked them. Valissa stopped by my apartment the
other day--<br>
<b>Valissa</b>: I was stunned--.<br>
<b>Brian</b>: ---But did you see why I was proud of my furniture?<br>
<b>Valissa</b>: I was proud of your furniture, Brian.<br>
<b>Brian</b>: I'm just so proud that I have a couch now, and a bed. I only have a couple boxes left, and considering what I had when I first got here....<br>
<b>Valissa</b>: I was amazed, he has a TV Center that he put together himself, but it's really nice. It was really funny, when you first got here you were, like, "I've got a bed, but it's on the floor..." (Laughs).<br>
<b>Brian</b>: It wasn't even a mattress, it was a futon. I had my TV and my fold-up futon, and I would drag it from one job to the next, and set it up.<p>

<b>Home Page</b>: Back to the job at Channel 5. In regards to the morning show, what new and unusual things are you doing?<br>
<b>Valissa</b>: Well, we peg it on our promos as being "...bright and early", and we take that literally.<br>
<b>Brian</b>: We want to give them (the viewers of the 5:30AM newscast) the news they need to start the day. We want people to start their days off on the right foot, and we want to deliver the news in such a way that it's informative, as well as attention-getting.<br>
<b>Valissa</b>: We want it to be fun and informative.<br>
<b>Brian</b>: One of the things that I love about the newscast, and I've anchored other newscasts, is that in primetime the expectations are so much higher. Extremely sober and straightforward is how you are expected to deliver those newscasts, and I think that's the proper way to do them. However, on "News 5 This Morning" we can let our personalities show, as opposed to the primetime casts (reflects for a moment). I like the fact that the people who watch our shows can feel as if they know us; not just our faces, but who we really are. They get to learn about our kids, our trips--<br>
<b>Valissa</b>: --The fact that you don't see movies until they comeout on video--<br>
<b>Brian</b>: ---The fact that I just saw "Forrest Gump" last week is something Valissa finds endlessly amusing, but it's fun to have people come up to me on the street that pick up on that and say stuff like, "...have you seen 'Forrest Gump' yet?" That's what makes it fun for us.<br>
<b>Valissa</b>: I think that, for the first time in my career, I have to remind myself that I am on TV. I am that relaxed, despite the fact that there are thousands of people watching.  I think that this says a lot for the environment, as well as mine and Brian's relationship. We feel comfortable with each other.<br>
<b>Brian</b>: I think that's another question that people always ask me when I'm out and about: "What is Valissa Smith really like?" And if they're not asking about us, then it's another anchor they want to know about. The answer as it relates to the two of us is "what you see is what you get." We like each other and like spending time together.<br>
<b>Pete</b>: I know that people at home suspect that anchors put up a false front when they're on-set, on live TV, delivering the day's news. I also suspect that you can do that for a while, but when you do an hour and a half live, day in and day out, you can not keep a front up.<br>
<b>Valissa</b>:  No, you're right, and I think that it's critical to know that when you have two anchors sitting at the desk you will have a better show if the anchors get along; they must honestly like each other. That professional facade cannot be maintained indefinitely if you just can't stand the person at the other end of the set. Thankfully, it works for us. It is more than me just liking Brian; I have real respect for Brian's journalistic talent. He has brought a lot of things to KCTV and I have learned from him. Remember, this is coming from someone whose been in the business, what, 15 years? It's just real comfortable to be able to turn to him and ask Brian, say, what is the meaning of this word. I've been in other markets (cities with TV stations) where the relationship between two co-anchors just isn't this easy or relaxed. I think that these kind of relationships are found at Channel 5,  period.<p>

<b>Home Page</b>: I think that one of the things that people reading this might be interested in knowing is some of your funniest stories about doing this show, you know things that happen on the air. You know, how do you hold it together when all you want to do is laugh out loud?<br>
(General laughter)<br>
<b>Valissa</b>:  Good thing that on the morning show we don't have to hold it together very much!<br>
<b>Brian</b>: You know, we honestly try not to put up a front, so if anything funny happens or if we are having a bad day, we let the viewers in on it,  unless it's at a really inappropriate time.<br>
<b>Valissa</b>: Right. Most of the time we just let viewers in on it. <p>
<IMG align="left"hspace=20 src="int1.jpg"><p>
<b>Brian</b>: We've been talking on the air for months now. We have a running gag about the fact that I have terrible allergies and one morning I thought that I was going to sneeze on the air, so
I just said, live on set, "....I think I'm going to sneeze!". The whole time I'm thinking to myself, "Brian, this will be the first day that you've sneezed on the air".<br>
<b>Valissa</b>: (Laughing) We got to talking about his allergies and how he couldn't help it; I know people at home understand and can empathize with the fact that, hey, the man's just got to sneeze!<br>
<b>Brian</b>: You know, I managed not to sneeze that day on the air, but I had resigned myself to the fact. It would have been okay, though.<br>
<b>Valissa</b>: We are still waiting for that festive occasion.<br>
<b>Brian</b>: I mean, it's not as if I'm sitting in Wendall Anschutz's chair on the 6 O'clock News and started sneezing my brains out...<br>
<b>All</b>: (laughing)<br>
<b>Valissa</b>: There are a lot of funny moments (Valissa pauses for a moment, searching her memory). All I can think about is today's show, but there are so many times where we are close to losing it...the funniest things are the things that just come up. Like one day I was just innocently getting my lipstick...<br>
<b>Brian</b>: Yea, yea, Chris (Snyder, morning weather person on Mondays and Tuesdays)  is over there doing weather and I'm sitting next to her. She's over here digging, and I mean really digging, in her purse, and I'm kind of curious as to what was
going on over there...<br>
<b>Valissa</b>: No! It was my pocket, my pocket!<br>
<b>Brian</b>:  ...and I'm trying to look at the prompter (the TelePrompTer, which has the scripts displayed on it) and I've got this fierce rummaging going on 2 feet away, you know, and
she's down, practically under the desk, digging for who knows what. Chris is walking back over and I knew we were coming out on a three shot and like RIGHT BEFORE the three shot she goes (Brian purses his lips together, making a puckering expression). I say to Valissa, "...what were you doing over there?!"<br>
<b>Valissa</b>: On the air he says this!!<br>
<b>Brian</b>: (laughs).<br>
<b>Valissa</b>: I said "...looking for my lipstick!" I know you guys might have some difficulty relating to this, but, you know, after an hour and a half of drinking coffee and getting it all over my cup I'm afraid I'm lip-less. (Laughter)<br>
<b>Brian</b>: You know, I had no idea what she was doing, and she said "...looking for my lipstick," I was like "Oh, of course! How foolish of me!"<br>
<b>Valissa</b>: That's the beauty of the show. I had people later in the day at the grocery store say to me: "Valissa, did you find your lipstick?" Those seem to be the moments that the viewers
remember. Anybody can give the viewer the news, but not everybody can give the viewer something fun to remember. <p>

<b>Home Page</b>: Well., I think I've got more than enough. Thank you, guys. The whole time we were doing this Home Page interview I have been thinking, "...who can I sucker into transcribing this puppy?" (Laughter)<p>

<!--Interview-->
<img align=right src="tracy2.jpg"> 	She's the smiling face you see sitting next to Wendall Anschutz on the News 5 newscasts weeknights at 6 and 10PM. Tracy Townsend,  News 5 anchor, talks about life on andoff the tube.<p>

The interview was conducted by Pete Barrett, Director of Marketing at KCTV, on Oct. 23, 1995.<p>

<b> Home Page:</b> Tracy, where are you from?<br>
<b> Tracy:</b>	Cincinnati, Ohio.<p>

<b> Home Page:</b> Did you grow up in Cincinnati?<br>
<b>Tracy:</b> In a little suburb outside of Cincinnaticalled Mount Healthy.<p>

<b> Home Page:</b> Where did you go to school?<br>
<b> Tracy:</b>	Good old Mount Healthy High School. Home ofthe "Fighting Owls."<p>

<b> Home Page:</b> So you're proud to say you're a "Fighting Owl?"<br>
<b> Tracy:</b>	I was when I was a cheerleader.  Now it's kind of one of those things in your life where you lookback and think "it was nice to have done, but ...".<p>

<b> Home Page:</b> Where did you go to college?<br>
<b>Tracy:</b>The Ohio State University in Columbus, Ohio. It's a big football school.<p>

<b> Home Page:</b> Did your interest in football carry through to this day?<br>
<b> Tracy:</b>	 I like football more now than when I was in school.  Back then, I'd go to the football games, watch the band and the cheerleaders and be ready to leave at half-time.<p>

<b>Home Page:</b> How'd you get into the business?<br>
<b>Tracy:</b>I got into the business kind of through the back door. My first job was in the Promotion Department at the ABC affiliate in Cincinnati,
Ohio, WKRC-TV.  From there I wentinto the newsroom as a production assistant and worked my wayup!  I was a reporter in Cincinnati before I came to
Kansas City.<p>

<b> Home Page:</b> So you didn't start off as an anchor orreporter?<br>
<b>Tracy:</b>	No.  No, I was still far behind the scenes.Really far...<p>

<b> Home Page:</b> So far behind the scenes you were milesaway?<br> 
<b>Tracy:</b>	Ah, two miles away.<p>

<b>Home Page:</b> If you weren't on the air, then were you aproducer?<br>
<b>Tracy:</b>	I was a Production Assistant, which meant thatI got to run the TelePrompter, floor direct, run scripts,whatever had to be done that no one else wanted to do. After awhile of doing that, I became a producer for one of the mainanchors, and that's really where I learned to put storiestogether and  hone my reporting skills.   When the Gulf Warstarted I was promoted to a part-time reporter. With war in theGulf going on, the station needed more people.  They offered me a full time job as a reporter.<p> 

<b>Home Page:</b> You worked at WKRC for how many years?<br>
<b> Tracy:</b>	From '88 to '93, in both Promotion and News.<p>

<b>Home Page: </b>When you were hired by Don North (NewsDirector at KCTV) what was your position?<br>
<b>Tracy:</b>I was weekend anchor, and reported 3 days aweek. This was a nice arrangement,  because I got to do twothings I really liked. At that time I had some experience atreporting in the field, but the anchoring part was really new tome. <p>

<b>Home Page:</b> You were working at that time with Brent Hunsaker (who is now at a station in Salt Lake City)....<br>
<b>Tracy:</b>	First Brent Hunsaker, then Russell Kinsaul.<p>

<b> Home Page:</b> One of the questions that most peoplewould like to know is what's it like sitting next to Wendall Anschutz.<br>
<img align=left src="tracy3.jpg">
<b>Tracy:</b>	I think at first I was a little intimidatedbecause I knew of Wendall, how long he's been in the business,and I know that he's very highly respected.  He's really funnyand I think it's obvious that he's smart, but what viewers athome don't know is that he's really, really fun to work with.<p>

<b>Home Page:</b> As you know, Wendall's been at KCTV sincethe late 60's, and is an institution in local television. Sitting next to someone like that, day in and day out...is that a learning experience?<br>
<b>Tracy:</b>	It is, because you can't help but try to dothe very best you can because you don't want somebody of thatstature to look bad.  You want to try to measure up and try tobe as on top of your work as Wendall is.<p>

<b>Home Page: </b>Do you and Wendall work long hours? Areyou here really late at night?<br>
<b>Tracy:</b> Not so much real late at night, but sometimesit's really early in the day. Usually when there's something bighappening, whether it be national or local, you come in early. It has been rare that we've had to stay after 11:00PM unlesswe're working on something special.<p>

<b> Home Page: </b>What do you do when you're not at work?<br>
<b> Tracy:</b>	Watch a lot of TV...all the things I taped the night before that I didn't get to see.<p>

<b> Home Page:</b> What kind of stuff do you tape?<br> 
<b>Tracy:</b>	I really like things that make me laugh.  Ilike things that can help me relax.  I tape my soaps...I like my soaps, and I like my sitcoms.  I also try to get out on the golf course; try to work out a little bit. Mainly, I try to relax.<p>

<b> Home Page:</b> You go to the gym and exercise to relax? <br>
<b>Tracy:</b>	I go to the gym, exercise, meet friends there,or I just get together with other friends.<p>

<img align=right src="tracy4.jpg">

<b> Home Page:</b> Back to the wonderful world of TV for amoment....it seems like you, Wendall, William, and Gary reallylike each other. In fact, when KCTV  comes back to the news setafter a commercial break, it seems like the viewer has justdropped in on the end of a conversation between the four of you.Just what is going on there during the break?<br>
<b> Tracy:</b>	Lots of time we'll go over the next script,see what's ahead in the next block.  But  inevitably we startjoking around and maybe make a commentary on some story that wesaw.  But a lot of times Wendall and William and Gary have akind of "joke of the day."  I have a hard time rememberingjokes, but sometimes their jokes are actually funny. <p>

<b>Home Page:</b> They seem like great people. I've alwaysheard that it's important for an anchor team to like each other,because if you don't the viewer can see through it and feel theanimosity. Is that true?<br>
<b>Tracy:</b> I think people would probably see through itbecause most people, when I meet people who watch Channel 5,say, "...you all just seem likeregular people". I think thatwould be kind of hard for me to hide, if  I was on air withsomebody that I didn't respect or get along with. 
Fortunately,I don't have that problem at KCTV;  I haven't worked withanybody here that I felt that way toward.  Especially not now. It sounds weird,
bit it's almost like having three olderbrothers.  They're hysterical sometimes.  We just act like kidsdown there (in the studio). sometimes.  It's
kind of fun.<p>

<b> Home Page:</b> Do you recall any particular event oroccurence in your career, particularly when you're in a livetelevision
environment, which took you off guard and you have toquickly think of some other direction to go in? Or somethingthat was particularly funny?<br>
<b>Tracy:</b>	I think it was a big boxing match and it wasMike Tyson and, I forget the other guy's name (Peter McNeil) ,but they were doing their usual pre-fight verbal jousting;something like, "Yea, you (reporters) can laugh at me all youlike, but I'd like to see any one of you step in the ring with Mike Tyson. You'd put a big dump in your pants" or something.  Istarted laughing off-air and my mouth was wide open when we cameback live to the set. It was kind of embarrassing.<p>

<b> Home Page:</b> I have it from reliable sources that thatparticular outtake is famous and is making the rounds up in News.<br>
<b> Tracy:</b>	Great (sarcastically). I usually get introuble when somebody says something in sports that isabsolutely hysterical; that's when I usually am caught offguard. William (Jackson) is no help on this; I think hedeliberately stacks his sportscast to have the strange stuff atthe end because he knows I'll be on camera live trying not tolaugh. <p>


<b>Home Page:</b> Speaking of being on-set live.  I thinkpeople reading this might not know...sometimes you see thelittle white wire in the back of people's collars and it goesinto the person's ear; when you turn your head people at homecan see it.  What is that thing?<br>
<b> Tracy:</b>It's called an "IFB".  I do get asked thatquestion all the time, but, for the record, we hear what's onthe air thru it. It also allows the producer, director, andsometimes reporters out in the field (during live shots)to talkto you. We hear them through that thing. If you ever see me jumpon the air, it's because I didn't adjust the volume before I satdown and the first thing "whispered" in my ear blew my eardrumin. It's a wonderful thing.<p>

<b> Home Page:</b> So people are talking or whispering inyour ear all the time?<br>
<b>Tracy:</b>	Not all the time.  That's not my preference. Some anchors do like people talking to them all the time.  Ireally just like them to tell me one thing, quickly, and be done because it's distracting to try to be talking to people at homeand have somebody talking in your ear.  But, it can be realhelpful, too.<p>

<b>Home Page:</b> If there was a breaking news situation where you needed to be told information that you couldn't get any other way, that's pretty much your only option, right?<br>
<b> Tracy:</b>	Right.  So there's critical moments where the IFB is a life-saver, and then there have been instances wherethe producer has gotten in my ear and said, "Your collar's up." So, it's helpful in many ways.<p>

<b> Home Page:</b> They also tell that kind of stuff to Wendall and William, too?  Like, "Make sure your tie is straight?"<br>
<b> Tracy:</b> Yes.<p>

<b> Home Page:</b> Do you have any brothers or sisters?<br>
<b>Tracy:</b>	I have a sister and two brothers.  My sisteris going to have a baby soon.  So, that's a big event in my liferight now...I'm going to be an aunt.  I'm pretty excited aboutthat.<p>

<b> Home Page:</b>  Aunt Tracy?<br>
<b>Tracy:</b>	Yeah.  I can't wait.<p>

<b> Home Page:</b> Are you involved in any communityactivities in Kansas City?<br>
<b> Tracy:</b>	Yes, I'm very active in the local chapter ofthe Kansas City Association of Black Journalists.  That's agroup of African-Americans in print and in broadcast.  One of the big projects that we have, it'sreal fun, is we do a high school journalism workshop. You get towork with many people who are interested in either television ornewspaper journalism.  A lot of times they are not quite surewhat actually goes on, especially in television, and so it's areal good learning experience for them to get a taste of whatit's all about.  That's something that I didn't have theadvantage of when I was in high school.  So, it's really good tohelp somebody along.  It's important to try to give back to thecommunity.  I work with that.<p>      Then I'm active in my alumni chapter of mysorority. We do a lot of work in education; a lot of  the peopleare teachers and principals.  I do some tutoring and help withvarious causes like Sickle Cell Anemia; we do a debutante ballwith a scholarship.  We do a lot of that stuff.<p>

<b> Home Page:</b> You're involved in YouthNet as well.  Whatis that?<br>
<b> Tracy:</b>YouthNet is a collaboration of almost twentyyouth service agencies in Kansas City. In the past, differentagencies involved in reaching out to youths would overlap intheir responsibilities.  The left hand might not know what theright hand is doing.  Through YouthNet everybody works together.It really does a lot in terms of helping kids who are, maybe, sixth grade on through high school by givingthem some focus in their lives and keeping them on track. There's a program called Transitional Support and I've seen howit really helps kids who come from an elementary schoolbackground go to middle school.  It kind of helps them get agrasp on what middle school is all about; there's not going tobe teachers to hold their hand throughout the day and thatthey're going to have to buckle down and get on their schoolwork.  And, peer pressure...you hear so much about that.  Theyhave outreach programs that help kids who might otherwise fallthrough the cracks stay on track.  I think that's a real neatprogram.  The kids are so fun to be around.  A lot of their homelives are unbelievable.<p> I do stories on some of these kids and realizehow fortunate I am and how fortunate I was as a young person. It also demonstrates that people and young people are trying tohelp
themselves, too.<p>

<b> Home Page: </b>Since this interview is for KCTV's HomePage, the next question seems appropriate: what do you know about
computers?<br>
<b> Tracy:</b>	I know how to use the computer in the newsroomand I'm really intrigued by the Internet. I'm eager to get acomputer, but I'm afraid to get one because what if it'soutdated next year? But, now that we (KCTV) have a Home Page, Idefinitely want to get a computer to see
what going on.  I thinkit's fascinating, the things you have access to.  It's almostfrightening.  I guess there'll be a time when you will be ableto electronically subscribe to magazines. You'll just "punch itup."<p>

<b> Home Page:</b> That's already happened.<br>
<b> Tracy:</b> There you go.<p>

<b>
Home Page:</b> What's Gary Amble like?<br>
<b> Tracy:</b>	He's very enthusiastic about what he does.  Heis certainly very knowledgeable about the weather, but what setshim apart is he tells you the weather...like it is.  He's notcaught up in a whole lot of meteorologist mumbo jumbo.  He makesit understandable.  My favorite is the "out the door" forecastbecause that what I want to know about the next day.  I think alot of people like that.<p>


<b>Home Page:</b> He seems like he just genuinely enjoysthat work.<br>
<b> Tracy:</b>	Yes.  I've never seen Gary in a bad mood. He's always smiling...just fun to be around.<p>

<b> Home Page:</b> William Jackson  is a whole other story. I see him as another interesting, energetic character.<br>
<b> Tracy:</b>	I used to call him the "diplomat," becausehe'd come in the newsroom and "HI!," "HI! HOW YA DOIN?!?" toevery single person. I think he has added a lot of energy to thenewsroom.  He always comes in in a really good mood, too. He'skind of funny, kind of funny. Just like Wendall and Gary.However, they all think they're funnier than they really are! Ialso want to know why they're always in such a good mood.<p>


<b>Home Page:</b> Do you ever watch tapes of yourself?  Whenyou see yourself on promotional announcements or on tapes of thenewscasts, do you ever look at that stuff?<br>
<b> Tracy:</b>	Sometimes.  And I think, "...ooh, look at myhair!" or "why'd I say that"?<p>

<b> Home Page:</b> So, it's not a pleasant experience?<br>
<b>Tracy:</b>	No, it's like hearing your voice on a taperecorder.<p>

<b> Home Page:</b> "Who's that whiny person?"<br>
<b>Tracy:</b>	Or, "why'd I wear that?"<p>

<b> Home Page:</b> What's it like to have your face sent outon a magnet to a few hundred thousand people? (In November, KCTV Promotion did a direct mail promotion inviting people to watch News 5. As part of themailing, they got a magnet).<br>
<b> Tracy:</b>That is embarrassing.  I still think that issooo weird.  I was afraid people were going to draw littlemustaches on them!  Like I used to do to magazines at home.<p>

<b> Home Page:</b> Have you seen one with a mustache on ityet?<br>
<b> Tracy:</b>	No!  I hope not! Everyone back home in my family has one on their refrigerator, I do know that.<p>

<b> Home Page:</b> What's your most interesting story aboutsomeone recognizing you in public?<br>
<b> Tracy:</b> There's actually two.  One is really funny. The other one is totally embarrassing.   I was at thegrocery store and I was
doing my grocery shopping.  Had my listin one hand and my big envelope of coupons in the other and thislady comes up to me and says, "You know, I
watch you all thetime.  Hey, do you do your own grocery shopping?  And, look,honey, she's got coupons!  And, I couldn't believe they didn't think
that I used coupons.  I use them religiously.<p> And, the other one is...I was at the store andI was walking through the women's apparel
(underwear) andsomebody says, "There's the lady on the news."  Oh, my,recognized!  And in the ladies underwear section! So, needless to say, I 
didn't buyanything that day.<p>

<b> Home Page:</b> What do you do between one newscast andthe next?<br>
<b> Tracy:</b>	I just get right back to work.  I don't take alunch break.  I read more newspapers,. No, really, I sleep, hangaround, make long distance calls, the usual night shift in thenewsroom thing. Of course, I am kidding.<p>

<b> Home Page:</b> That's just a message for the generalmanager, or perhaps the news director?<br>
<b> Tracy:</b>Right!  Actually, I eat my dinner, runerrands, or sometimes I'll go out on stories for the 10:00o'clock show.  But, it just kind of depends what's going on thatday.<p>

<b> Home Page:</b> Do you get out of here fairly soon afterthe show is over?<br>
<b> Tracy:</b> Sometimes.  Wendall and I call those "get andgo" days and those are typically on Fridays.  It's where we getour stuff, lay it down by the news set and go as soon as we say good night.  Friday, the "get and go" day.  Sometimes I'll goback upstairs and talk with the producer on things that work andthings that didn't work and maybe think of some stories to dothe next day.<p>

<b> Home Page:</b> When the show is over the closing music isplaying, how do you judge for
yourself if what we had just doneas a news organization was a good product.?<br>
<b>Tracy:</b>	Usually I'm already trying to make thatjudgment by the time we get through the first segment of theshow.  I base that on if there are any technical errors, if wehave factual errors in a story, and if we really gave peoplerelevant news information.  It would be better to wait until theshow is over, but I feel this is a high pressure job, and we'reso competitive. We want to win, and we want to know if we wonright away. There are times when I call the producer while we'restill on the air and say, "What does 4 have? What does 9 have?What does 41 have?"  Because you don't want to get beat onanything. EVER.<p>

<b> Home Page: </b>So, when the show is over you get to see asense of accomplishment when you've taken care of those points?<br>
<b> Tracy:</b>	Yes. Sometimes I like to get it done beforethe show is over because when we have a bad show, I sometimes gohome and I think about it. I can't sleep.  So, I like to get itover so
that by the time I go home my mind is clear and I cantry to relax and get to bed before 1:00 AM.<p>

<img align=left src="tracy1.jpg">

<b> Home Page:</b> So people are on the news, concentratingon bringing the viewer at home the very best and latestinformation. Yet I also hear a lot of talk about what newspeoplelook like. There seems to be a lot of fixation on the clothes,the hair style, even nail polish. Apparently, you have to thinkabout more than the news. If appearance is an important part ofthe presentation, does that mean you have your own make uppeople and your own wardrobe consultant and all that kind ofstuff?<br>
<b> Tracy:</b>	No. It would be great if we did.  We need tostart a petition!  No, we do it all ourselves. Everybody that'son-air does it (checks hair, clothing and make-up) shortlybefore going on, but it doesn't take an inordinate amount oftime. It's just one of the things you do in preparing to do yourjob, just like going over your scripts.  I think one's supposedto be presentable, but it's not some big glamourfest in the KCTVmake up room. Far from it, in fact.<p>

<b> Home Page:</b> We have a make up room, right?<br>
<b> Tracy:</b>Well, most of us use the ladies restroom; it'sgot better lighting. Wendall, William, and Gary don't use thislight; in fact, they can't come in the ladies rest room. Justmake sure your hair is combed and you don't have any spinach inyour teeth and you go do the news.<p>

<b> Home Page:</b> What do you read for relaxation?<p>
<b>Tracy:</b>	I love mysteries and Wendall likesnon-fiction.  I'm starting to read non-fiction.  He passes booksalong to me.  There's a group of us that are avid readers andjust trade books.  My preference is mysteries.  It's a great wayto feed my mind.<p>

<b>Home Page:</b> If you were to change one thing about yourphysical appearance, what would it be?<br>
<b> Tracy:</b>	I'd be taller!  I'd add some height.  I'm only 5'2."  I'd love to be 5'8."<p>

<!--Interview-->
<center><font size=+2><b><i>Call for Action's</i> Stan Cramer</b></font></center>
<hr size=1 noshade>
<br>

While TV promos tell viewers to "Wait Until Stan Finds Out", the real Stan Cramer finds out what it's like to be answering the questions rather than asking them. Cramer has become a Kansas City television institution, with his work admired by viewers and competitors alike. This interview was conducted by KCTV Director of Marketing and Production, Pete Barrett, 
in December '95.<p>

<b>Home Page</b>: You've been doing Call For Action a number of years and it seems like you've been doing it forever.  When did you <b>actually</b>
start doing it?<br>
<b>Stan</b>: I started in 1980 when the General Manager (of KCMO-TV) saw an opportunity for the Kansas City market.  No one was really reporting on and solving consumer problems and so he asked me to jump in and give it a shot and make of it whatever I could.  Initially we started with one or two reports a week, basically solving someone's problem first and then reporting on what we did.  And, initially, our reports were simply <b>that</b>. They were just "...here's this person's problem, here's how we solved it, amen."  It had a real narrow focus. We needed to broaden that a bit so over the years we've developed this further to the point today the number one criteria for any story we do is, "What is there in this that people can learn from?"  We try to broaden every story now to include a tip, some information that'll be helpful to the next person; keep them from falling into the same trap.<p>

<b>Home Page</b>: Do you think that that's why the feature has proven to be so popular over the years, because people can relate to it?<br>
<b>Stan</b>: I think so. That's certainly a big part of it. Another part of it is it helps the so-called little guy, the guy who doesn't have any other place to go, no other recourse.  They've done everything they can and they're tired of big business or big government or whomever's slapping them down.   It's a chance for the little guy to win.  That's one of the reason's it's successful.  And, the other of course, is that there's something in there we can learn.  That's a couple of the reasons.<p>

<b>Home Page</b>: You've been doing this since 1980.  I know you've been at the station since,  since 1967 or something like that.  You and Wendall Anschutz have been here longer than anybody.<br>
<img src="/call_for_action/stan.jpg" align=right>
<b>Stan</b>: I used to laugh as a kid (a kid being a person just out of Journalism School and working for a big time station) at people who had been at this station for 25 or 30 years. I used to think, "Gee, they have no ambition.  Must not want to go anywhere."  Now I am one of them and I don't laugh anymore.  KCTV is such a good station.  I've been fortunate because this is my hometown.  I went to school in Omaha at Creighton University and worked a year there for the Meredith Corporation in Omaha (corporate owners of KCTV).  We owned WOW-TV and Radio at the time.  I worked for them part-time while I was still in school.  My news director there was also one of my teachers and he offered me a job full-time when I graduated, so I took it.  Worked both radio and TV at the time, which was a challenge. My dad happened to know the General Manager at the old KCMO-TV (which is now KCTV) and we were able to finagle a transfer.  I'm sure it had nothing to do with my capabilities in those days; it only had to do with my dad knowing the G.M..   I got down here a year after graduation.  But, I've been with Meredith ever since...good company.  They treat you well and about every five or six years something changes in my career with Meredith to make me stay interested and invigorated.  It's got to. I think we'll all get stale if we don't have new challenges.  Call For Action was a new challenge I was given fifteen years ago, at a time when I was getting bored with what I was doing.<p>

<b>Home Page</b>: You say every six years or so you have a new challenge to stay invigorated.  What were the previous challenges that you had at the station?<br>
<b>Stan</b>: When I first came in I reported for both KCMO Radio and KCMO-TV; the Meredith Corporation owned both stations at the time.  I was right out of college and was obviously invigorated and challenged.  I did that for about five, six, seven years.  And about the time I was getting bored with that, an opening occurred at the station for Community Affairs Director and I applied for that. I got the position; that put me in a department head role, in a management position.<p>

<b>Home Page</b>: What does the Community Affairs Director do?<br>
<b>Stan</b>: The Community Affairs Director serves as kind of liaison between the station and the public.  It also serves on the Editorial Board; helping to determine the editorial posture of the station.  It does a lot of administrative assistant-type things for the General Manager: speaking
to the community, working on FCC matters... we're regulated, as you know, by the Federal Communications Commission, and TV stations have to go through license renewal every so many years.  I was responsible for that as well as ascertainment - determining the problems and needs of the
community on a regular basis.  Those kinds of functions.  And I served on a national Community Affairs Association Board of Directors.  Met with those folks and exchanged ideas with them over a period of time.<p>

<b>Home Page</b>: But really none of that was on-the-air work?<br>
<b>Stan</b>: Yes, it was. As part of that, I was responsible for producing 24 documentaries a year.  In today's environment, when you think of 24 documentaries you'd wonder how could anybody produce that many in a year.  They weren't full-fledged film documentaries, or produced in the field.Many of them were talk-type programs where we would bring guests in.  So, I was responsible for producing and airing many of those and then I'd farm a lot of the talent work out to people in the newsroom.<p>

<b>Home Page</b>: What was the show called?<br>
<b>Stan</b>: Each show had its own name.  We had weekly public affairs programs that I hosted, and sometimes others hosted, that I was responsible for. But the documentaries each had their own name.It was during that work that I produced some award-winning documentaries that really got me
into investigative-type reporting or problem solving. Coming to bat for the little guy, so to speak.  That's really where I got my feet wet.And enjoyed it so much that I think it was carving my path to the Call For Action of today.<p>

<b>Home Page</b>: Did any of those documentaries have the impact that some of your Call For Action reports do?<br>
<b>Stan</b>: There was one documentary that I did that exposed a home for mentally disabled children and young adults. This home housed them all the way from almost infancy clear up through their 20's and 30's. We found sexual abuse there. We found negligence. We found horrible living conditions.The executive director had falsified her credentials and she really wasn't the person she claimed to be. We exposed all of that and ended up passing a new state law as a result of it that regulated those homes. There were no regulations at the time.  It was quite an accomplishment for a young Community Affairs Director and I'm proud of that to this day.  It's still helping people.<p>

<b>Home Page</b>: Did that whet your appetite to do it on a regular basis...to "...make a difference for the little guy?"<br>
<b>Stan</b>: Right.  And to get to the truth. The truth is always beyond the surface. Almost always.<p>

<b>Home Page</b>: When you go to investigate a particular situation, I know that you can't take anything at surface value.<br>
<b>Stan</b>: Right. And that's really the difference between investigative reporting and just reporting.  Some people say all reporting should be investigative. Well, in the day-to-day news business you don't have time often to get below the surface. You must take the facts the police give you, or fire department, or the business, or the government agency at face value. You don't have time to find out if their press release was factual or if something was being hidden at  that news conference.  Or what is being covered up by the words that they use. So, investigative reporting allows you to go to that next step - and, gives you the time (to pursue a story). Of course, you also have to have the tools.
<p>
<img src="/call_for_action/markshou.jpg" align="right">
<b>Home Page</b>: The Walter Marks story figures most prominently in recent memory.  How did that even get started?<br>
<b>Stan</b>:  Marks took a sick leave, whatever month it was, December or January.  This was within two weeks, I think, of his returning to Kansas City from a trip to Russia and another trip to Chicago on district business. We couldn't understand why it was that, if he was so sick that he
required 6-8 weeks medical leave, how could he have just taken these trips for the district to 
exotic places out of the country?  How could that be possible?  Why would he do that?  Also, his sick leave was announced in very vague terms.  He was taking a sick leave for "a chronic back problem". All of a  sudden.  There had been no indication that he was sick, at least publicly.  It cuased a lot of questions.  Is he really sick?  What is his sickness? First, we looked at the travel records.  We wanted to know how much did he travel, when did he travel, when did he take those trips, how much did they cost?  And we added all those things up and they were pretty astonishing numbers. In addition to the travel records, we looked at the credit card reports.  We saw that he was using a district credit card, which is a matter of
public record.  He was using this extensively for personal expenses and the district was not being reimbursed in a timely fashion for that money.  No one seemed to know where he was.  This was a mystery, too.  Everyone said he's somewhere in Florida.  No one seemed to know exactly where. 
Everything was kept very secret.  So, we decided if we can find where he is, why don't we go see <b>how</b> he is.  It took us only a couple of hours, really, to find where he was.  Then we had to do a lot of logistics to figure out how to follow him and not be discovered.<p>

<b>Home Page</b>: Some of the more striking video that I've ever seen on this station was you walking up to him when he was carrying all that lumber, sore back and all.<br>
<img align=right src="/call_for_action/markswoo.jpg">
<b>Stan</b>: You know, we almost didn't confront him there.  Everyone remembers the lumber and him carrying this lumber.  He was down there (in Florida), at least in part, supervising the construction of his new home.  At the time we already had video of him walking, with no apparent back problems, to the plane in Florida. He gets off the plane in Kansas City, hobbling with a cane.<img align=left src="/call_for_action/markscan.jpg"> So, in fairness to him, we decided to go to Florida again and give him a chance to explain what's going on. We had tried to confront him at an office where he was carrying what looked like a heavy piece of marble and unloading the boxes.  Well, we saw him unloading all these boxes and moving all this furniture and doing all this stuff in the office with his wife and we decided "enough".  That's all we need.  Let's go confront him.  So, we're parked in a parking lot, probably 50...75 yards away and we get out of the van and we get on the other side of the van where we can't be seen. I'm getting my microphone on, buttoning and fixing my tie, doing all the things you're supposed to do to look pretty. I start walking with the cameraman across this open field, clear over to him.  And we're about a fourth of the way across this open field when he comes walking out with his wife.  They're finished.  They're closing up the office.  They're going to leave.  So we're standing out in the middle of this no-man's land saying "Uh-oh, what do we do?  If he looks over here, we're dead."  We turned immediately and went back to the van; fortunately, we were not seen. We got back in the van and followed him; that's when Marks went to the house and picked up the lumber. We hopped out right behind him and were able to confront him right there.<p>

<b>Home Page</b>: Good fortune smiled on you.<br>
<b>Stan</b>: Well, it did. You make your luck is the way I look at it.  That was luck.  We 	were in the right place in the right time.<p>


<em>[Clip from the Walter Marks interview in <a href="/call_for_action/marks.ram">RealAudio</a> or in <a href="/call_for_action/marks.wav">WAV</a> format]</em><p>

<b>Home Page</b>: Another image that may stick in Kansas City news viewers' minds from the recent past is the time you were doing a Call For Action story on a video repair store. The next thing you know, you've been jumped, the camera hits the ground, and you and the crew get assaulted!<br>
<b>Stan</b>: A lot of people ask me "Well, isn't that dangerous what you're doing out there?  Aren't you scared?"  Those are legitimate questions. Yes, we are.  We try to always be conscious of the surroundings we're in and the people we're dealing with.  We always have a producer with us and a cameraman.  Of course, the camera provides some security or at least a feeling of security.  But in this case that wasn't enough. We were set up. We had actually called ahead and told them we 
were coming, as we do most of the time. We let businesses know that we want to do an interview with them.  So, we're on our way over there and we arrive.  We go into the store and a couple of guys are sitting in the back office.  This is a video, VCR repair shop.  A couple of guys in the back office stick their heads around the corner and say "Yeah, just a minute."  We told them who we were.<p>

<b>Home Page</b>: Pretty calm?<br>
<b>Stan</b>: Everything's real calm. They say "I'm on the phone.  Just be a minute."  Well, then we 	hear him whispering on the phone to someone saying "He's here now.  He's here right now.  You'd better get over here right now." We're thinking "That's great. They're calling the owner.  They're probably next door because they own the bar next door." A few minutes go by
and nothing happens.
<img align=right src="/call_for_action/stanlady.jpg">
I yell again "Hey, you know, we're still here."  Again, they say, "We'll be right with
you."  Then I hear 	them whispering on the phone.  They're calling the police.  They're saying something like "He won't leave."  Now, they invited us to stay, encouraged us to stay and now they're calling the police. Now we know something is amiss. About that moment, the owner walks in and gives us an interview in the lobby there.  While we're doing this interview, a guy jumps the counter from that back room and lands on the back of the cameraman and hammers his way past him and chases me out in the parking lot, diving at me as he goes.  Right flat, face down on the asphalt, two or three times he misses as he grabs for my ankles.  I'm yelling for someone to call the police. Back in the store the owner is grabbing the camera and running out of the store with it. She goes into the bar next door that she owns and hides the camera!<p>

<b>Home Page</b>: One of Channel 5's cameras.<br>
<b>Stan</b>: Yes, and these are $50,000 cameras.  What the owner doesn't know is that the tape is still rolling inside the camera.  When we ultimately got the tape retrieved we were able to hear the thump, thump, thump, thump.  They started banging the camera on a table top or floor
trying to get the tape to come out.  They finally did get the tape out, dumped it in a can of paint, of all 	things.  I guess that's the only thing they had available.  Of course the police came and they retrieved the camera. The tape ultimately was sent off to a lab that cleaned it up and we were able to retrieve it and show this video on the air.<p>

<b>Home Page</b>: Very dramatic video.  I remember it well.<br>
<b>Stan</b>: But there are times when you just don't know who you're dealing with.  In this case, 	it was just a pure set-up.  They were ultimately prosecuted and I think both of them plead to various charges.  
<p>
<em>[The attack in <a href="/call_for_action/attack.ram">RealAudio</a> or <a href="/call_for_action/attack.wav">WAV</a> format]</em>
<p>
<b>Home Page</b>: You alluded to it earlier that there is some element of risk in going where many reporters don't go.  Asking questions people don't want you to be asking.<br>
<b>Stan</b>: I think it's more of asking the questions that others <b>don't ask</b>.  It's easy 	to sit down like we are right now and you ask the questions that you know I'm comfortable answering.  But to sit here and say "Stan, why do you beat your wife?"(which I don't by the way). That's a hard question.  And you expect some response from the other person when you ask those.  So, it's the <b>asking</b> of the questions.  It's exposing peoples' dirty laundry.  That's what is risky. This station, I think, deserves a lot of credit for funding this kind of project.  I'm not cheap.  The producers aren't cheap.  The cameraman's not cheap.  This is an expensive deal. We 
get sued. Sometimes we get into altercations out in the field that cost the station legal fees.  It's not a cheap deal so I think this station has courage to support what we do. You've got advertisers breathing down your neck all the time cause we do stories on advertisers sometimes.<p>

<b>Home Page</b>: That's a good point, one that doesn't come immediately to mind when a viewer sees a Call For Action report they see you aggressively pursuing a story but they don't see or appreciate the fact that the main way a television station survives is by attracting advertisers
and in many ways what you do alienates them.<br>
<b>Stan</b>: Right. But this station backs us up 100%.  We do not have to back off of any story because of possible loss of commercial advertising. The way I like to look at it is that an advertiser ought to be on our station because of what we do. If Channel 5's Call For Action exposes bad businesses, and a client is advertising on Channel 5,  that client must have a good business. There's a subtle endorsement of any product merely by being on our air...it's not necessarily true, but if I were the sales manager, I'd be trying to preach that. I don't know how successful it would be. I do know we attract quality clients. Real quality clients.<p>

<b>Home Page</b>:  Your face has become a symbol in Kansas City for standing up for people's rights. What people at home don't see is the 25 or more folks working behind the scenes supporting Call For Action's entire effort.<br>
<b>Stan</b>: Very true. We have a staff largely comprised of volunteers. Volunteers, that means they 	don't get paid.  They work one day a week, each of them.  We have four phone lines so they're manning those phone lines.  They take the incoming calls and process 90% of the complaints
themselves.  The rest, the ones that are particularly compelling for a TV report, are forwarded to me. We recreate everything.  We redo everything. We call the business.  We call the clients.  We call everybody and eventually put it on the air.  But, the first call usually comes to the volunteer and there are usually about 500 calls a month. No TV station makes enough money to be able to hire enough people to answer 500 complaints a month and process them.<p>

<b>Home Page</b>: In detail.<br>
<b>Stan</b>: You just can't afford to do that.  So, we couldn't offer this service if it weren't for these volunteers that come in here and donate their time and their expertise in solving problems.  I couldn't answer the phone upstairs.  We would alienate our viewers if we didn't have those volunteers.  We just couldn't do it.  I'd be up there with a couple of producers and maybe a secretary and a cameraman...trying to answer 500 calls. We certainly couldn't return those calls, so we would be offending a lot of people while we were doing a few stories on the air. This way, it's a phone service. The beauty of this is that it's one-on-one.  If you call in and talk to a person...to Joe Smith, for example, one of our volunteers, that's the person who will process your complaint all the way through.  It's all on the phone, one-on-one, person-to-person.  There's a beauty in that cause it's very efficient, you solve problems quickly, and it's very personal.<p>

<b>Home Page</b>: And the number is what...831-1919?<br>
<b>Stan</b>: 831-1919.  Between 11 a.m. and 1 p.m.  Tuesday, Wednesday, and Thursday. And you can also write to us here at the station.<p>


<b>Home Page</b>: Do you find yourself a target for legal action?<br>
<b>Stan</b>: Yeah.  We've been sued six times in what...15, 16 years? All six of those were dropped because they didn't have cases.<p>

<img align=left src="/call_for_action/stanknoc.jpg"><p>

<em>["Knocking" in <a href="/call_for_action/door.ram">RealAudio</a> or <a href="/call_for_action/door.wav">WAV</a> format]</em><p>

<b>Home Page</b>:  When we see you knocking on someone's door, is that the last resort in trying to contact them?<br>
<b>Stan</b>: That's a last resort.  We do it to give them one more opportunity to state their case.  There are occasions when we'll go out without calling ahead, but only if the calling ahead would change their behavior.  A store, for example, that is offering some sort of a sale that really isn't a sale.  We need to go see that and document it before they know we're looking at them.  In some cases like that we would show up unannounced, tell them what we know and then give them an opportunity to respond.
  
<img align=right src="/call_for_action/stanwhy.jpg">

If you're a businessman out there, or woman, and you get a call from us, 90% of the time how you react to that call often determines whether we'll do a story. It can be either a volunteer calling, or one of the producers.  In either case, notes are taken of that. If the business, for
example, criticizes us, curses us...as sometimes happens...you'll see on the form the volunteer has written "Tell Stan to stick it in his ear!" or "Tell Stan I don't give a darn if he comes up here and puts me on TV!"  Those cases usually go to the top of the stack.  We usually address those first.  The reason is...if they're talking that way to us when they know they're being quoted...it's an indication, we think, of how they treat customers when the camera is not there and that deserves 	public attention.<p>

<em>["Locked Out" in <a href="/call_for_action/media.ram">RealAudio</a> or <a href="/call_for_action/media.wav">WAV</a> format]</em>
<p>
<b>Home Page</b>: What are some of the most outlandish, bare-faced scams that you have ever exposed on television?  Just completely unbelievable?<br>
<b>Stan</b>: Gosh, most unbelievable.....there are so many...most of them have to do with the "you may already be a winner" kind of stuff. Seems like direct-mail or phone solicitation scams never go away. I'll tell you a funny story, though.<p>


<b>Home Page</b>: Okay.<br>
<b>Stan</b>: This falls into that category we call "stories that went nowhere". We were following a street crew from a municipality .because we were told they were loafing on the job, going to a bar instead of working.  Well, it happened to be a street cleaning crew.  Have you ever tried to follow one of those street washers?  They move about a mile and a half an hour! That's what it was...the thing with the big brush that turns and sprays the water...well, we were discovered quickly. In fact, the thing ended up following us!  They were waving at us, in the rearview mirror we could see them!  So that went nowhere. Then there was the lady who wanted me to find a tractor repairman so he could make good on his guarantee. Apparently, her tractor was broken. So...she had written us a letter and deep in the letter she happens to mention that this tractor repairman had done the repair 46 years ago. She wanted me to go find this guy and make his warranty good! Needless to say, we didn't do it.<p>

<b>Home Page</b>: Oh, life in Call for Action!<br>
<b>Stan</b>: Another one...a woman's husband works on a construction site and the toilet splashes back when he's sitting on it. When he flushes it comes up and gets his behind all wet and dirty...and she wanted us to fix that problem.<p>


<b>Home Page</b>: Go out in the field and investigate that right away, would ya?<br>
<b>Stan</b>: Well, we didn't do that one either.  Another one swallowed a tooth and wanted to 	know where it was. I asked her "Well, how long ago did you swallow this tooth?" She said "Well, about four days ago."  I didn't tell her where she could find it.

<H2><center>Welcome to the KCTV Engineering Page</center></H2></CENTER>
<b>From time to time we will update this page with profiles on the engineering
staff and the duties they perform. Typical duties include operating and
maintaining the audio, video and transmission equipment at the station. We 
will also present other interesting technical facts about KCTV and television 
industry trends.</b> 

<HR SIZE=4>

<CENTER><H2>KCTV's Tall Tower</H2></CENTER>
DID YOU KNOW that KCTV transmits from a 956 ft. "free standing" tower in
mid-town Kansas City, Missouri? Taller than the Eiffel tower in Paris, the
tower legs are lit up at night which makes our tower a Kansas City landmark.
Because of our association with CBS, it has also been called the 
<b><a href="twrtxt.html">KCTV "Eye-Full" Tower.</a></b>
<BR CLEAR="ALL">

<HR>

<H2><CENTER>Do we turn up the volume on commercials?</CENTER></H2>
This is a question often asked of us by viewers. Ned Soseman, Assistant Director
 of Engineering, has written a brief explanation on the subject of 
<b><a href="volume.html">loud commercials</a>.</b>
<BR CLEAR="ALL">

<HR>

<CENTER><H2>How does a TV show reach my home?</H2></CENTER>
A simple and, hopefully, easy to understand <b><a href="howtvtxt.html">explanation</a></b> 
 of how it happens.

<HR>

<CENTER><H2>Why can't I watch CBS over satellite?</H2></CENTER>
The Satellite Home Viewers Act prohibits receiving CBS network
programming via satellite if you are able to receive a local CBS
station. Check out the <b><a href="shva_txt.html">details</a></b> of the act
and what it means to you.

<HR>

If you have any technical comments or questions regarding KCTV or relating
to the television industry please direct them to my attention. Thanks for 
visiting our web page and we hope to see you again.

<UL>
<LI>Construction began in 1954 and was completed in early 1956.
<LI>The support piers contain 800 cubic yards of concrete.
<LI>The tower legs are 87.5 feet apart at the base.
<LI>Over 600 tons of steel and nearly 26,000 bolts make up the structure.
<LI>Total weight is over 1,200,000 pounds!
<LI>Over 5 miles of copper wire connect the tower lighting circuits.
<LI>The tower is 956 feet tall. The antenna mounted on top of the tower makes
the overall height above ground 1,042 feet. That's 2,049 feet above sea 
level!
<LI>Taller than the Eiffel Tower in Paris, the KCTV tower and antenna
 together are twice as tall as the famed Washington Monument.
<LI>There are 1,360 white light bulbs (25 watt) attached to the four legs
 that make our tower a Kansas City landmark.
<LI>The flashing air navigation strobe lights were added in 1977.
<LI>Our first remote controlled <B><A HREF="/citycam/citycam0.html">
CityCam</A></B> was added in 1987 at the 430 foot level. In clear weather it can
 scan a radius of 29 miles around the tower.
<LI>It takes our tower climber about 40 minutes to reach the top (unless
 someone is chasing him).

<H2>Loud Commercials!</H2>
</center>

<P>Why do you people turn up the volume on commercials?</P>


<P>In fact, we don't turn up the commercials -- never have and never
will. Yet, sometimes the commercials seem loud to us, too. Here's
why.</P>

<P>Television sound is controlled by two factors -- technical limits
and artistic decisions. We use precision instrumentation to make
certain that the sound we broadcast never exceeds a certain volume
level limit, as defined by federal law. However, the producers of
programs and commercials are free to use the entire volume range
from absolute quiet to the maximum allowable limit to achieve their
goals (just as some visual scenes are brightly-lit while others
are filmed in dim light).</P>

<P>It's not unusual, for example, for a soap opera scene to consist of
a quiet "private" conversation -- forcing viewers to listen more
carefully or to turn up the volume to hear the spoken words
clearly. Suddenly, a commercial blasts you out of your easy chair.
While the commercial seems too loud, it really isn't, relative to
the loudest noise in the entire soap opera program. However,
compared to the quiet scene preceeding the commercial, it may well
seem too loud.</P>

<P>The producer of the soap opera may choose to dramatize a scene with
a quiet mood, while many commercial producers will do nearly
anything within technical limits to grab your attention, including
loud sound. Both styles fall within technical boundaries yet, when
presented back-to-back, they clash. Therein lies the problem.</P>

<P>Not surprisingly, we get the most complaints about loud commercials
during soap operas and similar dramatic presentations. We receive
virtually no complaints during shows which are more energetic, such
as The Price is Right, Wheel of Fortune or sitcoms.</P>

<P>Were we to manually adjust the volume of commercials and programs,
the job would be an endless string of subjective decisions that
would override the artistic control of program and commercial
producers, thus lessening the TV viewing experience and the impact
of programs and commercials alike.</P>

<P>KCTV monitors the sound level of our transmissions 24 hours a day.
If a commercial or program sounds too loud (or not loud enough),
remember, the producers wanted it that way.</P>

<H2><center>How does a TV show reach my home?</H2>

<IMG SRC="howtvpix.jpg" BORDER="3"></center>



<HR SIZE=4>
<H2>1 - The Production House</H2>
<P>TV shows are created, produced and distributed by large companies, usually
located in Hollywood or New York.</P>

<P>The distributor "uplinks" the show to one of the many satellites in space.</P>

<HR>
<H2>2 - The Satellite</H2>
<P>Satellites are located 22,300 miles above the equator. Many are financed
and launched by private enterprises at a cost of about $270 million each.</P>
 
<P>Producers or distributors bid for "transponder" (channel) space on each
satellite. It costs about $14 million for one channel for seven years
(the average life of a satellite). Each satellite will typically have a 
minimum of 24 channels.</P>

<P>Various shows have different "lead times." Specials and syndicated shows 
are usually uplinked about a week ahead of time; network shows are usually 
broadcast immediately when received."</P>

<HR>
<H2>3 - The TV Station</H2>
<P>TV stations have satellite dishes on their property to "downlink" shows
from the satellites. Each station's dish typically looks at one satellite at
a time and can be rotated to find the particular satellite it needs.</P>

<P>The satellite feed is then connected to a recording machine by the
station's engineering staff. Some national commercials already are in the
feed; local commercials are inserted at the station. When it's time to run
the show, the station plays the prepared tape.</P>

<HR>
<H2>4 - The TV Tower</H2>
<P>The show is transmitted from the station by microwave radio to the TV
station's broadcast tower. The tower is about 1,000 feet tall with an antenna
attached to the top. This will broadcast the station's signal a radius of
about 60 miles from the tower. Towers are placed in the best position to
reach the most viewers with the strongest signal.</P>
<HR>
<H2>5 - Your Home</H2>
<P>The signal is then received by the TV antenna at your home.</P>

<P>If you are a cable subscriber, the signal is received by your local
cable provider, who may convert the  signal to a different channel on the
cable system and then send it along underground cable into your home.</P>

<HR>
<P>I hope this has been a helpful explanation. Your questions and comments
are welcomed.</P>

<HR SIZE=4>
<BR>
<H3>Why can't I watch CBS on my satellite anymore?</H3>
</center>

<P>In a word, its the <STRONG>law</STRONG>. Although the Satellite Home Viewer Act
(SHVA) has been federal law since 1988, it took a 1994 amendment to
set the wheels of compliance in motion.</P>

<P>In essence, the SHVA says that local affiliates own the local
franchise for network programming. If you want to watch network
programming, you must tune in your local network affiliate.</P>

<P>What SHVA means to home satellite viewers is that anyone who should
ordinarily be able receive a local network affiliate TV station but
chooses to watch that network via satellite is violating the law,
as is the satellite carrier.</P>

<P>Specifically, the SHVA prohibits satellite carriers from providing
TV network signals (ABC, CBS, FOX, NBC and PBS) to homes which
can receive an adequate signal from their local network TV
affiliates by using a conventional outdoor roof-top antenna. The
fact that a satellite subscriber may not have a roof-top antenna is
not relevant under the SHVA.</P>

<P>Perhaps by coincidence, the Federal Communications Commission
recently overruled all community ordinances and homeowners
association covenants prohibiting roof-top antennas, thus
encouraging their installation and use.</P>
 
<P>In 1994, President Clinton signed an amendment to the SHVA that
mandates specific time frames in which a satellite carrier must
respond to a local network affiliate's challenges, placing the
burden of timely compliance on satellite carriers and broadcasters.</P>

<P>Since then, satellite carriers (such as Netlink, PrimeTime 24,
etc.) have been sending notification letters to city and suburban
satellite subscribers stating that they are about to disconnect
network channels from their satellite.</P>

<P>Satellite carriers have been aware of the consequences of the SHVA
since 1988. Unfortunately, little information or warning was given
to current satellite subscribers about the SHVA, so most viewers
are shocked when they receive their notification.</P>

<P>The fine print in recent publicity and advertising from satellite
carriers describes TV network signals as "a possible add-on" to
home satellite services. Possible, in truth, only if you live
outside the primary coverage of a network affiliate.</P>

<P>Network affiliates, such as KCTV, broadcast powerful signals which
cover a well-defined local geographic area. KCTV's primary signal
extends approximately 60 miles in all directions from our
transmitting tower in mid-town Kansas City.</P>

<P>For purposes of compliance with the SHVA, the KCTV viewing area is
identified by Zip Codes. Using the satellite carrier's subscription
list, subscribers with Zip Codes that fall within KCTV's primary
coverage Zip Code list are automatically challenged. Those
subscribers who disagree with the challenge in writing are dealt
with individually.</P>

<P>The SHVA gives local network affiliates the right to grant a waiver
to specific satellite viewers who may have special reception
circumstances. For example, a viewer who lives 50 miles from Kansas
City in a valley behind a hill between their roof-top antenna and
our transmitting tower would deserve consideration for a waiver.</P>

<P>On the other hand, a local viewer who should be able to receive our
signal clearly but chooses to watch CBS on the satellite because
the show times are more convenient does not qualify.</P>

<P>Every local affiliate of each TV network is or soon will be going
through the challenge process. Satellite viewers who receive one
challenge will likely be challenged by other local network
affiliates in the future.</P>

<HR>

Home Viewers Act is about . If you have any further questions please contact

               Burton can't imagine why 
               either.  But it's 
               something they live with 
               everyday.
                   Their adopted 
               daughter was violently 
               shaken by her
               father when she was five 
               weeks old.  Now six, 
               she'll never be able to 
               walk or
               talk.
               
               sot:  "At that time, she 
               was totally blind, 
               cerebral palsy, 
               seizures."
               
               NARR:  Breanna's natural 
               father is now serving 
               prison time for another 
               crime,
               the murder of her two 
               year old brother.  The 
               Burtons say their 
               daughter's
               condition is a tragedy 
               that could have been 
               prevented.

                    GIVING TO CHARITY 
               THIS TIME OF YEAR IS A 
               TRADITION WITH MANY OF 
               US.      
SUP:                (STANDUP: "BUT OVER

               THEIR OWN POCKETS.      
                    SO, BEFORE YOU GIVE 
               HERE ARE SOME IMPORTANT 
               TIPS TO KEEP IN MIND.")
                    - BE LEERY OF 
               GIVING TO ANY GROUP 
               YOU'RE NOT FAMILIAR WITH 
               OR ARE UNSURE OF THE 
               CAUSE.
                    THERE ARE LOTS OF 
               PHONY ORGANIZATIONS 
               USING NAMES THAT SOUND 
               LIKE WELL-KNOWN 
               CHARITIES.
                    - DON'T LET ANYONE 
               PRESSURE YOU INTO GIVING 
               RIGHT ON THE SPOT. 
               REPUTABLE GROUPS DON'T 
               OPERATE THAT WAY.
                    - BEWARE OF ANY 
               GROUP OFFERING TO SEND 
               SOMEONE RIGHT OVER TO 
               GET YOUR MONEY. THAT'S 
               USUALLY AN INDICATION
               THEY'LL TAKE YOUR MONEY 
               AND RUN...AND A SIGN 
               THEY'RE TRYING TO AVOID 
               POSTAL REGULATIONS.
                    - ASK FOR A WRITTEN 
               ACCOUNTING OF HOW YOUR 
               DONATION WILL BE USED. 
               IT'S A GOOD IDEA TO GET 
               THE GROUP'S ANNUAL 
               REPORT.
                    - NEVER GIVE OUT 
               PERSONAL 
               INFORMATION...LIKE 
               CREDIT CARD OR BANK 
               ACCOUNT NUMBERS...OVER 
               THE PHONE. IF AN 
               UNSCRUPULOUS PERSON GETS 
               THOSE NUMBERS, THEY CAN 
               GET YOUR MONEY.
                    - FINALLY, YOU CAN

               THE COLTS WENT RIGHT AT 
               TONY STARGELL.
               14-0 IN THE FIRST 
               QUARTER.
               
               EARLY IN THE SECOND, THE 
               CHIEFS CRANKED IT UP.
               MARCUS GETS OUTSIDE FOR 
               17 YARDS..INSIDE THE 30.
               
               AND THE CHIEFS HAD 
               SOMETHING GOING.
               GANNON SWINGS IT OUT TO 
               KIMBALL ANDERS AND HE 
               SLIPS 3 TACKLES FOR THE 
               SCORE.
               14-7..
               
               BUT THEN DISASTER FOR 
               THE CHIEFS.
               GANNON BACK TO PASS..HAS 
               TO DO SOME SCRAMBLING 
               AND MESSES UP HIS 
               HAMSTRING.
               
               (WHOOPS}
               
               THAT MEANS THE RETURN OF 
               STEVE BONO.
               
               GANNON FINISHED..CAN 
               HARDLY WALK.
               
               ON HIS FIRST PASS 
               ATTEMPT..BONO NEARLY
               PICKED OFF BY JASON 
               BELSER.
               BONO WAS LUCKY.
               CHIEFS MANAGED A FIELD 
               GOAL AND TRAILED 14-10 
               AT THE HALF..
               
               BIG, BIG PLAY EARLY IN 
               THE THIRD QUARTER..4TH 
               AND 5, CHIEFS GO FOR IT 
               AND MAKE IT BUT CHRIS 
               PENN HAS THE BALL 
               STRIPPED AWAY..
               
               THEN HERE COME THE COLTS 
               AGAIN EARLY IN THE 4TH 
               QUARTER.

               HERE BUT GIVE UP A FIELD

               SEE IT  SLIPPING AWAY 
               WHEN ALL THEY COULD 
               MUSTER WAS A FIELD GOAL.
               17-13..
               
               AND HARBAUGH WASN'T
               FINISHED.
               SLINGS ONE OUT TO THE 
               RIGHT AND HARRISON IS  
               W-I-D-E OPEN.
               CHIEFS SECONDARY IN 
               DISARRAY.
               MARTY CAN'T BELIEVE IT.
               
               BUT WITH A MINUTE-20 TO 
               GO THE CHIEFS COME BACK.
               BONO FLIPS ONE TO ANDERS 
               WHO SCORES HIS SECOND
               TOUCHDOWN OF THE DAY.
               CHIEFS GO FOR 2..THEY 
               DON'T MAKE IT..

               GREAT EFFORT.

               famous for partying.
                      But now 
               corporations are getting 
               involved in encouraging 
               their employees to call 
               for a free cab ride home 
               when they've had too 
               much to drink.
                      Recently the law 
               firm of Shook, Hardy & 
               Bacon signed up all 
               9-hundred of their 
               employees for a similar 
               program with MADD.
                      Each got a card 
               like this to remind them 
               not to drink and drive 
               and the card's good for 
               a free cab ride home if 
               they've had too much.

               ARE BRITTLE AND 
               FREQUENTLY SNAP.
                    IT WOULD COST

"GOOD NEWS"    NEWS.. THE GOLDEN ARCHES 
               ARE MAKING THEIR WAY 
               ONTO THE SKI SLOPES.
                         LITERALLY.
*VTR VO                  YOU SEE COMPANY
SUPER:         EXECUTIVES GOT TO 
LINDVALLEN,    THINKING.. HOW CAN THEY 
SWEDEN         FEED HUNGRY SKIERS?
                         SO THEY TOOK 
               THEIR BIG MACS.. AND 
               FRENCH FRIES AND BUILT A 
               MC-SKI.
                         IT EVEN HAS A 
               SKI THROUGH WHICH GIVES 
               SKIERS A CHANCE TO EAT 
               WITHOUT TAKING OFF ANY 
               OF THEIR GEAR.
                         RIGHT NOW THE 
               ONLY MC-SKI IS IN 
               SWEDEN.
                         BUT IF IT 
               BECOMES A HIT.. YOU 
               MIGHT SOON BE SLALOMING 
               THROUGH AN AMERICAN 
               MCSKI.

STANDUP :17    (STANDUP--russell says)
(rktape 2:20)         The state of 
SUPER: RUSSELL Kansas has a specific 
KINSAUL/       law that sets out the 
REPORTING      rules for the use of 
               deadly force by police 
               officers, when making an 
               arrest.
                       But prosecutors 
               will tell you that there 
               are a lot of factors to 
               consider.
                       And for that 
               reason they say each 
               incident where an office 
               shoots an escaping 
               suspect, must be 
               considered on a case by 
               case basis.

                     THE REAL PROBLEM,

                   THE SEED OF LEWIS'S 
               THEORY COMES FROM AN

               CALLED "AVIATION WEEK

               REAR) SPAR ... IS BURNED 
               SEVERELY," SAYS THE 
               ARTICLE. "BUT FRACTURED 
               PIECES TO THE LEFT AND 
               RIGHT OF IT ARE CLEAN 
               ... A SIGN THAT THE FIRE 
               MAY HAVE BROKEN OUT 
               AFTER THE SPAR FAILED."
               / / /
                     IN OTHER WORDS, 
               THE SPARK THAT BLEW 
               FLIGHT 800 OUT OF THE 
               SKY ... CAME -- NOT FROM 
               INSIDE THE FUEL TANK --

               JUST AS SOUND, THIS WEEK

               THE MONUMENT AS A 
               MEMORIAL TO ALL THE WARS 
               OF THIS CENTURY. 
                   WARS LIKE VIETNAM

               THE FASCINATION OF THE

                   BUT NOBODY'S MUCH   
               INTERESTED IN WORLD WAR 
               ONE ANYMORE ... BECAUSE 
               THOSE WHO LIVED IT HAVE 
               NEARLY ALL DWINDLED 
               AWAY.
                   AND AS USUAL, 
               STEVE'S LOGIC IS SOUND.
SUPER:             HARDLY ANYONE DOES 
COMMENTARY     REMEMBER WORLD WAR ONE, 
               ANYMORE.
                   BUT THAT IS THE VERY 
               REASON WE SHOULD.

               ... IN MEMORY OF ALL 
               THOSE YOUNG LIVES THAT 
               WERE NEVER COMPLETED.
                   THE PLUME ATOP THE 
               TOWER WOULD BEAR ETERNAL
               WITNESS TO OUR GRATITUDE.
                   OF COURSE, WE DIDN'T

               ONLY CONSIDERED THE TAX

               SPENT 27,000.  THOSE 
               DISTRICTS ARE ALL ABOUT 
               THE SAME SIZE.

TRACY ONCAM         IF 50-THOUSAND

*VTR VO             BUT THIS YEAR, 
SUPER:         THOSE BIRDS ARE HARDER 
DEVON ENGLAND  TO FIND IN BRITAIN.
                    THE INCREASING 
               PRICE OF FEED IS ONE

                    THAT'S RIGHT .. 
               CROOKS ARE STEALING THE 
               BIRD AWAY FROM FARMERS 
               BY THE THOUSANDS.
                    THESE ARE NOT SMALL 
               TIME TURKEY CRIMES ... 
               BUT POSSIBLY THE WORK OF 
               A TURKEY MAFIA .. TRYING 
               TO TURN A QUICK BUCK IN 
               THE BIRD BUSINESS.
                    IF YOU THINK THIS 
               IS A JOKE .. DONT EXPECT

CONSTABLE      "When a large number of

               TO HER STOMACH TO MAKE 
               EDIE FEEL MORE AT HOME.
                    THE ZOO IS QUICK TO 
               POINT OUT THAT EDIE WILL 
               NOT BE RAISED AS A PET.
                    HER NEW MOTHER WILL 
               ONLY GET HER THROUGH THE

COMMENTARY     REALITY CHECK.
                   ANYTIME YOU THROW 
               THOUSANDS OF VIRILE 
               YOUNG MEN AND WOMEN 
               TOGETHER ... SEX IS NOT 
               ONLY LIKELY; IT IS 
               INEVITABLE.
                   THAT IS NOT TO SAY 
               IT'S UNCONTROLABLE ... 
               BUT THERE WILL ALWAYS BE 
               SOME WHO FALL TO 
               TEMPATION. ALWAYS! AND 
               NOT JUST MEN ... BUT
