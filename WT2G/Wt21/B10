<TITLE>MAKING THE HOME OFFICE TAX DEDUCTION MORE AVAILABLE TO PARENTS</TITLE>

<H2>MAKING THE HOME OFFICE <BR>
TAX DEDUCTION MORE AVAILABLE TO PARENTS </H2>

<P>
People who do paid work from home so that they can care for their
children are presently in most cases denied any meaningful deduction
for their legitimate home-office expenses under the Internal Revenue
Code. Not only is this result inequitable for these taxpayers,
but it also puts them at a competitive disadvantage with their
colleagues who rent or own workspace away from home. Furthermore,
it discourages people who want to spend more time with their children
from establishing home-based businesses or from making a home-based
work arrangement with their employer.
<P>
Taxpayers who conduct a home business while caring for dependents,
particularly small children, often fail to qualify for the home-office
deduction under Section 280A of the Code, because it requires
that the space used for a home business to be used exclusively
for such purpose. The home-based businesswoman needing to keep
an eye on small children or struggling with one income needs to
be physically proximate to her children and may not be able to
afford a separate room or space used for no other purpose. In
either instance, no deduction is allowed for depreciation, rent
(if the taxpayer doesn't own his or her home), maintenance, utilities
and insurance expenses allocable to the home office space if,
for instance, the work room is used also as a family room or guest
bedroom.
<P>
In another related development, the IRS has taken the position
that day care providers (presently, the only home-based businesses
that are not required to satisfy the &quot;exclusive use&quot;
rule) must keep elaborate records on the time any room is used
for personal and business purposes. This recordkeeping requirement
would presumably apply to any future exceptions to the &quot;exclusive
use&quot; rule such as taxpayers who operate home businesses while
caring for dependents. It imposes an unworkable burden on the
home-based business not required of their non home-based competitors.
<P>
Moreover, the value of a new exception to the &quot;exclusive
use&quot; rule would be minimal unless the existing rule for allocating
time of use was amended.  Applying the existing allocation rule to a home-based business
where there is mixed use of space, even if the business were operating a full
40 hours per week, results in a deduction worth only 25 percent
of the amount a competitor in an office receives for the same
expenses.
<P>
Finally, employees who are &quot;telecommuters&quot; and who would
otherwise qualify for the deduction for home-office expenses under Section 280A's
&quot;exclusive use&quot; test, are often denied the deduction under Section 67
enacted in 1986. Section 67 disallows home-office expenses of
an employee to the extent that such expenses along with other
certain &quot;miscellaneous itemized deductions&quot; do not,
in the aggregate, exceed two percent of the taxpayer's adjusted
gross income. Such other deductions are defined sufficiently broadly
that it would be the rare case where the two percent floor was
exceeded, and then, only the excess of expenses above the floor
is deductible.
<P>
<B>Suggested Solutions</B>:
<P>
Consequently, in order to provide the growing number of home-based
employees and business owners proper tax treatment that recognizes
legitimate business expenses in a way that is comparable to their
competitors and colleagues who are not home-based, the following
amendments to the Internal Revenue Code are needed:
<UL>
(1) Amend Section 280A(c)(1) to allow an exception to the &quot;exclusive
use&quot; rule permitting mixed use of space for business and
personal purposes in the case of taxpayers who conduct home-based
businesses while caring for dependents. Dependents should be defined
to include not only children, but also elderly parents or a sick
spouse.
<P>
(2) Amend Section 280A(c)(4)(C) to revise the allocation rule
for mixed uses to only compare only the amount of time a room
is in fact used for a business or personal purpose and not count
the time a room is used for no purpose at all (e.g., nighttime).
This would eliminate the reduction in the deductions for business
use for the time the mixed use room is used for no purpose and
put home-based taxpayers on a par with non-home-based taxpayers
who do not suffer a loss in deductions for their office space
when the office is closed.
<P>
(3) Provide some statutory &quot;safe harbors&quot; in Section
280A(c)(4) on calculating the mixed use of space for home day
care providers and, if the amendment suggested in (1) above is
enacted, for taxpayers with home-based businesses caring for dependents
to eliminate, in most cases, a burdensome recordkeeping requirement.
<P>
(4) Amend Section 67 to exclude home-office expenses of employees
from the miscellaneous itemized deductions subject to the two
percent floor.

<P>
In response to mounting problems, the White House has adopted
a new strategy to promote the nomination of Dr. Henry Foster as
Surgeon General.  It has chosen to frame the debate as a referendum
on the legality of abortion and to label its opponents as right-to-life
&quot;extremists.&quot; 
<P>
The White House's attempt to evoke a knee-jerk reaction from the
American public fails to address the salient issues of the debate,
however.  The Foster nomination is <U>not</U> about the legality
of abortion, and those calling for Foster's withdrawal are not
&quot;extreme.&quot;
<P>
The dictionary defines &quot;extremism&quot; as deviating to the
greatest degree from the center of opinion.  So what is the center
of opinion?  On the issue of abortion, the White House implicitly
argues that Henry Foster represents the center of public opinion.
 However, public opinion polls compiled by the American Enterprise
Institute show that Henry Foster occupies one end of the abortion
spectrum and that the majority of Americans do <U>not</U> subscribe
to Dr. Foster's views.
<UL>
<LI> A 1994 Gallup poll commissioned by CNN and <I>USA Today</I>
found that 65 percent of Americans believe that abortions should
either be &quot;illegal in all circumstances&quot; or &quot;legal
under certain circumstances.&quot;  Only 33 percent would agree
with Dr. Foster that abortions should be &quot;legal under any
circumstances.&quot;
<P>
<LI> A 1995 CBS News/<I>New York Times</I> poll (1/95) found that
60 percent believe that abortion should either &quot;not be permitted&quot;
or have &quot;stricter limits.&quot;  Dr. Foster's views that
abortion should be &quot;generally available&quot; are shared
by only 38 percent of the population.
<P>
<LI>A 1994 Roper study commissioned by Focus on the Family and the
Family Research Council polled abortion views on a 9-point continuum.
 From category 1 representing the most pro-life stance to category
9 representing the most pro-abortion stance, Dr. Foster's views
place him in either category 8 or 9.  Only 13 percent of Americans
fall into those two categories combined.
</UL>
<P>
Dr. Foster's record shows that he vigorously opposes popular measures
such as waiting periods and parental consent and notification
laws.  Foster also believes that abortions should be available
through all nine months of pregnancy, even 
after the fetus is viable outside of the mother's womb.  Can Dr.
Foster, as an 
individual who not only holds these views, but has also personally
performed abortions, conducted studies on mothers and their unborn
children to test abortion drugs, and performed sterilizations
on mentally retarded young women without their consent, be accurately
described as holding to the center of this public opinion?
<P>
And then there's the issue of Dr. Foster's credibility.  Dr. Foster
and the White House have not been forthright in representing Foster's
abortion record.  First, the White House said nothing about abortion.
 Then it admitted to Sen. Nancy Kassebaum that Foster had performed
<B>one</B> abortion.  Then Dr. Foster issued a statement saying
that he had done &quot;<B>fewer than a dozen</B>.&quot;  Then
there was the 1978 Department of Health, Education, and Welfare
transcript that recorded Foster as saying he had done &quot;<B>probably
near 700</B>&quot; amniocentesis tests and therapeutic abortions.
 Then Dr. Foster admitted his involvement in <B>55</B> abortions
when conducting abortion drug trials in 1981.  Then Foster told
<I>Nightline</I> that he was the &quot;physician of record&quot;
for <B>39</B> abortions.
<P>
The issue of credibility is hardly a minor point, especially for
an individual in whom Americans are asked to repose their trust.
 Are Foster's critics &quot;extreme&quot; for wanting a Surgeon
General who is truthful and forthright?
<P>
Lastly, the White House has characterized Foster's critics as
&quot;right to life extremists.&quot;  As of this writing, those
calling for the withdrawal of the Foster nomination include pro-life
groups, pro-family groups, the New York chapter of the National
Organization for Women, the <I>New York Times</I>, the <I>Washington
Post</I>, the <I>Washington Times</I>, the National Coalition
of Abortion Providers, Senators Joseph Biden, Nancy Kassebaum,
Bob Dole, and Dan Coats, among others.  Are all of these &quot;right
to life extremists&quot;?  If so, then where does that put the
White House and Henry Foster?  If not, then why has the White
House singled out the pro-life community for its rhetorical venom?
<P>
Groups coming from many different perspectives oppose the Foster
nomination for many different reasons.  Yet the White House has
chosen to label anyone who doesn't agree with its position as
&quot;extreme&quot;?  Did I miss something, or does the White
House now hold a monopoly on what can be considered &quot;mainstream&quot;?

<TITLE>ILLEGITIMACY AND ABORTION:</TITLE>

<H2>ILLEGITIMACY AND ABORTION:<BR>
TWO SIDES OF A SINGLE COIN </H2>

<P>
Republicans in Congress have a vested interest in precluding further
debate about the impact of the family cap on marginal abortion
rates.  A united front will send a stronger message to the states
that the welfare system must be radically changed and, at the
same time, will suggest more powerfully than words that neither
politicians nor the party need be hamstrung by an unequivocal
commitment to life.
<P>
By offering cash bonuses to states that reduce out-of-wedlock
births <U>and</U> abortions, the House Ways and Means committee
has seized upon an ideal opportunity to showcase pro-life consensus
-- without muting the emphasis on illegitimacy.
<P>
The incentives measure explicitly avoids reducing illegitimate
births by increasing abortions because changes in the amount of
the grant depend upon a ratio that defines <U>both</U> illegitimate
births and abortions as negative outcomes.  The current bill defines
the &quot;negative outcome ratio&quot; as the total number of
out-of-wedlock births plus abortions, divided by the total number
of births in the state in the applicable year.
<P>
 
By including abortions and out-of-wedlock births in the same total,
the measure eliminates all incentive for states to promote abortion
-- instead of abstinence and marriage -- as the means to ensure
that fewer children are born out of wedlock.  In fact, if passed,
the measure would represent the first time the federal government
has actually rewarded states for implementing policies that contribute
to a lower abortion rate.
<P>
At the same time, the incentives provision strengthens the anti-illegitimacy
provisions in the Republican bill.  The subcommittee bill, for
example, targeted only welfare mothers under the age of 18; but
the new language encourages states to reduce the illegitimacy
rate in all age groups.
<P>
One of the greatest appeals of an incentives solution is that
it explodes the myth that reducing illegitimacy and eliminating
abortion are mutually exclusive goals -- a pernicious misconception
that has been manufactured by liberal observers with a vested
interest in dividing conservative support for welfare reform.

<P>
Pro-lifers should combat that perception at all costs, short of
compromising our principles.  What we think about the right to
life has an organic relationship with our vision of the kind of
society we should institute -- and spiraling illegitimacy rates
erode our national character in ways that inevitably warp our
vision of the good society.
<P>
While we know that abortion is not an acceptable means to reduce
illegitimacy, we do not know which strategy will work best to
stem the tide of family breakdown.  James Q. Wilson argues that
&quot;the federal government cannot have a meaningful family policy
for the nation, and it ought not to try.&quot;  Codifying that
admonition, the new amendment guarantees the maximum amount of
flexibility that is consistent with a rigorous emphasis on the
reduction of illegitimacy -- and with an insistence on state accountability
for the use of federal funds.
<P>
One caveat Professor Wilson cites (and Speaker Gingrich has reiterated)
is that &quot;every major new [state] initiative must be evaluated
by independent observers operating in accordance with accepted
scientific canons.&quot;  By linking the funding mechanism to
changes in the negative outcomes ratio, the incentives provision
guarantees that states will generate objective data regarding
the number of non-marital births and abortions each fiscal year
-- and that policymakers can assess the &quot;success&quot; of
state experimentation accordingly.  By measuring &quot;outputs&quot;
independently of the dollar inputs which produce them, the amendment
ameliorates one of the worst non-market failures of the current
system.
<P>
By contrast, block grants without any semblance of accountability
threaten to turn the governors into the country's 50 biggest welfare
clients.  Lacking profit as a measure of performance, a state
welfare agency would view its budget as the proxy goal to be maximized.
 In studying the Reagan-era strategy of devolution-by-block-grant,
liberal analysts Richard Nathan and Fred Doolittle discovered
what they termed &quot;the paradox of devolution&quot;:  devolutionary
initiatives activated state and local governments to increase
their own support for programs cut at the federal level -- and,
in turn, to lobby heavily for the restoration of cuts and creeping
increases in grants.  In the end, the Reagan block grants failed
to reverse the growth of government at any level.
<P>
Nathan and Doolittle conclude: &quot;Our advice to politicians
would be for liberals to support state role enhancement in policymaking
and administration in conservative periods.&quot;  The advice
should give conservatives pause before they promote schemes that
give unfettered latitude to the states without also eliminating
all federal funding.
<P>
Short of radical devolution, the best alternative is a measure
that will turn the current incentives structure on its head. 
By rerouting federal dollars to reward the reduction of illegitimacy
rather than the expansion of bureaucracy, an incentives amendment
models a useful mechanism for revising federal-state relations
as well as accomplishing other worthwhile policy goals.

<P>
<H2>NATIONAL HISTORY STANDARDS:  <BR>
 CLINTONITES MISS THE MOON</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<CENTER>
<I>by</I>
<P>
<I> Gary L. Bauer</I></CENTER>
<P>
When Americans look back on the twentieth century, they may well
view the landing on the moon as <I>the</I> most significant event
of our time.  So said historian Arthur M. Schlesinger, Jr. 
<P>
Not if they are taught U.S. history according to the National
History Standards.  That's because, incredibly, the team that
labored for two years and spent $2 million in federal grants to
come up with &quot;world class&quot; standards completely missed
the moon.  They include references to &quot;Soviet advances in
space&quot; and to the <I>Challenger</I> disaster, but neglect
to mention that the United States won the space race.
<P>
Hardly an American has been unaffected by the U.S. landing on
the moon.  Thousands of us are alive today because of advances
in medical technology that are a &quot;spinoff&quot; of the space
program.  The computer revolution and the development of worldwide
communications networks are a direct result of the massive U.S.
drive to reach the moon.  Schlesinger is clearly right to signal
its importance.  And it is ironic that the national history standards,
rightly assailed by conservatives as &quot;politically correct,&quot;
should have effaced the memory of Jack Kennedy's most enduring
accomplishment.
<P>
It is hard to overstate the magnitude of the failure.  For the
Department of Education, this embarrassing public fiasco is indisputable
evidence of bureaucratic ineptitude.  If we adopt these amnesiac
history standards, we will succumb to a kind of national identity
crisis.  We will cease to remember who we are and why it matters
that there is an America.
<P>
This gaffe is almost unbelievable.  I say <I>almost</I> because
as Undersecretary in the U.S. Department of Education under President
Reagan, I gained an appreciation for how bureaucracies work. 
And I learned why we can never have national standards in education
determined by political bodies.  However well intended, the Goals
2000 legislation, which drives national standards, is deeply flawed.
 The attempt to have government determine &quot;official knowledge&quot;
in this country cannot help but become a political football. 
What George Will has called a &quot;cranky anti-Americanism&quot;
has come to dominate too many professional historians' worldview.
 That's why their depiction of America's &quot;war of vengeance&quot;
against Japan forced the Smithsonian's <I>Enola Gay</I> exhibit
to be cancelled. 

<P>
The Clinton administration's national history standards project
did not just miss the moon.  Major U.S. advances in medicine have
been lost as well, such as the development of anesthesia, the
conquest of Yellow Fever, and the discovery of the polio vaccine.
 Similarly, there is an anti-free enterprise bias to the history
standards.  Students are encouraged to put John D. Rockefeller
on trial for his sharp business tactics.  But where do the standards
lead young Americans to an understanding of the most productive
and free economic system in history?  Nowhere.
<P>
Defenders of the history standards complain that the criticisms
are all coming from conservatives, from the angry white male caucus.
 Well, the history standards' dismissal of Paul Revere and Robert
E. Lee, Thomas Edison and Albert Einstein would appear to fit
this category.  But how can these apologists explain the omission
of leading black Americans like Thurgood Marshall, Gen. Colin
Powell, Gen. Benjamin O. Davis, Ralph Bunche, Roy Wilkins and
the Rev. Ralph David Abernathy?  And how to explain the cultural
importance the history standards give to &quot;Madonna&quot; and
Roseanne, while pushing Leontyne Price and Marian Anderson off
the bus?  Further, how do historians who gave us six references
to the Seneca Falls Convention on women's rights explain their
failure to include Sen. Margaret Chase Smith and Ambassador Claire
Booth Luce?  These influential women were Republican leaders and
early advocates of the E.R.A. Was their adherence to the E.R.A.
<I>and </I>the GOP offensive to the panel?  Whatever became of
the big tent?  
<P>
It goes without saying that the history standards' emphasis on
race, gender, and class forces young Americans to accept a secular
world view.  But for millions of us, our religous ties are more
important than ethnicity, gender and geography.  The history standards
panel clearly failed to comprehend the influence of religion in
American life.  How else to explain the fact that they consistently
employ the term &quot;fundamentalists,&quot; a term generally
viewed as pejorative.  Some 30 million Evangelicals, recognized
even by <I>TIME </I>and <I>Newsweek</I>, receive no mention. 
Some groups seem more equal than others.  Catholic Americans will
find it odd that their children will learn of Mother Jones, but
never hear about Mother Seton.  Father Coughlin gets in, but Bishop
Fulton J. Sheen is an &quot;unperson.&quot;  Jewish Americans
will find a similar skittishness about recognizing the accomplishments
of Jews as Jews.  Interestingly, too, for a document that emphasizes
group experience and all claims of victimhood, the national history
standards are strangely silent about America's role in four Arab-Israeli
wars.  
<P>
Tocqueville recognized that centralization of administration was
always the enemy of excellence because it enervates local initiative.
 Not only will national standards in education, bureaucratically
derived and politically driven, fail to overcome a rising tide
of mediocrity, they will become a part of it.  As President Kennedy
often said: &quot;We can do better.&quot;

IN THE WAKE OF THE PC NAVY </H2>

<P>
The Navy has become so politically correct (PC) since the Tailhook
debacle that now sailors can't even express their opinion about
a controversial policy.
<P>
Last August, Navy pilot Lt. Cmdr. Kenneth Carkhuff told his boss
that he objected to women serving in combat and that his views
were based on religious convictions. As a result, Carkhuff was
removed from his unit and now faces dismissal for failing to &quot;demonstrate
leadership.&quot;
<P>
Since when does expressing an opinion translate into a leadership
failure? According to the Navy, Carkhuff's disagreement with its
full-steam-ahead women in combat policy warrants a discharge without
benefits after 13 years of outstanding service.
<P>
Carkhuff believes that women should not be subjected to the violence
of combat. His religiously-motivated beliefs are shared by many
less vocal members of the military who understand that PC reigns
and stating a contrary belief is grounds for dismissal.
<P>
This case is really about Constitutionally guaranteed free speech.
During the Second World War the Supreme Court heard a case involving
religiously based speech. In <I>Barnette v. West Virginia State
Board of Education</I>, the high court found that education authorities
could not force a Jehovah's Witness to pledge allegiance to the
American flag. The court ruled that, &quot;Freedom to differ is
not limited to things that do not matter.&quot;
<P>
Women in combat matters to Cmdr. Carkhuff because it's contrary
to his religious beliefs. The 34-year-old Naval Academy graduate
does not dispute the Navy's authority to place women in combat,
but he respectfully disagrees and exercised his Constitutional
right to express that opinion privately.
<P>
The Clinton Administration has erased more than 250,000 combat
exemptions for women. Today, women can serve in 95 percent of
all Navy billets. Feminists say this is progress, but combat veterans
and our combat-hardened allies know this portends future disaster.
<P>
In 1992, uniformed female military officers descended on Capitol
Hill to lobby against the female combat ban labeling it an &quot;equal
opportunity&quot; issue. The

Pentagon ignored the regulations which restrict uniformed sailors
from lobbying.
<P>
These women won their fight. But in contrast, when a lone man
objects to the same radical changes, suddenly an anchor from Washington
drops on his berth threatening to sink him along with his wife
and five children.
<P>
Cmdr. Carkhuff was assigned to an SH60B Seahawk unit which had
five pilots; two were female. He disagreed with the Navy's women-in-combat
policy but agreed to fly with female pilots if ordered. His boss
chose the PC route and booted Carkhuff overboard.
<P>
On January 25th, the Chief of Naval Personnel sent Carkhuff a
letter charging him with &quot;substandard performance&quot; and
failure to demonstrate leadership for not supporting the Navy's
female policy. A board of three Naval captains will soon determine
his fate.
<P>
The issue for Congress is whether the Navy has so embraced political
correctness that it no longer stands by objective truth. Sample
evidence of the Navy's ongoing PC revolution.
<UL>
<LI>Top admiral Jeremy Boorda made one of his first visits to Capitol
Hill a session with Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Co.) -- Tailhook's
grand inquisitor -- and promised to do better. He now oversees
the rapid feminization of the Navy.
<P>
<LI>Three top admirals -- Kelso, Arthur and Mauz -- suffered direct
hits from unsubstantiated feminist accusations. These wounded
warriors were put to sea by the PC Navy.
<P>
<LI> The Navy deceived the public about the pregnancy problem aboard
the first aircraft carrier with women. Five pregnancies became
29 and the count is still climbing.
<P>
<LI>The Navy wrote a pregnancy policy that all but endorses abortion
and takes no position on out-of-wedlock births much less pregnancies
that result from extramarital affairs. But two-thirds of all uniformed,
one-time mothers have never been married and more than half of
all pregnant women who abandon ship never return.
<P>
<LI>The Navy hosted &quot;Diversity Day '94&quot; last September
which was attended by six PC admirals and included seminars that
promoted homosexuality as the moral equivalent of heterosexuality.
<P>
<LI>The Navy leads the services in the number of open homosexuals
serving. This violates the military homosexual law signed by President
Clinton in 1993.</UL>
<P>
The Clinton Administration's decision to place more women in combat
is not based on military necessity. It is a political decision
to buy feminist favor and in time it will backfire. In the meantime,
we must pretend.
<P>
Cmdr. Carkhuff should be awarded a medal for declaring the &quot;emperor
has no clothes.&quot; 
Instead, the Pentagon's PC crowd is working overtime ridding the
Navy of people of character who dare oppose a misguided policy.

<P>
In the welfare debate last year, President Clinton himself stated
that &quot;the real source of the problem is the inordinate number
of out-of-wedlock births in this country.&quot;  He also conceded
that &quot;there's no question that ending welfare for unwed mothers
would work.  The question is `Is it morally right?'&quot;
<P>
While the President's proposed policies leave much to be desired,
he has formulated precisely the right question to frame the current
debate over welfare reform in general and illegitimacy in particular.
 There exists a striking public consensus that the welfare state's
practice of subsidizing illegitimacy is not only a massive problem,
but a moral problem at root.
<P>
No moral judgment even need be adduced to acknowledge that intact
families bestow upon individuals and communities advantages that
simply come no other way.  Empirical evidence amassed by social
scientists in the last ten years has confirmed in exquisite detail
what those who have lived in broken families already know.  A
single woman with children is not a viable economic unit for the
vast majority, but children need biological fathers for far more
than the extra dollars they add to the family budget.
<P>
If those on the welfare rolls have suffered most conspicuously,
it is also true that the welfare system has corrupted the ideals
and narrowed the vision of many who live well beyond the bounds
of the inner city -- even as it is now threatening our most cherished
civic institutions.  One obvious casualty is the weakening of
our conviction that the so-called &quot;bourgeois virtues&quot;
are available to all, regardless of race or class.  Early American
social workers, like Mary Ellen Richmond, understood that the
way to reintegrate the deviant into society is to cultivate in
them the values of the mainstream culture.
<P>
The role of the traditional two-parent family is essential in
sustaining the institutions of a free society precisely because
it is the vehicle by which values are transmitted from generation
to generation.  If the family fails to impart 
virtues that temper and restrain behavior, broad legal freedoms
must give way.  So, too, human dignity and equality, as the Founders
understood it.  Virtue, historian Gertrude Himmelfarb has said,
is the only true basis of equality and 

the only requisite for citizenship.  Either we act now to reduce
illegitimacy and to reinfuse our public policy with a commitment
to higher and nobler things -- or we run the risk of sabotaging
the entire experiment in democratic self-government.  Given the
consequences for the individual child, the surrounding community,
and the national polity, bringing a baby into this world without
a sense of sacred responsibility cannot long be regarded as a
morally neutral act.  Congress should now recognize that it is
also wrong to sanction such activity by subsidizing it.  Himmelfarb
writes that &quot;after making the most arduous attempt to objectify
the problem of poverty, to divorce poverty from any moral assumptions
and conditions, we are learning how inseparable the moral and
material dimensions of that problem are.&quot;
<P>
In sending his welfare package to Congress more than 30 years
ago, President Kennedy articulated contemporary liberals' fundamental
misunderstanding of the causal role welfare plays in boosting
illegitimacy rates.  &quot;Welfare programs,&quot; he said, &quot;must
contribute to the attack on . . . family breakdown [and] illegitimacy.
. . .  Unless such problems are dealt with effectively, they fester,
and grow, sapping the strength of society as a whole and extending
their consequences in troubled families from one generation to
the next.&quot;  Kennedy's insight about the consequences has
proven historically accurate; but his &quot;service&quot; approach
to curbing illegitimacy worked no better than the current President's
will.
<P>
While the President advocates a massive and expensive public relations
campaign against out-of-wedlock births, an unnamed aide on the
Clinton welfare task force confided to <U>Newsweek</U> reporter
Joe Klein: &quot;We looked at a hundred different programs around
the country that were trying to deal with this problem, and not
one of them moved the needle.  There just weren't any results.&quot;
 A formal study of the Teenage Parent Demonstration, sponsored
by the Department of Health and Human Services in response to
&quot;persistently high rates of teenage pregnancies and births,&quot;
found that &quot;[t]he program had an unusual and disappointing
pattern of impacts on pregnancy and birth rates . . . despite
. . . the substantial efforts of the programs to empower [the]
young mothers to take control of their fertility.&quot;
<P>
Charles Murray anticipated the problem in his 1988 book <U>In
Pursuit of Happiness and Good Government</U>.  &quot;The task,&quot;
he concludes, &quot;is not to devise a public relations campaign
to discourage single teenage girls from having babies, but to
neutralize whatever is impeding the age-old impulse of human beings
to form families. . . .  A major change in the behavior of young
women and the adults in their lives will occur only when the prospect
of having a child out of wedlock is once again so immediately,
tangibly punishing that it overrides everything else.&quot;  Eliminating
grants to unwed teenage mothers will be necessary, but not sufficient,
to restore the integrity of the family unit.
<P>
Only by historical accident were unwed mothers - of any age -
ever included in the AFDC program.  Frances Perkins, President
Roosevelt's Secretary of Labor and chief architect of welfare
policy, opposed extending federal entitlements to unmarried mothers
because she foresaw that subsidizing illegitimacy would escalate
family breakdown.  It would be ironic at best if the current majority
in Congress were to find themselves to the left of the most liberal
member of the Roosevelt Administration because they rejected that
intuition, now confirmed by years of sad experience.
<P>
As the one policy option that promises to effect change in the
current system, restrictions on benefits by definition constitute
the compassionate alternative.  If compassion is once again properly
understood, perhaps then it will become more obvious that the
object of our concern must be &quot;misery&quot; and &quot;sorrow,&quot;
not economic poverty, and that the &quot;misery&quot; most evident
today is the spiritual and moral deprivation visited upon dependents
of the welfare system.  It is time that we stop suppressing the
moral responsibilities that make life precious for a resident
of the inner city just the same as for a middle-class suburbanite.
 It is time, in short, to secure equal access to the central satisfactions
of family, virtue, and freedom.

<P>
<H2>A PRO-LIFE DEFENSE<BR>
  OF THE FAMILY CAP</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<CENTER>
<I>by</I>
<P>
<I>Jennifer E. Marshall</I></CENTER>
<P>
Again, in the course of the welfare debate, the abortion issue
has demonstrated its unique capacity to mobilize and divide.
<P>
Pro-life advocates who resist the so-called family cap, which
would freeze benefits to mothers who bear additional illegitimate
children while on welfare, fear with some justification that the
cap could promote an increase in abortions.  Pro-life advocates
who support the measure share both the concern and the long-term
goal of driving abortions to the point of zero.
<P>
All right-to-life activists should realize that, as one of the
few weapons in the anti-illegitimacy arsenal, the family cap not
only serves their cause in the long-term but deserves their active
support in the present debate -- subject to the critical qualification
that there must be no attendant funding for abortions.
<P>
No hard data is available to demonstrate that the family cap stimulates
the abortion rate.  And there is reason to think that the family
cap will <U>not</U> increase abortions, even in the short-term.
<P>
Feminists and welfare rights activists argue that the current
benefits level is already far too low to cover the costs associated
with a new baby.  If so, it is illogical to maintain that a cap
would have a sufficiently significant impact on the &quot;affordability&quot;
of another child to necessitate such a drastic measure as abortion.
<P>
The decision to abort, anyhow, is far more than an economic calculation.
 Twenty years of spiraling illegitimacy rates in the face of liberalized
abortion laws demonstrate that many individuals do not regard
abortion as a viable option.
<P>
Policy data collected by the Family Research Council suggests
that abortion is even less acceptable to poor women; and an article
recently published in <U>Family Planning Perspectives</U> found
that abortion rates for teen welfare mothers are <U>lower</U>
than national averages for all teenage girls.
<P>
Other research suggests that, whether conception was intended
or not, most illegitimate births to underclass women today are
&quot;wanted.&quot;  Certainly, there is 

anecdotal evidence to suggest that some girls have babies because
they want &quot;something to love&quot; -- or, worse yet, because
their peer group has perversely defined a baby as a status symbol.
<P>
Others simply believe that abortion is wrong and choose not to
compound their first mistake by committing another.  While poverty
dispirits some lives, in others it serves to highlight the intangibles
that make life most sacred.  The point of decrying moral deterioration
among the underclass is to assert an easily forgotten truth: every
person, regardless of economic status, is capable of the very
moral commitments that argue most forcefully against abortion.
<P>
Even assuming that our ultimate objective is to save as many lives
as possible, it is by no means clear that the appropriate operational
measure of success in assessing the family cap is the number of
lives saved in the short-term.  The question itself is a red herring
because it obscures the larger and more important issue: &quot;What
constitutes progress toward ending altogether the culture that
finds abortion acceptable?&quot;
<P>
While there is no point at which the short-term perspective loses
relevance, few would dispute that there exists some point at which
the long-term implications demand consideration.  If it is true
that preserving the current benefits package will save lives,
presumably we could save even more lives by increasing the entitlements
tenfold.  Yet, most right-to-life activists intuitively understand
that there is an alternative good to be served by restricting
benefits that will in no way compromise our commitment to life.
<P>
Liberal observers with a vested interest in dividing conservative
support have manufactured a pernicious myth that reducing illegitimacy
and eliminating abortion are mutually exclusive goals.  Pro-lifers
should combat that perception at all costs, short of suspending
our principles, because there is no question that reducing illegitimacy
by reducing the federal subsidy will serve the over-arching purpose
of the pro-life movement.
<P>
The vast majority of abortions are performed on unmarried women
-- and the proportion is growing.  To reduce abortions, we must
reduce the premarital sex and out-of-wedlock pregnancy that create
a perceived &quot;need&quot; for abortion.
<P>
By gradually eliminating federal benefits, poor women who are
pregnant out of wedlock will be forced to turn to local organizations,
including right-to-life crisis pregnancy groups, that will counsel
against abortion and discourage further irresponsible behavior.
<P>
Launching the arguments against illegitimacy in the context of
the current debate over those benefits will give new rhetorical
emphasis and more widespread attention to the arguments against
abortion; for, the two ills spring from the same misconception
that life is cheap and motherhood bears no sacred responsibility.
<P>
Indeed, the bipartisan focus on illegitimacy is one of the most
golden opportunities we have had in quite some time to reverse
the message of the counterculture that has made abortion &quot;rights&quot;
seem palatable.
<P>
We should bear in mind that what we think about the right to life
has an organic relationship with our vision of the kind of society
we should institute.  Not by coincidence, the Declaration speaks
of &quot;life&quot; in the same breath with &quot;liberty&quot;
and &quot;the pursuit of happiness&quot; -- two conditions that
speak directly to the question of how best to organize society.
<P>
By opposing the current system of welfare benefits, we advocate
a transformation of the political and social culture that will
sustain both &quot;happiness&quot; and a more enduring pro-life
consensus than even legal reform can hope to accomplish.

<P>
Abortion advocates have seized upon the results of the latest
public opinion poll on abortion, proclaiming that the overwhelming
majority of Americans (75 percent) are &quot;pro-choice&quot;
while only a small group (23 percent) are &quot;anti-abortion.&quot;
 The White House has used these purported findings to justify
its promotion of Dr. Henry Foster for Surgeon General.  And &quot;pro-choice&quot;
legislators have cited these &quot;findings&quot; as evidence
that the Republican Party should abandon its historic pro-life
commitment.
<P>
But a closer examination of this and other public opinion polls
reveals that such an interpretation is, in fact, misleading. 

<P>
The CBS News/<I>New York Times</I> poll to which abortion advocates
are referring found that 23 percent of respondents believe that
&quot;abortion should not be permitted;&quot; 37 percent believe
that &quot;abortion should be available but under stricter limits
than it is now;&quot; and 38 percent believe that &quot;abortion
should be generally available to those who want it.&quot;  These
results do not show 75 percent being in favor of the pro-abortion
activism of Dr. Henry Foster.  Nor does the survey show a mandate
for the GOP to disenfranchise its constituency who are morally
concerned about abortion, as abortion advocates would argue. 
Rather, the survey shows that 60 percent of Americans believe
that abortion should either be banned or more strictly limited.
<P>
Similar results have been obtained from other public opinion polls.
 A September 1994 Gallup poll for CNN and <I>USA Today</I> found
that 65 percent of Americans believe that abortions should either
be &quot;illegal in all circumstances&quot; (13 percent) or &quot;legal
under certain circumstances&quot; (52 percent).  Only 33 percent
believe that abortions should be &quot;legal under any circumstances.&quot;
<P>
Interestingly, when the &quot;legal under certain circumstances&quot;
category is defined more narrowly, a majority of respondents still
offer a &quot;pro-life&quot; response.  A September 1994 <I>Time</I>/CNN
poll found that 52 percent of respondents believe that &quot;abortion
should be illegal in all circumstances&quot; (13 percent) or that
&quot;abortion should only be legal in certain circumstances such
as when a woman's health is endangered or when the pregnancy results
from rape or incest&quot; (39 percent).
<P>
These findings reveal that large numbers of Americans express
moral objections to or reservations about abortion.  Indeed, when
a 1995 CBS News/<I>New York </I>
<I>Times</I> poll asked respondents to choose which one of two
statements more closely resembled their viewpoint on abortion,
46 percent responded that &quot;abortion is the same thing as
murdering a child&quot; as opposed to 41 percent who agreed that
&quot;abortion is not murder because the fetus really isn't a
child.&quot;
<P>
A 1993 Family Research Council poll conducted by the Voter/Consumer
Research group asked respondents whether they &quot;strongly agree,&quot;
&quot;somewhat agree,&quot; &quot;somewhat disagree,&quot; or
&quot;strongly disagree&quot; with the following statements about
abortion:  &quot;Unborn children should have the right to life&quot;
and &quot;Women should have the right to choose to have an abortion.&quot;
 Not surprisingly, the phrasing of the questions influenced some
respondents' answers -- towards the unborn child's right to life
in the first case and towards the woman's &quot;right to choose&quot;
in the second.  However, when the results were cross-tabulated
to discover those who would &quot;strongly agree&quot; with one
question and &quot;strongly disagree&quot; with the other, 25.6
percent held strongly pro-life views; 20.4 percent were strongly
pro-choice.  The rest were somewhat torn or confused.
<P>
Syndicated columnist Charles Krauthammer identifies with this
torn or confused group.  While he does not support efforts to
make abortion illegal, he opposes the Foster nomination because
he is troubled by the prospect of having a Surgeon General who
has personally performed abortions, who has tested abortion drugs
on mothers and their unborn children, who opposes waiting periods
and parental consent/notification laws, and who believes in abortion
through all nine months of pregnancy, even after the fetus is
viable outside of the mother's womb.  Krauthammer believes many
other &quot;pro-choice&quot; Americans share his objections to
abortion and to the Foster nomination.  He believes the White
House's nomination of Dr. Foster shows an insensitivity to the
fact that most Americans do believe abortion is immoral.
<P>
The GOP would be wise not to abandon the high moral ground in
the abortion debate.  While the issue is certainly not settled,
a majority of Americans do morally disapprove of abortion -- and
this broad moral unease means that pro-life policymakers need
not shrink from the battle.  Indeed, the Foster nomination is
but one example of how the abortion issue cuts for pro-lifers.

<P>
<H2> FEDERAL GOVERNMENT USES<BR>
 TAXPAYER MONEY TO PROMOTE<BR>
 FEMINIST AGENDA</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<CENTER>
<I>by</I>
<P>
<I> Robert L. Maginnis</I></CENTER>
<P>
The federal government used taxpayer money to buy packets of radical
feminist literature that denigrates men, promotes abortion on
demand, and declares homosexuality to be the moral equivalent
of heterosexuality.
<P>
The Postal Service and the United States Information Agency have
purchased these packets from the feminist Ms. Foundation for Women
and distributed them nationwide.  The materials were designed
to help plan the annual &quot;Take Our Daughters to Work Day,&quot;
which occurred Thursday, April 27th.  
<P>
The Ms. material:
<P>
<LI> Demonizes men and makes girls appear to be uniformly victimized
in a patriarchal society.
<P>
<LI> Presents an unbalanced analysis of educational opportunities
for the sexes.
<P>
<LI>Promotes abortion and warns that unnamed factions want to take
away the &quot;right to choose.&quot;
<P>
<LI> Severely exaggerates statistics.
<P>
The 136-page packets include parent, employer and school guides;
lesson plans for girls and boys; a synopsis of gender bias research;
and merchandise and literature order forms.  
<P>
The Ms. Foundation claims responsibility for creating and sponsoring
&quot;Take Our Daughters to Work Day&quot; as a public-education
campaign about girls and self-esteem.  According to its mission
statement, the Ms. Foundation &quot;directs resources to break
down barriers based on ...sexual orientation...[and promotes]
reproductive rights.&quot;  &quot;Sexual orientation&quot; is
code for homosexuality.
<P>
The packets include books such as <U><I>Medicine Women</I></U>,
for girls age 13 and up, which teaches about women who were midwives,
witches, high priestesses, female warriors and more.  Another
book, <U><I>Reinventing the Family: the Emerging Story of Lesbian
and Gay Parents</I></U> &quot;dramatize[s] the ingrained antipathy
of the larger society toward homosexuals [and] refute[s] the
detrimental assumptions hampering wider acceptance of gay parenting.&quot;

<P>
The packet further profiles facts about &quot;male dominance,&quot;
e.g., &quot;Between 1980 and 1990, the number of senior girls
in high school interested in engineering dropped by 25%.  Nationally,
the number of college women going into science and graduating
in science is declining.  Women and girls continue to be enrolled
in education and training programs that prepare them for low-wage
jobs in traditionally female occupations.&quot;
<P>
The materials often lack balance.  For example,  no mention is
made that more bachelor's and master's degrees are awarded to
women; boys get better scores in math and science, but girls get
higher scores in reading and writing; boys in eighth grade are
50 percent more likely to be held back a grade; and boys in high
school constitute 68 percent of the &quot;special education&quot;
population.
<P>
Feminist heroines like professor Anita Hill, Planned Parenthood
founder Margaret Sanger and activist Gloria Steinem are highlighted,
as are events like the Supreme Court decision, <I>Roe v. Wade</I>,
which legalized abortion.
<P>
Anita Hill is accorded &quot;victim&quot; status in the Clarence
Thomas Supreme Court confirmation hearing because she testified
&quot;before an all-male, all-white Senate judiciary committee.&quot;
<P>
Ms. Founder Gloria Steinem is credited with the statement: &quot;A
woman without a man is like a fish without a bicycle.&quot;  What
does this have to do with the self-esteem of little girls?
<P>
The pro-abortion message is clear.  Under the name of Margaret
Sanger the material reads: &quot;Still, in the 90s, 40,000 teenage
girls drop out of school each year because of pregnancy.&quot;
 Next to <I>Roe v. Wade</I>: an &quot;estimated 1.2 million additional
unintended pregnancies would occur each year in absence of publicly
funded women's health services.&quot;
<P>
The material also includes the statement: &quot;10% of American
women are lesbians and approximately 3.5 million lesbian and gay
Americans have had children.&quot;  The 10% figure is based on
Alfred Kinsey's thoroughly discredited estimate of the incidence
of homosexuality in the population.  Kinsey, an Indiana University
zoologist who authored <U><I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</I></U>
in 1948, based his research on 12,000 interviews, relying heavily
on data gleaned from criminals.  He extrapolated his findings
to the general population.  A number of recent studies have found
the population indulging in homosexual behavior to be considerably
less than 10 percent, and probably no more than 1 to 2 percent.
 
<P>
In a blatant attempt to redefine the family, the material lists
an unknown court case that declared &quot;[t]wo women make up
a `family of affinity.'&quot;  Also, the wildly exaggerated estimate
that 3.5 million children are being raised in homosexual homes
has no foundation in fact.
<P>
On another &quot;hot&quot; feminist issue, the Ms. Foundation
claims that &quot;Every 15 seconds in the U.S. a woman is battered.
 It is the greatest single cause of injury to women, more than
car accidents, muggings and rapes combined.&quot;  This, too,
is an exaggeration.
<P>
There are 31,536,000 seconds in a year.  If an American woman
is battered every 15 seconds then there are 2,124,000 such incidents.
 According to the Justice Department there are only 133,228 single-offender
assaults each year attributed to an offending spouse.  That's
one every 237 seconds.  
<P>
The Justice Department's 1994 report, &quot;Violence Against Women,&quot;
found that women are almost twice as likely to be victimized by
a boyfriend or ex-spouse than by a current spouse.  It projects
each year that there are 367,462 assaults by boyfriends or ex-spouses
compared to 195,980 by spouses.  And women are more likely to
be assaulted by a friend than by an intimate or relative.
<P>
Although the Ms. Foundation claims that &quot;girls are 4 to 5
times more likely to attempt suicide,&quot;  it neglects to mention
that boys actually kill themselves at a rate six times that of
girls.
<P>
The Census Bureau found that for all Americans 15 to 24 years
old in 1991, 11.8 percent of boys and 9.8 percent of girls used
cigarettes.  But Ms. says, &quot;Girls smoke more than boys.&quot;
<P>
While the feminist organization claims that girls are neglected
in classrooms, the fact is that most of the attention boys receive
is disciplinary.  Factoring-out conduct-related exchanges makes
the numbers similar.
<P>
The Ms. Foundation is a highly partisan political advocacy organization
which relies on unvetted research.  Ms. literature routinely has
promoted division between the sexes and has denigrated women who
do not work outside the home.  The federal government should not
embrace -- and thereby endorse -- materials which are anti-male,
pro-abortion, and pro-homosexual.

<TITLE>A GENERATION XER'S</TITLE>

<P>
<H2>A GENERATION XER'S<BR>
 PERSPECTIVE<BR>
  ON PROMISE KEEPERS</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<CENTER>
<I>by</I>
<P>
<I>Gracie S. Hsu</I></CENTER>
<P>
Thirteen &quot;Promise Keepers&quot; events will be held across
the nation this summer, equipping and encouraging an estimated
half-million men to keep their promises to God, to their wives
and children, and to their fellow man.  While this laudable movement
to honor one's word is not aimed at a particular age group, some
might believe its &quot;traditional values&quot; message would
have more appeal among older generations.  Perhaps.  But public
opinion data indicate that one age group which might be especially
receptive to this message are young adults -- the so-called &quot;Generation
X.&quot;
<P>
In fact, Generation Xers (adults aged 18-29) are more likely than
any other adult age group to say that &quot;divorce should be
harder [rather than easier] to obtain,&quot; according to a recent
compilation of public opinion polls by the American Enterprise
Institute.
<P>
This finding is significant because it deviates from previous
generational trends.  Those in the younger age ranges have typically
held more liberal views toward divorce than their elders.  For
example, Baby Boomers (those between age 30 and 48 today) said
20 years ago that divorce should be easier to obtain -- a view
to which fewer of their elders subscribed.
<P>
Why, then, would Generation X be <I>more</I> likely than their
elders to hold traditional values on the permanence of marriage?
 The reasons are admittedly complex.
<P>
Some attempt to explain this anomaly by remarking that Gen Xers
are too young to understand the difficulties of marriage, and
that once Gen Xers are exposed to the hardships of married life,
their attitudes toward liberalized divorce policies would also
change.
<P>
But a more compelling reason -- the one on which most people agree
-- is that far from being ignorant about the hardships of marriage,
Gen Xers personally understand the devastating effects of <I><B>divorce</B></I>.
<P>
Indeed, Generation Xers are more likely than any other adults
to be children of divorce.  During the years in which today's
Generation Xers were born (1965-1977), the divorce rate in the
U.S. doubled.  The percent of children born
outside of wedlock also doubled during that time period -- the
result not so much of a broken <I>marriage</I> vow as of a broken
promise to <I>love</I>.  Consequently, more than 40 percent of
today's young adults spent at least some time in a single-parent
family by age 16.
<P>
The argument that Generation X's aversion to divorce developed
from their witnessing too many broken marriage promises is strengthened
by the attitudinal consistency which Generation X exhibits in
other areas of life.
<P>
For example, articles analyzing the Gen X culture often describe
Xers as &quot;skeptical,&quot; &quot;insecure,&quot; or &quot;cautious&quot;
-- attitudes which have largely been influenced by broken or flippantly-made
promises.
<P>
To expound, Generation X analysts say young adults are &quot;skeptical&quot;
of media hype because too many commercials and advertisements
make far-flung promises which they cannot deliver.  Analysts also
say that Xers are &quot;insecure&quot; about finances and future
stability because the American dream they were promised of surpassing
the wealth of their parents has, in reality, dim prospects.  And,
according to a recent <I>American Demographics</I> article, Gen
Xers are &quot;cautious romantics.&quot;  They marry at later
ages, increasing their economic and emotional stability in the
hopes of avoiding divorce and the broken promises of a marriage
vow.
<P>
Clearly, the message of Promise Keepers responds to the anxieties
of today's young adults.  But the fact that Promise Keepers is
not limited to the young should make the young, in particular,
celebrate.  For, perhaps now more than ever, young adults <I>need</I>
role models.  Far too many of their primary role models (i.e.
parents) have failed to model successful marriages.  And as a
result, Generation X could well be the most well-intentioned but
least-equipped adult age group in terms of keeping their marriage
vows.
<P>
Thus, encouraging older men to be &quot;Promise Keepers&quot;
will, among other benefits, help the young maintain their resolve.
 And that is the hope of the Promise Keepers movement -- that
the advancements begun by these rallies will positively impact
generations to come.
<P>
Lest there be any misunderstanding:  I am not suggesting that
the Promise Keepers movement is a cure-all for divorce or that
it is the singular solution for eradicating broken promises. 
But, this movement is definitely promising...for both young and
old alike.

<P>
<H2>ABC PROMOTES<BR>
  DRUG LEGALIZATION</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<CENTER>
<I>by</I>
<P>
<I> Robert L. Maginnis</I></CENTER>
<P>
ABC television recently aired a documentary which suggested that
America has lost the drug war and now must embrace legalization.
 &quot;America's War on Drugs: Searching for Solutions&quot; includes
a litany of distortions:
<P>
<LI>Anti-drug programs are called a failure.  In fact, America's
balanced strategy of prevention-treatment-enforcement turned the
drug problem around in the 1980s.  Drug pushers are gaining today
because the Clinton Administration has abandoned the offensive.
   
<P>
<LI>ABC argues that legalizing drugs will reduce crime.  It cites
anecdotal information from foreign countries as proof.  But these
&quot;facts&quot; are refuted by reports from the same countries
and from America's own experience.
<P>
<LI> ABC touts drug treatment as a better alternative to enforcement.
 It profiles closely controlled and very limited foreign experiments
as evidence.  But those countries still have major illicit drug
problems and ABC admits that drug treatment more often fails than
it succeeds.  
<P>
<LI>ABC labels those opposed to legalization or &quot;harm reduction&quot;
as motivated by fear.  In fact, there is clear scientific evidence
to demonstrate that even &quot;mild&quot; drugs like marijuana
have serious health consequences.
<P>
ABC correctly reports that drug abuse is once again on the rise,
especially among children, and that &quot;America shows few signs
of rethinking its drug strategy.&quot;  Although hostess Catherine
Crier claimed that her objective is to &quot;stir up public debate&quot;
and &quot;not to advocate any specific policy,&quot; many of the
program's guests are known members of the drug legalization movement.
 The program promoted a drug philosophy called &quot;harm reduction&quot;
which includes legalization.
<P>
Harm reduction, endorsed by most legalizers and to a certain extent
by the Clinton Administration, calls for more treatment and less
enforcement.  It views the use of illegal drugs as a health issue
rather than be a crime problem.  
<P>
ABC's presentation ignores history.  The U.S. experimented with
legalization from 1919 to 1922, when government-sponsored clinics
handed out free drugs to addicts in hopes of controlling their
behavior.  The effort failed.  Society's 
revulsion against drugs, combined with enforcement, virtually
eradicated the menace at the time.
<P>
Crier cites society's high cost for illegal drug use each year
at $67 billion.  But she fails to compare those costs with the
high costs of two popular legal drugs: alcohol, $99 billion and
smoking, $72 billion.  At the program's end, Crier admits that
decriminalization will lead to more use. 
<P>
The Drug Enforcement Administration estimates that drug decriminalization
will cost society more than alcohol and tobacco combined, perhaps
$140-$210 billion a year in lost productivity and job-related
accidents. 
<P>
An article in the <I>Journal of the American Medical Association</I>
found that marijuana users had &quot;55 percent more industrial
accidents, 85 percent more injuries and a 78 percent increase
in absenteeism.&quot;  Insurance companies would pass accident
expenses on to consumers.
<P>
Once drugs are legal, it will be very difficult, if not impossible,
to turn the clock back.  Today, there are few calls for recriminalization
of alcohol even though the evidence shows that prohibition saved
lives.  Alcohol use declined by 30 to 50 percent during prohibition
and deaths from cirrhosis of the liver fell dramatically.  Mark
Moore, Harvard professor of criminal justice, wrote: &quot;The
real lesson of prohibition is that society can, indeed, make a
dent in the consumption of drugs through law.&quot;
<P>
Unfortunately, ABC provides one sympathetic anecdotal account
of a drug abuser entrapped by stiff laws; meanwhile, it ignores
thousands of families who have been devastated by drug abuse.
 There was no reference to diminished public safety, increased
victimization, or increased family violence and child abuse caused
by individuals under the influence of illegal drugs.  And statistics,
such as the claim that 15 percent of the population smoke pot,
go unsubstantiated.
<P>
Instead, the viewer is introduced to &quot;harm reduction&quot;
programs in Holland and Britain and told that tolerance rather
than punishment works.  A Dutch official explains that legalizing
marijuana resulted in no increase in crime.  
<P>
ABC was either unaware of or ignored a study by Dr. K. F. Gunning,
President of the Dutch National Committee on Drug Prevention,
who found a 250 percent increase in cannabis use among students
from 1984 to 1992.  During the same period, shootings rose 40
percent, car thefts increased 62 percent, and hold-ups rose 69
percent.
<P>
American social scientists have confirmed a relationship between
drug use and juvenile delinquency.  A 1990 study published in
the <I>Journal of Drug Issues</I> found a strong association between
the severity of the crime and the type of substance used -- the
more intoxicating the substance, the more serious the incident.
<P>
Although ABC reported that in Britain, heroin addicts in small
experimental programs have not committed many crimes, Great Britain's
previous &quot;harm reduction&quot; efforts dispute these claims.
 The British sponsored a program of controlled distribution of
heroin between 1959 and 1968.  According to the <I>British Medical
Journal</I>, the number of heroin addicts doubled every 16 months
and the increase in addicts was accompanied by an increase in
criminal activity as well.
<P>
Undoubtedly, getting money for drugs is a motive for some crime,
but many criminals use drugs when committing crimes.  For example,
the U.S. Justice Department reports that most inmates (77.4 percent
male and 83.6 percent female) have a drug history and the majority
were under the influence of drugs or alcohol at the time of their
current offense.  
<P>
ABC cited California's experiment with marijuana legalization
which allegedly saved a billion dollars in law enforcement costs.
 What it didn't mention is a study that found that within the
first six months after decriminalization, arrests for driving
under the influence of drugs rose 46 percent for adults and 71.4
percent for juveniles.  Decriminalizing marijuana in Alaska and
Oregon in the 1970s resulted in the doubling of use and efforts
to recriminalize.
<P>
Crier reports that we have more than 300,000 people in jail for
drug-related offenses and later says that drug use would rise
with legalization.  She fails to reconcile more abuse with less
crime.  In fact, the 1993 Justice Department &quot;Sourcebook&quot;
shows 97,999 inmates charged with a drug offense and that most
inmates (79.4 percent) have used drugs. 
<P>
ABC also failed to mention that if drugs were legalized some restrictions
still would be necessary.  For example, Holland restricts the
sale of legalized drugs to minors, pregnant women, police, military,
pilots and prisoners.  There is no way the government could legally
sanction demonstrably harmful drugs like PCP and LSD, and less
potent marijuana would not satisfy users when far stronger pot
became available on the black market.  A black market niche for
these drugs would be inevitable.
<P>
Former Secretary of Health, Education, and Welfare Joseph Califano
cautions that in a post-legalization world, &quot;Madison Avenue
hucksters would make it as attractive to do a few lines [of cocaine]
as to down a few beers.&quot;  This would line the pockets of
legal drug producers and clearly hurt the American taxpayer and
American families.
<P>
Despite significant evidence that all hard drug users used gateway
drugs (alcohol, tobacco, marijuana) before they used hard drugs
(cocaine, PCP, heroin), ABC includes comments by &quot;harm reduction&quot;
advocates who dismiss the &quot;gateway&quot; theory of drug abuse
and the health risks associated with marijuana.
<P>
A 1992 article in <I>The Journal of Primary Prevention</I> found
that marijuana use is essentially a &quot;necessary&quot; condition
for the occurrence of cocaine use.  Other research shows that
involvement with illicit drugs is a developmental phenomenon,
age correlates with use, and cigarette and alcohol use precedes
marijuana use.  Polydrug use is often an indication of transition
to the more addictive substance.   
<P>
Dr. Carlton Turner, former  director of the National Institute
on Drug Abuse and head of the Marijuana Research Project at the
University of Mississippi, warns, &quot;There is no other drug
used or abused by man that has the staying power and broad cellular
actions on the body that cannabis [marijuana] does.&quot;
<P>
Since the 1970s there have been more than 10,500 scientific studies
which demonstrate the adverse consequences of marijuana use. 
The short term effects of marijuana include impairment in motivation
learning and memory, perception, judgment and complex motor skills.
 Pot consumption can cause difficulty in speaking, listening effectively,
thinking, retaining knowledge, problem-solving, and forming concepts.
<P>
The long-term effects are far more serious.  One study found large
numbers of marijuana smokers among younger cancer patients.  A
study in <I>Cancer</I> found that children of women who smoke
marijuana are 11 times more likely to contract leukemia.  Mothers
who smoke marijuana also contribute to low birth weight and developmental
problems for their children and increase by as much as 500 percent
the risk of abnormalities similar to those caused by fetal alcohol
syndrome. 
<P>
ABC may stir up public debate but &quot;America's War on Drugs&quot;
was not a responsible and balanced presentation.  &quot;Harm reduction&quot;
creates more problems than it solves.  Although a balanced policy
of treatment, prevention and strong enforcement works, the Clinton
administration has cut enforcement while Congress is cutting prevention
programs.  
<P>
America needs leaders committed to the drug war.  At present,
the debate is mired down in rhetoric while drug abuse among children
worsens.

<P>
Now that May
6 has finally arrived, families across America can breathe a sigh
of relief.  For May 6 is Tax Freedom Day, the day when Americans
cease working to support The Tax Man and start working to support
their families.
<P>
That's right, when you calculate how many days
one would have to work to pay off all the taxes owed by the average
taxpayer, the Tax Foundation in Washington reports that one would
not be free to keep their own earnings until May 6.
<P>
 But if the
new Republican House of Representatives has its way, tax freedom
will come sooner in the future.
<P>
The House recently passed a major
income tax cut that was hailed as the &quot;crown jewel&quot;
of its Contract with America.  The tax cut bill had a number of
 important pro-family features -- including a provision to make
it easier to claim home office deductions and a provision to write
off expenses associated with adopting a child.  But no provision
in the bill is as important as the bill's centerpiece:  a new
$500 children's tax credit for taxpaying parents.
<P>
The $500 children's
tax credit is designed to address the steady erosion in per-child
tax benefits that has occurred over the last four decades.  This
erosion in per-child benefits is part of the reason the average
family today sends Uncle Sam nearly a quarter of every dollar
earned, whereas the average family in 1950 sent only two-cents
of every dollar earned to the federal government.  And it is the
chief reason several national commissions -- including the 1986
White House Working Group on the Family and the 1991 National
Commission on Children -- made pro-family tax relief their top
policy recommendation.
<P>
  Unfortunately, the fate of the House GOP's
tax cut bill is very uncertain in the Senate.  Several key Republican
Senators -- most especially, Finance Committee Chairman Robert
Packwood (R-OR) -- have publicly raised doubts about tax cuts
in general, and the per-child tax credit in particular.  Others,
like Senators Dan Coats (R-IN) and Rod Grams (R-MN), have pledged
to take a $500 tax credit proposal to the Senate floor if Packwood
blocks committee passage of a bill patterned after the House GOP
Contract.
<P>
The fact that parents need tax relief can be seen not
just in the economic statistics showing a dramatic rise in the
tax burden facing Americans, but also in the
cultural statistics William Bennett publishes showing a dramatic
decline in the various indices of family well-being.  
<P>
To be sure,
pro-family tax relief cannot single-handedly solve these problems.
 Pro-family tax relief cannot cause husbands to love their wives
or children to respect their parents.  It cannot clean up filthy
TV or remove child predators from neighborhood streets.  It cannot
improve the quality of America's schools.
<P>
In short, pro-family
tax relief cannot, by itself, magically solve the various social
problems facing America's families, neighborhoods, and communities.
<P>
But
pro-family tax-relief will make it easier for families to thrive
by reducing economic stress on financially-strapped parents. 
It will make it easier for time-starved parents to monitor their
children's TV viewing habits and after-school play activities
and educational studies.
<P>
In essence, pro-family tax relief will
empower parents to address many family needs that only they can
meet.  As such, pro-family tax relief is a useful complement to
the cuts in wasteful government and social programs. 
<P>
 Hopefully,
the full Senate will soon adopt a $500 tax credit for children.
 Such a credit is needed, if Tax Freedom Day is to come any sooner
in the years ahead.

<P>
John Cardinal O'Connor of New York has defined two conditions
-- and two conditions only -- that justify opposing the anti-illegitimacy
measures recently adopted by the House.  His opposition hinges,
first, on the &quot;virtual inevitability&quot; that a freeze
on benefits &quot;amounts to a programmed `short-term' increase
in abortions&quot; and, second, on the lack of &quot;any hard
evidence&quot; to support the contention that reducing illegitimacy
will reduce abortions.
<P>
The Cardinal's principled objections deserve an answer, and all
people of faith should be relieved by the fact that we do have
hard evidence to allay both of his concerns.  Given the weight
of evidence suggesting that abortions will not increase in the
short term and will in fact decrease in the long term, those who
defend the status quo on moral or empirical grounds must now bear
the burden of proof.  And those who have been both puzzled and
troubled by the rift in the pro-life ranks over this issue must
understand that the division springs not from a different understanding
of our moral responsibilities, but from a different degree of
reliance on the actual empirical record.
<P>
While it is far too premature to draw any decisive conclusions
from the welfare experiment in New Jersey, there is absolutely
no statistical indication as of yet that an increase in abortions
has occurred since the state's family cap took effect August 1,
1993.  In fact, according to the New Jersey Department of Human
Services, the total number of Medicaid-funded abortions in New
Jersey declined from 13,629 in 1993 to 13,424 in 1994.
<P>
Anita Leone, executive director of an association that represents
all the publicly-funded abortion clinics in New Jersey, confirmed
in a recent interview: &quot;We know that abortions in New Jersey
are currently decreasing.  We just don't know why.&quot;  Because
the decline in the birth rate among welfare mothers in New Jersey
has been rather substantial since implementation of the family
cap (11.4 percent, according to the Department of Human Services),
the fact that an increase in abortions is not yet indicated is
particularly significant.      
<P>
The anecdotal evidence collected by those who are on the frontlines
of welfare reform in New Jersey confirms the general pattern that
is beginning to emerge from the data.  Richard Traynor of the
Legal Center for Defense of Life in New Jersey and David Sciarra
of New Jersey Legal Services, who together 
filed a class-action suit over the New Jersey family cap, both
commented in telephone interviews that the class was certified
to include welfare mothers who had aborted their babies -- but
that neither one could locate a woman who had actually aborted
in the wake of the cap.
<P>
Instead, the only plaintiffs who mention abortion in their affidavits
explain that they consciously decided on moral grounds not to
terminate their pregnancies, despite increased economic pressures.
 One woman testified that she made an appointment at an abortion
clinic but ultimately &quot;became very upset about having an
abortion and decided that [she] could not go through with it.&quot;
 Another woman who already had two children and was carrying triplets
-- three times the pressure -- never even considered abortion.
<P>
The decision to abort, the evidence suggests, is uniquely invulnerable
to rational economic incentives.  Only the most callous of mothers
places a price tag on her baby's head, and welfare mothers are
apparently more inclined to consider the intangibles than any
other population group.  Public opinion data collected by the
Family Research Council suggest that abortion is even more morally
repugnant to poor women; and the fact that abortion rates for
teen welfare mothers are <U>lower</U> than national averages for
all teenage girls is a powerful indication that non-economic factors
determine the decision to carry a child to term.
<P>
Many who now argue otherwise are precisely the ones who maintain
that the current benefits level is already far too low to cover
the costs associated with a new baby.  If so, it is illogical
to predict that a cap would have a sufficiently significant impact
on the &quot;affordability&quot; of another child to trigger such
a drastic measure as abortion.
<P>
State-by-state data from the 1980s demonstrates that small changes
in welfare payouts do not affect abortion rates in the short term;
and Michael Schwartz of Life Advocacy Alliance has found in analyzing
more recent data that states with the highest average monthly
benefit for a family of three also tend to have the highest ratio
of abortions to live births.
<P>
Not surprisingly, then, the only &quot;evidence&quot; the plaintiffs
could offer in the New Jersey suit was 55 letters from pro-life
activists expressing concern that freezing benefits might increase
abortions.  As of yet, there is nothing more concrete than their
concern itself to corroborate their claims; and pro-lifers who
are unconvinced by the hearsay -- including John Tomicki, past
president of New Jersey Right to Life -- have concluded that welfare
reform itself is a pro-life cause.
<P>
Contrary to Cardinal O'Connor's assertion, we do have compelling
statistical evidence to suggest that reducing illegitimacy will
reduce abortions.  Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation has
found an astronomically high correlation between abortion and
illegitimacy in a state-by-state analysis.  His study shows that
an increase of 100 in the number of illegitimate births per 10,000
women, in fact, results in an increase of 200 in the number of
abortions per 10,000 women.
<P>
The vast majority of abortions are performed on unmarried women
-- and the proportion is growing.  To reduce abortions, we must
reduce the premarital sex and out-of-wedlock pregnancy that create
a perceived &quot;need&quot; for abortion.  Marriage affords the
best protection -- indeed, the only real hope -- for the children
of the poor.
<P>
In deference to that fact, John Paul II wrote in his most recent
encyclical <U>Evangelium Vitae</U> that &quot;[a] general <I>and
no less serious </I>responsibility [for abortion] lies with those
who have encouraged the spread of an attitude of sexual permissiveness
and a lack of esteem for motherhood, and with those who should
have ensured -- but did not -- effective family and social policies
in support of families.&quot;
<P>
The Pope's teaching leaves ample room for inferring that a program
that undermines families and promotes sexual immorality as effectively
as our current welfare system does is equally responsible for
abortion as permissive abortion laws.  Those who countenance the
status quo in welfare countenance a system rife with abortion.
 And those who fight for welfare reform wage a war against abortion
that is no less morally valid than peaceful sit-ins, prayer vigils,
and reform of law.

<P>
While a burgeoning white illegitimacy rate has helped strip the
debate of racial overtones, a black Democrat named Wayne Bryant
has pioneered in the state of New Jersey one of the key anti-illegitimacy
provisions recently adopted by the U.S. House.  The so-called
&quot;family cap&quot; would deny benefit increases to mothers
who bear additional illegitimate children while on welfare.
<P>
By incorporating the family cap, Senator Bryant intended -- not
to constrict reproductive choices or to reduce births per se --
but to promote a sense of responsibility by insisting that families
on welfare live by the same values and confront exactly the same
choices as the general population.
<P>
Echoing Bryant's most popular argument, California's welfare commissioner
Eloise Anderson observes: &quot;Working women do not get automatic
raises when they have children.  Why should our expectations of
a woman on AFDC be any different than any other woman?  Do we
think they're stupider or less capable of being rational?&quot;
<P>
Since the family cap took effect in New Jersey in August of 1993,
the birth rate among welfare mothers in the state has dropped
substantially -- powerful proof that women on welfare are indeed
capable of governing their own decisions.
<P>
Even the most conservative estimate of the birthrate decrease
reported by the New Jersey Department of Human Services (11.4
percent) vindicates the two fundamental principles underlying
the current national debate: that economic incentives do influence
out-of-wedlock childbearing and that subsidizing irresponsible
sexual behavior has accelerated the moral and cultural decline
beyond what even Daniel Patrick Moynihan envisioned 30 years ago.
<P>
James Q. Wilson explains the moral implications of economic incentives:
&quot;Virtue is not learned by precept; it is learned by the regular
repetition of right actions. . . .  Seen this way, there is no
conflict between economic thought and moral philosophy: The latter
simply supplies a fuller statement of the uses to which the former
can and should be put.  We induce habits of right conduct by arranging
confronting youngsters in the ordinary aspects of their daily
lives so that right action routinely occurs.&quot;
<P>
Yet, morality is not merely a product of rational choices in response
to economic incentives.  If man is more than a material being,
then it is not unreasonable to expect some individual moral decisions
to override the economic incentives that run against the grain
of virtue.  Nor is it implausible to suggest that, of all the
choices an individual mother must make, the decision to abort
her child -- the most galvanizing moral issue of our day -- is
the one least likely to respond to policy variables.  
<P>
Precisely because human behavior is governed by a unique complex
of moral instinct and rational choice, the elimination of additional
cash benefits in New Jersey has decreased the birthrate without
causing an upsurge in the abortion rate.  While it is far too
premature to draw any decisive conclusions, there is absolutely
no statistical confirmation as of yet that an increase in abortions
has occurred since the New Jersey family cap took effect August
1, 1993.
<P>
The decision to abort, the evidence suggests, is uniquely invulnerable
to rational economic incentives.  Only the most callous of mothers
places a price tag on her baby's head, and welfare mothers are
apparently more inclined to consider the intangibles than any
other population group.  Public opinion data collected by the
Family Research Council suggest that abortion is even more morally
repugnant to poor women; and the fact that abortion rates for
teen welfare mothers are <U>lower</U> than national averages for
all teenage girls is a powerful indication that non-economic factors
determine the decision to carry a child to term.
<P>
The findings in New Jersey are striking evidence of the latent
moral potential in welfare mothers begging to be cultivated, rather
than frustrated by the perpetuation of policies that subsidize
immorality.  Remedial policies should reconcile the current tension
between moral knowledge and the economic incentives of the welfare
system -- before moral knowledge is altogether gone from the inner
city.
<P>
Charles Murray explains that, when illegitimacy reaches a critical
mass, the neighborhood effects create problems that extend far
beyond the recipients of welfare.  Community values and the norms
for male behavior are changed, and with them the behavior of young
men and women who never touch an AFDC check.  Thus, the effect
of those checks springs not only from discrete changes in economic
incentives but from a larger, more pervasive effect on the formation
of character among poor young people.
<P>
Yet, conservatives must take care to acknowledge that government
cannot be an effective moral teacher.  Public policy can undermine,
but never instill, virtue.  Rather than attempting to devise the
perfect bundle of carrots and sticks, we must eliminate altogether
the government subsidies that skew welfare recipients' decisions
by shielding them from the natural economic consequences.
<P>
Getting government out of the way, of course, is the theme that
unites social conservatives and economic libertarians.  In <U>The
Road to Serfdom</U>, F. A. Hayek emphasized the symbiotic relationship
between morality and freedom from government intervention:
<P>
 Freedom to order our own conduct in the sphere where material
circumstances force a choice upon us, and responsibility for the
arrangement of our own life according to our own conscience, is
the air in which alone moral sense grows and in which moral values
are daily re-created in the free decision of the individual.
<P>
It is the intrinsic truth of Hayek's observation that motivated
Wayne Bryant to institute the family cap in New Jersey -- a cap
he himself describes as a mechanism to reduce government constriction
of personal choices.
<P>
Government must instead cede ground to the character-forming institutions
that are found in every community -- families, churches, schools,
charities, and other traditional arrangements that have been supplanted
by public authorities.
<P>
Unless those institutions are reinvigorated and social functions
are restored to neighborhoods and communities, the behavioral
problems Daniel Patrick Moynihan described in his famous report
will only continue to grow more acute, jeopardizing personal freedoms
and ultimately the survival of the republic itself.  If it is
true that moral values do not have concrete meaning in the absence
of freedom, it is also true that the preservation of political
liberty depends upon the cultivation 
of virtue in the people.

<P>
A century and a half ago, Alexis de Tocqueville
recognized that increased centralization and bureaucratization
take away civic and individual responsibility: &quot;[A] centralized
administration is fit only to enervate the nations in which it
exists, by incessantly diminishing their local spirit.&quot;
<P>
It
isn't just fiscal crisis that necessitates the latest round of
proposed budget cuts -- our social crisis demands that the role
of the federal government be cut back.  Bureaucracies like the
US Education Department breed local apathy and mediocrity and
should be eliminated -- even if we had a budget surplus.
<P>
Once upon
a time the federal role in education was constitutional: it had
none. Things began to change in the 1930s when the New Deal brought
increasing federal involvement.  Later, under President Eisenhower,
Congress created the cabinet-level Department of  Health, Education
and Welfare.  In 1965, Lyndon Johnson rammed through Congress
the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, which vastly expanded
federal involvement.
<P>
Then, in 1976, candidate Jimmy Carter promised
a separate education department and received the backing of the
National Education Association (NEA) as a result.  In 1979, President
Carter, facing a liberal challenge from Sen. Ted Kennedy (D-Mass.),
set about to make good on his promise.  But there was strong opposition
from the American Federation of Teachers, from much of higher
education, and from the general public.  The AFL-CIO attacked
the idea and even the Washington Post argued that bureaucratic
costs would increase.
<P>
Marvin Stone, writing for U.S. News &amp;
World Report, articulated the fears of many Americans:  &quot;Would
the Education Department have the power to tamper with America's
traditional local control of education?  Of course it would. 
Where there is money to be given, there is the implicit responsibility
to make sure that it is spent according to the purposes of the
donors -- or else.&quot;  Though the bill establishing the department
stated emphatically that state and local control would not be
undermined, Stone was not convinced, citing a &quot;subtle schizophrenia
meandering through the legislation&quot; that revealed the authors'
true intentions. 
<P>
The US Education Department,
then, is a bureaucracy with a dubious past.  Its conception was
of doubtful legitimacy, given the strictures of the Constitution
and tradition.  The circumstances of its birth were also suspect
-- more or less a political payoff to the NEA.  And the US Education
Department has not improved American education.
<P>
Before its creation,
President Carter could point to &quot;[o]ur Nation's pluralistic
education system&quot; as &quot;the most competent and open in
the world.&quot;  No longer so.  According to former Secretary
of Education William Bennett, more than 90 percent of the students
entering US colleges today would not be admitted to institutions
of higher learning anywhere else in the world.
<P>
Meanwhile, the US
Education Department has grown into a huge bureaucratic &quot;blob,&quot;
 elbowing its way into places it does not belong.  Federal intrusiveness
reached a new height with passage of Goals 2000, which John Jennings,
director of the Center on National Education Policy, calls &quot;a
monumental movement away from local control of education&quot;
(emphasis added).
<P>
Goals 2000 promotes national education goals
and standards that override local priorities and ignore the fact
that many private entities have developed gauges for student learning.
 University of Virginia professor E.D. Hirsch has written a series
of books on cultural literacy, describing fundamentals of education
at each grade level.  The Family Research Council has published
an outline of US history entitled Let Freedom Ring.  William Bennett's
best-selling Book of Virtues is a wonderful source on America's
literary heritage.  All of these examples meet the need for a
high academic standard.
<P>
How is it possible that a program like
Goals 2000 -- quite inimical to American tradition -- has become
the manual for running local schools?  Partly through subterfuge:
 the insistent repetition that it is entirely voluntary.  Partly
because the profound crisis of American education has convinced
many that only an enormous federal initiative can cope with it.
 But this conviction is based on a fallacy:  the fallacy that
the federal government has money of its own.  Our culture of dependency
has forgotten that the only money the US Education Department
or any other federal agency has, is money that citizens have earned.
<P>
Tocqueville's
lesson has been relearned in our times:  centralization and huge
bureaucracies don't work very well. That truth swept away the
regimes of the Soviet Union and half a host of other countries.
 Finally, it's beginning to hit home, too.  
<P>
Today, no politician
would dare highlight the facts which President Carter touted in
his proposal for a US Education Department:  over 150 programs,
16,200 employees, and a budget of more than $13 billion, making
Education larger than five other departments.  Such big-government
philosophy has been rightfully stigmatized.  
<P>
Bureaucracy must
be pruned back to effect a renewal of the local spirit that Alexis
de Tocqueville praised so highly in 1835: 
<UL> I know of no people
who have established schools so numerous and efficacious, places
of public worship better suited to the wants of the inhabitants,
or roads kept in better repair.  Uniformity or permanence of design,
the minute arrangement of details, and the perfection of administrative
system must not be sought for in the United States; what we find
there is the presence of a power which, if it is somewhat wild,
is at least robust, and an existence checkered with accidents,
indeed, but full of animation and effort.</UL>
<P>It's time to disestablish
the US Education Department -- for the sake of American education,
our fiscal health, and the renewal of local spirit.

<title>A MAN OF HIS WORD</title>
<body>
<p>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">
<p>
<h2>A MAN OF HIS WORD</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by<p>
Anne Ellsworth Redd</i></center>
<p>
In a 17th century poem by Richard Lovelace, a soldier, who is just
about to go to war, explains
to his grieving lover, &quot;I could not love thee, dear, so much/
Loved I not honor more.&quot;  He is saying that his very expression
of love depends upon his character, his honor.  It seems that
this concept -- that a man's contribution in life and love would
depend upon his faithfulness to integrity -- is lost to us today.
 Some say that this kind of man no longer exists, or, even, that
he never did exist.  But this is the kind of man my father is.
<p>
There was a time, when I was in high school, that my dad proved his
faithfulness to me in a way that moves me, years later.  As a
surface naval officer, he was away from home for much of my last
three years of high school.  High school is a challenging (put
mildly) time for the best of us.  I had certain ideas about my
independence and made all kinds of mistakes in an effort to &quot;find
myself.&quot;  The very last people that I was interested in were
my parents.
<p>
Throughout this period (perhaps you're familiar with
the poetic, brooding, black-turtleneck stage?) my father wrote
me letters -- weekly, if not more.  I remember them well:  long,
sincere letters on heavy white stationery, written in his own
trademark hand and folded over once.  He told me that he loved
me, he asked me about my life and my interests, he described places
that he visited and challenges that he faced, he shared ideas
about life and God.
<p>
In one memorable letter, he told me that
he understood that I wanted to be &quot;free,&quot; and said that
he and my mother wanted to give me as much freedom as they possibly
could.  &quot;But there are two kinds of decisions,&quot; he wrote,
&quot;important decisions and <i>life-changing</i> decisions.  The latter
will profoundly affect you for the rest of your life.  These decisions
are decisions about sex, about drugs, about college...&quot; and
he went on to list some of these life-changing decisions (he is
always frank).  He said that he and my mother needed to be a part
of these latter decisions.  Though I took all of the letters and
good advice for granted at the time, looking back I am moved by
the kind of faithfulness and love that would cause him to write
so consistently.
<p>
When I was in eighth grade, my father was diagnosed
with cancer.  The doctors operated, in an attempt to remove all
of the malignancy.  From the moment of his learning of his illness
and throughout his hospitalization, I remember his strength. 
There were tears and hugs of love, and there was much pain.  But
there was strength under it all, and a complete
selflessness in his suffering.  He was cured, thankfully, but
he and my mother both used the pain as an opportunity to grow
-- as an exercise in faith.
<p>
In the face of cancer, long hours,
six-month-long deployments, and all the other things that life
brings with it, he has kept his promise to my mother and to God
by remaining faithful to her.  Their marriage has been a partnership,
a friendship, a haven, and a love affair.  The commitment that
my parents have for each other has modeled for us, their children,
faithfulness in a world sadly lacking it.  His faithfulness to
me, his daughter, has laid a foundation of dignity and confidence
that should serve me well in my family and career.  And he has
been a model for my brothers of the kind of man each of them should
strive to be.
<p>
As a naval officer, my dad works hard  to serve his
country.  As a leader, he is uncompromising in his beliefs, unflinching
in his morals, and unrelenting in his pursuit of excellence. 
Though we tease him that he sounds like a broken record, my dad
talks often about what he calls the fundamentals of leadership
-- Vision, Excellence, Character, Teamwork, Respect.  He has a
commitment to truth and goodness that doesn't depend on popular
opinion or trends.
<p>
A true man initiates in leadership, in integrity,
<i>and</i> in apology.  He is the first to make a stand for what is right,
and he is the first to admit when he is wrong.  In fact, a true
man may often find himself standing alone in this society.  But
he will always find himself standing.  As a leader, my dad is
honest about his failures and weaknesses, and he strives to learn
from them.  He is not perfect (and he will be the first to say
so), but he is persevering.  He is not faultless, but he is faithful.
 These things make him great.
<p>
In a society shaken by divorce and
marital unfaithfulness, we need men who keep their promises. 
In a culture sated with drugs and MTV and O.J. Simpson and &quot;safe
sex,&quot; we need men who are ready to lead a more radical movement
-- an Integrity Movement.  We need leaders with the compassion
for victims of this culture, and who, like Lovelace's soldier,
have the conviction to lift up a brighter and clearer standard
of living for everyone.
<p>
When we accept the premise that we are
trapped in cultural quicksand -- that we cannot demand more from
our youth or our leaders -- we have lost our hope in the soul's
potential, and we have denied the evidence of the lives of men
like my dad.

<title>UN THREATENS NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">
<p>
<h2>UN THREATENS<br>
NATIONAL SOVEREIGNTY</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Gary L. Bauer and Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>
<p>
The operational philosophy and military role of the United Nations
have radically changed.  In the UN's first five years it launched
only two peacekeeping missions, but since the fall of the Soviet
Union the UN has mounted 19 operations involving more than 70,000
blue-helmeted soldiers.  Last year these operations cost $3.6
billion.  The U.S. was assessed $1.2 billion and the Clinton Administration
spent another $1.7 billion for U.S. military participation in
UN missions.  Today, thousands of American soldiers wear UN blue
helmets in 10 countries ranging from Haiti to Lebanon to the former
Yugoslav republics.
<p>
Indeed, the UN has experienced a renaissance with the unexpected
fall of the Soviet Union, rising from near impotence in the early
1980s to worldwide peacemaker in 1995.
<p>
Harvard fellow Ronnie Dugger has called for the creation of a
United Nations military force composed of volunteer peacekeepers
financed by global citizen-members who pay dues and carry citizenship
cards.  If that doesn't fly, Dugger told <i>New York Times</i>
readers in June, perhaps nongovernmental organizations like Greenpeace
could become citizen-members of their own international agency
and elect a world parliament to pass and enforce laws through
a voluntary military force. 
<p>
Franklin D. Roosevelt envisioned the UN as an organization dealing
with traditional inter-state aggression rather than the type of
internal conflicts that now dominate its agenda.  But the 50-year-old
organization is transitioning to the &quot;new world order.&quot;
 That change is echoed by UN Secretary General Boutros Boutros-Ghali,
 who has issued <I>An Agenda for Peace</I> suggesting a greatly
expanded UN peacemaking role.  He endorses the principle of &quot;universal&quot;
sovereignty:  &quot;Underlying the rights of the individual and
the rights of peoples is a dimension of universal sovereignty
that resides in all humanity and provides all peoples with legitimate
involvement in issues affecting the world as a whole.&quot;
<p>
Boutros-Ghali has used this concept to sanction UN efforts in
Somalia: 
<P>
&quot;The magnitude of the human tragedy constitutes a threat
to international peace and security.&quot;  This justified the
world body's intervention in the sovereign affairs of a nation-state
without invitation.  The same happened in Iraq after the Gulf
War. 
<p>
The 1990 invasion of Kuwait posed a classic situation for the
UN, a case of aggression in which the armies of one state crossed
international borders to invade another.  Desert Shield/Storm
was a successful international effort to expel the invaders and
restore the sovereignty of Kuwait.  The follow-on 1991 UN-sanctioned
incursion into northern Iraq to protect the Kurds (Operation Provide
Comfort), however, was the first time the Security Council authorized
the use of force to address strictly internal affairs of a member
state.  Thus began a dangerous new era for UN &quot;peacemaking.&quot;
<p>
&quot;Loose constructionists of the UN Charter believe the existence
of such problems justifies expanding UN jurisdictions to deal
with them,&quot; says former U.S. Ambassador to the UN Jeane Kirkpatrick,
who warns, &quot;We are slipping into practices which enhance
only the power of the strongest.  Is this what we want to do?
 Someone had better think through this question -- and soon.&quot;
<p>
But Boutros-Ghali awards supremacy of rights to individuals and
groups within countries.  He argues that &quot;the centuries-old
doctrine of absolute and exclusive sovereignty no longer stands.&quot;
 Outside forces, then, do have a right to trump national sovereignty.
<p>
The UN's &quot;right&quot; to intervene in the sovereign affairs
of a country leaves all member countries, including the U.S.,
vulnerable to having their own sovereign territory compromised.
  For example, the next time Korean Americans bear the brunt of
a Los Angeles riot, the South Korean government could ask the
UN to intervene to protect its citizens' rights.   It couldn't
happen now because the U.S. would veto the move procedurally and
militarily.  But it could happen in the future, especially if
the UN has a standing military governed by a liberal world community.
<p>
There is no shortage of potential Bosnia-like situations on the
horizon.  The conscious choices that the international community
makes about these situations will decide the new order.  We can
only hope that the UN will avoid the temptation to resolve these
problems with the sword.
<p>
Meanwhile, the UN's military focus has been growing.  The UN Department
of Peacekeeping has expanded from a staff of 23 to more than 350
with a modern situation center, staffed 24 hours a day, linked
electronically to all UN hot spots.  It has a standby system to
tap troops and equipment from 185 member nations and it has established
a base in Italy to stockpile equipment like armored personnel
carriers for rapid deployment to peacekeeping missions.  
<p>
There have been calls for a standing UN Army.  Former French President
Francois Mitterand endorsed the creation of a &quot;UN Legion.&quot;
 This brigade-size unit of thousands  would be available for immediate
deployment when the Security Council authorizes military action.
 A &quot;UN Legion&quot; has been discussed at the U.S. Army Peacekeeping
Institute, where representatives from various U.S. government
agencies met with UN representatives in 1993 and 1994.  Anticipating
future trends, the U.S. Army recently published a field manual
entitled &quot;Peace Operations&quot; outlining relationships
with the UN and including extracts from the UN Charter.
<p>
Last year the Clinton Administration issued Presidential Decision
Directive-25 on reforming multilateral peacekeeping operations.
 This was supposed to make them more selective and more effective.
 The directive claims, &quot;The U.S. does not support a standing
UN Army, nor will we earmark specific U.S. military units for
participation in UN operations.&quot;  
<p>
Despite this assurance, White House Press Secretary Michael McCurry
said President Clinton supports America's continued UN involvement
and Madeleine K. Albright, U.S. Permanent Representative to the
United Nations, told Congress, &quot;The Clinton Administration
believes very deeply in the potential of the UN system.&quot;
<p>
The Clinton Administration has overseen the UN's radical transformation,
but some Americans don't share the optimism.  Presidential hopeful
Senator Bob Dole said, &quot;It is high time we rein in UN peacekeeping,
which is out of control.&quot;  Senator Jesse Helms called the
UN &quot;the nemesis of millions of Americans.&quot;  
<p>
We must heed the warning signs.  History teaches that the acquisition
of military power traditionally has been the first step toward
establishing governance over a territory.  Coupling the UN's changing
military strength with the new operational philosophy favoring
individual over state sovereignty sends a warning flare that no
liberty loving people can afford to ignore.

<title>REINVENTING FAMILY VALUES IN BEIJING</title>

<h2>REINVENTING FAMILY VALUES<br>
IN BEIJING</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>Gracie S. Hsu</i></center>
<p>
While there has been much speculation as to whether Hillary Clinton
will or will not attend the United Nations Fourth World Conference
on Women, much less attention has been given to the U.N. document
itself and what its impact will be on the family.  The U.N. conference
-- to be held in Beijing, China, from September 4-15, 1995 --
is supposed to advance women's rights around the world.  However,
the document reveals a much different reality -- one which attempts
to reinvent traditional families and family values.
<p>
Consider only a few of the Beijing document's most egregious violations:
<UL>
<LI><B>Denigrating the values of motherhood and traditional family
life.</B>  The word &quot;mother&quot; has been bracketed throughout
the entire platform so that it might be changed to the term &quot;caretaker.&quot;
 Similarly, the word &quot;family&quot; has been bracketed so
that it might be changed to &quot;household.&quot;  [Bracketed
sections indicate that delegates could not agree on the text.
 These sections are to be discussed further, with each alternative
weighed equally.]  Moreover, the word &quot;family&quot; almost
always appears in a negative context, i.e., in relation to domestic
violence or as a vehicle for female oppression.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Devaluing the husband-wife relationship to a mere power
play. </B>  Consider paragraph 198 of the platform: &quot;Inequality
in the public arena can often start within the family when <I>power
relations</I> between men and women are unbalanced with discriminatory
attitudes and practices within the family.  The unequal division
of labour and responsibilities within households based on<I> unequal
power relations</I> also limits women's potential...for participation
in decision-making in wider public forums&quot; (emphasis added).
 Thus, rather than acknowledging marriage as a cooperative partnership,
the platform pits one mate against the other.  Notably, the words
&quot;wife&quot; and &quot;husband&quot; are nowhere to be found
in the document even though the populace of every country participating
in the conference honors the marital relationship.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Gender is open for interpretation.</B>  While &quot;gender&quot;
appears more than 200 times in the platform document, the U.N.
fails to define the term.  During a preparatory 
committee meeting for the conference, one of the delegates asked
that the term &quot;gender&quot; be defined as the traditional
biological classifications of &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female.&quot;
 Others, however, sought to define &quot;gender&quot; as &quot;the
socially-constructed roles which society assigns to men and women.&quot;
 This latter definition has been used in feminist literature to
mean that gender is subject to change and that there exists a
spectrum of genders, perhaps even five (e.g., male heterosexual,
female heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, and transsexual). 
The U.N. rejected both definitions and decided that &quot;gender&quot;
was to be understood &quot;in its commonly accepted meaning.&quot;
  One can only hope the commonly accepted meaning of gender in
the United States remains that which acknowledges the biological
classifications of male and female.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Parents are irrelevant in adolescent health decisions.</B>
 In various areas relating to sexuality, reproduction, and AIDS,
the document repeatedly states that governments should &quot;emphasize
the role and responsibility of adolescents in sexual and reproductive
behavior through the provision of appropriate services and counseling,
recognizing their rights to privacy, confidentiality, and informed
consent.&quot;  The document refuses to recognize that parents
should play a vital role in their children's reproductive health
decisions.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Abortion and contraception as reproductive &quot;rights.&quot;</B>
 The efforts of the previous U.N. conferences in Cairo and Copenhagen
to promote abortion and unrestricted contraceptive availability
are well known.  The Beijing document follows in this tradition.
 The platform fails to recognize the role of men as husbands and
fathers, and argues that women should be completely autonomous
in their reproductive decision-making.  Indeed, the platform urges
governments to &quot;take action to ensure that women's sexual
and reproductive rights are fully recognized and respected&quot;
(paragraph 232).  Furthermore, the platform seems to elevate reproductive
&quot;rights&quot; above all other rights, stating that &quot;the
ability of women to control their own fertility forms an important
basis for their enjoyment of other rights&quot; (paragraph 98).
</UL>
<P>
Americans, in greater and greater numbers, are rejecting the radical
feminist agenda that has spawned many of the social problems now
confronting our nation.  The Clinton Administration should take
a lesson and remove the United States from promoting this to the
rest of the world in Beijing.

<title>SHANNON FAULKNER IS GONE</title>

<p>
<h2>FAULKNER IS GONE, BUT<br>
BATTLE OVER SINGLE-SEX<br>
SCHOOLS THREATENS<br>
EDUCATIONAL DIVERSITY</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>
<p>
Shannon Faulkner's decision to quit The Citadel does not stop
the battle over state-sponsored same-sex education.  That controversy
won't even be resolved when a federal judge decides whether an
alternative for women at Converse College in Spartanburg, S.C.
eliminates the need for a co-ed Citadel program, and daily reports
of Faulkner replacements or other touching profiles of military
women won't change the issue.  The gender assault goes much farther.
<P>
The Clinton Justice Department will take this case to the Supreme
Court and the high court could strike down public funded single-gender
education forever -- damaging America's academic diversity.  That
is a serious threat.
<P>
The Citadel's loss of the Faulkner trial would threaten the more
than 80 all-women's colleges that depend on taxpayer support.
That's why some of these colleges have expressed their support
for The Citadel in amicus briefs.  Their fear is that prohibitions
against direct funding of single-sex educational institutions
would lead to prohibitions against &quot;indirect funding&quot;
of single-sex colleges through federal financial aid and tax exemptions.
 This would make it difficult for any single-sex educational institution
to survive.
<P>
A diversified educational system should include single-sex schools
because same-gender settings are best for some students.  The
benefits of single-sex schools for some students are marked. 
Students do better academically, and women tend to pursue majors
in science, math and management, hold more leadership positions,
and are more likely to seek higher academic degrees.  Both genders
are more likely to participate in
honors programs and pursue careers in business, law or teaching,
and both sexes tend to find their overall academic experience
more rewarding.
<P>
One argument raised by critics of single-sex educational institutions
is that schools like The Citadel exacerbate the bias against women.
 But over the past 20 years there has been a dramatic increase
in the educational attainment of women in this country.  Diane
Ravitch, a former assistant secretary of education in the Bush
Administration, reports that:  67 percent of women high school
graduates go to college, compared to 58 percent of men; 55 percent
of all college undergraduates are women; women earn 59 percent
of all master's degrees; and women earn 39 percent of all doctoral
degrees, up from 14 percent in 1970.
<P>
Besides enhancing academic diversity, single-sex education can
help curb the epidemic of youth violence.  Same-gender schools
have emerged as a means to help at-risk inner city boys -- especially
those in elementary school.
<P>
Same-sex settings give boys a greater chance to succeed in life.
 Boys learn most when they perceive their teacher as a disciplinarian
and competitor.  They respond better to teaching based on the
adversary model of education, which incorporates contest and competition
in a disciplined environment.  And male teachers provide possibly
the only male role model alternative to a street gang leader for
some inner-city boys.  
<P>
Single-sex schools for girls have a positive academic effect and
protect them from aggressive boys.  They have better affective
outcomes and higher test scores.  They also enjoy higher self-esteem
than their co-ed peers.
<P>
Studies have shown that single-gender education works in the inner
city.  Seventh graders who had attended the Malcolm X Academy
in Detroit, an all-boys inner city school, had the highest math
scores among 77 Detroit schools and the second highest in Michigan
among 780 schools.
<P>
Cornelius Riordan, a professor at Providence University, found
that African-American and Hispanic students in single-gender schools
outperformed their coed peers by nearly a grade level.  And inner
city single-mothers recognize the value of same-sex schools, especially
for boys.
<P>
Unfortunately, single-gender public schools are illegal because
they allegedly discriminate based on gender.   Groups like the
American Civil Liberties Union and the National Organization of
Women have threatened to file lawsuits claiming a violation of
Title IX of the 1964 Civil Rights Act.  These are the same groups
which lined-up behind Shannon Faulkner's fight with The Citadel.
<P>
Some critics of single-sex education compare policies that exclude
because of gender to policies that discriminate according to race.
 They contend that the issues involved in The Citadel case are
the same as those in the 1954 Supreme Court case of <I>Brown v.
Board of Education</I>.  But this is a false analogy.
<P>
Gender differences are very different from racial differences.
 In some parts of the country, races were once segregated on public
transportation, in schools and in bathrooms.  But when racial
segregation finally ended, beneficial forms of segregation by
gender continued.  We continue to have &quot;separate but equal&quot;
male and female public bathrooms because most people recognize
that gender is different than race.
<P>
The battle over state-funded single-sex classes is not about bigotry
and is not a civil rights &quot;retreat.&quot;  The truth is single-gender
schools diversify America's educational experience and provide
wider options to individuals -- both women and men -- that might
benefit greatly from them.   They also give constructive male
role models to fatherless boys growing up in inner-cities.

<title>LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION'S WAR ON THE FAMILY</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">
<p>
<h2>LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION'S<br>
WAR ON THE FAMILY</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Gary L. Bauer</i></center>
<p>
In Pennsylvania, a rapist brought a custody suit against the family
who had adopted the child he fathered by his rape of a 13-year-old
girl.  In Georgia, a transsexual attempted to sue the state health
department to pay for a sex change operation.  In New York, a
public housing tenant who had committed a drug crime fought his
eviction on the grounds that he could not be evicted without 30
days' prior notification.  And in another Georgia case, a petition
was filed to release a murderer who had killed his grandparents,
because they refused to give him their car keys.
<P>
What do all of these disturbing cases have in common?  You and
I paid for them.  That's right, our tax dollars, channeled through
the Legal Services Corporation (LSC), funded these cases and many
more like them over the past twenty-one years to the tune of $5
billion.  
<P>
LSC, which is a non-profit corporation set up by the federal government,
supposedly helps poor people gain access to expensive legal services.
 In actuality, it has been a deep well of anti-family litigation
that has helped to expand welfare dependency, divorce, abortion,
and the homosexual political agenda.  LSC has also been active
in eroding legal protections for the traditional family, pushing
the radical &quot;children's rights&quot; agenda, and making prisons
cozy for criminals.
<P>
When it comes to families in crisis, LSC grantees seem to be more
interested in facilitating divorce than in helping to repair marriages.
 LSC grantees have argued that mediation, an important way of
resolving domestic disputes, &quot;should be avoided because the
woman is always at a disadvantage.&quot;  They have also advised
lawyers working on divorce agreements to reduce the father's visitation
time and to avoid cash settlements so that the mother can be eligible
for welfare.  The agenda here is clear:  break up the family and
replace dad with a welfare check.
<P>
While encouraging welfare dependence, LSC programs have also blocked
attempts at welfare reform.  The most well-known case is in New
Jersey, where LSC once again joined its frequent co-litigators,
the ACLU and the National Organization for Women's Legal Defense
Fund.  They argued that the state's capping of welfare payments
to mothers who have additional children while on welfare violated
a woman's right to procreate.  Likewise, LSC programs have put
their muscle behind efforts to block welfare reform in California,
Massachusetts, Maryland, Rhode Island, Tennessee, Iowa, Kansas,
and Maine.
<P>
LSC lawsuits have also helped subsidize the destructive habits
of alcoholics and drug addicts.  In recent years, LSC grantees
have helped thousands of substance addicts obtain monthly disability
checks courtesy of employers and taxpayers.
<P>
Criminals often find a friend in LSC.  Throughout the years, LSC
grantees have worked hard to make sure that prisons look more
like country clubs than places to incarcerate dangerous offenders.
 Such efforts have increased the costs of jailing criminals, putting
many back on the streets where they prey mainly on the very people
LSC is supposed to protect.
<P>
Since 1977, LSC grantees have been prohibited from involvement
in abortion-related cases.  Nonetheless, LSC programs have remained
firm in their commitment to abortion on demand and have worked
around the law, attempting to secure unlimited taxpayer-funded
abortions.  In several cases throughout the country, LSC grantees
have worked against waiting periods, parental consent, and parental
notification.  LSC programs have been involved in most of the
major cases in the history of abortion litigation, including <I>Doe
v. Bolton</I>, the companion case to <I>Roe v. Wade</I>.  
<P>
You would think that the new Republican-controlled Congress, with
its mandate to control spending and reduce government intervention
in people's lives, would be chomping at the bit to defund such
nonsense.  But even among Republicans, this pot of gold for the
far left has its supporters who are working to ensure its survival.
 Rep. Hal Rogers (R-Ky.), chairman of a House appropriations subcommittee,
has been working to save LSC by retaining funding along with some
new &quot;reform&quot; provisions.  Meanwhile, in the Senate,
Sen. Nancy Kassebaum's Labor and Human Resources Committee has
held hearings aimed at extending LSC's life.
<P>
Saving LSC would be a big mistake for Congress.  LSC should be
defunded, saving the taxpayers $415 million a year, plus untold
billions in legislative impact and litigation costs.  It doesn't
make sense for Congress to fund the groups that will turn around
and sue to undo the reforms it was elected to enact.
<P>
The legal profession itself should do more to help the poor. 
For too long, taxpayers have subsidized one of the most lucrative
professions by relieving it of a portion of its responsibility
to do pro bono work for the poor.  The $255 million a year in
non-federal support for LSC-type programs demonstrates that there
is great potential to meet the legitimate legal needs of the poor
without burdening the taxpayer.
<P>
LSC is remarkably resistant to reform and oversight.  The structure
of the program guarantees that it will remain unaccountable and
uncontrollable until Congress pulls the plug.  There are better
ways to help the poor.  LSC <I>should </I>be abolished.

<title>GENDER BENDERS IN BEIJING</title>
<body>

<p>
<h2>GENDER BENDERS IN BEIJING</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Gracie S. Hsu</i></center>
<p>
The &quot;gender feminist&quot; agenda embodied within the Platform
for Action of the United Nations Fourth World Conference on Women
is a direct attack on the family as we know it.  The conference,
which is to be held in Beijing, China, from September 4-15, 1995,
purports to advance women's rights, but the Platform itself reveals
a clear intention to promote &quot;gender feminism.&quot;
<P>
The Beijing document -- the text of which was heavily influenced
by Bella Abzug and other radical feminists -- includes over 200
references to &quot;gender&quot; in various contexts, i.e., &quot;gender
equality,&quot; &quot;mainstreaming a gender perspective,&quot;
&quot;gender diversity,&quot; etc.  However, &quot;husband&quot;
and &quot;wife&quot; are nowhere to be found in the 121-page document,
and the terms &quot;mother&quot; and &quot;family&quot; are up
for debate against the proposed substitutes of &quot;caretaker&quot;
and &quot;household&quot; respectively.  Clearly, the effort to
change the semantics associated with the family is the first step
in altering the way the world thinks about the family.
<P>
But why are gender feminists so intent on redefining the family?
 Because gender feminists believe that the husband-wife relationship
is inherently oppressive to women and that the traditional family
propagates this &quot;oppression.&quot;  Radical feminist Shulamith
Firestone wrote in 1970 that &quot;the heart of women's oppression
is her [sic] childbearing and child rearing roles.&quot;
<P>
Thus, gender feminists envision a brave new world in which reproduction
is <I>socially-constructed</I>, rather than biologically-determined.
 Firestone argues that &quot;the elimination of sexual classes
requires the revolt of the underclass (women) and seizure of control
of reproduction, restoration to women of ownership of their own
bodies, as well as feminine control of human fertility....so that
the end goal [is]...not just the elimination of male privilege
but of the sex distinction itself; genital differences between
human beings would no longer matter culturally.&quot;  Moreover,
feminist Alison Jagger asserts that &quot;the radical feminist
equality means not just equality under the law nor even equality
in satisfaction of basic needs; rather it means that women, like
men, should not have to bear children....  The destruction of
the biological family, never envisioned by Freud, will allow the
emergence of new women and men, different from any people who
have previously existed.&quot;
<P>
That the gender feminists have left their fingerprints on the
Beijing document is obvious.  From the document's emphasis on
&quot;reproductive rights&quot; (i.e., abortion and 
unlimited contraceptive availability, even to minors without parental
consent) to promoting &quot;gender equality&quot; and the mainstreaming
of a &quot;gender perspective,&quot; the document clearly seeks
to subvert the traditional family.
<P>
In all this, the United Nations has done nothing to defend natural
families.  When asked to define the term &quot;gender&quot; during
a preparatory meeting for the conference, the UN rejected the
proposal that &quot;gender&quot; should be defined as the biological
classifications of male and female.  The UN instead settled on
a non-descript, ineffectual definition that gender is to be understood
in &quot;its commonly accepted meaning.&quot;  While the UN did
not embrace the feminist definition of &quot;socially-constructed
roles which society assigns to men and women&quot; (i.e., a spectrum
of genders, including heterosexuals, homosexuals, bisexuals, and
transsexuals), it has left the door open to varying interpretations
of the term.
<P>
But despite the gender feminist agenda being incorporated into
the Beijing document, despite the Clinton Administration's backing
of the document, and despite the UN's dullness, the natural family
will not so easily succumb.  The crafters of the document, in
their attempt to advance a new worldview, still have much with
which to contend.
<P>
Biology, for instance.  Men and women differ biologically.  That
is a universally-recognized fact, not a socially-constructed idea.
 It is no wonder, then, that transsexual Kate Bornestein laments
the fact that &quot;the current gender system relies heavily on
everyone's agreement that it's inflexible.&quot;
<P>
Second, despite the rantings of radical feminists who say that
motherhood equals oppression, women worldwide will still freely
choose to bear and rear their children.  Some would even say that
mothering is a <I>natural</I> instinct within women, which is
why feminist Simone de Beauvoir believes that &quot;no woman should
be authorized to stay at home and raise her children...because
if there is such a choice, too many women will make that one.&quot;
<P>
Third, despite their success in infiltrating the Beijing document
with their terminology, gender feminists must still hurdle many
other language &quot;barriers.&quot;  After all, Webster's dictionary
still defines &quot;gender&quot; as &quot;the fact or condition
of being a male or a female human being....&quot;  Moreover, most
languages have no equivalent of the English term &quot;gender.&quot;
 Thus, even in the Beijing document, the phrase &quot;gender justice&quot;
is rendered in French as &quot;l'egalite entre les hommes et les
femmes,&quot; and in Spanish, the phrase &quot;gender-sensitive
initiatives&quot; translates to &quot;iniciativas que tengan en
cuenta las diferencias entre hombres y mujeres.&quot;
<P>
These gender feminists cannot hope to overthrow the family by
simply tinkering with a UN document.  But even with regard to
this UN document, families -- and women -- worldwide are seeing
to it that this radical feminist agenda will not be thrust upon
them without a fight.

<title>UN CONFERENCE MISSES MARK</title>

<p>
<h2>UN CONFERENCE MISSES MARK<br>
ON MARRIAGE, VIOLENCE<br>
AGAINST WOMEN</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>
<p>
Ambassador Madeleine Albright will present US priorities to the
Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing, China, in early September.
 As the head of the US delegation, Albright promises &quot;to
see that American views and values are well represented.&quot;
 But some of those &quot;views and values&quot; are truly alien
to our traditions.
<P>
The conference's road map, &quot;Program for Action,&quot; was
heavily influenced by western feminists like Bella Abzug, a former
New York congresswoman, who is described as &quot;arguably the
most important lobbyist&quot; behind the UN conference.  According
to State Department sources, many of the US delegates to the Beijing
conference are members of the Women's Linkage Caucus (WLC) which
is headed by Ms. Abzug.
<P>
The WLC heavily influenced the 121-page UN document, including
a section on violence against women which falsely implies that
most violence against women takes place in the home.  The document
says, &quot;In many cases, violence against women and girls occurs
in the family or within the home, where violence is often tolerated&quot;
and goes on to say, &quot;[v]iolence against women encompasses...physical,
sexual and psychological violence occurring in the family, including
battering, sexual abuse of female children...marital rape.&quot;
 But a new Justice Department study indicates that the safest
place for a woman today is married and living with her husband.
<P>
The August, 1995 Bureau of Justice Statistics study, &quot;Violence
Against Women: Estimates from the Redesigned Survey,&quot; reports
that a woman's relationship to the offender is a key variable.
 The study found that when all acts of violence against women
(rape/sexual assault, robbery and aggravated/simple assault) are
considered, married women are 30 times less likely than separated
women to become violence victims.  Moreover, 
married women are at least four times less likely than never-married
women to be crime victims.
<P>
The study also found that twenty-something women are the most likely
victims of violence.  They are twice as likely to become victims,
compared to teenagers and women in their 30s and 40s.  Although
the Justice Department report does not explain the difference,
US Census Bureau statistics show that the older female cohort
tends to be married, and the younger cohort is more likely to
live in homes where there is a protecting father.
<P>
Even incidents of rape and sexual assault are low for married
women.  The 1995 study found that a woman is three times more
likely to be raped and sexually assaulted by a boyfriend and 10
times more likely to be raped and sexually assaulted by an acquaintance
than by a spouse.  Single women are just as likely to be raped
and sexually assaulted by a stranger as they are by a boyfriend.
<P>
Instead of spreading feminist propaganda, Ambassador Albright
ought to take this data to the Beijing Conference.  Perhaps the
delegates would rethink their stand on marriage.  The UN plan
includes only seven uses of the term &quot;marriage,&quot; and
the words &quot;wife&quot; and &quot;husband&quot; are not found
at all.  This is an interesting omission, given that every great
society in history has been built upon the foundational concept
of family.
<P>
Ambassador Albright should embrace a message that works and not
failed feminist distortions.  If the conference &quot;on women
will affect directly the lives of half the people on earth,&quot;
as Albright claims, shouldn't her message be one that offers the
truth and solutions to violence rather than distortion and compromise?

<title>FBI CHILD PORN STINGS AND A VIRTUAL DENIAL OF REALITY</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">
<h2>FBI CHILD PORN STINGS AND A<br>
VIRTUAL DENIAL OF REALITY</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Cathleen A. Cleaver, Esq.</i></center>
<p>
&quot;Disheartening&quot; is how Steve Case, president of America
Online, describes his members' actions.  What did they do to deserve
this polite reproof?  They consumed and distributed the precious
merchandise of the child pornography meat market.
<p>
For some time now, pictures of  young bodies have been swapped
like baseball trading cards over computer networks.   It's time
to get serious, folks.  The Justice Department has, and deserves
praise for its efforts.
<p>
Laws prohibiting computer-transmitted child pornography have been
in place for years, but there has been a defacto decriminalization
of this material due to lack of enforcement.  That is finally
being corrected, but there is little to no prohibition of other
pornography-related activity in cyberspace.
<p>
Sure, there are obscenity laws that might apply, but the specter
of those laws does not loom large in cyberspace.  There is a &quot;freedom&quot;
there that exists nowhere else with regard to pornography -- an
environment virtually untroubled by legal injunction or deterrent.
 Indeed, if we consider cyberspace to be a little world of its
own, it is the type of world for which groups like the ACLU have
long fought, but fought in vain.
<p>
It will not remain this way.  Congress will soon make some final
decisions about how to address obscenity and indecency.   But
while it lasts, we ought to look closely at this &quot;control-group&quot;
society, if for no other reason than to assure ourselves that
our decades-old decisions to control pornography through law were
good ones.
<p>
With a few clicks of the mouse, today's computer novice can get
raw, even violent, sexual images once difficult to find without
exceptional effort and material risk. The user can go to popular
&quot;erotica&quot; sites to fill his screens with photographs of group sex 
scenes, close-up shots of genital mutilation, eroticized defecation 
scenarios, or vulgar videotape stills of
animals with young women.  He can sell these pictures, or swap
them, or send them to disturb a neighbor, or post them to shock
the unwary.  The user can meet inquisitive children in chat rooms
and send them lewd photographs of himself.  He can write detailed
accounts of rape and murder and display them for all to read.
 The user can do these things in near anonymity, and with the
comfort of knowing that he is not at risk of legal sanction. 
This is cyberspace now, and it is the free speech absolutist's
dreamworld.
<p>
Most concede that obscenity -- hard-core sexual material so graphic
and unredeeming that it fails the Supreme Court's test -- should
be illegal on computers as it is elsewhere.  Others balk, however,
at the proposition of laws to keep computer indecency from children.
It is a feigned reaction.  &quot;Indecency&quot; is legal for
adults, but can be regulated so that it is kept from children.
It has been defined as <I>a pattern of patently offensive depictions
or descriptions of sexual or excretory activities or organs</I>.
The hysterical arguments about indecency laws banning serious
works of literature or library art are no more credible now than
they were when unsuccessfully lobbed at such laws in other contexts.
Society has long embraced the principle that those who peddle
harmful material have the obligation to keep the material from
children.  Moreover, to charge, as some do, that indecency regulation
will bring the developing technology to a screeching halt is to
maintain that its advancement <I>depends upon</I> unfettered
exhibition of offensive sexual material.  This cannot be true.
<p>
Opponents of computer pornography laws say we should simply &quot;empower&quot;
parents instead.  They would empower parents by forcing them to
purchase expensive software products to try to combat the pornographers
themselves.  This is a bad idea for several reasons.  It is bad
philosophically because it advocates <I>restricting</I> the behavior
of the &quot;good guys&quot; (families and children) while giving
license to the &quot;bad guys&quot; to litter cyberspace with
pornography.  It also represents a drastic departure from time-honored
principles of the role of law in protecting children from exploitation.
Outside cyberspace, laws restrain people from displaying sexually
explicit images in public places and from selling alcohol, tobacco,
or porn magazines to children.  No one suggests that parents are
absolved from parental responsibility because of these laws. 
Yet, in the cyberporn debate, a small chorus of angry voices bellows:
&quot;It's the responsibility of <I>parents</I>, not government!&quot;
when identical laws are considered.
<p>
It is also a bad idea to leave the burden completely on the parent,
because it will not work.  Without liability and penalty disincentives,
the ability to restrict pornography would depend upon the character
of pornography distributors.  Already there are electronic &quot;how-to&quot;
pamphlets to circumvent blocking devices.  As technical restrictions
increase, so too will these aids, and they will be marketed and
used with impunity.
<p>
We can observe first-hand what the result of a purely market-based,
non-regulatory solution would look like, for we are looking at
it now.  Those advocating technofixes in place of laws aren't
earnestly seeking to empower parents to protect children.  Rather,
they want to force parents by the power of their arrogance to
kick kids off of this universal system so that nothing need inhibit
the free porn trade.
<p>
Opponents of pornography laws implore that the laws simply cannot
apply to this new medium.  This tattered old argument is pulled
out and dusted off with each new technological advance.  We saw
it last in the early '80s with the advent of the commercial videotape
market, and we see it now again.  Scientific change mandates legal
change only insofar as it affects the justification for a law.
The notion that people who disseminate harmful material have
the obligation to restrict the material from children is one which
transcends specific technology.  Old laws might need definition
and renovation, but old principles stand firm. 
<p>
Cyberspace is a work in progress.  We should not squander the
opportunity to examine and appreciate a world where pornography
knows no bounds.  The information superhighway does not belong
to pornographers.  Failure to enact strong laws is a concession
that it should.

<title>AMERICA AND THE SELLING OF PEDOPHILIA</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">
<h2>AMERICA AND THE SELLING OF<br>
PEDOPHILIA</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Robert Knight and Cathleen Cleaver</i></center>
<p>
Calvin Klein pulled its kiddie porn ads from the market this week,
but not before millions of Americans were treated to a new low
in the ongoing campaign to sexualize children. 
<P>
One ad features a young blonde teen-ager on the floor of a cheaply
furnished room. Her panties are exposed under a short skirt. 
She looks like a kidnap victim, about to be raped.  Her eyes convey
hurt and fear.  Another photo shows a boy clad in purple underpants.
His nails are painted black.  His eyes convey lust.  The ads were
shot by the same photographer that did Madonna's pornographic
book, <U>Sex.</U>
<P>
The television ads are even more suggestive.   In fact, the TV
ads are eerily similar to tapes that were the center of the controversy
last year when the Clinton Justice Department tried to weaken
the definition of child pornography.  In the <I>U.S. v. Knox</I>
case, Janet Reno argued that children had to be completely nude
for material to be considered child pornography, and furthermore,
that the children had to be purposely acting lasciviously.  The
material in <I>Knox</I> was videotapes produced by the Nather
Company, which described them as &quot;erotic beyond belief,&quot;
containing &quot;tender&quot; teens and pre-teens in &quot;savage&quot;
panty shots.  The Nather Tapes were found by the courts to be
child pornography, a verdict agreed to by the U.S. Senate, which
voted 100-0 to  condemn the Reno interpretation.  
<P>
Like the Calvin Klein ads, Nather Tape Two opens with images of
a clothed adolescent girl tentatively striking poses, responding
to off-camera directions from an adult male voice.  The camera
repeatedly focuses on her panties.  At one point, she says, &quot;I
don't know what to do.&quot;  The off-camera voice asks her to
sit down and push her knees up.  Another panty shot follows, and
another voice off camera says, &quot;We love it.&quot;  In another
tape, the off-camera voice asks a pre-teen girl to dance as the
camera focuses on parts of her body.  In the Calvin Klein ads,
a teen girl stands nervously in a basement room, responding to
off-camera directions from an adult male voice.  The off-camera
voice asks why she's nervous.  She 
replies,  &quot;I don't know what you're going to do.&quot;  The
voice asks her if she's a good dancer.  When she replies that
she is, he asks her to dance for him.  Other ads show a boy in
t-shirt and jeans.  The off-camera voice compliments the boy on
his body, and tells him he looks strong.  The voice then goads
him to prove his strength by ripping his t-shirt open, and the
boy complies.  The similarity between the porn tapes and the Klein
ads is uncanny.        
<P>
Before public pressure forced Klein to shelve the ads, many Americans
watched in dismay, asking how a nation came to allow its children
to be fodder for crude commercials by unscrupulous vendors.  Then
again, some ask, why has America allowed its children to be exposed
to graphic materials in public schools in the name of  &quot;AIDS
prevention&quot; and  &quot;sex education?&quot; 
<P>
The sexualization of children in America had its beginnings not
on a Madison Avenue drawing board or even in Hollywood but in
the pages of one of the best-known (and least-read) books of the
century -- Alfred C. Kinsey's <U>Sexual Behavior in the Human
Male</U>.  In 1948, Kinsey, an Indiana University zoologist, shocked
the world with the publication of  what came to be known as the
Kinsey Report.  A companion volume on females was published in
1953.
<P>
Both books ignited a controversy that persists to this day.  Both
paint a picture of people of all ages awash in secret sexual experimentation.
 The Kinsey Reports formed the &quot;scientific&quot; basis of
Hugh Hefner's destructive Playboy Philosophy, which brought pornography,
adultery, pre-marital and homosexual sex into the American mainstream.

<P>
But the most disturbing element of the Kinsey Reports is the overlooked
chapter in the male volume entitled &quot;Early Sexual Growth
and Activity.&quot;   Featuring charts in which &quot;trained
persons&quot; measured incidences of &quot;orgasm&quot; in children
as young as two months, the Kinsey child sex material contains
the seeds of a growing cultural movement to regard children as
not only sexually viable but entitled to sex with adults.  
<P>
In 1981, Dr. Judith Reisman delivered a paper on the Kinsey child
sexuality data at the Fifth World Congress of Sexuality in Jerusalem.
 Nine years later, Dr. Reisman, along with sex therapist Edward
W. Eichel,  research physician Dr. J. Gordon Muir and psychologist
Dr. John Court wrote <U>Kinsey, Sex and Fraud: The Indoctrination
of a People</U>.   The authors, according to the British medical
journal <I>The Lancet</I>, &quot;demolish the foundations of the
two [Kinsey] reports.&quot;   They also expose the foundation
of the Kinsey philosophy, which views all sexual acts as essentially
equal &quot;outlets.&quot;  To Kinsey, the sex between a husband
and wife is no different morally, physically or socially from
that of  sex between the same genders, between children and adults,
or even between humans and animals.  
<P>
And to Kinsey, age is not much of a factor.  In the Female volume,
he remarks, &quot; It is difficult to understand why a child,
except for its cultural conditioning, should be disturbed at having
its genitalia touched.&quot; 
<P>
 
<P>
Since the Kinsey books remain the most influential works in the
study of sex, their philosophy has spilled over, first to academia,
then to the larger culture.  Kinsey disciples went on to found
the Sex Information and Education Council of the United States
(SIECUS), which peddles the Kinsey philosophy in its sex education
materials.  In 1980, SIECUS co-founder Mary Calderone told the
Association of Planned Parenthood Physicians that SIECUS' primary
mission was to educate society &quot;very broadly and deeply with
awareness of the vital importance of infant and childhood sexuality.&quot;
 SIECUS President Debra Haffner has even envisioned a &quot;national
petting project,&quot; in which young teens are taught how to
stimulate each other sexually -- without having intercourse. 
With such novel approaches, SIECUS recently snagged a major federal
grant from the Clinton Administration to evaluate all sex education
programs in the United States.  
<P>
In 1991, <I>Child</I> magazine featured an article by then-Kinsey
Institute President June Reinisch called &quot;Sensuality and
Kids.&quot;  Reinisch counsels parents to foster sex play and
masturbation among children because it &quot;develops self-esteem&quot;
and for which some children &quot;use to relax and get ready for
sleep.&quot;  In the same vein, former Surgeon General Joycelyn
Elders advocated teaching children to masturbate. 
<P>
Other signs that the Kinsey philosophy is destroying cultural
protections for children abound:
<UL>
<LI>The American Psychiatric Association's latest <U>Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual</U> has redefined pedophilia so that a
person who molests children is no longer a &quot;pedophile&quot;
unless he feels bad or anxious about what he is doing.   The &quot;stress&quot;
triggered by feeling bad is now considered the marker for a paraphilic
disorder.  So a well-adjusted molester is okay because he feels
okay about what he does.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>In <I>The New Republic</I>, the mainstream liberal political
weekly, Hanna Rosin offers a defense of the pro-pedophile North
American Man-Boy Love Association in a recent review of the documentary
film <I>Chickenhawks</I>.  Regarding sex between boys and men,
she asks, &quot;is the idea of mutual consent so absurd?&quot;
 Then she quotes a NAMBLA member who advocates treating children
&quot;in a different way.&quot;  Rosin's comment:  &quot;Certainly
a self-serving view, but still plausibly on the continuum of,
say, a defense of children's legal autonomy.&quot; 
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>The New York Times </I>devoted several pages in its Sunday
magazine last year to Sally Mann's &quot;provocative&quot; nude
photos of her own children.  This week, incidentally, the Times'
fashion supplement includes a MAC Viva Glam lipstick ad with a
spread-legged crotch shot of a leather-stockinged Ru Paul, the
transvestite. The paper still carries this phrase on its banner:
 &quot;All the news that's fit to print.&quot;
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Movies and television increasingly portray children as sexual
actors.  In the 1994 film <I>Milk Money</I>, for example, young
boys watch and sell pornographic videos and pool their milk money
to buy the services of a prostitute.  In the film <I>Blank Check</I>,
a preadolescent boy schemes to have sex with a woman twice his
age. A Disney affiliate, Miramax,  has released an NC-17 film,
<I>Kids</I>, which shows young teens indulging in indiscriminate
sex and drug-taking.  The film's makers frankly admit that their
work is perverse, and that its gritty tone might offend some people.
 Precisely.  And have you noticed how often young children now
emit vulgarities and obscenities, even in &quot;family films?&quot;
</UL>
<P>
As for Calvin Klein, the designer rebukes the charges against
his filthy ads, saying that he was not intending a pornographic
message.  Klein says that &quot;some people are taking away a
different perception&quot; of the ads than the &quot;intended
message.&quot;   Coming from the man who began high-fashion kiddie
porn back in 1980 when he had 15-year-old Brooke Shields say suggestively
that &quot;nothing&quot; came between her and her Calvins, this
does not pass the straight face test.  He is lying, or is so personally
corrupt that he is unable to recognize the depravity of his own
message.  In a full-page ad in <I>The New York Times</I>, Klein
defended the ads, describing their &quot;positive message&quot;
as &quot;that young people today, the most media savvy generation
yet, have a real strength of character and independence.  They
have very strongly defined lines of what they will and will not
do -- and have a great ability to know who they are and who they
want to be.&quot;  Pretty rhetoric, and very similar to that employed
 by the North American Man-Boy Love Association, which contends
that children ought to be &quot;independent&quot; and &quot;make
their own decisions&quot; about having sex with adults.  The nice
men at NAMBLA want to &quot;empower&quot; children.  Talk about
&quot;the Hurried Child.&quot;   The child-sex movement is all
too eager to &quot;free&quot; children from the constraints of
their parents' morality.
<P>
Certain features of the Klein photo ads scream of child pornography.
 The off-color carpet and wood paneling suggest a basement room
-- child molesters often use the seclusion and privacy of a basement
to photograph their victims.  The blonde girl in the ad has a
frightened look on her face, and her hand is raised to her mouth,
where her lips appear slightly blue.  When children are sodomized,
they are often left bruised. 
<P>
Between Alfred Kinsey, Calvin Klein, and their disciples in Hollywood,
the entire nation is getting bruised -- beginning with our children.

<title>DO WE NEED A DRUG CZAR?</title>
<body>

<h2>DO WE NEED A DRUG CZAR?</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>
<p>
A Senate committee voted to abolish the White House drug czar
and move its function to the Treasury Department saving $10 million
next year.  Senator Richard Shelby (R-AL) explained, &quot;If
this administration will not facilitate and prosecute the drug
war, then Congress is forced to do it for them.&quot;  Clinton
promises to veto the bill if the final version eliminates the
Office of National Drug Control Policy.
<P>
Shelby says the administration is sending &quot;a mixed message
to America's youth -- a message that doing drugs is not a crime.
 I object to the administration's handling of this issue, its
lack of commitment to enforcement.&quot;   He blames drug czar
Lee Brown for &quot;lack of visibility&quot; in fighting illegal
drug use and trafficking.
<P>
Senator Shelby is correct about &quot;a mixed message.&quot; 
The Clinton administration has overseen an all-out retreat in
the drug war.
<P>
At a hearing before a House committee earlier this year, former
First Lady Nancy Reagan said, &quot;Why is it we no longer hear
the drumbeat of condemnation against drugs coming from our leaders
and our culture?&quot;  Former drug czar William Bennett echoed
Reagan's point, there is &quot;no viable effort by the Clinton
Administration to prevent the complete disintegration of foreign
supply control.&quot;  And former DEA director Robert Bonner stated,
&quot;I believe that there has been a near total absence of presidential
leadership by President Clinton in the fight to turn back illegal
drug use in this country.&quot;
<P>
At the same hearing Lee Brown began his testimony with an unusual
and telling aside.  He told the committee, &quot;I am extremely
disappointed by the way that you have structured this hearing.
 You have placed me on the third panel to testify, following the
appointees of the last administration.  This is contrary to established
precedent in the House for scheduling of administration witnesses
regardless of which party sits in the White House.&quot;
<P>
The administration's anti-drug record possibly explains the House's
witness sequence and the low esteem accorded Dr. Brown.  Even
Democratic Congressmen piled on the drug czar.  Rep. Charles Rangel
(D-NY) said, &quot;I've been in Congress for over two decades,
and I have never, never, never seen a 
president who cares less about this issue.&quot;  Rep. John Conyers
(D-MI) told Lee Brown during the drug czar's confirmation hearings,
&quot;Either the president is with you, or he has just given you
a chair at the cabinet level...If it is the latter, you are getting
ready to be the biggest fall guy in the Clinton Administration.&quot;
<P>
Probably the latter is closer to the truth.  The question remains,
should Congress discard the drug czar's post because Clinton isn't
committed to the war?  After all, when the ONDCP was established
by Congress in 1988, it was authorized to develop and coordinate
the policies, goals, and objectives for the drug fight.  What's
lacking in this administration is vision and leadership.  Snuffing
out an issue coordinator at the cabinet level is not the right
decision.
<P>
Senator Shelby would transfer the drug czar's responsibilities
to the Treasury Department.  But placing drug policy under Treasury
might further taint drug enforcement given the problems now linked
with the ATF.   Other anti-drug efforts like prevention and treatment
would likely suffer.
<P>
Treasury Secretary Robert Rubin supports the existing drug office.
 &quot;ONDCP is critical,&quot; says Rubin, &quot;because it is
a neutral agency coordinating all the 50 agencies with anti-drug
roles.&quot;  Even Attorney General Janet Reno sees a &quot;need
to continue a strong and coordinated effort&quot; played by the
drug czar.  
<P>
Brown defends his post:  &quot;The deletion of funding for the
ONDCP will undercut the President's ability to fight drugs and
drug-related crime, which recent polls confirm are America's greatest
fear.&quot;  He points out that 77 million Americans report some
history of using illicit drugs.
<P>
Brown shouldn't be faulted for his boss's apparent indifference
to the drug problem.  One of the czar's primary duties is to advise
the president.  But if his advice is ignored and Clinton fails
to personally support the drug war, it will languish.
<P>
Brown said that &quot;Shutting off the relatively small $9.9 million
for our office will do irreparable damage to the nation's ability
to have a coordinated anti-drug strategy.&quot;  Of course he's
right.  Treasury cannot effectively coordinate government-wide
anti-drug efforts.  Eliminating Brown's job because his boss doesn't
care is wrong.
<P>
This nation needs a coordinated anti-drug program and it begins
with a committed president.  The drug czar is an important player,
but he can't take the lead alone.  
<P>
With abuse rates rising and the culture glamorizing illicit drugs,
now is not the time to abandon what the czar's office represents:
a coordinated anti-drug commitment.
<P>

<title>THE FIRST LADY'S PARTICIPATION IN BEIJING CONFERENCE</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">
<h2>THE FIRST LADY'S PARTICIPATION IN<br>
BEIJING CONFERENCE<br>
SENDS THE WRONG MESSAGE</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Gracie S. Hsu</i></center>
<p>
Within hours of Harry Wu's safe return to the United States, the
Clinton Administration announced First Lady Hillary Rodham Clinton's
intention to go to Beijing for the United Nations Fourth World
Conference on Women.  After weeks of debate and uncertainty regarding
her participation, the Clintons felt Harry Wu's release paved
the way for the First Lady to attend without further barriers.
 But the Clintons are mistaken:  there remain several significant
reasons why Mrs. Clinton should not attend this conference.
<P>
First, Harry Wu was shamelessly used by the Chinese government
as a bargaining chip.  Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration
bought into China's tactic 100 percent.  By &quot;rewarding&quot;
China for its &quot;good&quot; behavior of expelling human rights
activist Harry Wu after convicting him of &quot;crimes,&quot;
the United States demonstrates that despotic regimes like China
should be free to take and use political prisoners as leverage
to strongarm the U.S. into accommodating their wishes.  The U.S.
position in this sends a clear message to China and to other nations
that the U.S. is willing to abide by the perverse rules of extortion.
<P>
Secondly, the Clinton Administration wrongly assumes that Harry
Wu's return to the United States clears the way for the First
Lady to attend the conference by exonerating China.  It does not.
 Indeed, during his first speech to the public after returning
from China, Mr. Wu strongly urged Mrs. Clinton to forgo her participation
in the Beijing conference because of China's blatant disregard
for human rights.  Mr. Wu said that the First Lady's attendance
would send China &quot;a signal, a kind of approval&quot; that
the United States is willing to tolerate, even condone, such crimes
against humanity.
<P>
And human rights abuses in China abound.  From forced sterilization
and coercive abortion policies, to female infanticide, to slave
labor (which Harry Wu placed himself at considerable risk to document),
to the killing of prisoners to harvest their organs for transplant
procedures, to cannibalizing aborted fetuses, to religious persecution,
to the quashing of human rights at all levels by the ruthless
communist Chinese government, the Chinese people inhumanely suffer
at the hands of their own government.  Indeed, the only difference
between the Tiananmen Square massacre and the ghastly human 
rights abuses that occur every day in China is that Tiananmen
was witnessed by the public.
<P>
Perhaps because the Tiananmen massacre has been permanently etched
into America's consciousness, the public outcry against Mrs. Clinton's
attendance in Beijing has been strong and swift.  As a result,
the Clinton Administration has been prompted to defend Mrs. Clinton's
attendance by contending that she will be able to:  (1) speak
out against China's human rights violations and (2) advance women's
rights.  However, it is doubtful that the First Lady will be able
to accomplish either of these objectives by participating in this
conference.
<P>
First, while we earnestly hope that Mrs. Clinton will highlight
China's human rights abuses, it is also noteworthy that Geraldine
Ferraro, a Clinton Administration-appointed delegate to the United
Nations conference, requested that the Beijing document's condemnation
of  &quot;trafficking in human organs and tissue&quot; -- a barbaric
practice largely associated with China -- remain bracketed for
removal.  In other words, Ms. Ferraro blocked this language from
being officially incorporated into the document.  That an official
U.S. delegate was unwilling to have the conference document even
<I>mention</I> one of China's most egregious human rights violations
during an unpublicized consultatory meeting makes it that much
more improbable that the First Lady would dare to condemn China's
abuses in the highly publicized setting of Beijing. 
<P>
Furthermore, a great chasm exists between doing something about
human rights abuses and merely talking about them.  A strong stand
by the Clinton Administration to withhold the First Lady's attendance
on the grounds that China abuses women would have shown words
backed by action.  But now the Administration has only words.
 And if the adage is true that actions speak louder than words,
then Mrs. Clinton's words will have little impact since she is
in Beijing delivering them.  Worst of all, her distinguished presence
at the conference confers on China the international spotlight
it desires and the legitimacy it seeks.
<P>
Finally, if the First Lady intends to uphold women's rights, then
she should not be attending the Beijing conference at all.  The
Beijing document's Platform for Action does not represent the
large majority of American women (or the women of any other country,
for that matter) on the central issues of motherhood and the family.
 Rather, it promotes a radical feminist agenda which undermines
the natural family unit and erodes the foundations of marriage
and family life, while upholding abortion and the dissemination
of contraceptives to minors as positive alternatives.
<P>
From the beginning of Harry Wu's imprisonment, the Clinton Administration
has been adamant in its resolve to send a  U.S. delegation to
the Beijing conference.  The U.S. refused to take a firm stand
then.  But with Wu's release, it would have been only a small
price to pay for the U.S. to finally take a stand -- albeit symbolic
-- by having Mrs. Clinton refuse to attend the conference.  That
the Clinton Administration failed to do even that is disturbing.

<title>ADVICE TO BEIJING CONFEREES</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">
<h2>ADVICE TO BEIJING CONFEREES:<br>
GET A PROMISE KEEPER TO<br>
HELP DO DISHES</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>William R. Mattox, Jr.</i></center>
<p>
Forget the Enjoli Woman.  The delegates to the UN's Fourth World
Conference on Women taking place in Beijing, China aren't interested
in proving that they &quot;can bring home the bacon <I>and</I>
fry it up in a pan.&quot;
<P>
According to Grete Berget, who heads the Norwegian delegation,
the conferees are interested instead in finding effective ways
to &quot;get men to share working at home.&quot;
<P>
I've got a little tip for Ms. Berget and other delegates looking
for men willing to help with the vacuuming and the dishes:  go
to church.
<P>
Now, that may sound like strange advice.  And it's probably not
the kind of hint most Beijing delegates would consider helpful.
<P>
But a recent study by sociologist Gary Hansen at the University
of Kentucky found that the men most apt to help their wives with
household chores are orthodox Christians.
<P>
That's right, men who strongly believe the Bible is &quot;God's
word&quot; and &quot;the answer to all important human problems&quot;
spend more time than other men doing household chores like cooking,
cleaning, and dishwashing.
<P>
Lest anyone get the wrong impression, these Christians do not
believe in gender blending.  In fact, Hansen reports they are
more likely than others to support traditional breadwinner-homemaker
arrangements and to believe young children suffer when Mom is
employed outside the home.
<P>
Yet, orthodox Christian men aren't afraid to roll up their sleeves
and help out around the house.  According to Hansen, they devote
more time to household chores than do less-orthodox and non-orthodox
men.  
<P>
That the women who get the most help around the house are married
to men who attend churches that extol the virtues of male leadership
seems rather surprising.  
Surprising, that is, until one considers that the Bible instructs
men to mimic the leadership style of the One who said He came
&quot;not to be served, but to serve.&quot;  And who proved it
by doing things like washing others' dirty feet.
<P>
Challenging men to be &quot;servant leaders&quot; is one of the
main purposes of Promise Keepers, a Christian men's organization
which has hosted a series of stadium-packed conferences this summer
that have attracted more than 600,000 male attendees.  Several
of these gatherings have been picketed by activists from the National
Organization for Women (NOW) -- a fact which David Blankenhorn
of the Institute for American Values finds curious.
<P>
&quot;The more I listen to Promise Keepers' message -- that men
should be faithful to their wives and involved in their children's
lives and willing to express emotion and quick to admit mistakes
-- the more I hear the echoes of those frustrated housewives who
gave 1960s feminism much of its animating spirit,&quot; he says.
<P>
This is not to say that Promise Keepers is singing from one of
Betty Freidan's old song sheets.  But it is to say that their
tune is at least similar enough that 1990s women tired of coming
home from work to loads of laundry ought to at least give a listen.
<P>
Indeed, Hansen's research findings bring to mind the mid-1980s
song by the B-52s in which Kate Pierson expresses longings for
&quot;someone who's <I>heaven sent</I>, someone to help pay rent,
someone to share dreams and wishes, someone to help me do the
dishes.&quot;       
<P>
It is possible that the delegates in Beijing will stumble across
new ways to make men more sensitive to women's needs.  But it
isn't likely.  
<P>
Tensions between the sexes -- and disputes about housework --
date back to, well, Biblical times.  And throughout history, the
only way these tensions and disputes have been eased consistently
is to challenge members of both sexes to lay aside scorekeeping
and serve one another.
<P>
Grete Berget and the other delegates attending the Beijing conference
are right when they say that many men today are failing to serve
their wives.  But if the University of Kentucky study is any indication,
the answer to this problem is less likely to come from the UN
conference in Beijing than from the Promise Keeper rallies sweeping
America. 
<P>
Praise the Lord and pass the Palmolive.

<title>SCHOOL DAYS, SEX DAZE</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">
<h2>SCHOOL DAYS, SEX DAZE</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Robert H. Knight</i></center>
<p>
As little Johnny or Joanie adjust to the reality of another school
year, they might find that it is a little bit tough to concentrate
on academics.
<p>
How, indeed, can children keep their mind on arithmetic when they
are exposed to sex in a big way?  From kindergarten on, many children
are learning the ABC's of sexuality, taught in a &quot;morally
neutral&quot; manner in state-mandated programs.
<p>
Despite two decades of documented failure to reduce the ravages
of teen sex, the effort to sexualize children at younger and younger
ages continues apace.  The rationale used to be &quot;sexual health&quot;
or reproductive safety.  Now, the same bad medicine is being peddled
under the rubric of  &quot;AIDS prevention.&quot;  Each year,
it gets earlier, more graphic, and increasingly incorporates &quot;alternative
lifestyles.&quot;
<p>
Parents are being cut out of the act.  In Falmouth, Massachusetts,
a court ruled recently that schools could pass out condoms even
if parents object.  In school libraries, books like <i>Heather
Has Two Mommies</i> are taking their place alongside Dr. Seuss.
 Parents who object are called &quot;bigots&quot; and &quot;religious
fanatics.&quot;
<p>
Why did much of America's educational establishment buy into the
notion that children should be taught about sex years before puberty?
 Part of the answer can be found in Indiana, at the world-famous
Kinsey Institute.  It was here, in the late 1940s, that Dr. Alfred
C. Kinsey published his famous Kinsey Report, formally known as
<i>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</i>.  As revealed by Dr.
Judith A. Reisman in a 1981 paper, and further explored in the
1990 book <i>Kinsey, Sex and Fraud</i>, by Dr. Reisman, Edward
W. Eichel, Dr. J. Gordon Muir and Dr. John H. Court, the Kinsey
material contains a chapter on child sexuality that has been the
basis for the view that children are sexually viable at all ages.
<p>
Graph tables (Tables 31 and 34) report data that can have been
gathered only during the sexual molestation of children from two months
to 15 years of age with climaxes recorded by the use of a &quot;second
hand or stopwatch.&quot;
<p>
In one instance, a four-year-old boy was said to have had 26 &quot;orgasms&quot;
in a 24-hour period.  Because molestation of children is illegal,
the Kinsey studies have been the only data on child sexuality
to achieve wide usage.
<p>
Efforts to open the Kinsey files on the child sex experiments
have been rebuffed by current director John Bancroft as well as
his predecessors.  How did Kinsey get this data?  Where did the
children come from?  Are their identities known today?  Who committed
these acts?  These questions remain unanswered.
<p>
Incredibly, even as the rest of the Kinsey Report became the touchstone
of the sexual revolution, the child data has largely been ignored
by the popular culture -- even though it may have had the most
far-reaching effect on academic views about child sexuality.
<p>
The Kinsey view of child sexuality, although based on criminal
abuse of children, has been promoted for years through major sex
education institutions to which Kinsey's disciples migrated. 
Taxpayers are being forced to fund the Kinseyan agenda through
federal grants to the Sex Information and Education Council of
the United States (SIECUS), which was founded by Kinsey colleagues
and disciples.
<p>
SIECUS co-founder Mary Calderone, former medical director of Planned
Parenthood, has said that the SIECUS mission is to educate society
&quot;very broadly and deeply with awareness of the vital importance
of infant and childhood sexuality.&quot;
<p>
Current SIECUS President Debra Haffner has envisioned a &quot;national
petting project,&quot; in which youngsters are taught to strip
and masturbate each other and to engage in &quot;outercourse&quot;
as a way to forestall intercourse.  This view was echoed by former
Surgeon General Joycelyn Elders, who on the advice of SIECUS counselors,
advocated teaching children how to masturbate.
<p>
But educators are not the only intended carrier of the Kinsey
gospel.  In its blueprint document, <I>Sex Education 2000</I>,
SIECUS &quot;calls on the national media to present sexuality
as a positive aspect of the total human experience <I>at all stages
of the life cycle</I>&quot; (emphasis mine).
<p>
Apparently, Calvin Klein got the message, judging by its recent
kiddie-porn style ad campaign for jeans.  The print and TV ads
show young teens in various states of undress with camera angles
and settings that evoke classic themes of child pornography. 
Klein's defense of the lascivious commercials was vintage Kinsey/SIECUS.
In a  full-page ad in <I>The New York Times</I>, the designer
called the campaign &quot;positive&quot; because the ads convey
the idea that &quot;young people today...have a real strength
of character and independence.&quot;  Translated: You are great,
kid.  Only <I>you</I> know what is right.  Now strip for the camera.
Then get back to class.  You've still got a lot to learn.
<p>
It is time for the Kinsey Institute to open its file and solve
a 50-year-old cover-up that is still having a profound effect
on our culture.  And it is time to curb the ongoing crusade in
education and popular culture to rob our children of an irreplaceable
treasure -- their innocence.

<title>PARENTAL RIGHTS: WHOSE CHILDREN ARE THEY?</title>
<body>

<h2>PARENTAL RIGHTS:</br>
WHOSE CHILDREN ARE THEY?</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Cathleen Cleaver, Esq.</i></center>
<p>
Congress will soon take up legislation designed to acknowledge
(or restore) the right of parents to direct the upbringing and
education of their children.  Is federal legislation really necessary?
 Consider the following:  This summer, Mr. and Mrs. Waymon Earls
of Toccoa, Georgia were shocked to find a bag of condoms in their
13- and 15-year-old daughters' room.  The girls confessed that
their middle school counselor had helped them get the condoms.
After repeatedly being told that it was none of the parent's business,
a reluctant school superintendent revealed to the Earls that the
counselor had driven the girls during school hours to a health
clinic where they were tested for AIDS and cervical cancer, and
given condoms and prescriptions for birth control pills.  The
school has, to date,  refused to give the Earls the results of
the tests.  &quot;We're simply trying to do what's best for the
students,&quot; said the superintendent.  The Earls have filed
a lawsuit against the school and its officials. Georgia taxpayers
are funding the school's defense, and its attorneys have moved
the case to federal court.
<p>
Education bureaucrats are not the only culprits.  A steady drumbeat
of Child Protective Services tragedies reveals an increasing nonchalance
about the sanctity of the family unit on the part of government
social workers who take children from their homes on little more
than rumor.  This &quot;loot first and ask questions later&quot;
approach reflects the height of arrogance, and does untold damage
to the very souls CPS was designed to protect.  Tragically, however,
there are real cases of intra-family abuse and neglect.  But in
too many such cases, protective government agencies completely
fail to intervene.   That our child protection system needs improvement
is apparent, but no case of under-enforcement can support a blanket
sanction of over-enforcement so obtrusive as to be self-defeating.
<p>
To compound matters, President Clinton earlier this year agreed
to the United Nation's Convention on the Rights of the Child,
which espouses the &quot;new concept&quot; of government &quot;protecting
children from the power of parents.&quot;  There is little doubt that the 
United Nations is out of touch with American ideas.  The U.N.'s Convention on
the Rights of the Child was telling, but the platform document
for its Fourth World Conference on Women in Beijing -- with its
confusion about gender and hostility toward motherhood and natural
families -- cinches the case.  The UN has been virtually co-opted
by social experimentalists who can test theories in an ostensibly
reputable body where physical and conceptual &quot;foreign-ness&quot;
makes for reduced scrutiny and no real accountability.  Paternal
deconstruction proponents responsible for the Convention on the
Rights of the Child have accomplished through the U.N. what they
could not through the legislative process.
<p>
Senator Charles Grassley and Congressman Steve Largent have introduced
the Parental Rights and Responsibilities Act of 1995.  The Act
establishes the fundamental right of parents to direct and provide
for the education and religious teaching of their children, and
also addresses health care decisions and reasonable corporal discipline.
 Importantly, the Act allows the government to intervene when
it has a compelling interest to do so, and has specific allowances
for child abuse and neglect.  
<p>
The notion that government should protect children from the power
of parents is opposed by the vast majority of Americans.  In February
of this year, Luntz Research asked registered voters nationwide:
&quot;Who do you feel should be primarily responsible for the
upbringing and education of children -- parents or the government?&quot;
 Voters favored parents by a landslide 94%.
<p>
The Earls will continue to fight for the right to be parents,
and pro-family groups will rally around the much-needed Parental
Rights Act.  Stable, intact families rearing children with both
love and direction have never been in shorter supply or more desperately
needed.  The time has come to put a stop to efforts to replace
Mom and Dad with Big Brother.

<title>STAY MARRIED, GO TO CHURCH, LIVE LONGER. NO SWEAT.</title>

<h2>STAY MARRIED,<br>
GO TO CHURCH,<br>
LIVE LONGER. NO SWEAT.</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<p>
If you want to live longer, lose weight.  So says a widely-publicized
study recently published in the <I>New England Journal of Medicine</I>.
<p>
But there's actually another, more effective way to help increase
your own, your spouse's, and your <I>children's</I> longevity,
without the sweat or the bland food.  It's staying married.
<p>
According to a 70-year prospective study recently reported in
the <I>American Journal of Public Health</I> and the <I>American
Psychologist</I>, either the breakup of one's own marriage or
the divorce of one's parents reduced the average life span of
a group of 1,500 gifted children studied throughout their lifetimes.
<p>
That's right.  Divorce may be hazardous to your health.  Men and
women who at some point in time went through a divorce, even if
they remarried, had a 40 percent greater risk of premature death
than those who were steadily married.  Those who did not remarry
fared even worse.  Men who remained divorced or separated were
120 percent more likely to face earlier death.  Among women, the
risk jumped 80 percent.
<p>
Dr. David B. Larson, president of the National Institute for Healthcare
Research (NIHR) in Rockville, MD, recently released an extensive
research report that further details the impact of divorce on
health.  Among other findings, Dr. Larson found that divorced
people were more likely to be afflicted with terminal cancer,
three times more likely to commit suicide, and among men, twice
as likely to die prematurely from cardiovascular disease than
their married counterparts.  In fact, divorced men who didn't
smoke had only a slightly lower risk of dying from cancer than
married men who smoked a pack of cigarettes a day.
<p>
While the threat of premature mortality might not weigh heavily
in the minds of couples who are seeking a divorce, the startling news
that their divorce might shorten the lives of their <I>children</I>
may give reason for pause.  The <I>American Journal of Public
Health</I> study found that when parental divorce occurred before
the children reached age 21, the children's risk of mortality
increased by 44 percent.  Moreover, children whose parents divorced
were more likely to experience marital breakup themselves.  But
even after controlling for the dissolution of one's own marriage,
parental divorce during one's childhood was still a significant
predictor of premature mortality.  Perhaps the once oft-quoted
advice of staying together &quot;for the children's sake&quot;
should be heeded more seriously.
<p>
Interestingly, the negative outcomes associated with growing up
in a broken home can be offset by religious faith.  Dr. Larson
of NIHR found that religious commitment not only decreases the
likelihood of divorce, but it also predicts greater satisfaction
in marriage.  Furthermore, several other studies have confirmed
the positive relationship between religious commitment and increased
longevity.
<p>
A study of an elderly population published in the <I>American
Journal of Epidemiology</I> found that the less religious had
mortality levels twice as high as those of the more religious
-- even after controlling for age, marital status, education,
race, gender, the person's health, and previous hospitalizations.
 Moreover, according to a 10-year follow-up of 2,700 persons in
another epidemiological health study, increased church attendance
was the only social factor that effectively decreased mortality
rates in women.
<p>
While divorce is clearly a major public health issue, deterring
divorce is admittedly a hard thing to do.  But it's far from impossible.
 After all, weight loss is a hard sell, too.  And yet, Americans
everywhere will put down their Big Macs, call Weight Watchers,
and join a health club so that they can lose weight and live longer.
<p>
Who knows?  A whole new market to promote marriage might burgeon.
 TV shows could portray more married couples and fewer divorces;
marriage counselors could advertise themselves as marriage <I>and</I>
life savers; warning labels could even be adhered to marriage
certificates reading, &quot;Breaking this covenant may be hazardous
to your health.&quot;  If nothing else, these findings do give
new meaning to the term &quot;life-long&quot; marriage.

<title>EDUCATION DEBATE NEEDS TO FOCUS ON THE FAMILY</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">
<h2>EDUCATION DEBATE NEEDS TO<br>
FOCUS ON THE FAMILY</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>William R. Mattox, Jr.</i></center>
<p>
The U.S. Department of Education recently launched a series of
events to encourage greater family and community involvement in
learning.  While it is surely odd for an Administration that opposes
parental choice in education to lead such an effort, this public
relations blitz -- or at least the research that undergirds it
-- truly deserves wide attention.
<p>
Families exert far more influence over their children's intellectual
development than is commonly realized.  In fact, more than three
decades of research shows that families have greater influence
over a child's academic performance than any other factor -- including
schools.
<p>
In the mid-1960s, University of Chicago sociologist James Coleman
led a major research study which found a &quot;powerful relation
of the child's own family background characteristics to his achievement,
a relation stronger than that of any school factors.&quot;  Coleman's
research spawned a number of studies replicating his work and
building upon it.  These studies consistently confirmed Coleman's
chief finding that families exert considerable influence over
student achievement.
<p>
What is especially important about this body of research is that
it consistently shows that what families <I>do</I> really matters.
 That is, differences in student learning are not determined simply
by the quality of one's gene pool or by which side of the tracks
one lives on.  Instead, differences stem significantly from the
values, habits, and relational dynamics at work within the household.
<p>
Take, for example, family meals together.  While some might consider
this a rather trivial family ritual, several studies have found
the frequency of family meals together to be a strong predictor
of student test scores.  In explaining this high positive correlation,
 Chester Finn of the Hudson Institute says that consistent mealtimes
give parents regular opportunities to ask questions about what
kids are doing in school.  Mealtimes also give 
parents regular opportunities to broaden children's educational
horizons.  For example, Theodore Roosevelt's interest in public
affairs is said to have been cultivated by the rich dinnertime
discussions his family regularly enjoyed when he was a boy.
<p>
Just as family interactions around the dinner table pay surprising
dividends, the number and variety of learning tools (books, tapes,
puzzles, encyclopedias, computers, and the like) in the home have
a profound effect on children's learning, especially when these
materials are used in direct parent-child interaction.  For example,
a 1985 report from the National Academy of Education found that
the single most important activity for building the knowledge
required for eventual success in reading is reading aloud to children.
 Moreover, a 1992 study at the City University of New York found
that average IQ scores of low-income preschoolers are boosted
by nearly seven percentage points for each day of the week that
their mother reads to them.
<p>
The benefits of parent-child verbal interaction can also be seen
in recent research showing preschoolers placed in full-time day
care settings often lag behind their home-reared peers in language
development.  What is the primary reason for the difference? Young
children at home spend much of their day interacting verbally
with people (particularly Mom) whose language skills are more
advanced, whereas kids in day care spend most of their day interacting
verbally with peers whose language skills are no more developed
than their own.
<p>
Given the extraordinary influence families have over their children's
learning, it is curious that almost all public discussion about
improving education in this country centers around school-based
reforms of one kind or another.  While no one would deny many
school-based reforms are needed, Seattle public schoolteacher
David Guterson believes the promise of such reforms is often overblown.
 &quot;We should think clearly about the problems of schools and
ask ourselves why every attempt to correct them seems doomed to
fail,&quot; Guterson writes.  &quot;We should recognize that schools
will never solve the bedrock problems of education.&quot;  
<p>
Only families can.  Only families will.
<p>
Unless and until our education debate begins to focus on the family,
significantly improving student performance in America is likely
to remain an elusive goal.

<title>REINSTATE THE FAMILY CAP IN CONFERENCE</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">
<h2>REINSTATE THE FAMILY CAP<br>
IN CONFERENCE</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Gary L. Bauer</i></center>
<p>
As the conference committee convenes to resolve differences between
the House and Senate welfare bills, the defining issue will be
the family cap.
<p>
A modest first step, if passed by the Congress, the cap would
simply deny a federally-funded increase in the cash benefits to
mothers who bear additional children while on welfare.  A federally-imposed
cap places no restriction on Medicaid, food stamps, and housing
-- or the use of state funds.  States are fully free to fund additional
cash benefits with state money.  Indeed, states are free to use
federal block grant money to fund vouchers for goods and services,
just so long as they freeze the dollar amount of the AFDC check.
 This &quot;restriction&quot; is scant in proportion to the scale
of devastation wrought by illegitimacy's open-ended draw on the
Treasury.
<p>
In many instances, added cash benefits have reduced the birth
father to no more than a passing stranger, and marriage is teetering
on the brink of anachronism in communities with a high concentration
of welfare recipients.  To the extent that the state provides
ready alternatives, marriage, work, and self-sufficiency will
inevitably seem less hallowed, less than necessary.
<p>
The purpose of the family cap is not to reduce births per se,
but to restore a sense of personal responsibility by insisting
that families on welfare live by the same values and confront
exactly the same choices as the general population.  Lowering
our expectations of a woman on welfare and the father of her child
is no different from lowering our estimation of their capability
-- implying that they are a different, less human sort than the
rest of us who can and do live by the rules.
<p>
Government policy that dumbs down the standards for welfare recipients
so that &quot;measuring up&quot; no longer has any content, or
makes any economic sense, is unjust.  Women on welfare should
have equal opportunity to follow the playbook that for centuries
has been the surest guarantor of human happiness.  What Edmund
Burke wrote long ago is truer today: &quot;We know that we have
made no discoveries, and we think that no discoveries are to be
made, in morality.&quot;  Yet, we perpetuate a welfare system that makes it 
harder for men and women to pursue virtuous living.
<p>
The argument for the family cap rests not on value premises alone,
but on certain assumptions about human nature and social causation
that are empirically verifiable.  And the most recent data from
New Jersey's experiment with the family cap provides evidence
that proponents of the cap are indeed correct in their assumptions.
<p>
The formal evaluation study at Rutgers University has found no
significant difference in the rate of births to women in the 
&quot;experimental&quot; group, who are subject to the restriction on 
additional cash benefits, and women in the &quot;control&quot; group, who 
are exempt from the cash limitation.
<p>
Contrary to press reports, the null difference between the experimental
and control birth rates does NOT imply that the cap has had no
impact on births to welfare mothers.  The correct explanation
for the null difference is that births dropped within both groups
after the new policy took effect.  The family cap, in other words,
has had an even larger and more dramatic impact on births than
expected.
<p>
The most plausible explanation for the cap's success is that the
change in policy sent a clear moral signal that was at least as
important an aspect of the policy as the actual restriction on
cash benefits.  Public discussion of the ideas and values motivating
the law reached women in both the &quot;treatment&quot; and &quot;control&quot;
groups, thus triggering the observed decline in births.
<p>
Critics of the cap may question whether a public relations campaign
promoting personal responsibility could be sufficiently forceful
to obviate the need for changes in current welfare policy.  Those
critics forget that laws are indeed moral signaling devices, that
policies cannot belie principles, and that governments cannot
instill a sense of responsibility <I>and </I>provide material
support for the alternative at the same time.  A public relations
campaign is not sufficient precisely because welfare obviates
the need for personal responsibility.
<p>
If the family cap derives its power from a larger cultural context,
publicizing the moral reasoning behind the change in law, clearly
all institutions in the community must redouble their efforts
to send strong, unequivocal messages advocating right living.
 Perhaps the most compelling argument for the cap is that it is
a symbolic first attempt to begin scaling back the government
programs that have eroded the strength of the character-forming
institutions -- the families, schools, and churches -- by negating
their functions.
<p>
Conferees who vote against the cap will squander a golden opportunity
to begin replenishing our nation's moral capital, one heart at
a time.

<title>BAN PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTIONS</title>
<body>

<h2>BAN PARTIAL-BIRTH ABORTIONS</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<p>
It isn't often that congressmen and senators have the opportunity
to vote on something as important as preserving human life.  But
those in the House of Representatives will have such an opportunity
during the first week in November, and those in the Senate may
have the opportunity shortly thereafter.
<p>
Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fla.) has introduced H.R. 1833, which would
ban partial-birth abortions.  The companion bill, S. 939, has
been introduced by Sen. Bob Smith (R-N.H.).  This important bill
should gain support from people across the political spectrum
because the bill helps to protect innocent human life from being
exterminated outside the womb.  Moreover, because the bill focuses
on the partial-birth abortion procedure, it educates both the
Congress and the public about the reality of the abortion act.
<p>
Rep. Canady's bill already has more than 150 cosponsors on both
sides of the aisle.  (The Senate bill has six.)  The House Judiciary
Committee passed H.R. 1833 overwhelmingly in July, and even the
12-member American Medical Association's legislative council voted
<I>unanimously</I> to <I>endorse</I> the Partial-Birth Abortion
Ban Act.  When asked about the council's decision, one legislative
council representative called the procedure &quot;basically repulsive,&quot;
saying that it wasn't a &quot;recognized medical technique.&quot;
<p>
...And it isn't, or at least it shouldn't be.
<p>
First of all, partial-birth abortions involve aborting partially-delivered
babies from four and a half months into the pregnancy up to even
the <I>ninth month</I>.  The procedure consists of  partially
delivering the live baby feet first so that all but the head is
outside the mother's womb.  The head remains in the uterus while
the abortionist kills the baby by stabbing surgical scissors into
the base of its head, then suctioning out the brain by a small
tube, and then completing the delivery of the now-dead baby. 
The legislation makes it a crime to perform this procedure except
to save the mother's life.  A woman undergoing the abortion would
not be penalized and could not sue the abortionist, but the abortionist
could be punished  for up to two years in prison and/or fined.
<p>
Ohio Registered Nurse Brenda Pratt Shafer, who has assisted in
three partial-birth abortions, describes the process this way:
<p>
&quot;Dr. Haskell brought the ultrasound in and hooked it up so
that he could see the baby. On the ultrasound screen, I could see the heart 
beating. I asked Dr. Haskell, and he told me that, 'Yes, that is the heartbeat.'
 As Dr. Haskell watched the baby on the ultrasound screen, he
went in with forceps and grabbed the baby's legs and brought them
down into the birth canal.  Then he delivered the body and the
arms, all the way up to the neck.  At this point, only the baby's
head was still inside.  The baby's body was moving.  His little
fingers were clasping together.  He was kicking his feet.  All
the while his little head was still stuck inside.  Dr. Haskell
took a pair of scissors and inserted them into the back of the
baby's head.  Then he opened the scissors up.  Then he stuck the
high-powered suction tube into the hole and sucked the baby's
brains out.  I almost threw up as I watched him do these things....&quot;
<p>
&quot;I never realized how perfect these babies really are at
this point.  When you hear the word 'fetus,' I think a lot of
people think, as I did, of just a blob of cells, or a mass or
something.  It was very revealing to me.  I don't think about
abortion the same way anymore.&quot;
<p>
According to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, the research arm of
Planned Parenthood, approximately 13,000 abortions every year
occur after the 20th week of pregnancy (four and a half months).
 While it is not known how many of these are partial-birth abortions,
two abortionists, including Dr. Haskell, have said publicly in
different interviews that they have performed 3,000 &quot;late
term&quot; abortions, including the partial-birth procedure, between
the two of them.  Rep. Canady's bill is a first step to preventing
the horror of late-term abortions.
<p>
Public opinion polls show that an overwhelming majority reject
late-term abortions.  Yet, the Supreme Court has never dealt with
the issue of a &quot;partially-born&quot; child.  The Partial-Birth
Abortion Ban Act will rightly outlaw the most barbaric of the
late-term abortion procedures.
<p>
Proponents of abortion will argue that all abortions are needed
in cases of &quot;health of the mother.&quot;  This reasoning
is flawed because typically, courts have defined &quot;health
of the mother&quot; clauses very broadly to encompass &quot;all
factors -- physical, emotional, psychological, familial, and the
woman's age -- relevant to the well-being of the patient.&quot;
(<I>Doe v. Bolton</I>, 410 U.S.C. at 192 (1973), emphasis added.)
In fact, of the many reasons why a mother would elect to abort
her unborn child (i.e., parental disapproval, physical inconvenience,
emotional distress), none would fall outside the realm of this
&quot;exception.&quot;
<p>
Similarly, the case is often made for abortions that are &quot;medically
necessary.&quot;  However, this is equivalent to abortion on demand.
William Hamilton, vice president of the Planned Parenthood Federation
of America, told Knight-Ridder Newspapers that &quot;medically
necessary&quot; means &quot;anything a doctor and a woman construe
to be in her best interest, whether prenatal care or abortion.&quot;
Judith Feder, a Clinton Administration health official, stated
that &quot;the decision of the woman and the physician&quot; determines
whether a service can be considered &quot;medically necessary.&quot;
<p>
This modest legislation provides a means for a civil society to
register its objections by banning this unwarranted act of violence
against a helpless member of our human family.

<title>NEW WELFARE POLL SHOWS STRONG SUPPORT FOR COMBATTING 
ILLEGITIMACY</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">
<h2>NEW WELFARE POLL SHOWS<br>
STRONG SUPPORT FOR<br>
COMBATTING ILLEGITIMACY</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Gary L. Bauer</i></center>
<p>
Opposition runs strong and deep to &quot;increasing a welfare
mother's monthly welfare check if she has another child out of
wedlock,&quot; according to a new national poll commissioned by
the Family Research Council.
<p>
Two-thirds (66 percent) of the 1,000 Americans surveyed said they
&quot;strongly&quot; oppose such increases.  Another 18 percent
said they &quot;somewhat&quot; oppose welfare benefit increases
for illegitimacy.  Only 13 percent said these increases were justified.
<p>
These findings should allay any doubts Congressional Republicans
may have about whether the public supports their &quot;family
cap&quot; proposal to cease welfare benefit increases when women
bear additional children out of wedlock.  The &quot;family cap&quot;
is a central feature of the welfare reform legislation House and
Senate GOP leaders will be sending soon to the President.
<p>
Interestingly, support for the family cap among rank-and-file
pro-lifers is at least as strong as support from other Americans.
 Among those who &quot;strongly&quot; favor prohibitions against
abortion, 70 percent &quot;strongly&quot; support the family cap,
and another 16 percent &quot;somewhat&quot; support such an approach.
 (Some pro-life leaders have expressed concern that the &quot;family
cap&quot; might increase abortions, while others have argued that
curbing out-of-wedlock pregnancy will lower the number of abortions
long term since most abortions are to unmarried women.)
<p>
The FRC poll also found that Americans are more hopeful about
efforts to combat illegitimacy than about &quot;workfare&quot;
strategies.
<p>
By a margin of roughly two-to-one (64 percent to 33 percent),
Americans say &quot;getting young people to delay having children
until they are able to support themselves and a family&quot; is a more 
attainable goal than &quot;getting single mothers with few job skills into 
jobs that will pay them enough to support themselves and their children.&quot;
<p>
This does not mean Americans oppose workfare.  In fact, fully
90 percent say welfare recipients should have to work for their
benefits.
<p>
But the poll results do suggest that Americans expect policymakers
to give at least as much attention to a preventative, anti-illegitimacy
strategy as they do to a remedial, workfare strategy.
<p>
And should there not be enough &quot;workfare&quot; jobs to go
around, most Americans believe welfare mothers of preschool children
should be permitted to go to the back of the line.
<p>
Eighty-two percent say preschool moms should be the &quot;last&quot;
group required to work for benefits.  Most say &quot;mothers of
school-aged children&quot; and (especially) &quot;fathers of dependent
children&quot; should have to meet work requirements first.
<p>
These findings suggest that significant increases in day care
spending are not needed to complement &quot;workfare&quot; requirements,
since neither House would require states to provide jobs for all
welfare recipients.
<p>
The FRC poll was conducted in mid-October by Voter/Consumer Research,
a research firm based in Bethesda, Maryland.  The poll surveyed
1,000 randomly-selected Americans.  It has a margin for error
of plus or minus three percent.

<title>ARE TEXAS' ILLEGITIMACY NUMBERS LEGITIMATE?</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">
<p>
<h2>ARE TEXAS' ILLEGITIMACY NUMBERS LEGITIMATE?</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>William R. Mattox, Jr.</i></center>
<p>
As the welfare reform debate turns increasingly to the states,
a number of folks interested in finding effective ways to combat
illegitimacy have been intrigued by something going on deep in
the heart of Texas.  Apparently, when it comes to having babies,
women seldom go it alone in the Lone Star State.
<p>
Whereas nearly one in three babies (31 percent) nationally is
born to a single mother, the most recent data available from the
National Center for Health Statistics show that roughly one in
six Texas tots (17 percent) is born out of wedlock.  Only Utah
(15 percent) has a lower ratio of non-marital to marital births.
<p>
What is remarkable -- and somewhat curious -- about the Lone Star
State's relatively low illegitimacy ratio is that it runs counter
to nearly every major national trend.  Generally, illegitimacy
tends to be higher in states with populations that are disproportionately
young, poor, or black -- all of which are true of Texas.
<p>
Indeed, New Mexico, Louisiana, Mississippi, and the District of
Columbia have the nation's highest illegitimacy ratios, while
Idaho, New Hampshire, and North Dakota follow Utah and Texas in
the Top Five for low illegitimacy.
<p>
So what explains the Lone Star State's apparent success?  Why
is Texas the only state along America's southern border that has
an illegitimacy ratio below the national average?
<p>
No one knows for sure.  But those hoping that Texas has found
some magic bullet for dramatically reducing our nation's serious
illegitimacy problem are apt to be disappointed.
<p>
Here's why:  NCHS shows that while Texas has a non-marital birth
rate well below the national average, it also has a teen pregnancy
rate well above the national average.  In fact, 45 states have a lower teen
pregnancy rate than Texas.  Thus, the Lone Star State's low illegitimacy
ratio apparently is not due to the success of its teen pregnancy
prevention programs.  Nor is it apparently attributable to rampant
abortion, since the abortion rate in Texas is below the national
average.
<p>
How, then, does one explain the fact that the Lone Star State
simultaneously has one of the highest teen pregnancy rates in
the country and one of the lowest illegitimacy ratios?  Here are
three possible explanations:
<p>
<b>1. The Shotgun Marriage Theory</b>. It used to be that girls
who got pregnant out of wedlock would, with the aid of their enraged
fathers, convince their boyfriends to marry them prior to the
arrival of their child.  Thus, many out-of-wedlock pregnancies
ended up being in-wedlock births.
<p>
In recent years, of course, shotgun marriages have fallen out
of fashion.  And while NCHS does not have data comparing the age
of first marriage for Texas women to that of women from other
states, there is little reason to believe shotgun marriages are
making a major comeback in Texas -- even though the Lone Star
State does have a disproportionate number of shotgun owners.
<p>
<b>2. The Chevy Suburban Theory</b>.  Not only does Texas have
more shotgun owners than other states, but it also has more of
those gas-guzzling, road-hogging Chevy Suburbans that some like
to call &quot;Texas Station Wagons.&quot;  Why is this important?
 Because nine-passenger Chevy Suburbans are the ultimate Big Family
Car for married couples who have lots of children -- and when
marrieds have lots of children, the ratio of non-marital to marital
births is lowered.
<p>
Indeed, the reason Utah has the lowest illegitimacy ratio in the
country is not just because its highly-Mormon unmarried population
is less likely to engage in the kind of hanky-panky that leads
to early pregnancy.  It is also because its highly-Mormon married
population is very reproductive by today's standards.
<p>
The most recent stats from the Census Bureau show that Texas women
are bearing children at a rate well below that of Utah women.
 But these stats are several years old, so it is at least conceivable
that Texas couples have recently started reproducing like rabbits
to fill their Suburbans.  It is more likely, of course, that many
Texas families are driving those gas-guzzling Suburbans (instead
of more practical seven-passenger minivans) because a good Texan
would never own a &quot;mini&quot; anything.
<p>
<b>3. The Texans Tell Tall Tales Theory</b>.  Another possibility
is that Texas' illegitimacy numbers are illegitimate -- that the
Lone Star State's data reflect that time-tested Texas tendency
to tell tall tales.  Sad to say, one need not hail from the &quot;Show
Me State&quot; (Missouri) to be skeptical about the veracity of
Texas' numbers.  The reason?  NCHS reports that Texas is one of
six states that does not require a mother's marital status to
be identified on her child's birth certificate.
<p>
Thus, NCHS says the illegitimacy numbers Texas reports to NCHS
are &quot;inferred.&quot;  This is a fancy way of saying the numbers
are made up.  They are educated guesses, to be sure.  By educated
people no doubt.  But they are, in the end, still guesses.
<p>
Curiously, Texas leaped from 23rd in the nation in low teen illegitimacy
in 1989 to 9th nationally in 1990 -- the very year Texas made
it easier for births to be &quot;inferred&quot; as marital.  Thus,
Texas' dramatic &quot;improvement&quot; in illegitimacy in recent
years is almost surely due to the fact that Texas officials have
been &quot;inferring&quot; lots of births incorrectly.
<p>
To their credit, some straight-shooters at the Texas Bureau of
Vital Statistics recently changed the procedure for reporting
birth information so that a mother's marital status must be identified.
 The effects of this change won't be reported by NCHS until next
spring, but preliminary indications are that Texas' illegitimacy
ratio will climb to about 29 percent.
<p>
That is significantly higher than the Lone Star State's current
ratio, but it is still lower than the national average -- and
lower than all of its neighbors.
<p>
Which is to say Texas probably doesn't have a magic bullet in
its fight against illegitimacy, but it does have an illegitimacy
ratio just good enough to give Texans reason to do what Texans
do best: boast.

<title>NATIONAL SURVEY FINDS THAT BLACKS FAVOR GETTING TOUGH ON 
CRIMINALS</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/perspective/perspective.gif">
<h2>NATIONAL SURVEY FINDS THAT<br>
BLACKS FAVOR GETTING<br>
TOUGH ON CRIMINALS</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>
<p>
Whites often blame blacks for the crime problem, and some believe
blacks have no interest in getting tough on criminals.  But new
evidence shows that the black community is very interested in
fighting crime.  After all, they are the most frequent  crime
victims, their sons go to jail more often, and they suffer most
from drug-related crime.
<p>
A new national poll sponsored by the Family Research Council found
that blacks favor get-tough policies on crime, including forcing
prisoners to work, requiring them to pay restitution, and ensuring
they are drug-free before release.
<p>
<center><h3>BENEFITS OF WORK FOR PRISONERS</h3></center>
<p>
More than eight in 10 black Americans told Voter/Consumer Research
(a Maryland-based national pollster commissioned by FRC to do
this study) that they favor requiring convicted criminals to work
while serving their sentences.  They share the commonly held view
that prison should be punishment and not a health resort for body
building.
<p>
Apparently, black citizens sense that requiring work while in
jail improves the chances that some inmates will turn away from
crime once released.
<p>
Although most Americans favor requiring criminals to work, only
9 percent of America's inmates are employed while serving time
and few inmates actually do obtain jobs.  Nonetheless, the Federal
Bureau of Prisons found that inmates who enrolled in industrial
work were substantially less likely to cause disciplinary problems in 
prison or be rearrested after release.  Similarly, research by Anne 
Piehl of Harvard University found that prisoners enrolled in high school 
classes were 10 percent less likely to be rearrested four years after
their release than those who did not participate.
<p>
<center><h3>BENEFITS FOR VICTIMS</h3></center>
<p>
The FRC survey also found that more than three out of every four
black Americans favor requiring convicted criminals to pay their
victims and their victims' families financial compensation for
the pain, suffering and economic hardship they caused.  Those
most apt to support restitution are single women and divorced
and single parents.
<p>
The women who favor restitution are in one of the most victimized
groups in America.  According to the Justice Department, the violence
victimization rates for single and divorced women are four times
greater than for married women.  Many black females find themselves
very vulnerable to crime and understandably are outspoken about
victim restitution.
<p>
But for inmates, earning money to make restitution payments to
victims can be difficult.  More might be willing to work, but
many jurisdictions have laws that do not permit prison factories
to make products that compete with the private sector.   Understandably,
law-abiding citizens often object to giving up jobs so felons
can be employed.   Some prison systems have found a way, however.
<p>
In Lockhart, Texas, 138 inmates make computer circuit boards,
eyeglasses and air conditioners.  Prisoners put their names on
waiting lists to get jobs and agree to have most of their wages
deducted to help offset the $21,000 per year cost of their incarceration
as well as to support a victims compensation fund.
<p>
Although recovering some of the billions spent on prisons is a
worthy objective, most taxpayers are not willing to sacrifice
public safety to save money.  There are alternatives to incarceration
for non-violent offenders, however.
<p>
In 1992, one-third of new prison inmates were drug offenders.
 All violent drug criminals belong behind bars.  But many were
non-violent, low level drug offenders.  For them, punishment could
include public service with frequent drug testing to ensure they
stay drug-free.  This would save prison space for the truly violent
criminals and save taxpayer dollars.
<p>
<center><h3>DRUG-TESTING MAKES SENSE</h3></center>
<p>
Black Americans know that drug abuse and crime are linked.  FRC's
survey found that 85 percent of blacks favor drug testing to insure that 
a criminal is drug-free prior to release.  In addition, more than three of 
every four blacks oppose drug legalization.
<p>
The Justice Department found that half of all state prison inmates
have used cocaine and half used some drugs during the month prior
to their current offense.  Thirty-one percent of inmates admitted
they were using drugs at the time of the offense.  Black and white
inmates are equally likely to have used a drug in the month before
their current offense.
<p>
The Justice Department's 1994 crime &quot;Sourcebook&quot; profiles
a study that drug tested arrestees in 23 cities.  Based on voluntary
and anonymous urine samples and interviews, the study found that
81 percent of men arrested in Chicago and 83 percent of women
in Manhattan, New York tested positive for drugs.  The lowest
numbers, although still remarkable, were found in Omaha, Nebraska
(54 percent) and San Antonio, Texas (42 percent).
<p>
Black Americans want law enforcement agencies to wage the drug
war vigorously and curb crime.  Lawmakers must heed the message
of the FRC's recent survey.  Laws that mandate work serve to both
punish and save criminals; restitution helps crime victims; requiring
drug-testing reduces the likelihood of criminals returning to
prey on more victims.

<title>SEX-TROUBLED NAVY SHOULD DEEP-SIX PORNOGRAPHY SALES</title>

<h2>SEX-TROUBLED NAVY SHOULD<br>
DEEP-SIX PORNOGRAPHY SALES</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Lieutenant Colonel Robert L. Maginnis (U.S.A., Ret.)</i></center>
<p>
In the wake of the rape of a 12-year-old girl in Okinawa by a
U.S. sailor and two Marines and the groping of a female sailor
by a drunken chief petty officer on a commercial flight, Admiral
Jeremy Boorda, the Chief of Naval Operations, has called for A
Day of Introspection for service men and women to consider the
issue of sexual harassment.
<p>
Whether &quot;introspection&quot; can help is anyone's guess,
but if our nation's military leaders are really serious about
combatting improper sexual activity by service personnel, they
will move quickly to stop the save of sexually explicit materials
on military bases.
<p>
Believe it or not, the federal government is the country's largest
distributor of pornographic materials.  By selling sex magazines
to U.S. Armed Forces through the military exchange system, the
government spreads smut tax-free and at discount prices.
<p>
Most Americans (51 percent) favor banning the sale of pornographic
materials on military bases, according to a new national survey
conducted for the Family Research Council by Voter/Consumer Research,
a Maryland-based pollster.  Not suprisingly, support for this
measure is particularly high among women.
<p>
To date, the Navy's solution to the problem of sexual harassment
and misconduct has been both misguided and ineffective.  The positive
effects of sexual harassment classes have been more than offset
by assigning more women to the close quarters environments of
naval aviation and combat ships.
<p>
Evidence of this is the recent deployment of the <I>USS Eisenhower</I>,
to the Mediterranean for six months.  The crew included 415 women,
a large number of whom became pregnant, engaged in extramarital affairs,
and returned to publicize incidents of sexual misconduct.  Experienced
sailors were not surprised by the <I>Eisenhower</I> results. 
Any skipper of a coed ship can relate incidents of fraternization,
granting of favors for sex, on-board pregnancies, etc. 
<p>
Navy regulations already prohibit the sale of materials that &quot;inspire
or encourage lust, particularly in the young, by exploiting indecent
or undue exposure, exaggerating sexual characteristics of male
or female figures, or by showing suggestive obvious passionate
actions or poses.&quot; 
<p>
The Navy's hesitancy to dump this trash may be because commanders
lack the courage to enforce the regulations or fear First Amendment
challenges.   At least one ship commander ignored such possible
constraints and did the right thing.
<p>
The captain of the <I>USS America</I> received a complaint about
a magazine sold in his ship's store.  The April, 1984 issue of
<I>Hustler</I> magazine included graphic pictures of a woman engaging
in a sex act with a crucifix.  The ship's supply officer was ordered
to deep-six the magazine.
<p>
In many cases, commanders may not understand the connection between
sexually explicit material and sexual misconduct.  They can't
&quot;connect the dots.&quot;
<p>
Pornographic material, like alcohol, is a powerful stimulant.
 Beginning with &quot;soft&quot; pornography sold in Navy stores,
the desire for sexually explicit material grows to require more
explicit, more deviant images in order to reach the previous level
of sexual arousal.  Gradually, the addict becomes desensitized
even to the more explicit material and  may act out sexual fantasies
inspired by the material.  Such activities may include promiscuity,
exhibitionism, group sex, voyeurism, sex with children, rape,
sadism or homosexuality.
<p>
Army exchanges sell this trash, too. <i>Hustler,</i> one of the
more perverse of the &quot;mainstream&quot; magazines,  is sold
openly at Fort Bragg, North Carolina, where military personnel
find one of the largest government-sponsored displays of erotic
material in the world.
<p>
Submariners at Groton, Connecticut can also choose from a wide
selection of pornography.  Even in Washington, D.C., the Pentagon
Book Store sells nine &quot;soft-porn&quot; magazines and two
sexually explicit homosexual magazines, the latter belying DOD's
commitment to &quot;Don't Ask, Don't Tell.&quot;
<p>
Under current policy, military exchange managers select magazines
based on sales volume, customer preferences, and, in the case
of pornographic material, whether it fits the definition of &quot;obscenity&quot;
outlined in the 1973 Supreme Court case <i>Miller vs. California</i>.
<p>
The <I>Miller</I> criteria were written to protect freedom of
speech and expression but there are kinds of speech and expression
not protected by the Constitution. These include, among others,
slander, libel, perjury, false advertising, conspiracy, yelling
&quot;fire&quot; in a crowded theater, copyright violations and
child pornography.
<p>
Navy regulations allow commanders to ban materials that could
incite sexual harassment in the workplace.  According to the Navy,
the workplace is &quot;an expansive term for military members
and may include conduct on or off duty, 24 hours a day.&quot;
 This includes off-duty in an off-base military community, on
commercial airplanes, at aviation conventions and on the high
seas.
<p>
Marine commanders at Camp Lejeune applied this concept of  &quot;off
duty&quot; to a local purveyor of pornography.  Eugene's Arcade
was placed off limits to military personnel. The shop's owner,
Eugene Enslin, filed a suit alleging violation of his constitutional
rights of free speech.  U.S. District Court Judge W. Earl Britt
dismissed the lawsuit, concluding that, &quot;A military commander
has an overriding duty to safeguard the morals, welfare and discipline
of his men.&quot;
<p>
A 1992 Department of the Navy memo states: &quot;A commanding
officer has broad responsibility to ensure the effective and efficient
operation of his/her command... [and] has authority to regulate
or ban activities that may be detrimental ... to good order, discipline,
and morale among command personnel.&quot; It is clear that commanding
officers may restrict base exchanges from selling materials that
promote illicit or offensive behavior.
<p>
In a 1992 letter to the Navy's Assistant Secretary for Manpower
and Reserve Affairs, the Navy Exchange Commander wrote: &quot;I
believe strongly that our Navy...should establish a Navy-wide
policy which states that material inconsistent with its core values,
which is demeaning to men or women of our Navy and which is contrary
to good order and discipline, will not be sold in exchanges.&quot;
<p>
In a 1992 memo to the Chief of Naval Operations, Captain P. W.
Kelley, a Navy lawyer, stated: &quot;In view of the mission of
the exchange system... adult periodicals can be excluded from
exchange shelves.&quot;
<p>
Several years ago, Americans learned that topless and bottomless
&quot;performers,&quot; male and female, were appearing under
military auspices at U.S. military bases in the Pacific.  When
these incidents were publicized, the Navy banned the sex shows.
 It argued, &quot;The issue of moral acceptability aside, on-base
activities such as these contribute to creating an environment
in which all females are regarded with less or no respect, and
abusive behavior toward all women is not only passively accepted
and condoned but encouraged.&quot;
<p>
It is clear that the Navy understands the detrimental effect of
pornographic materials and explicit sex-related entertainment.
 It is also clear that policies are in place to limit the availability
of such material or shows to service members.  The fact that defies
logic is that the services remain in the porn business.  Why?
<p>
Given the rise in sexual assaults and the growing attention devoted
to sexual harassment, the Navy must stop the sale of pornography through 
military installations. Unscrupulous businessmen are willing to sell the 
trash, but must taxpayer funded stores peddle depraved material at cut-rates 
and tax-free to servicemen worldwide?
<p>
Eckerd Drugs and 7-Eleven have voluntarily decided not to sell
sexually explicit material despite the loss of potential profits.
 Why does the U.S. government, which should stand for what is
right and moral in our country, not have the social conscience
of these commercial firms? 
<p>
Commander-in-Chief Bill Clinton has the unilateral authority to
remove pornographic material from military stores.  With the stroke
of a pen, his executive order could prohibit the sale of sexually
explicit materials in base exchanges all over the world.  Such
an order would surely be upheld in the courts, especially if based
on long respected claims of military deference.  We are waiting,
Mr. President.

<title>PARENTS WANT HELP FIGHTING THE POP CULTURE'S ADVERSE INFLUENCE</title>

<h2>PARENTS WANT HELP<br>
FIGHTING THE POP CULTURE'S<br>
ADVERSE INFLUENCE</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>
<p>
Most parents applauded when Procter &amp; Gamble recently withdrew
all advertising from four popular talk shows because they feature
&quot;gratuitous sex, foul language, and references to violence.&quot;
 Apparently, P&amp;G now understands that consumers are convinced
that these shows represent the decay of pop culture.
<p>
According to an October 1995 national public opinion survey commissioned
by the Family Research Council, four of every five parents believe
pop culture negatively affects children.  Single parents, especially,
say they need outside help shielding their children from pop culture's
emphasis on sex, violence, and vulgarity.
<p>
Even when Generation Xers (age 18 to 30) were asked &quot;to assess
the degree to which today's movies, television, and music lyrics
encourage teenage sex&quot;, 63 percent said &quot;a great deal&quot;
or &quot;quite a lot.&quot;  Programs like <I>Melrose Place</I>
and <I>Beverly Hills, 90210</I> flaunt sexual themes and vulgarity
and even family-hour shows such as <I>The Nanny</I> are laden
with sexual innuendo.
<p>
Three of every four Americans told Voter/Consumer Research (a
Maryland-based national pollster) that they either strongly or
somewhat agree with the statement, &quot;The values promoted in
today's movies, on television, and in music lyrics do not represent
my own views.&quot;  This widely shared view might explain Proctor
&amp; Gamble's move to dump trash talk shows.
<p>
Parents intuitively know what the scientific community confirms:
the messages of pop culture are &quot;persuasive&quot; in affecting
behavior.
<p>
In 1995, Robert McAfee, president of the American Medical Association,
stated: &quot;If you combine television, motion pictures, rap
music and video games, there's a continuing influence of violence....[and]
violence is indeed a learned behavior.&quot;  More than half of
young adults told FRC they agree that &quot;movies, television
and music lyrics contribute to violent crimes.&quot;
<p>
The National Institute of Mental Health reported that the consensus
in scientific literature is that exposure to television violence
increases children's physical aggressiveness.  Senate Judiciary
Committee member Paul Simon (D-Ill.) said he found &quot;nearly
3,000 scholarly articles and studies on the harmful effects of
television violence on children and adults.&quot; 
<p>
Science isn't as conclusive regarding television's impact on drug
abuse and teen sex, although the Center on Addiction and Substance
Abuse at Columbia recently released a national survey showing
that 76 percent of adolescents blame popular culture for encouraging
illegal drug use.
<p>
Researchers have found that <I>MTV</I>, the marriage between television
and music, is especially corrosive.  According to the authors
of the book <I>Dancing in the Dark</I>, music television is &quot;one
of the most powerful forms of contemporary propaganda.&quot;
<p>
Dr. Joseph Stuessey, professor of music history at the University
of Texas, told the U.S. Senate Commerce Committee, &quot;Music
affects behavior.... It affects our moods, our attitudes, our
emotions, and our behavior.&quot;  It is estimated that the average
teen listens to rock music four to six hours each day.
<p>
The Parent's Music Resource Center reports that teens listen to
an estimated 10,500 hours of rock music between the seventh and
12th grades alone -- just 500 hours less than the total time they
spend in school over 12 years.
<p>
Dr. Sheila Davis, a professor of lyric writing at New York University,
states that songs &quot;are more than mere mirrors of society;
they are a potent force in the shaping of it....[p]opular songs...provide
the primary 'equipment for living' for America's youth.&quot;
<p>
Child psychologist Dr. David Elkind writes in <I>The Hurried Child</I>,
&quot;Music can influence young people as much as any visual media.&quot;
<p>
The loudest cry for help to battle pop culture's negative influence
comes from single parents.  Nearly two of every three single parents
told FRC they agree with the statement, &quot;These days, it is
too difficult for parents to deal with this [the pop culture]
alone.&quot;
<p>
Ultimately, parents are responsible and should monitor what kids
consume.  They should also explore technical devices that control
what kids watch  -- The Telecommander or TV Guardian -- and express
their views to the entertainment industry.
<p>
The entertainment industry is not without responsibility, however.
It demonstrated good citizenship when it created the ratings
now assigned to movies.  Comic book producers banned certain material,
and recently two national music distributors announced renewed
efforts to improve the Parental Advisory Program that flags sound
recordings which contain explicit lyrics.
<p>
More needs to be done.  TV networks ought to eliminate objectionable
programming or re-establish a &quot;family viewing hour&quot;
or &quot;safe harbor&quot; during which no objectionable material
is shown or advertised.  They should also cut gratuitous violence
and sexually explicit material.   By endorsing V-chip technology
they could help parents better control what enters the living
rooms of America.
<p>
Clear majorities told FRC they want an independent rating system
for television and music and the ability to block objectionable
cable television and computer material from their homes.

<title>WATCHING IS NOT OKAY</title>

<h2>WATCHING IS NOT OKAY</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Kristi Hamrick</i></center>
<p>
What happened to Dr. Kevorkian as he worked in steel rooms cutting
into the last remains of someone's family? What happened to the
pathologist whose job it was to determine the way death came --
rather than to be the cause of that death?
<p>
What kind of thoughts entered his mind as he saw the signature
of death? Did he wish he could have been there? 
<p>
And then later, this scavenger of death, this man whose entire
living depended on the deaths of others, later his thoughts turned,
where?  To, &quot;I can be there&quot; or &quot;I can be the cause&quot;?
<p>
Recently Dr. Kevorkian was involved in another woman's death,
but this time, she wasn't so sick.  Physicians seemed to have
halted the decline toward death. Until Dr. Kevorkian.
<p>
And so we find in this drama that the reality was that the true
state of this woman's health was her mental health. And she was
abandoned to a voyeuristic death, Dr. Kevorkian having helped
her decide that her life wasn't worth living.
<p>
Or was it?
<p>
No one seems to remember that the first duty to one's depressed
friend -- to a fellow human being -- is not to speed them to death,
but to cheer them up and help them find the strength to go on.
We are inspired by the lovely wife of Christopher Reeve who helps
him see all that remains in life for him to accomplish.
<p>
But today they seem rare, for we live in a culture that glamorizes
death.
<p>
Recently my husband and I drove by a prominent theater in our
nation's capitol, and on the marquee every movie hawked a vision
of death. <I>Copy Cat</I> and the thrill of serial killing; <I>Devil
in a Blue Dress</I> and the fun of blackmail and betrayal, <I>Dead
Presidents</I> and the joy of a horrific war experience followed
by unemployment; <I>7</I> and the beauty of twisted 
justice; even a <I>Vampire in Brooklyn</I> and the spice of the
&quot;undead&quot; and their appetites.
<p>
But for those of us weaned on shootings and our &quot;right&quot;
to bad taste, no mere knowledge of death will do any longer for
some.
<p>
We can't know -- in Alfred Hitchcock fashion -- that someone in
the next room just left this mortal coil. Now we must see it,
slow motion, full color, <I>Pulp Fiction</I> frame by frame, until
we're so hardened to the sight of human suffering, that the nausea
rape, torture, murder and old fashioned fear just don't do much
for us anymore.
<p>
But blood isn't a big screen phenomena. If the money is not in
the budget for movies, there is always television.
<p>
One recent Friday night, free speech and hardened sensibilities
served up battery and slow death in prison on the <I>X-files</I>;
murderous people killing enemies by slow death by maggots on <I>American
Gothic</I>, and various forms of shootings, stabbings and stalkings
-- and that is without all those really seamy &quot;true-to-life&quot;
cop dramas where we not only get to see brain-like matter splatter,
we are exposed to portly policemen in the shower, making washing
decisions on a national screen despite what modesty and good taste
would indicate.
<p>
Having been a reporter who covered the court and police beats,
I can say first hand that  what is missing from these true to
life dramas is real life. Police are usually people working hard,
thinking of their kids, trying to find out what really happened
at the scene of a tragedy. They're not soap operas in blues. They
live out the unglamorous reality of hard work and dignified people.
<p>
So where does this leave America? Where does this lead the world?
Into the valley of the shadow of death, into the imagined worlds
of men like Dr. Kevorkian, who seems to believe that just because
he can invent a machine that kills he should be allowed to ...
and allowed to watch.
<p>
Ironically, when Dr. Kevorkian kills, the media responds by putting
on &quot;reasoned&quot; discussions of euthanasia, asking bubble-headed
bleach blonde questions about the &quot;right to die&quot; rather
than seeing that there is little difference between an elderly
man with a death machine, and kids killing kids with baseball
bats &quot;to watch.&quot;
<p>
News stories show us pictures of &quot;real life&quot; dramas
of children killing children to &quot;see what it was like&quot;
or to see a real murder. Children throwing tiny victims from high-rise
apartments. Children raping, stabbing and shooting. Life is worth
less than tennis shoes or jackets, and people have less worth
than laboratory rats.
<p>
Groups like People for the Ethical Treatment of Animals advocate
using coma patients and those classed as brain dead for medical
experiments rather than the kinds of creatures that civilizations
have historically understood to be of less worth than children.
And in a survey I heard about, some people don't seem to understand
that if a child and a dog were drowning, the child should be the
first saved.
<p>
Out of what hole did Dr. Kevorkian crawl? Where did his passion
for death come from? In part, one wonders, from the notion that accidental 
life isn't worth the DNA it haphazardly &quot;evolved&quot; on.
<p>
From the deliberate rejection of founding ideals like the holding
of truths to be self evident, that all people are created equal
&quot;and they are endowed by their creator with certain inalienable
rights, among these are life ...&quot;
<p>
Human life ... each one unique, valuable, irreplaceable. Each
person with something to offer. And it does not have to be the
same things ... nor even the same abilities to walk or think or
paint.
<p>
A society that loses the sanctity of life has nothing left to
share but death. If there are no reliable standards of right and
wrong, then there is no reason to persevere or overcome -- if
you don't want to. No reason for people to reach out to you in
your darkest moment if they don't feel like it.  If we have no
common dignity then we share, at least, a common end. And so our
culture seems to revel in death, both by  murderous flashing images
on a screen and the real live voyeurism of thugs and Dr. Kevorkian.
<p>
Somewhere along the line, Dr. Kevorkian seems to have decided
that he wanted to watch. In a civil society, the answer to that
is, &quot;No,&quot; and  &quot;Get some help.&quot;
<p>
Until we determine to embrace human life as the sacred and valuable
thing that it is, unique in all the world, and determine that
we will work together to enrich the human experience in practical
and real ways, we will have nothing in common but the fear and
fascination we have with the only thing we know for sure  -- the
fact that we will all die.
<p>
But there is more to life than death ... at least, there should
be.

<title>The Strange Transformation of the Supreme Court's Privacy Doctrine</title>

<h2><i>MEYER</i>, HOW YOU'VE GROWN:<br>
THE STRANGE TRANSFORMATION<br>
OF THE SUPREME COURT'S<br>
PRIVACY DOCTRINE</h2>
<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<p>
<i>David M. Wagner</i></center>
<p>
<i>This paper is the text of a lecture given at Molloy College, Rockville Center, 
NY, on April 21, 1994.</i>
<p>
The &quot;constitutional right of privacy&quot;
was much talked about back in 1987, when Robert Bork -- a nominee
who had been considered unbeatable because of his sterling legal
record -- was, in fact, beaten, largely because his opponents
focused on the fact that he had critiqued the Court's privacy
cases.  Judge Bork's defeat should have meant, at a minimum, that
privacy, whatever exactly it is, is highly valued by the American
people.
<p>
Supporters of Judge Bork countered that the word &quot;privacy&quot;
was merely that year's euphemism for abortion.  They were right,
insofar as the cases that Judge Bork had gotten in the most trouble
for critiquing were <i>Griswold v. Connecticut</i>,[1] in which the Court
struck down a statute that banned the use of contraceptives, and
<i>Roe v. Wade</i>,[2] which, of course, is the foundational case for a
constitutional right of abortion.
<p>
But the constitutional right
of privacy did not start with these cases.  It started in a very
different kind of cultural environment and was deployed in defense
of very different values.  The story of its origins and subsequent
development tells us a lot about the changes in the thinking of
our nation's elites between the early 1920's and today.
<p>
The privacy cases trace their origin to a series of Supreme Court cases in
the 1920's that all dealt, in one way or another, with the rights
of parents to direct the education of their children.  Included
in this series were <i>Meyer v. Nebraska</i>[3] and <i>Bartels v. Iowa</i>,[4] 
in which the Court struck down statutes that banned the teaching
of foreign languages below the ninth grade.
<p>
(You might wonder how such statutes got passed in the first place.  Remember that
this was in the early 20's, and passions were still high from
World War I.  Notice that the names of the
plaintiffs, Meyer and Bartels, were both German.)
<p>
In the later cases of the series, <i>Pierce v. Society of Sisters</i>[5] 
and <i>Farrington v. Tokushige</i>,[6] the Court struck down statutes that were 
aimed at eliminating private education.  The statute struck down in <i>Pierce</i>
had banned private schools outright by mandating children's attendance
at public schools.  The statute struck down in <i>Farrington</i> imposed
an extensive and intrusive regulatory regime on so-called &quot;foreign
language schools&quot; in Hawaii.  (It appears that this statute
was primarily an anti-Japanese move, since schools that used the
Hawaiian language were not considered &quot;foreign,&quot; while
Japanese was by far the leading minority language.)  Of these
four cases, two of them -- <i>Meyer</i> and <i>Pierce</i> -- came to be seen
as the leading ones, and the theory that sees the parent-child
relationship as protected by the Due Process Clause is sometimes
called the <i>Meyer-Pierce</i> doctrine.
<p>
In those days, the Supreme Court
was much in the habit of striking down social legislation and
economic regulation.  The Court was fervently committed to free
market economics and to the philosophy of individualism that goes
with such economics, and it frequently resorted to the argument
that the Constitution itself prohibits laws that regulate the
economic marketplace.  In some cases it used the Constitution's
Contracts Clause[7] of Article II Section 10 of the Constitution,
but it relied even more heavily on the Due Process Clause of the
14th Amendment, which prohibits states from taking life, liberty,
or property without due process of law.
<p>
Some jurists, including Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes,[8] offered the critique 
that was later offered by Robert Bork and others -- that the Due Process Clause
focuses on process rather than substance and does not give the
Court the power to strike down regulations enacted according to
fair procedures.  Holmes, in 1905, like Bork in 1987, stood up
for &quot;the right of a [political] majority to embody their
opinions in law.&quot;  But that other great majority -- a majority
of the Court -- held throughout the early 20th century that the
Due Process Clause protects more than mere due process; it also
prohibits some types of legislation altogether, and may, therefore,
be said to protect &quot;due substance&quot; as well as due process.
<p>
This doctrine, which came to be known as &quot;substantive due
process,&quot; is also the doctrinal matrix of the parents' rights
cases.  The conventional explanation today of the Court's solicitude
both for economic freedom and for parental authority is that the
Court was protecting a class system that depended both on patriarchal
authority and on unrestrained capitalism.[9]  But the need for &quot;hidden
agenda&quot; theories diminishes once one realizes that household
and marketplace are not antitheses, but different points along
a continuum of interconnected human relationships.  The very term
&quot;economics&quot; comes from the Greek &quot;oikos,&quot;
meaning &quot;household.&quot;  (Also underlying the Court's concern
was the right of private school teachers to earn their living
at their chosen profession.[10])
<p>
In the 30's, substantive due process
was a major obstacle to FDR's reforms.  Regardless of where one
stands on the merits of FDR's programs, one does have to recognize
that the electorate wanted change and was getting tired of unelected
and life-tenured judges using esoteric constitutional doctrines
to substitute their philosophy for the philosophy embraced by
the majority of the nation.   FDR's Attorney General, Robert Jackson,
spoke eloquently of how the Court had substituted its own views
of the Constitution for what the Constitution actually says. 
Eventually FDR put Jackson and other liberal jurists on the Court;
the doctrine of substantive due process officially went into discredit
in 1937; and a former clerk to Justice Jackson is now Chief Justice
of the United States.
<p>
Only one strand of substantive due process
survived 1937 -- the <i>Meyer-Pierce</i> doctrine.  It's true that the
Court placed an outer limit on that doctrine in 1944, in <i>Prince
v. Massachusetts</i>,[11] in which it held that <i>Meyer</i> and <i>Pierce</i> 
do not exempt parents or guardians from the child labor laws.  This case
involved a child's legal guardian who wanted the child to help
her distribute religious literature.  The Court turned aside both
a parents' rights claim and a free exercise of religion claim.
 To this day, <i>Prince</i> is always the first case cited by government
attorneys defending some state action against a constitutional
challenge by parents.  But even in <i>Prince</i>, the Court went out
of its way to clarify that it was not overruling the <i>Meyer-Pierce</i>
doctrine.  It said:
<p>
<blockquote>It is cardinal with us that the custody,
care and nurture of the child reside first in the parents, whose
primary function and freedom include preparation for obligations
the state can neither supply nor hinder.  <i>Pierce, supra</i>.  And
it is in recognition of this that these decisions have respected
the private realm of family life which the state cannot enter.
</blockquote><p>
In 1942, two years before <i>Prince</i>, the Court showed the enduring power
of the notion that the Constitution protects certain fundamental
relationships.  The case was <i>Skinner v. Oklahoma</i>,[12] and it struck
down a statute that authorized sterilization as a punishment for
a third conviction for certain crimes (a eugenics-era version
of &quot;three strikes and you're out&quot;).  The case was basically
resolved under the Equal Protection Clause of the 14th Amendment,
rather than the Due Process Clause, on the theory that Oklahoma
had made an irrational distinction in punishing some crimes by
sterilization while other, similar crimes were not subject to
such punishment.  But the driving force behind the ruling seems
to have been the Court's abhorrence of sterilization as a punishment,
and here the Court brought in the Due Process analysis familiar
from the <i>Meyer-Pierce</i> line of cases.
<p><blockquote>
We are dealing here with
legislation which involves one of the basic rights of man.  Marriage
and procreation are fundamental to the very existence and survival
of the race.[13]
</blockquote><p>
Notice that here, as in <i>Meyer</i> and <i>Pierce</i>, the Court
continues to see the protected right as inherently relational.
 It's &quot;marriage and procreation,&quot; neither of which are
solitary activities.  The Court is still protecting relationships,
rather than self-definition by isolated individuals.
<p>
Notice also that the Court has redefined the nature of the <i>Meyer-Pierce</i> 
holdings. It has given them a new lease on life in the post-1937 world
by ignoring their origins in economic substantive due process
and emphasizing instead their protection of the privacy of protected
relationships.
<p>
The next chapter in the development of the constitutional
privacy right was <i>Griswold v. Connecticut</i>[14] in 1965.  Here the Court
was faced with a very broad anti-contraceptive statute that it
very much wanted to strike down.  The problem was, how?  The Court
had long since rejected substantive due process, and, with it,
the notion that the Court is entitled to sit as a super-legislature,
striking down duly enacted statutes merely because it disagreed
with them.  Back in the 30's, liberals had thrown out the old
substantive due process that protected economic rights.  Would
the liberals of the 60's bring substantive due process back, so
as to protect privacy?
<p>
The answer was yes -- but they did it carefully.
 In a majority opinion by Justice Douglas, the Court in <i>Griswold</i>
reaffirmed the death of substantive due process and repudiated
the notion of legislating from the bench.[15]  It then looked for
constitution clauses other than the 14th Amendment Due Process
Clause for a way to strike down the statute.  What they came up
with was the theory that the 1st, 4th, and 5th Amendments all
protect privacy in some way;  plus, the 9th Amendment authorizes
judges to find new, non-textual rights;  so, on the whole, a general
right of privacy may be said to be one of the &quot;emanations&quot;
from &quot;penumbras&quot; of those amendments.[16]
<p>
The <i>Griswold</i> opinion has both a moderate face and a radical face.  Its moderate 
face is seen in the fact that the privacy right that it protected was
specifically a right of <i>marital</i> privacy.  The opinion contains
some glowing rhetoric about the importance and sacredness of the
marital relationship.[17] This rhetoric is fully consistent both
with the values of most Americans, and with the theory of relational
privacy as we have seen it in <i>Meyer</i> and <i>Pierce</i>, and both those
cases were among those cited in <i>Griswold</i>.[18]
<p>
The radical face of <i>Griswold</i> is seen in its headline value.  I have not 
looked up the original newspaper accounts of <i>Griswold</i>, but I feel reasonably 
confident that they did not say &quot;Court Affirms Privacy Doctrine,&quot;
or &quot;Court Embarks on New Substantive Due Process,&quot; or
&quot;Court Does Novel Analysis of 1st, 4th, 5th and 9th Amendments.&quot;
 No:  the real news value of <i>Griswold</i> lay in the fact that by
its effect, though not by its language, it elevated contraception
to the status of a constitutional right.  That elevation had profound
cultural impact.  Formerly, contraception was, no doubt, widely
practiced, but at the same time it lacked cultural cachet.  It
still carried connotations of the unrespectable, the bohemian.
<i>Griswold</i> had the effect of wrapping contraception in the red,
white, and blue; and, in so doing, it placed a certain judicial
seal of approval on the sexual revolution that was then in progress.
<p>
By 1972, the evidence suggested that this was precisely the direction
in which the Court intended to take the new substantive due process.
For instance, while <i>Griswold</i> seemed to create a due process right
to contraception only for married people, the Court in <i>Eisenstadt
v. Baird</i>[19] in 1972 used the Equal Protection Clause to extend the
same right to the unmarried.
<p>
It also completely contradicted the rhetoric in <i>Griswold</i> about marriage: 
whereas <i>Griswold</i> had cited the special, sacred nature of the marital 
relationship as a basis for finding a privacy right,[20] <i>Eisenstadt</i> heaped 
scorn on the notion that marriage is anything special, and affirmed instead
the continuing legal and metaphysical separateness of spouses.
<p>
Let's pause to retrace our steps.  We started in the 20's with <i>Meyer,
Bartels, Pierce</i>, and <i>Farrington</i>, which affirmed a right of privacy
for protected relationships, namely, those of the family.  They
made the family, especially in its role as bearer and rearer of
children, a zone of limited yet real legal autonomy.  We moved
on to <i>Skinner</i>, the sterilization case from 1942, where we saw
that the privacy doctrine had survived the death of substantive
due process and was still available to protect &quot;marriage
and procreation.&quot;  Then we saw <i>Griswold</i>, where procreation
drops out of the picture, and finally, <i>Eisenstadt</i>, where marriage
drops out of the picture.  The privacy right has by this point
become a constitutional right to reject the values that it was
originally designed to protect.
<p>
After <i>Eisenstadt</i>, the stage was set for <i>Roe v. Wade</i>.[21] 
Roe is probably the most analyzed case in legal history, and I'm certainly 
not going to break any new ground under it today.  In terms of the issues 
we're discussing today, there are two remarkable things about <i>Roe</i>.  One is 
that it dropped the pretense, maintained in <i>Griswold</i>, that the Court 
was doing something other than bringing back substantive due process, in
a new form and at the service of a different set of values.  Two,
it marked the final repudiation of the old relational approach
to privacy, where privacy protected relationships, and inaugurated
an era in which privacy stands for a sort of erotic hyper-individualism:
 an individual's right to define him- or herself, especially through
sexual activity, free from all binding commitments, and free from
all encumbrances other than those that the individual freely and
continuously chooses.
<p>
This is really the constitutionalization of the metaphysics of Jean-Paul Sartre 
and the Existentialists, who taught that the human person makes himself through 
his own choices.[22] It follows that choosing is more important than being,
and freedom is &quot;a constantly renewed obligation to remake
the <i>Self</i>....&quot;[23]
<p>
Although <i>Roe</i> contained a few hedges against this isolationist view of 
individualism -- where it says, for instance, that the woman &quot;cannot be 
isolated in her privacy&quot;[24] -- nonetheless, the later abortion cases 
entrenched isolationist individualism further into the Court's evolving 
concept of privacy. For instance, in <i>Planned Parenthood v. Danforth</i>[25] 
in 1975, the Court struck down a paternal consent requirement for abortion.
 The mutation of the privacy doctrine ought not to pass unnoticed.
 In <i>Meyer</i> and <i>Pierce</i>, it envisioned the parents, as a unit, 
exercising autonomy for the benefit of the child.  By the time we get to
<i>Danforth</i>, we find that it nullifies one parent's rights altogether,
and protects the other parent's autonomy at the expense of the
child.  Another way to look at the matter is that in the 20's,
the privacy right protected the family as such, while in the 70's,
it viewed family ties as one of the chief obstacles to privacy.
<p>
To be sure, the Court has not thrown itself four-square behind the
new view of privacy -- privacy as the individual's right, in isolation
from family and society, to define himself through an ongoing
process of choosing.  If it had, <i>Bowers v. Hardwick</i>[26] would have
come out the other way.  We know this because we have Justice
Blackmun's dissent in that case, which reads like a majority opinion,
which it very nearly was.
<p>
The dissenters in that case, not the majority, had a theory of human freedom, 
albeit one against which many objections could be raised.  The majority simply took 
the position that theories of freedom are one thing, constitutional
law is another, and nothing in the Constitution authorizes the
Court to act as the nation's official philosophy board.  That's
a very strong argument -- but, in a sense, much less interesting
than what the dissenters had to say.
<p>
The Blackmun dissent argued for a broad privacy doctrine while completely and 
explicitly rejecting the <i>Meyer-Pierce</i> view of privacy.  Wrote Justice 
Blackmun: &quot;We protect those rights [referring to marriage and family] not 
because they contribute, in some direct and material way, to the general
public welfare, but because they form so central a part of an
individual's life.&quot;[27]
<p>
For comparison, consider the key statement of the meaning of the privacy doctrine in 
<i>Pierce</i>. Justice McReynolds wrote for the Court:
<p>
<blockquote>The fundamental theory of liberty upon which
all governments in this Union repose excludes any general power
of the State to standardize its children by forcing them to accept
instruction from public teachers only.  The child is not the mere
creature of the State;  those who nurture him and direct his destiny
have the right, coupled with the high duty, to recognize and prepare
him for additional obligations.[28]
</blockquote><p>
The views of privacy endorsed by the Court in the 1920's, and those that it 
sometimes endorsed in the 1970's, are not absolutely contradictory, but they 
certainly pull in different directions.  Justice McReynolds could, theoretically,
have defended parents' rights in terms of the parents' individual
self-definitions, with their children being mere tools in the
parents' life projects.  Such a view would have been a perfect
fit with that of Blackmun in <i>Bowers</i>.   But instead, McReynolds
coupled parents' rights with parents' duties, and specifically
held that this package of rights and duties is oriented towards
preparing the child &quot;for additional obligations.&quot;  He
does not specify what those obligations are, but, from the very
fact that he views these terms as self-explanatory, we may infer
that he means the ordinary obligations of life in a democratic
republic:  being a good friend and neighbor, participating in
civic life, pulling one's own weight economically, taking care
of one's family, and so forth.[29]
<p>
For the mindset of the 1970's, on the other hand, all those obligations -- the 
claims of family, neighborhood, the political community, etc. -- are just so many
encumbrances on the free choice of the individual.  These two
human prototypes -- 1920's Man and 1970's Man, McReynolds Man
and Blackmun Man -- have barely enough in common even to speak
to each other.  From the point of view of 70's Man, 20's Man is
a bundle of complexes and prejudices who never has any fun.  From
the point of view of 20's Man, 70's Man is rootless and shallow,
a passive consumer of pleasurable sensations, not the sort of
person around whom any real community can be built.
<p>
It cannot be stressed too often, however, that constitutional law does not
necessarily force us to choose between 20's Man and 70's Man as
our preferred human type.  There is always the possibility that
the 14th Amendment does not incorporate either as its preferred
model for human society, but instead leaves that choice up to
the democratic process in the several states, cheerfully anticipating
that some states and localities will go in more of a 20's direction,
and others will go in more of a 70's direction.  This option is
the only one I know of that stands a chance of bringing peace
to our judicial politics.
<p>
As it happens, this option was also the
very one offered by Robert Bork.  Critical of the reasoning of
<i>Meyer</i> and <i>Pierce</i> no less than of that of Roe, his philosophy of
sticking narrowly to the constitutional text may have offered
the closest approximation to a truce in the wars over what kind
of privacy, what kind of human person, what kind of society is
envisioned in the 14th Amendment.  The story of his confirmation
battle is the story of how the partisans of 20's Man were willing
to accept this truce, but the partisans of 70's Man were not.
 The truce was rejected; the wars go on, judicially as well as
culturally.
<p>
Today it is simply a given, in the courts and in the
law reviews, that the Constitution protects privacy, <i>in some sense.</i>
 What sense precisely, future cases will have to tell.  The 90's
are not the 20's, but neither are they the 70's.

<title>Observations About America's Welfare Crisis</title>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">
<h2>OBSERVATIONS ABOUT<br>
AMERICA'S WELFARE CRISIS</h2>
<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>Jennifer E. Marshall</i></center>
<p>
<li><b>On Responsibility.</b> For a man to enjoy freedom,
he must accept responsibility for his own acts.  The failure to
accept responsibility denies man basic human dignity.
<p>
The problem with the welfare system is that it suppresses a sense
of personal responsibility and negates freedom and dignity in
the bargain.
<p>
The system neither demands nor rewards responsible behavior. 
Instead, it pays benefits to those who spurn virtue and, in so
doing, makes a mockery of responsible citizens.
<p>
Franklin D. Roosevelt said that &quot;welfare is a narcotic, a
subtle destroyer of the human spirit,&quot; and Alexander Hamilton
observed that &quot;a power over a man's subsistence amounts to
a power over his will.&quot;
<p>
By creating a culture of dependency, we have reduced a potentially
proud and independent people to passive clients.  We have told
them, not that they are equal to the inevitable challenges of
life, but that they are helpless -- a different, less human kind
of breed than the rest of us who can and do live by the rules.
<p>
Welfare bureaucrats say, &quot;You can't do this.  Let us do it
for you.  And pay us to do it with your vote, year after year.&quot;
 And so we are empowering the bureaucracy at the same time we
are destroying individuals, and children are inheriting not only
material poverty but their parents' poverty of the spirit.
<p>
<li><b>On Compassion.</b> The problem of the 1990s is no
longer &quot;poverty,&quot; but, rather, &quot;dependency.&quot;
 And the problem of dependency is primarily a moral problem.
<p>
Government policy that provides money to the poor, while encouraging
them to act in ways that ensure dependency, is not compassionate.
 That's &quot;compassion&quot; that kills, and even liberals have
begun to see the light.
<p>
In a December 15, 1986 article in <i>The New Republic</i>, liberal
social critic Mickey Kaus admitted that &quot;compassion . . .
is a miserable basis for liberal politics.  It carries the unmistakable
implication of dependence and piteousness on the part of those
on the receiving end of the sentiment. . . .  [I]t provides no
principle to tell us when our abstract compassionate impulses
should stop . . . which is why a politics based on mass-produced
compassion leads naturally to the indiscriminate dispensing of
cash.&quot;
<p>
Compassion instead must be defined as the potential to effect
change in the current system -- because the current system is
synonymous with misery.
<p>
And the principle behind that change must be a new sense of limits,
based on the discrimination between good and bad behavior.
<p>
In her book <i>Poverty and Compassion</i>, Gertrude Himmelfarb
suggested that we must be determined, not just to feel good about
ourselves, but to do good to others.  And sometimes it is necessary
to feel bad ourselves and to curb our run-away compassion, in
order to serve the best interests of others.
<p>
<li><b>On Illegitimacy.</b> Can we doubt that a system
that subsidizes illegitimacy perpetuates illegitimacy -- and creates
social chaos?  Listen to the testimony of one woman on welfare,
quoted in the March 1995 <i>Reader's Digest</i>:  &quot;Welfare
is an enabler.  It's not that you want to be in that situation.
 But it's there.  We always know.&quot;  
<p>
In other words, welfare enables unmitigated disaster -- by making
it increasingly difficult for the poor to make the right choices
which they otherwise are fully capable of making.  
<p>
Welfare destroys individuals first, and then the destruction moves
outward in concentric circles to consume the entire community.
 When illegitimacy reaches a critical mass -- as it already has
in many communities, both black and white -- the neighborhood
effects create problems that extend far beyond the recipients
of welfare.
<p>
Community values and the norms for male
behavior are changed, and with them the behavior of young men
and women who never touch an AFDC check.  Thus, the effect
of those checks springs not only from discrete changes in economic
incentives but from a larger, more pervasive effect on the formation
of character among poor young people.
<p>
Great Society programs shared a common assumption:  that the poor
are victims in the grip of larger forces.  We are all victims
now, of large destructive forces of our own making -- and no one
is more victimized than the poor themselves.
<p>
<li><b>On Family Formation.</b> By subsidizing illegitimacy,
we have turned our inner cities into a wasteland.  And we can't
expect to roll back the tide until we discover some means to ensure
that more children grow up with a father in the home.
<p>
Families socialize children, and persons of a utopian bent of
mind are wrong in thinking that we can replace the family by some
kind of government construct that will accomplish the same ends.
 We have tried that, and we have failed miserably.
<p>
Liberals made their mistake in assuming that virtues like selflessness
and generosity are a part of human nature.  To the contrary, any
right impulse that man possesses must take shape and form within
the family -- or else it will not form at all.
<p>
Even <i>Newsweek</i> has announced that &quot;the name of the
game is shame,&quot; but shame springs up spontaneously only when
children experience loving family relationships that make them
care about how their actions will impact those around them.  Children
who don't feel the love of family can't feel remorse.  They just
feel the pain that inevitably results from violating the laws
of society and of &quot;Nature's God.&quot;
<p>
And so, for the sake of the children, we are justified in taking
whatever means are available to a free people to ensure that intact
families are once again the norm.
<p>
If we don't take action, one of every 2 babies will be born to
a single mother within the next 20 years.  That's a fact we can't
live with.
<P>
<li><b>On Cultural Decline.</b> Peggy Noonan has said that
we have all had a moment when we suddenly realized that the world
was changing before our very eyes -- and not for the better. 
For her, the moment came at a graduation ceremony when the audience
stood up and applauded a senior who would soon give birth to a
baby minus a father.
<p>
Noonan wrote in the September 14, 1992 issue of <i>Forbes</i>:
 &quot;In the sound of that applause I heard a wall falling, a
thousand-year wall, a wall of sanctions that said: We as a society
do not approve of teenaged unwed motherhood because it is not
good for the child, not good for the mother, and not good for
us.&quot;
<p>
What we applaud, we encourage; and we do a grave disservice to
young women and their children when we refuse to draw lines between
right and wrong.
<p>
We can disapprove and yet still provide help -- but we cannot
make that critical distinction by guaranteeing a right to cash
benefits independent of the obligation to good conduct.
<p>
The only real help comes from private individuals and organizations
that sponsor moral renewal at the same time they offer material
support.  Since it's far easier to receive a check in the mail,
no questions asked, welfare denies its dependents the chance to
get real help -- the kind of help that changes lives.
<p>
<li><b>On The Needs of Our Children.</b> James Q. Wilson
said in the 1994 Wriston Lecture at the Manhattan Institute that,
rather than focusing on how to reduce poverty or dependency, we
must set our sights on saving the children.
<p>
We must focus on the dictum that, for a child to thrive, he needs
the &quot;irrational involvement&quot; of two parents who love
him fiercely.
<p>
The problem is that a teenage mother is still a child herself,
with all the distractions and conflicting emotions of adolescence
at play.
<p>
She must contend not only with earaches and two-year-old tantrums,
but with her own broken dreams of any realistic chance at a better
life.
<p>
Three-fourths of illegitimate births among whites alone are to
women with a high school education or less; and, the younger the
single mother, the less likely she is to finish high school.
<p>
The kindest policy we could adopt is one that ensures that young
unwed mothers will have to live either at home with their families
or in group homes.  Not only would the young mother have the help
and supervision of adults on a daily basis, but her child would
be far less likely to suffer abuse or neglect.
<p>
Children born out of wedlock are statistically much more likely
to be abused.  And it is alone at night in an empty apartment
that a tired young mother is most likely to react with anger at
the sound of a crying baby.
<p>
Studies show that the high rate of out-of-wedlock births to young
mothers is the primary explanation for America's low international
standing on measures of infant mortality.
<p>
If we really want to end the suffering of children, we should
end the government subsidies that enable children to bear children.
<P>
<li><b>On Fatherlessness.</b> More than 70% of all juveniles
in state reform institutions come from fatherless homes.  The
likelihood that a young male will engage in criminal activities
doubles if he is raised without a father and triples if he lives
in a neighborhood with a high concentration of single-parent families.
<p>
While shocking, the statistics should not take us completely by
surprise.  Young males are a problematic sex, and they require
socialization that only fathers can provide.
<p>
If not socialized into responsible adult behavior and, as it turns
out, into responsible sexual behavior, young men are dangerous.
 Social scientists are just now beginning to say, in their bloodless
way, what policemen have known for years -- in a <i>not</i> so
bloodless way.
<p>
It is not enough to say that certain kinds of welfare reforms
will cause suffering.  We have to come to terms with the degree
of suffering that's occurring right now.
<p>
And we have to include in the body count the number of children
who fall prey to the violent crime that results from, as James
Q. Wilson put it, &quot;neglecting the processes by which the
underclass reproduces itself.&quot;
<p>
We can maintain our broad legal freedoms -- and our lives -- <i>only</i>
if we manage to instill in our children a degree of self-restraint.
 And we can cultivate that restraint only by turning the hearts
of the fathers to the children.
<p>
<li><b>On Building Community.</b> The welfare system does
not represent the intended relation of free and equal citizens.
 In fact, welfare practically precludes <i>any</i> relationship
between rich and poor.
<p>
Benefit checks amount to essentially tribute money.  In exchange
for our money, we ask that the poor simply leave us alone.
<p>
We hope that the state will make them comfortable, but the paying
of checks by an impersonal bureaucracy requires no personal
involvement on our part.
<p>
Do we realize the implications?
<p>
We have reinstituted segregation -- though not along lines of
race -- because the underclass culture fosters alienation.  Already
we are divided by the distance between &quot;middle-class&quot;
values and the moral anarchy of the inner city, and we will find
it increasingly appealing to create a modern analogue of the Indian
reservation to house the people we fear.
<p>
Our hope lies in the private transactions in which we meet individuals
in need of help, not as clients, but as fellow human beings. 
Tocqueville explained: &quot;Private charity establishes valuable
ties between the rich and the poor by involving the giver in the
fate of the one whose poverty he has undertaken to alleviate.
 Although divided by circumstance, they are willingly reconciled.&quot;
<p>
This is a country badly in need of healing, not of new and deeper
divisions.  But we will have to change welfare if we want to stymie
the secession of the poor from middle-class life -- and from the
common experience of freedom, as the Founders meant it.

<title>Hearing on the Administration's Aids Training Program</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">
<h2>HEARING ON THE<br>
ADMINISTRATION'S AIDS<br>
TRAINING PROGRAM</h2>
<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<h4>Testimony of Robert L. Maginnis, Policy Analyst<br>
Family Research Council<br>
for House Committee on Government Reform and Oversight<br>
Subcommittee on Civil Service<br>
Representative John L. Mica, Chairman<br>
June 22, 1995</h4></center>
<p>
Mr. Chairman and members of the subcommittee, it is a pleasure
to address you today concerning the Administration's AIDS training
program.
<p>
President Clinton announced on September 30, 1993 to all heads
of executive departments his HIV/AIDS policy.  The policy requires
each departmental secretary to designate a senior staff member
to implement HIV/AIDS training programs and to develop workplace
policies for employees with HIV/AIDS.
<p>
The training has received a mixed review.  Some federal employees
have called the Family Research Council to complain that they
found the training offensive.  Others have said it was relatively
benign.
<p>
The Administration's AIDS awareness training has numerous problems.
 It does not reduce the risks of contracting HIV, and it merely
recites the provisions outlined in the Americans with Disabilities
Act.  The training duplicates other federal AIDS education programs,
and it has been used to promote homosexuality.
<p>
You asked me to address four questions.
<p>
<b>First, does the training meet the statutory objective?</b>
<p>
The governing statute defines &quot;training&quot; as &quot;the
process of providing for and making available to an employee ...[information]...which
will improve individual and organizational performance and assist
in achieving the agency's mission and performance goals.&quot;
<p>
It remains a mystery as to how this training meets the objective.
 The government's publications provide little help.  For example,
the Treasury Department's AIDS awareness booklet quotes President Clinton,
&quot;We need to set an example.&quot;  An example of what?
<p>
The Agriculture Department outlined its training goals:  to shatter
the myths about AIDS, explain how to treat people with AIDS, to
encourage employees to keep an open mind to better understand
AIDS, and to emphasize that AIDS is difficult to contract.  There
was no attempt to link the agency's mission and goals with the
training.
<p>
While Agriculture's AIDS goals could also be made for cancer or
heart disease, which kill many more Americans every year, the
federal government doesn't mandate three hours of training to
prevent these diseases.
<p>
In fact, federal government-sponsored AIDS awareness training
may have been a good idea in 1987.  But after spending $500 million
per year on AIDS education for many years, the Clinton Administration's
program appears to be a total waste of taxpayer money.
<p>
Conservative estimates of the costs to the taxpayer of  the Administration's
program are over $80 million in lost productivity, material, and
fees.  Congress should demand a full accounting.   
<p>
The Administration's AIDS program focuses almost exclusively on
awareness and has little impact on behavior change.  Since HIV
is contracted through behavior and not from breathing bad air,
training that ignores diagnosis and fails to contribute to behavior
modification will have minimal impact.
<p>
<b>Second, what have federal civil servants told me about the
training?</b>
<p>
I've heard from civil servants throughout the government.  They
complain that the training was offensive, a big joke, a waste
of time, and that it promoted homosexuality.   Most objected that
the training was mandatory and those who protested were threatened
with adverse personnel actions.
<p>
The training includes a brief history of HIV, symptoms and some
emphasis on prevention and risk reduction.  There is a discussion
of needle sharing and sexual contact.  Federal employees are told
to reduce their HIV contraction risk by practicing &quot;safer
sex&quot; by using barriers like condoms, dental dams, plastic
wrap, and latex gloves.  An employee manual states, &quot;A dental
dam or plastic wrap may be used for any oral-vaginal or oral-anal
contact.  All types of barriers are effective against HIV transmission
only if they are used correctly and consistently from start to
finish.&quot;
<p>
One employee labeled the training as a glorified high school sex
education class with sensitivity training on the side.  Others
objected to the graphic explanations of sexual activities.
<p>
<b>Third, what kind of AIDS training is appropriate for the federal
workplace?</b>
<p>
The federal government spends billions of dollars each year on
AIDS research, education, and treatment.  Much of that money is
wasted because it fails to involve diagnosis.  If the government
wants to impact the epidemic in the workforce, it must link HIV
diagnosis with follow-up counseling and training.
<p>
Such a program would be less expensive than the Administration's
program and far more productive.  For example, an AIDS test now
costs about $2.49.  The federal government could test the &quot;at-risk&quot;
civil servants and then, with the results in hand, provide confidential
follow-up counseling and training.
<p>
Limiting the spread of the virus through behavior reinforcement
or modification should be a top priority.  A test-linked program
is the only meaningful type of training that will help arrest
the epidemic.
<p>
<b>Finally, is legislation needed to better define the kinds of
training in the federal workplace?</b>
<p>
Yes.  Most of the AIDS training is not offensive.  But there are
alarming exceptions.  For example, the Forest Service's Tahoe
Region sponsored AIDS training last year.  It was conducted by
a sexologist, a self-described homosexual phlebotomist, and an
HIV-positive woman from the community.
<p>
The phlebotomist was an ex-convict who tried to debunk &quot;homophobic&quot;
attitudes.  He speculated that many husbands were involved in
homosexual affairs.  He showed a variety of condoms and how to
apply them to a life-size replica of erect male genitalia.  He
even explained a technique for using one's mouth to apply the
condom.  He also explained the proper cleaning techniques when
sharing hypodermic needles.
<p>
In conclusion, the Clinton Administration mandated AIDS awareness
training to appease activists and to provide a platform for the
promotion of homosexuality as the moral equivalent of heterosexuality.
 This training is a subset of the diversity agenda which permeates
the federal bureaucracy today.
<p>
Congress should pass legislation that limits training to the clearly
defined statutory objectives.  Training should not promote a particular
political agenda, redefine the family to include homosexual couples,
or include offensive material.  Training, also should be job related.

<h2>DISESTABLISHING THE<br>
DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</h2>
<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<h4>Testimony of Robert G. Morrison<br>
Education Policy Analyst<br>
Family Research Council<br>
before the House Committee on Economic<br>
and Educational Opportunities<br>
June 29, 1995</h4></center>
<p>
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee:  my name is Robert
G. Morrison and I am here to represent Gary Bauer and the Family
Research Council.  Our organization serves more than 250,000 members
nationwide.  I served with Gary Bauer in the U.S. Department of
Education from 1985-87.  My testimony today will call for the
disestablishment of the Department of Education and the repeal
of Goals 2000, the Educate America Act.
<p>
In 1979, when President Jimmy Carter first proposed the creation
of a U.S. Department of Education to repay the National Education
Association for its political support,  columnist Marvin Stone
warned of  the centralization of power over education:  writing
for <I>U.S. News &amp; World Report</I>, Stone asked:  &quot;Would
the Education Department have the power to tamper with America's
traditional local control of education?  Of course it would. 
Where there is money to be given, there is the implicit responsibility
to make sure that it is spent according to the purposes of the
donors -- or else.&quot;  Despite half-hearted objections at the
time, the Department has moved inexorably toward greater and greater
control over local education.  With Goals 2000, the U.S. Education
Department and other federal bureaucracies seek to tighten their
grip on the genuine education reform movement and extinguish it.
<p>
Of course, these ceaseless efforts at centralization will fail.
 They must fail, because they sap local community spirit and individual
responsibility.  They must fail because, as Mr. Jefferson said:
 &quot;If we waited for Washington to tell us when to sow and
when to reap, we should soon want bread.&quot;  They must fail
for an even more profound reason.  Alexis de Tocqueville has been
recently quoted both by President Bill Clinton and by Speaker
Gingrich.  But Tocqueville, as a genius of political science,
explained <I>why</I> the attempt to centralize administration
ultimately fails.
<p>
<blockquote><i>However enlightened and skillful a central power may be, it
cannot of itself embrace all the details of the life of a great nation.
 Such vigilance exceeds the powers of man. And when it attempts
unaided to create and set in motion so many complicated springs,
it must submit to a very imperfect result or exhaust itself in
bootless efforts.
<p>
Alexis de Tocqueville<br>
Democracy in America, 1835</i></blockquote>
<p>
&quot;Imperfect results&quot; and  &quot;bootless efforts&quot;
pretty well describe the record of the U.S. Education Department.
 Under the spur of Goals 2000, the Department has seen fit to
endorse the new national history standards.  These politically-correct
standards seek to teach all American students that Madonna and
the Simpsons are significant figures, while neglecting Paul Revere,
the Wright Brothers, Marian Anderson and Jonas Salk.  They speak
of &quot;Soviet advances in space&quot; and the <I>Challenger</I>
disaster, while completely omitting the U.S. landing on the moon
even though Arthur Schlesinger, Jr., a respected liberal historian,
has said that the moon landing may be the most significant event
of the twentieth century.  Worse, the standards could be fairly
termed &quot;anti-American&quot; history standards because they
teach young people that U.S.-Soviet &quot;swordplay&quot; led
to the American involvement in Korea, Vietnam and U.S. interventions
around the world.  Never do the standards speak of Soviet invasions
of Hungary, Czechoslovakia or Afghanistan.  Never do the standards
acknowledge communist efforts at subversion in the U.S. or Western
Europe.  We urge this committee and the full House to join the
Senate in denouncing these history standards.
<p>
Not only do we at Family Research Council believe that the national
history standards that have been produced are unacceptable, we
believe that <I>any</I> effort of the federal government to dispense
official truth is misguided and dangerous.  We have only to look
at the Clinton administration's recently reported failure in the
area of childhood immunizations to recognize the harm that government
can do when it manufactures a crisis based on faulty data and
a political agenda.  Yet, if there are any of our liberal friends
who still defend the idea of a political determination of  U.S.
history, we would ask them to consider this:  what if national
history and economics standards were to be devised by Professor
Gingrich, Professor Gramm and Professor Armey?
<p>
The reality in contemporary American life is that parents, taxpayers
and citizens generally are not of one accord about all education
programs.  There is broad support, measured by polls, for safe
and drug-free schools.  There is consistent public backing for
schools which teach children reading, writing, arithmetic and
history, for schools which impart reliable standards of right
and wrong.  But there is no stable consensus on many other hotly-debated
issues.   Family life and sex education continue to be points
of contention.  Methods of teaching reading, similarly, divide
Americans.  So, too, does the teaching of evolution.  Even bilingual
education is fraught with controversy.  What the Education Department
and Goals 2000 do is put the federal government in the middle
of all these controversies. 
<p>
When the federal government becomes an antagonist, it is viewed
increasingly as hostile to one or another group of parents or
interests.  That is why we at Family Research Council support
the <I>disestablishment </I>of the U.S. Department of Education
and the <I>repeal</I> of Goals 2000.  We seek the return of decision-making
 authority  to local communities -- to elected school boards which
are close to the people they serve.  We also strongly support
parental choice of schools.  Only when every parent can freely
choose a safe and effective public, private, religious or home
school will we have an end to the interminable clashes over education
and values. 
<p>
Many in the education establishment, we know, question whether
parents are capable of wisely choosing a school for their children. 
To this we can only answer:  if parents are capable of choosing presidents, 
governors and members of congress, then surely they can choose a school.
 Further, if advocates of a public school monopoly persist on
this point, we must challenge them.  If Americans cannot make
an<I> educated</I> choice of schools for their own children, whom
they love, then who bears the responsibility for their failure?
We have had compulsory public schools in this country for a century
and a half.  Nearly ninety percent of Americans attend those schools.
 The fact is, of course, parental choice works.  That's why some
of those most knowledgeable about education -- including teachers'
union members, the Clintons and the Gores -- choose their own
children's' schools. 
<p>
Our vision for education reform includes a de-centralization of
decision-making which will not only be effective in getting us
&quot;back to basics,&quot;  but which will also reinvigorate
democracy at the grassroots.  One of the reasons why Goals 2000
will fail is because it saps local initiative and disperses accountability.
 There are also historical reasons.  We have attempted a more
modest, arguably a more realistic national goals effort before.
<p>
In 1984, the Reagan administration sought to set out Goals 1990.
 It hoped to have American students recoup just <I>one-half</I>
of the points lost in the SATs since the mid-60s.  Initially,
there were some hopeful upticks.  But, by the end of the decade
of the 80s, it became clear that American students were not listening
to even the best lectures from the Bully Pulpit.  In 1990, President
Reagan had retired to California, deservedly honored for his central
role in the defeat of communism, respected throughout the world
for unleashing a great and productive economy and looked to with
gratitude by millions of American families for his championing
of parental rights and traditional values.  No one criticized
Ronald Reagan for the failure of U.S. students to achieve Goals
1990. 
<p>
The education establishment says that &quot;kids deserve a place
at the table with the President.&quot;  It's an attractive soundbite.
 But it would be far better for us to have a nation of  &quot;education
mothers and fathers&quot; and empowered local education leaders
than it would be to hold out a role for the President or Congress
that is neither realistic nor constitutionally appropriate.  The
truth is, the President and Congress are always going to be preoccupied
with taxing and trading, with national defense and international
cooperation.  We need to move beyond &quot;kids as props&quot;
to show Washington's intimate concern for education. 
<p>
This Congress has before it legislation which will disestablish
the Department of Education and repeal Goals 2000.  Family Research
Council shares these objectives.  We look forward to working with
the members of this committee and with your staff to perfect it.
 We urge this committee to give the resources and the responsibility
back to the parents, taxpayers and locally elected leaders who
can most effectively act to improve education. 
<p>
To de-centralize education decision-making is to recognize once
again &quot;the genius of the people&quot; of which Madison spoke
in <I>The Federalist Papers</I>.  By disestablishing the U.S.
Department of Education and repealing Goals 2000, this Congress
will demonstrate its respect for the Constitution and, especially,
the Tenth Amendment.  This Congress will show that it listens
to the petitions and the concerns of millions of parents.  Congress
will also prove that it is serious about cutting wasteful federal
spending.  While this action may not gain this body the title
of  the &quot;Education Congress&quot; from the vested interest,
it will win for this Congress a new measure of gratitude and respect
for restoring &quot;Democracy in America.&quot;

<h2>HOMESCHOOLERS:<br>
PIONEERS OF FREEDOM</h2>
<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>Robert G. Morrison</i></center>
<p>
We have in our office &quot;Goals 1996.&quot;  We're moving a little bit
more quickly than Goals 2000.  Our goals for 1996 include the
dis-establishment of the U.S. Department of Education, to undo
what President Carter did back in 1979.  He created the department
to meet a commitment that he made to the National Education Association.
 We opposed the creation of a Department of Education in 1979,
and we've seen nothing in the last 16 years to justify its continued
existence. Our sincere belief is that the appropriate federal
role in education is no federal role in education.  Our Constitution
does not call upon our federal government to be running schools
from Washington, D.C.  We will very energetically support other
leaders in Washington trying to dis-establish the U.S. Department
of Education.  The key point is that $70 billion of our money
goes into Washington, D.C. to be spent on education, money we
think can be better spent by states and communities and localities
and, most importantly, by parents and taxpayers themselves.  Our
emphasis is going to be on local schools and local leaders.
<p>
We're also going to call for the repeal of Goals 2000 legislation which
was passed last year.  Now, Goals 2000 is one of the most important
education bills ever in this respect:  it is, in effect, the nationalization
of American public education, bringing more power and authority
into Washington, D.C.  It's very interesting that this happened
because, at the same time, the United States considered a health
care plan which was devised by Ira Magaziner and Mrs. Clinton,
a health care plan which would have centralized authority and
power and eliminated choices.  The American people and their Congress
rightly considered and, we believe, rightly rejected that idea.
  But that's because there was a serious national debate, and
we actually looked into the plan and carefully analyzed it.  Americans
understood what they were being offered and said, &quot;No, we
don't want it.&quot;
<p>
Unfortunately, we did not get the same quality
of debate and discussion about Goals 2000 that we did about the
Clinton health care plan.  Interestingly, Ira Magaziner and Hillary
Clinton played a part in devising the Goals 2000 plan over the
last half decade or more as well.  But we're not here to represent
one political party or another, and we have to be fair because
President Bush actually introduced America 2000 back in 1991.
 His Secretary of Education, Lamar Alexander, supported America
2000.  Now we think Goals 2000 is even worse than America 2000.
 But the principle had given way, and too much control was already
coming to Washington in America 2000.
<p>
It made it very difficult to leverage opposition to Goals 2000 in Washington
when a lot of the Republican members on Capitol Hill said, &quot;How
can we vote against Goals 2000?  Didn't we endorse pretty much
the same thing just a year or so ago?&quot;
<p>
We said, &quot;Yes, regrettably you did, and we were trying to talk to you about 
that, but we didn't get anyone's attention.&quot;
<p>
So now we are working on the repeal of Goals 2000.  Let me draw from my Coast 
Guard days to create a metaphor.  If you look at the Elementary and
Secondary Education Act, it's a huge liner. It's an $11.6 billion
piece of legislation, another bill to extend power and authority
over our communities.  Most states cannot say no to their share
of $11.6 billion.  If you look at Goals 2000, it doesn't look
that big.  It's only $700 million.  I realize I'm working in Washington
where you talk about a billion here, a billion there -- pretty
soon you're talking about money.   But if you think of Goals 2000
as a small tugboat guiding and pushing that huge liner, you'll
get an idea as to why Goals 2000 is so vital.  It's not that big
money is involved, but it's the power and direction that the program
gives.
<p>
One of the reasons I especially wanted to come speak to
you is to express our deep gratitude and appreciation to you as
homeschoolers for what you have done to help transform the picture
in Washington.  I'm talking about what happened last year with
H.R. 6, the Elementary and Secondary Education Act, that was going
through the House of Representatives.  When you were threatened
with something called the Miller Amendment, which had the potential
almost to outlaw private education, religious schools and homeschools
in the effect that it would have had down the line, you created
a sensation in Washington, D.C.  A sensation, I should mention,
that has never really been noticed by the Washington Post, the
New York Times, Dan Rather or Connie Chung.  Maybe we'll just
try to get Gary to whisper it to Connie Chung....
<p>
It was a major event to be there at ground zero, with hundreds of thousands
of phone calls coming in from all over America about H.R. 6. 
Not every member of Congress had been following H.R. 6 with rapt
attention.  Many of them were interested in the agriculture bill,
the trade bill, or NAFTA, or military issues or foreign trade
-- all these other things -- and they weren't too concerned about
what was going on in a committee about education.  But all of
a sudden their phones lit up.  They couldn't make any phone calls
in or out, their faxes were completely tied up, and they were
finally saying, &quot;What are they talking about?  Who are they?&quot;
 Well, there's a sign chiseled in the House of Representatives,
right over one of the passages, that says, &quot;Here, sir, the
people rule.&quot;  They are the people, sir.   That's who's calling
you.  That's where you're getting your phone calls from.  We recognize
and honor the role of leaders, leaders like Carol Lee Adams, the
homeschooling mother in New Jersey who actually brought this whole
thing to our attention.  She immediately contacted Michael Farris,
us, and a committee staff on Capitol Hill.  We certainly honor
leaders like Dr. Dobson and Gary Bauer, but none of this could
have happened if you just had a group of leaders calling each
other and expressing their indignation.  None of this earthquake
could have occurred unless there was this coast-to-coast, popular
uprising against this very dangerous bill.  So that's why I wanted
to come and thank the earthquake for what happened there.
<p>
What happened on Capitol Hill reminds me of the parable in the Gospel
of Luke of the widow and the unjust judge.  &quot;And for a while,
[the judge] was unwilling.  But afterward he said to himself,
even though I do not fear God nor respect man, yet because this
widow bothers me, I will give her legal protection, lest by her
continually coming she wear me out.&quot;   I like that, but,
of course, in Washington, not everyone likes you to cite Scripture.
 So I would recommend to those believers in the gospel of Charles
Darwin that you ought to at least recognize that you don't come
between a she-bear and her cubs.  That is a very dangerous thing
to do.
<p>
The lesson to draw from this blitz over H.R. 6 is the
need for accurate and timely communication.  We are moving very
quickly with fax networks, telephone trees, with newsletters,
with radio broadcasts, and even on the Internet.  We have the
ability to communicate with one another quickly and accurately
to check information.  That is a major step forward that is going
to be used by the pro-family movement generally, and especially
by homeschoolers.  I think it also proves to us that, in our time,
decentralization of power is a reality.  We do not believe that
Washington, D.C. has all the answers to all the problems in our
lives.  And decentralization of information is making possible
a revitalization of local democracy.  So decentralization works.
<p>
I think it also proves to us that Americans are capable.  For
a long time now we have proceeded on the idea that Americans don't
know how to run their own affairs.  With all of these legislative
measures that have come through, be it the health care plan, be
it the education plan, even in many ways in the crime bill, it
was assumed that we had to go to Washington with our hats in hands
saying, &quot;Please, our rulers, will you govern us?  Will you
somehow free us from our local problems?&quot;  The  H.R. 6 battle
proved that Americans are capable.
<p>
The homeschooling movement is much more than this remarkable episode over H.R. 6. 
I honor the commitment that homeschoolers make, and I have found some
things about the movement that I think are important to all Americans.
<p>
I know one of the first questions that you are all asked is,
&quot;How will your children be socialized if they are homsechooled?&quot;
 That has been one of the major concerns of American public education.
 I have always thought that you may fail there -- you may not
actually meet the national standards in <i>socialization</i> of kids
-- but your children will instead be <i>civilized</i> and that wouldn't
be bad at all.
<p>
You have also taught a lesson in democracy to
the entire country.  We have two drop-out problems in our country.
  One is the school drop-out rate.  But I'd say there's another
drop-out problem that gets less attention, and that's the drop-out
of citizens.  In this great free republic of ours in 1994, only
39% of eligible Americans voted in the Congressional elections.
 These were perhaps the most important Congressional elections
in a generation, yet only 39% voted.  That, by the way, was a
very good turn-out for an off-year election, the best in over
20 years.  But nonetheless, it suggested six out of 10 Americans
did not even exercise the right to vote which was bought with
blood for them.  That's not America the way it ought to be.  
We need to have more citizens engaged.  Homeschoolers are teaching
a lesson in citizen involvement that I think is very important,
and that is gaining respect, even from some people who are not
otherwise sympathetic.  William Raspberry, a leading columnist
in Washington, D.C., is generally liberal and many times writes
columns that I do not agree with.  But William Raspberry has been
kindly disposed toward homeschoolers.
<p>
Homeschoolers are doing something for all of us as American citizens, whether 
we homeschool our children or not.  A hundred years ago, Frederick Jackson Turner,
a great American historian, spoke about the closing of the American
frontier.  He cited it as a significant event in American history
because the frontier had affected the entire development of our
country and our institutions.  The famous Turner thesis was that,
if you were living on the Eastern Seaboard or in the Midwest,
and if your  employer, if your community, even if your family
or church, if any of the structured institutions in your life
became oppressive to you, if they crushed your spirit, you always
had the option of going out to territories and starting a new
life.  This westward movement was a constant in American life.
<p>
Though we no longer have that kind of frontier, homeschoolers
are pioneers in a very real sense, creating a new option, a new
frontier in education that benefits every American citizen.  By
sometimes wrestling, sometimes litigating, sometimes battling
with the state authorities, homeschoolers bring the state into
a right relationship with the citizens.  It's no longer master
and servant, senior and subject, but basically citizen and government.
 When a state government recognizes the right of parents to educate
their own children -- and note I say recognize but not grant,
because it is a <i>recognition</i> that we seek -- when the state recognizes
that right, it comes into a proper relationship and all of us
benefit.  We are all strengthened by what homeschoolers are doing.
<p>
Homeschoolers are also restoring some of the academic seriousness
in education through a commitment to educational excellence. 
So much of what we've seen in education is tragic.  In the teaching
of reading there has been an obvious &quot;dumbing down&quot;
of Americans.  The Department of Education itself admitted in
October of 1993 in a national adult literacy survey that 46% of
Americans could read at a level beyond the rudimentary level --
less than half of American adults could read anything beyond a
rudimentary level.  Now we have to have historical memory and
compare that with our own past.  James McPherson, a Civil War
historian, tells us that 90% of Union soldiers in the Civil War
were literate.  80% of Confederate soldiers in the Civil War were
literate.  Compare that with 46% today.  I would challenge any
of the opponents of homeschooling to see homeschooled children
anywhere in the United States who are not getting that vital basic
skill of reading.
<p>
I believe we must recognize what so often is
not recognized in our public education establishment:  the vital
importance of the Bible as a way to transmit literacy.  E.D. Hirsch,
a professor at the University of Virginia and neither a Christian
nor a conservative, has written a book on cultural literacy in
which he points to the Bible as the basis for English language
literacy.  He cited a fascinating example about India, where there
are over 400 languages.  In order to have a unified country, to
conduct debates in the Indian parliament or to conduct business
or commerce, Indians must speak English.  It's the only common
language they have, and the people of India must be familiar with
the Bible so they can understand the wealth of images and sayings
of the English language.  How else to understand the cultural
concepts of &quot;go the extra mile,&quot; the widow and the unjust
judge, David and Goliath and a host of other references that come
from Scripture.  Yet, our public education establishment has been
militantly opposed to imparting a greater knowledge of the Bible
to our young people.
<p>
Homeschoolers promote the importance of fiscal
responsibility.  Many of you are making a tremendous sacrifice
to educate your children, but you do so efficiently and wisely.
 In contrast, it costs the United States taxpayers in our country
some $5,500 per child to achieve not very great results in education.
 That is a national tragedy.  And all we ever hear is that they
need more, they need more.  Several years ago I met a very fine
public school principal down in Alabama who agreed with us on
so many things, yet he said, &quot;You people are always arguing
for less money for education.  We need more. And the reason that
we need more is that we don't have enough toilet paper in our
high school.  And that just is an example of how awful things
are.&quot;  Well, this roll I hold in my hand I got from a homeschool
-- I can tell you there's plenty wherever private enterprise reigns.
 The one place I know where there was a lack of such things was
on Soviet ships when they had to call Moscow and say, &quot;Hey,
we need basic commodities.&quot;  Albert Shanker, the head of
the American Federation of Teachers, has compared American public
education to Soviet agriculture, and I have an idea of what he
means.
<p>
The final thing I will say is that we've seen the involvement
of parents, of husbands and wives, coming closer together with
their children, and that has been characteristic of the homeschool
movement.  As I sat there in Washington during the H.R. 6 battle
and got hundreds of phone calls, 90% percent of them were from
mothers who were deeply concerned for the welfare of their children.
 I thought what a remarkable thing it was, and that people in
the secular political world who do studies and  write columns
ought to pay attention to this, because what you are seeing is
not a woman's movement, but a mother's movement.  You are seeing
a new movement, a new thing happening in American society.  The
feminist movement, theoretically put, argued for barriers between
mother and child in their advocacy of abortion on demand, barriers
and conflict between husbands and wives, barriers even between
women and their God.  In the homeschooling movement we have seen
all of those conflicts be resolved and all of those barriers come
down.  That's why I find homeschooling so exciting, and why I
will invite the interest of many of our friends in the press and
the academic community to study it and see this new thing happening
in America.  That's why I've come from Washington to thank you.
God bless you all.

<title>Classical Education</title>

<h2>CLASSICAL EDUCATION</h2>
<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by<br>
Fritz Hinrichs
<p>
This text is adapted from a speech given by Fritz Hinrichs
at the 1995 Homeschool Curriculum fair in San Diego, Calif.</i></center>
<p>
This talk will address two questions: what is Classical Education
and why is it necessary in our day.
<p>
The word &quot;classical&quot; or &quot;classic&quot; is used
in many contexts and often without specific meaning: Classic Coke,
classical music, classic rock.  However, classical usually means
something that through time has proven worthy of our respect and
interest.  In music, the work of certain composers has been recognized
as worth saving, while that of others, though popular in its own
time, has been tossed aside into the dust-bin of history.  The
same is true of books.  Some books are more worthy of study than
others because of the profundity and clarity with which they express
the ideas they contain.
<p>
The study of the great books has been the backbone of good education
for centuries.  If you look at the books read by the intellectual
giants in our culture, you find that particular books come up
again and again.  These books were required of most schoolboys
until the rise of Dewey and the democratization of education through
the public school system in the first half of the 20th century.
 The public school system saw these books as elitist and not easily
comprehensible by the masses and, therefore, not appropriate for
public education.
<p>
Another influence contributing to the demise of the great books
was the demoralization of the Christian intellectual community.
 Most of the institutions of learning in this country were founded
by Christians who saw it as their duty to conquer the intellectual
arena for Christ.  However, since the rise of secularism and,
especially, since the humiliating defeat that biblical Christians
suffered at the Scopes Trial, the evangelical community has been
in full retreat from the intellectual arena.  Before the turn
of the century, most institutions of learning were dominated by
those who thought from a Biblical worldview.  This consensus,
however, soon began to crumble.  In the 1925 Scopes Trial, the
public humiliation of William Jennings Bryan's creationism caused
academia, as well as the general culture, to hold biblical Christianity
as unworthy of intellectual regard.  Even though the trial was
in no way a rigorous debate of the creation issue, its effect
on the Christian intellectual community was nothing 
short of disastrous.  From that point on, Christians felt as though
the intellectual elite had humiliated them, and, in return, they
abandoned the intellectual community in droves.  The intellectual
pursuit came to be seen as not only of little value for Christians,
but also as simply antagonistic to the faith.  At this point in
history the church saw an unraveling of the Christian intellectual
tradition.  No longer would Christians apply themselves to the
study of the great thinkers; that would be a task left entirely
to those with a non-Christian world view.
<p>
Christian education has become something of a lost science.  Not
only have Christians done very little to prepare their children
to become godly intellects, but intellectual incompetence has
been seen as the true helpmate of vital spirituality.  A soft
mind has been considered a vital tool in the pursuit of a soft
heart.  In our day, mental rigor and a vigorous intellectual pursuit
are often equated with doctrinal rigidity and cold spirituality.
<p>
However, by God's grace, with the increasing interest in classical
education, we are seeing a revival of the Christian intellectual
tradition.  Classical education differs from most educational
philosophies in that it attempts to step back from the parade
of pedagogical fads that seem to keep us in a state of continual
bewilderment and asks:  &quot;What was education like in the past?
 What books were used?  What goals were thought important?&quot;
<p>
Dorothy Sayers, in her well-known essay &quot;The Lost Tools of
Learning,&quot; attempted to answer these questions and, in so
doing, gave us some very sage advice for education in our own
day.  She began by investigating the medieval model of education
and found that it was composed of two parts.  The first was called
the Trivium and the second, the Quadrivium.
<p>
The Trivium contains three areas:  Grammar, Dialectic, and Rhetoric.
 Each of these three areas suits to a specific stage of a child's
mental development.   During his early years, a child studies
the Grammar portion of the Trivium.  The Grammar period (ages
9-11) is based on memorization and the acquisition of foundational
facts.  During their younger years, children possess a great natural
ability to memorize large amounts of material even though they
may not understand its significance.  This is the time to fill
them full of facts:  multiplication tables, geography, dates,
events, plant and animal classifications-- anything that lends
itself to easy repetition and assimilation by the mind.  The Grammar
stage lends itself to the study of language, especially an ancient
language such as Latin or Greek, which requires much memorization
of grammatical structures.
<p>
During the second period, the Dialectic (ages 12-14), the child's
greater reasoning ability prompts him to ask questions based on
the information gathered in the Grammar stage.  The child no longer
sees the facts he has learned as merely separate pieces of information.
 Through questioning, he begins to develop logical relationships
between facts.  The American Revolution is no longer a mere fact
in history; it must be understood in light of the child's whole
scope of knowledge.  For example, how are the actions of the American
revolutionaries to be understood in relation to our responsibility
to obey the governing authorities?  How can the fact that Washington
and Jefferson are both held up as great men be reconciled with
the fact that they were slave-holders?
<p>
When a child comes to the age of ability to reason, he frequently
uses his reason to make a nuisance of himself by back-talking
to his parents or trying to catch them in some error or fallacy.
 This sometimes irritating new ability of the young mind should
be directed towards profitable mental exercises.  The study of
formal logic can aid greatly because it teaches the student the
rules that guide sound thinking.  Many subject areas provide good
practice material for the young mind.  Historical events often
pose questions of morality requiring a good deal of discussion
and careful reasoning.  Theology also gives many opportunities
for debate.  Though our discussion must be seasoned with reverence
for the subject matter as well as for our opponents, fundamentally
we can see theological debate as a very healthy and beneficial
activity.  A less controversial but equally powerful tool for
cultivating logic is the study of mathematics.  For thousands
of years the geometry text written by the ancient Greek mathematician
Euclid has provided a beautifully constructed series of geometrical
proofs that, with guidance, any perceptive child can work through
with great benefit to his or her thinking skills.
<p>
The third period Dorothy Sayers mentions is that of Rhetoric (ages
14-16).  At this age, the child moves from merely grasping the
logical sequence of arguments to learning how to present them
in a persuasive, aesthetically pleasing form.  Sayers also calls
this the Poetic age, because expression becomes as important as
logical content.  During this period the student can begin to
study areas of interest in greater depth in preparation for the
Quadrivium, in which students specialize in particular areas of
study.  In the Rhetoric period, students more inclined towards
either mathematics and science or literature and the humanities
can pursue the area of their natural abilities.  The pursuit of
particular subjects is appropriate at this stage because a student
who had been given a classical education would have the thinking
skills and mental discipline and other tools of learning necessary
to tackle the difficulties associated with almost any area of
study.
<p>
In modern education, we have put the proverbial cart before the
horse by expecting students to master a great number of subjects
before they have mastered the tools of learning.  Even though
the study of language and logic may seem dull in themselves, they
equip a student with the tools needed for mastering any particular
subject, whether it be Scottish political history or carburetor
maintenance.  As Sayers states in the conclusion of her essay,
&quot;The sole true end of education is simply this:  to teach
men how to learn for themselves; and whatever instruction fails
to do this is effort spent in vain.&quot;
<p>
&quot;Learning to learn for oneself&quot; certainly well summarizes
the pedagogical goal of classical education; however, once equipped
with the ability to learn, where shall one go from there?  Another
truism is helpful here:  &quot;Education is merely selling someone
on books.&quot;  To be able to learn for yourself does not mean
that you no longer need a teacher, but rather that you are capable
of making books your teachers without the aid of an instructor
to explain the books to you.  In our day and age we seem to be
quite impressed by the number of years one has spent in the academic
institutions obtaining degrees.  The ancients, however, would
probably have thought our institutions must be quite poor since
they rarely produce students who are able to learn independently.
 That a student still needs an instructor to explain the works
he is reading shows a sad level of intellectual dependency.  We
seem to think that intellectual adolescence must be indefinitely
prolonged before granting a young scholar the right to stand on
his own two feet.  The fact that you leave the academic institution
should not be a sign that your education has come to an end, rather
it should show that you are ready for it to begin.
<p>
If we ask, &quot;Which books are worthy teachers?&quot;,  the
answer usually depends on what we are attempting to learn.  If,
however, the question is, &quot;Which are the truly great books?&quot;,
we find there is actually fairly broad agreement.  There are books
that through history have shown enduring value.  With the Bible
we have a canon comprised of those books that God, through his
Spirit, has directed the Church to acknowledge as authoritative;
so also with the great books there is a canon of sorts.  Through
time certain books have generally come to be viewed as central
to the development of western culture and have had an unusually
large impact due to the profundity and eloquence with which they
have expressed their ideas.  These books form the core of the
western intellectual tradition; it is the ideas contained in them
that have formed the saga known as western history.
<p>
Anyone who has grown up in the West and desires to understand
the cultural milieu in which they have been raised should read
these books.  In order to come to a self-conscious understanding
of the ideas that have shaped the culture around us, we need to
face the ideas at the source from which they came.  Francis Schaeffer
had an excellent sense for the top-down flow of ideas.  He was
fond of explaining  how ideas began with the philosophers, worked
down through the universities, into the popular media and finally
into the general culture.  Because ideas progress in this manner,
it behooves us to become acquainted with ideas at their fount
so that we may understand their manifestations in our present
culture.  Thus, the reading of the great books serves an important
apologetic function for Christians.
<p>
When I describe the study of the great books as a tool in apologetics,
people often visualize their study as something of a brutal secular
gauntlet the Christian must run in order to gain intellectual
credibility.  This is a mistaken understanding.  Certainly there
is much in the western intellectual tradition that must be consciously
rejected and put under biblical criticism, but it is the non-believer
and not the Christian who must fear the reading of the great books.
 Those who through the promotion of political correctness would
return us to polytheistic paganism have come to realize that they
must entirely throw out the study of western culture if they are
going to reshape the thinking of our students.  Western thought
has been permeated with Christian monotheism and, thus, a persistent
concept of objective and universal truth, so it will always be
dangerous territory for the mental slugs that political correctness
would raise up on its diet of insipid relativism. 
<p>
Certainly the study of the great books should not be taken lightly.
 There are serious hazards to one's faith that lurk, but studying
through the great books often is like the trouble-filled journey
of Christian in <I>Pilgrim's Progress</I>.  Just about the time
that you think all is lost and that the darkness is certainly
coming in around and you feel that you will surely be done in,
an author who is a friend of the Faith comes to your side and
helps guide you back to the path of truth.  For every Aristotle,
there is an Augustine; when you are in the throes of a skeptical
Descartes, the brilliant faith of Pascal comes to your aid; when
under attack by Hume, you have a friend in Calvin; when besieged
by Kant, you fight back with Lewis.  God in his providential care
has given us a bountiful number of voices who have stood in the
gap at crucial periods of our history and spoken for His truth.
 The men God has raised up to speak His truth to our culture are
a testimony to the tremendous care with which He has guided the
West.
<p>
We live in the continuum of western history.  In order to evaluate
this stream of which we are a part, we must step back from it
and discern the ideas that have shaped it.  To attempt to ignore
the ideas that have shaped our cultural history is to guarantee
ourselves not only cultural irrelevance but also entrenchment
in the Christian ghetto.  This position not only will lead to
our own intellectual poverty but also will disgrace the Sovereign
God who needs not be mocked by the cowardice of His children.
 The King's children do not hide in the alleys but walk confidently
knowing that the sun that shines belongs to their Father.

<title>HEARING ON RELIGIOUS LIBERTY</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">
<h2>HEARING ON RELIGIOUS LIBERTY</h2>
<h4>Testimony of Cathleen A. Cleaver, Esq.<br>
Director of Legal Studies, Family Research Council<br>
before the<br>
Committee on the Judiciary<br>
of the<br>
United States Senate<br>
October 25, 1995</h4></center>
<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>
Mr. Chairman and Members of the Committee, I am the Director of
Legal Studies for the Family Research Council, a non-profit research
and advocacy organization, established to defend family, faith,
and freedom.  On behalf of Gary Bauer and the Family Research
Council, I want to express our sincere appreciation for the opportunity
to address this distinguished Committee on the critical issue
of religious liberty.
<p>
The First Amendment is not internally inconsistent.  The Establishment
Clause[1] was designed to prevent the State from coercing a religious
belief. The Free Exercise Clause[2] was designed to prevent the
State from interfering with the exercise of religious beliefs.
Thus, the religion clauses were designed to work hand-in-hand
to promote government neutrality with regard to religion.
<p>
In the last several decades, however, the Supreme Court has wrongly
interpreted the clauses to be antagonistic to each other.  The
Court has created a false conflict between the religion clauses
which must be reconciled in each case, and the Establishment Clause
prohibition has been the usual victor.  &quot;The government cannot
avoid aiding religion unless it actively opposes religion,&quot;
the argument goes.  More often than not, discrimination against
citizens or groups with religious viewpoints has become the only
constitutionally &quot;safe&quot; resolution to this false conflict.
Insistence on avoiding appearances of endorsement of or incidental
aid to religion has worked to inhibit the free exercise of religion.
Complementary clauses read to be inconsistent could not but 
result in inconsistent rulings.  The current &quot;chaos&quot;
in the federal courts in this area, therefore, is distressing,
but not surprising.
<p>
On October 20th, this Committee heard testimony from a distinguished
panel of experts who discussed the history of interpretation errors
in First Amendment religion clause jurisprudence, and efforts
to correct those errors by various federal statutes.  I will not
repeat this testimony, nor will I refute the argument that nothing
need be done, for the acceptability of that position is increasingly
waning.[3]
<p>
I will, instead, attempt to explain our preference for a constitutional
amendment rather than a federal statute, and address specific
concerns which have been raised in the public debate. 
<p>
The Family Research Council supports an amendment to the constitution
clarifying the First Amendment's prohibition of discrimination
against religious expression, and against persons, groups, or
organizations in access to government benefits or protections
on account of the religious character of their speech or identity.
We do not favor changing the First Amendment in any way.  Rather,
we support an amendment which would correct the Supreme Court's
misinterpretation of the First Amendment.
<p>
Several concerns and questions have been raised about the amendment
approach and its ramifications.
<p>
<B>1. Is such a radical approach really necessary?</B>  First,
it is wise to keep from confusing <I>procedure</I> with <I>substance.</I>
Amending the constitution is a radical procedure, to be sure.
Article V of the Constitution ensures that it is not to be achieved
without effort and consensus.  Yet, the substance of a restorative
religious liberty amendment need not be radical in nature.  Legal
experts and numerous interested groups have examined potential
approaches for months, and the Family Research Council remains
willing to continue to discuss specific language for the amendment.
We are especially eager to hear your specific ideas, Mr. Chairman,
and those of Congressman Hyde. For purposes of discussion this
morning, I will center my comments on the draft proposal garnering
considerable support, and presented to this Committee at the October
20th hearing:[4]
<p><blockquote>
<b>In order to secure the unalienable right of the people to
acknowledge, worship, and serve their Creator, neither the United
States nor any State shall deny benefits to or otherwise discriminate
against any persons, acting in a private capacity, on account
of their religious expression, belief, or identity; and the exercise
by such persons of freedom of religion, speech, press, or association
shall not be construed as an establishment of religion.</b>
</blockquote><p>
This language would, in effect, say to government, &quot;do not
discriminate against persons on account of their religious beliefs,&quot;
and to the Supreme Court, &quot;do not construe this non-discriminatory
treatment to be a governmental establishment of religion.&quot;
The fact that some civil liberties groups call the Amendment
extreme does not make it so.  It is a negative mandate upon government:
do not discriminate and do not misconstrue.  It bestows no new
rights, it apportions no new responsibilities.  Far from &quot;injecting
the federal government into the situation&quot; as some critics
perceive, the Religious Liberty Amendment  protects religious
liberty by ensuring government neutrality toward religion.  The
Amendment is not radical in substance.  Indeed, it is nothing
more than an embodiment of First Amendment principles properly
understood.
<p>
<B>2.  If it is not radical, why is it necessary?</B>  It is necessary
to correct serious misinterpretations of a Constitution provision.
 It is restorative, not creative.  The amendment process is an
appropriate means of clarifying the Constitution of the People.
Several constitutional amendments have been in the nature of clarifications,
especially the voting rights amendments.
<p>
<B>3.  Some suggest that the Court is coming around on its own,
obviating the need for an amendment</B>. <i>Rosenberger v. University
of Virginia</i> is generally cited here.[5] <i>Rosenberger</i>,
however, like other 5-4 decisions with multiple opinions, is a
very fact-dependent decision.  In reversing the University of
Virginia's decision to withhold student activity funds for a Christian
student magazine, Justice Kennedy found it important that Wide
Awake Productions, the publisher, was not a &quot;religious organization&quot;
and that the funds would go to a printing company rather than
directly to the student publication.[6] Moreover, Justice O'Connor
warned in her concurrence that <i>Rosenberger</i> is not meant
to establish any bright-line test.[7] Despite its disclaimers and
reservations, <i>Rosenberger</i> was a good result, yet there
is simply no reason to conclude that <i>Rosenberger</i> signals
a new consistency in religion clause jurisprudence.  Indeed, Justice
Souter in his dissent went so far as to say that neutrality toward
religion is not required by the First Amendment.  It could be
years before another religious discrimination case of this kind
is taken up by the high court.  In the meantime, some Americans'
precious First Amendment rights are held in abeyance, the deprivation
of which is an irreparable harm.
<p>
<B>4.  Will a Religious Liberty Amendment prevent any future misconstruction
of the Religion Clauses?</B>  No.  And it is, of course,  possible
that the Amendment itself will be misconstrued.  Any assertion
to the contrary would be disingenuous.  But to concede these points
does not then force a concession that the Amendment will be futile
or meaningless.  The Supreme Court made a wrong turn in 1947 in
<i>Everson v. Board of Education</i>;[8] momentum and the weighty principle of 
<I>stare decisis</I>[9] have worked against the Court's righting itself.
Even considering the possibility of misinterpretation, an amendment
would dislodge the Court from its faulty construction of internal
inconsistency in the First Amendment.
<p>
<B>5. Will the Amendment create a new entitlement program for
church-related programs or schools?</B>  No. Government has no
obligation to provide funds to private schools, for example. 
Yet, if government should decide to do so, a Religious Liberty
Amendment would prevent the government from discriminating in
favor of private secular schools and against private parochial
schools.[10] The Amendment would <I>permit</I> government to fund
secular classes in religious schools, but would not <I>require</I>
government to fund such classes.   Religious activities would
not be funded by the government -- the Amendment would not eradicate
the Establishment Clause, after all -- but activities conducted
in religious settings or by religious people could be funded,
if such activities were within the purview of the secular government
funding program.  The &quot;pervasively sectarian&quot; or &quot;pervasively
religious&quot; analysis would be abandoned.
<p>
<B>6. Would an Amendment allow teacher-led prayer?</B> No. 
The Amendment would ensure that persons in their private capacity
would be free from discrimination, but government employees, including
teachers, would be subject to the restrictions of the Establishment
Clause when acting in their official capacity, such as when teaching.
<p>
<B>7. Why not seek a statutory remedy?</B>  A federal statute
could ultimately be futile.  While such a statute would initially
resolve inconsistencies from state to state,[11] the Supreme Court
would remain the final arbiter of the Constitution.  A federal
statute would not prevent judges from continuing to misconstrue
the First Amendment.  While a statute might survive a facial challenge,
an &quot;as applied&quot; challenge would quite possibly be adjudged
unconstitutional under current precedent.  A statutory &quot;solution&quot;
would be a hollow victory, if, at the end of the day, the substantial
efforts to draft, enact, and defend a statute were swiftly abolished
by one Supreme Court opinion.  When the roof is leaking, repair
the roof -- don't buy more buckets.
<p>
The Religious Liberty Amendment could be thought of as the religious
&quot;neutrality&quot; amendment.  This principle of neutrality
is not new -- it is the aim and result of our First Amendment's
religion clauses properly understood.  A Religious Liberty Amendment
could restore this saving principle, so that our First Amendment
would not be used to promote the empty state religion of secularism, but to 
promote true freedom, and the prospect of freedom's fulfillment in truth, 
to which every American is entitled.

<title>THE LEGACY OF THE NEW JERSEY FAMILY CAP</title>

<h2>THE LEGACY OF THE NEW JERSEY<br>
FAMILY CAP:</h2>
<h4>A BLUEPRINT FOR THE STATES</h4></center>
<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<center><i>by<br>
Jennifer E. Marshall</i></center>
<p>
When the states begin to reassess welfare policy in the wake of
new federal legislation, the defining issue will be the family
cap.  A well-rounded debate over the family cap will ask and answer
fundamental questions about the future of social policy in a post-entitlement
world -- and few questions beg right answers quite so urgently.
<p>
A modest first step, the family cap would simply deny an increase
in the AFDC cash benefits to mothers who bear additional children
while on welfare.  The &quot;restriction&quot; is scant in proportion
to the scale of devastation wrought by open-ended checks.
<p>
In many instances, those checks have reduced the birth father
to no more than a passing stranger, and marriage is teetering
on the brink of anachronism in communities with a high concentration
of welfare recipients.  To the extent that the state provides
ready alternatives, marriage, work, and self-sufficiency will
inevitably seem a little less hallowed, a little less than necessary.
<p>
The purpose of the family cap is, not to reduce births per se,
but to restore a sense of personal responsibility by insisting
that families on welfare live by the same values and confront
exactly the same choices as the general population.  The working
poor, for example, receive no increase in salary when another
child is added to the family.  Lowering our expectations of a
woman on welfare and the father of her child is no different from
lowering our estimation of their capability -- implying that they
are a different, less human kind of breed than the rest of us
who can and do live by the rules.
<p>
In his 1988 book <I>In Pursuit of Happiness and Good Government</I>,
Charles Murray argues that self-respect is an essential human
need and that the threshold condition for self-respect is accepting
responsibility for one's own life.  Self-determination must be
authentic, however.  An &quot;as if&quot; condition does not suffice.
Thus, Murray concludes, &quot;self-respect is not within the gift of any 
government or any policy. . . .  The only thing that government can do is
provide an environment within which people can earn their self-respect&quot;[1]
by earning their own way in the world.  If children are suffering
because parents are irresponsible, no amount of government money
can allay the suffering -- because the parents will still be irresponsible.
<p>
But Murray also defines self-respect as &quot;measuring up to
internalized standards of what it means to be a full-fledged member
of the community.&quot;[2] Government policy that dumbs down the
standards for welfare recipients so that &quot;measuring up&quot;
no longer has any content, or makes any economic sense, does violence
to the human spirit.  It's also singularly unjust.  Women on welfare
should have equal opportunity to follow the playbook that for
centuries has been the surest guarantor of human happiness.  What
Edmund Burke wrote long ago is even more true today: &quot;We
know that we have made no discoveries, and we think that no discoveries
are to be made, in morality.&quot;  Yet, we perpetuate a welfare
system that makes it harder for men and women to pursue virtuous
living.
<p>
Arguments against the current system rest not on value premises
exclusively but on empirical fact, confirmed by social science
data, that adult satisfaction depends on earning one's own way
and that children's well-being depends critically on a stable
family life.[3]  A proper concept of justice places a premium, not
on securing any particular material result, but on upholding the
social agreement that men and women work for their bread and wait
to bear children until they are emotionally and financially able
to provide for their support.  Certainly, we should question the
justice of requiring working men and women to uphold the rules
while spending their hard-earned tax dollars to subsidize the
systematic violation of those rules.
<p>
The central problem with the welfare system is that it deranges
social expectations regarding work and marriage by turning nature's
rewards and penalties on end.  Asserting that everyone possesses
moral autonomy is not the same as asserting that everyone possesses
equal capacity to sort through the mixed signals of a policy that
obliterates natural consequences and denies virtue its full reward
by making crimes against the social compact pay.
<p>
Again, however, the argument for the family cap rests, not on
value premises alone, but on certain assumptions about human nature
and social causation that are empirically verifiable.  And the
most recent data from New Jersey's experiment with the family
cap provide powerful evidence that proponents of the cap are indeed
correct in their assumptions.
<p>
In the sixteen months after the family cap took effect in August
of 1993, the average monthly birth rate for women on AFDC in New
Jersey declined by 10 percent or more -- a durable, sizable, and
real reduction in the birth rate.[4] When the denominator is restricted
to women of childbearing age (15-45 years old), whose youngest
child is at least 10 months old and who have been on AFDC for
at least 12 months, the reported birth rate decreased by 17.6
percent over the 12-month period immediately following implementation
of the Family Development Program (FDP).[5]
<p>
While the time series data is significant, the most interesting
piece of evidence to date surfaced in a memo leaked to the press
from the formal evaluation study at Rutgers University.  According
to the memo, the Rutgers study has found no significant difference
in the rate of births to women in the &quot;experimental&quot;
group, who are subject to the restriction on additional cash benefits,
and women in the &quot;control&quot; group, who are exempt from
the cash limitation.
<p>
<b>Contrary to press reports, the null difference between the
experimental and control birth rates does NOT imply that the cap
has had no impact on births to AFDC women.  The correct explanation
for the null difference is that births dropped within both groups
after the new policy took effect.  The family cap, in other words,
has had an even larger and more dramatic impact on births than
expected.[6]</b>
<p>
Explaining the scope of that effect is an exercise in charting
a much broader agenda for political and cultural reform.  While
the family cap is no panacea, it is a critical first step that
logically implies both the destination desired and the reforms
that will be required -- to renew the ethic of individual responsibility
and personal compassion that will restore moral authority to the
Founders' notion of liberty.  The logic of the family cap insists
that relimiting government is itself a moral imperative.
<p>
The most plausible explanation for the success of the New Jersey
cap is that the change in policy sent a clear moral signal that
was at least as important an aspect of the &quot;treatment&quot;
as the restriction on cash benefits.  Dr. Rudy Myers of the New
Jersey Department of Human Services explains:
<p><blockquote>
[T]he treatment in FDP [New Jersey's Family Development Program]
is <I>not </I>a matter of whether or not the AFDC grant is increased
with the birth of the additional child, but is, rather, a matter
of whether or not the individual is exposed to the public publicity
itself -- e.g., newspapers, conversations at the Laundromat, talk
radio, etc.  Suffice it to say that it is extremely implausible
that anyone living in New Jersey for the past several years has
<I>not </I>been exposed to the &quot;family cap&quot; policy.
 &quot;Policy&quot; here cannot be restricted to meaning simply
the law about the family cap; it is the entire line of reasoning
about issues of personal and family responsibility, fairness to
working taxpayers, [and] the rational approach to self-sufficiency.[7]
</blockquote><p>
Because the public discussion of the ideas and values motivating
the law reached women in both the &quot;treatment&quot; and &quot;control&quot;
groups, Dr. Myers concludes that the control group condition cannot
be considered a reasonable proxy for eliminating the effect of
the cap altogether.
<p>
Contrary to liberal rhetoric about the &quot;punitive&quot; nature
of the cap, the success of the New Jersey policy rests on the
power of social persuasion.  The $44 benefit increase eliminated
by the family cap constituted only 4 percent of the total monthly
welfare benefits received by the average AFDC mother in New Jersey.[8]
Those who cry &quot;social engineering&quot; should bear in mind
that the cash limitation itself merely restores government neutrality
after a long interlude of active government favoritism to out-of-wedlock births. 
Women are free to bear as many children as they wish, at their own expense. 
A law with as modest an economic disincentive as the New Jersey
cap almost certainly derives its force from new moral sanctions
against illegitimate childbearing and other personal failings.
<p>
Critics of the cap now question whether a public relations campaign
promoting personal responsibility could be sufficiently forceful
to obviate the need for changes in current welfare policy.  Those
critics forget that laws are indeed moral signaling devices, that
policies cannot belie principles, and that governments cannot
instill a sense of responsibility <I>and </I>provide material
support at the same time.  A public relations campaign is not
sufficient precisely because welfare obviates the need for personal
responsibility and because the &quot;as if&quot; condition, Charles
Murray discovers, does not hold.
<p>
The family cap may be less important than the shift in social
norms that it reflects, but it is a prerequisite for real reform
because it reconciles the current tension between moral knowledge
and the perverse economic incentives of welfare.  The family cap
is an indictment, not of welfare recipients, but of the welfare
system itself.  Illegitimacy, for example, used to be controlled
in large part by the natural economic consequences, until the
economics of welfare intervened to blunt the effect.  Policymakers
will find it impossible to reaffirm a family's ability to meet
their own needs, or even to insist that parenting is a fundamental
and enduring responsibility, without reversing the economic signals
that have sent the opposite message for the last 30 years.  Economic
disincentives to virtue ultimately derange social expectations
so that morality itself no longer has meaning.
<p>
While the family cap will be a necessary first step, by no means
will it prove sufficient to reverse the damage.  Policymakers
should move quickly to terminate cash benefits to unwed minor
mothers and to provide a refundable tax credit to married couples
with children when at least one spouse is employed.  Both policy
recommendations address powerful economic disincentives to marriage
left intact by an exclusive focus on the family cap.  Proactive
measures to encourage family formation, like a tax credit for
adoption expenses, are strongly advisable as well.
<p>
Yet, New Jersey's experiment with the cap demonstrates that the
solution cannot rest entirely with the welfare system or with
new legislation.  Even with the family cap in place, yielding
surprisingly strong results, roughly 10 percent of the state's
unwed welfare mothers continue to bear children each year.[9] If
the family cap derives its power from a larger cultural context,
publicizing the moral reasoning behind the change in law, clearly
all institutions in the community must redouble their efforts
to send strong, unequivocal messages advocating personal and parental
responsibility.
<p>
Perhaps the most compelling argument for the cap is that it is
a symbolic first attempt to begin scaling back the government
programs that have eroded the strength of character-forming institutions
-- the family, the church, the school -- by negating their function.
 An astute Frenchman by the name of Tocqueville identified the
fatal error in policies that seek to take the trouble out of living by 
supplanting voluntary arrangements. &quot;The power of the state,&quot; 
he wrote, &quot;would resemble parental authority if, fatherlike, it tried to 
prepare its charges for a man's life, but on the contrary, it only tries to keep 
them in perpetual childhood.&quot;
<p>
It is time to acknowledge that public policy can undermine, but
never instill, virtue and that restoring the concept of responsibility
implies new obligations, not only for welfare recipients, 
but for members of the middle and upper classes too.  Unless neighbors
are once again moved to trouble over each other, the behavioral
poverty of the underclass will only continue to grow more acute,
jeopardizing personal freedoms and ultimately the survival of
the republic itself.  Children must grow to appreciate what is
great and good in order to make good use of liberty; and even
parents depend on the interplay of thoughtful neighbors to help
pattern right habits of the heart.
<p>
Politicians, for their part, can create the enabling conditions
that foster strong families and communities.  And in addition
to cutting government programs, policymakers should revise the
tax code to encourage charitable giving.  States should also consider
designing executive measures like the Faith and Families program
Governor Fordice has implemented in Mississippi to help speed
the replacement of state solutions by strong civil institutions.[10]
<p>
Ultimately, however, politicians will be dependent on the quiet
saints who man soup kitchens and staff maternity homes to inspire
moral renewal in our land -- to teach man to defend liberty more
for the love of virtue and charity than as a claim of  right or
an end in itself.
<p>
The fate of our experiment with self-government will depend upon
our ability to renew a sense of responsibility across all income
classes, along with a renewed commitment to our Founding Fathers'
faith that all men are created equal to live up to those responsibilities.
<p>
At stake is the future of freedom, but also morality, community,
and family -- all of which depend critically on the preservation
of liberty.  Living in the afterglow of new federal welfare legislation
that has ended the entitlement status of welfare, we would do
well to remember that freedom itself <i>is</i> an entitlement
owed every man by virtue of his birth.

<title>HOW SOCIAL SECURITY AFFECTS THE TAX REFORM DEBATE</title>

<h2>HOW SOCIAL SECURITY<br>
AFFECTS THE TAX REFORM<br>
DEBATE</h2>
<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by<br>
William R. Mattox, Jr.</center>
<p>
This speech was given at the Heritage Foundation Resource Bank
Meeting on April 27, 1995 in Philadelphia, Pa.</i>
<p>
This morning's topic is going on the offensive and in thinking
about the range of ideas one could talk about, I was struck by
how many opportunities we now have before us -- and how many of
these ideas would not have even been worthy of discussion just
a short time ago.
<p>
Indeed, today everything is on the table -- except Social Security,
which is why I'd like to devote most of my remarks this morning
to Social Security.  Now, I'm not going to advance any new ideas
about Social Security reform.  I'm not even going to talk about
Social Security directly.
<p>
Instead, I'm going to talk about why anti-family biases inherent
in the Social Security system <b>must</b> be taken into consideration
when we seek to legislate in other areas -- most especially in
pursuing a conservative tax cut agenda.  As you know, the House
recently passed the American Dream Restoration Act -- the crown
jewel of the Contract with America.
<p>
The centerpiece of this measure is a $500 tax credit for children.
Within the conservative movement, there are three views of this
pro-family tax cut:
<p>
1. <b>Social issues conservatives</b> love it and often make
a case for it by citing the extraordinary erosion in per-child
tax benefits since 1950.
<p>
2. <b>Deficit hawks</b> hate it.  They perceive it to be a revenue
drain and claim Americans don't want tax cuts as much as they
want deficit reduction.  This is a questionable proposition, but
even if true, there is nothing that says you can't do both.
<p>
3. <b>Supply-siders</b> are torn about pro-family tax relief.
 On the one hand, most agree with Milton Friedman who says he
has never seen a tax cut he didn't like; and most appreciate the
political argument that pro-family tax relief can enhance the chances 
of passing capital gains cuts and cuts in spending programs.  On the 
other hand, most supply siders see no short-term payoff in terms of 
economic growth -- and for this reason, many want to do the least 
amount necessary to secure pro-family votes.
<p>
Now, I share the supply-siders' interest in growth, but I believe
there is a very compelling economic argument for making pro-family tax relief
our top tax-cut priority.  Allan Carlson of the Rockford Institute
has argued that the Social Security system robs parents of the
social insurance value of their children.  That is, if there were
no old-age social insurance scheme, adults in our society would
have an economic incentive to invest a portion of their time and
money in the rearing of children in order to protect themselves
against the prospect of being destitute in old age.
<p>
Now, Carlson is not suggesting that childrearing is the only means
of protecting oneself against poverty in old age.  Certainly,
one can and should save for such purposes.  Nor is Carlson suggesting
that this economic incentive is, or ever should be, the primary
motivation for raising children.  Certainly, moral imperatives
are, or should be, far more significant factors.  But Carlson
believes moral principles and economic forces should work in harmony.
Yet, in our current system, moral and economic forces are in
conflict.  In our current system, it is economically foolish to
invest in childrearing, for under Social Security productive adults
can live it up today on the resources that might otherwise be
diverted to childrearing and live it up tomorrow on the resources
Social Security takes from other people's adult children and gives
to them.
<p>
This bias calls for fundamental reform of the Social Security
system.  But if such reform cannot even be discussed, then it
is incumbent upon us to offset these anti-family effects through
some other means -- the most logical being per-child tax savings.
 How much in per-child tax savings would be necessary to neutralize
the Social Security system's anti-child bias?  By my calculations,
$2,100 -- and I'll be happy to explain later how I arrived at
that figure if anyone wants to know.
<p>
When one considers that most children offer their parents less
than $400 in tax savings, you can appreciate why some of us pro-family
yahoos hardly regard $500 in addition tax savings as excessive.
Not only does Social Security indirectly discourage people from
having children, but it indirectly discourages them from raising
kids well.  Indeed, under the current system, workaholics who
neglect their childrearing responsibilities do not stand to suffer
economically if their kids grow up to be dolts or sloths (so long
as everybody else's kids can produce enough to keep the
Social Security system afloat).  But in a natural economy free
of old-age entitlements, neglectful parents would stand to lose
much.
<p>
To offset Social Security's bias against investments of parental
time and attention, Carlson argues that we not only need an income
tax -- but a progressive one at that.  A progressive income tax,
he argues, has the effect of causing parents at some point to
shift their attention from paid work to the unpaid work of raising children.
Now, I have little reason to believe that Carlson's enthusiasm
for a progressive income tax is widely shared by many here.
<p>
But lest one think his view represents a threat to the <b>adoption</b>
of a flat tax, it should be noted that, for all practical purposes,
we already have a flat tax.  That's right, when one <b>combines</b>
current income tax rates with current Social Security tax rates,
nearly all taxpayers have a marginal tax rate of roughly 30 percent.
Crudely speaking, for those making below $60,000, this rate is
divided almost equally between a 15 percent income tax rate and
a 15 percent payroll tax.  For most of those making over $60,000,
this 30 percent is derived from a 28 percent income tax rate and
a 2 percent Medicare tax.  While this is a reality that all of
the leading &quot;flat tax&quot; plans currently ignore, it is
a reality that need not threaten many of the appealing features
of such plans -- features like eliminating tax withholding, simplifying
tax forms, and getting rid of many tax write-offs and deductions.
<p>
One tax deduction that ought not to be scrapped, however, is the
charitable deduction.  From the standpoint of economic theory,
I do not know whether there is a compelling reason for preserving
the charitable deduction.  I suspect there is -- but it really
doesn't matter, because the short-run political argument for preserving
the charitable tax deduction is so powerful that no other argument
is perhaps necessary.  If one of our major goals is, as it should
be, dismantling the welfare state, then I think we should recognize
that few Americans are likely to view as credible any agenda which
simultaneously seeks to gut public housing and to eliminate tax
incentives for giving to Habitat for Humanity.  If you think the
public drubbing conservatives took on school lunch was bad, wait
until you see what the Left would do with that.
<p>
Unless we are more troubled by charitable tax deductions than
AFDC and public housing, I think we should steer clear of any
tax simplification plan that eliminates charitable contributions.
Indeed, if we truly want to dismantle the welfare state, I think
we ought to be looking at ways to expand charitable deductions
to non-itemizers as well as ways to permit taxpayers to divert
a portion of their tax liability to a charitable cause of their
choosing.
<p>
Having devoted most of my speech to the indirect effect of Social
Security on various tax issues, I want to close my remarks by
talking about restoring the social institution that provides greater
security -- yes, greater social security -- than any other.  It's
the institution of marriage.  And it is in serious shape.
<p>
My friends, no proactive idea being talked about at this conference
is likely to prevent the eventual collapse of our civilization
unless we see a restoration of lifelong marriage.  While the factors
influencing family breakdown are primarily moral or cultural,
there are at least a few policy ideas worth exploring in these
arenas.
<p>
<i>At the state and local level, we need to be:</i>
<ul><p>
<li>Advancing divorce reform initiatives which require fault to
be established in cases where one spouse wishes to contest the
divorce.  (Current law now favors the spouse wanting to leave
the marriage rather than the one wishing to save the marriage.)
<p>
<li>Advancing tough anti-illegitimacy measures in the context
of welfare reform.
<p>
<li>Promoting abstinence-based programs in schools where sex education
is taught.
<p></ul>
<i>At the federal level we need to:</i>
<ul><p>
<li>Eliminate the Legal Services Corporation, which finances some
300,000 divorces a year.
<p>
<li>Address the perplexing problem of the tax treatment of marriage
in a manner that helps all married couples -- perhaps with a tax
provision tied not just to marital status, but to marital length.
 By extending larger tax benefits with each year a couple stays
together, the tax code could pass along the societal savings of
marital stability to those who have avoided divorce the longest.
</ul><p>
While it is important for us to recognize the virtues of these
pro-family policy reforms, it is also important for us to recognize
the limitations of all policy instruments.  Pro-family tax relief,
for example, will not make husbands love their wives or children
respect their parents.  It will not clean up filthy T.V. or remove
child predators from our streets.  Pro-family tax relief will
not, by itself, magically solve the various social problems facing
America's families, neighborhoods and communities.
<p>
But pro-family tax relief will make it easier for families to
thrive by reducing economic stress.  It will make it easier for
parents to monitor their children's T.V. viewing habits by freeing
them to spend more time with their children.  It will empower
parents to address many family needs that only they can meet.
<p>
This is why pro-family tax relief is so critical -- and why all
parts of the conservative movement ought to embrace it enthusiastically.

<p>
This speech was the keynote address at the Lutherans for Life
National Convention on November 3, 1995 in Chicago, Illinois.</i>
<p>
People in Washington have particular trouble, it seems, with words
that communicate the things we feel most deeply. We are currently
involved in a great controversy with one of our best friends.
Bill Bennett is a man I've honored and worked for. He has written
letters to Dr. James Dobson and conservative activist Paul Weyrich
taking sharp issue with them over the question of abortion.
<p>
Bennett is a wise man, a man of great learning and experience.
When he speaks, it pays to listen.  In speaking of abortion, Bennett
asks if it would not be better to support a candidate for president
who would actually speak out <I>against</I> abortion, a man who
would support teen abstinence programs that work, a man who would
champion adoption instead of abortion? Wouldn't such a man help
to lower the terrible toll of one and a half million abortions
a year, even if he remained committed to the continuing legality
of abortion? Wouldn't it be better to back someone of high moral
character, Bennett continues, someone who could mount the &quot;bully
pulpit&quot; of the White House in behalf of culturally conservative
ideals?  Isn't such a man <I>preferable </I>to the man who endorses
what Bennett calls the &quot;chimera&quot; of a human life amendment
while providing only &quot;lip service&quot; to the pro-life cause?
<p>
You must give Bill Bennett credit -- he knows how to pose a dilemma.
He's a thoughtful and provocative writer. I hope you will bear
with me if I take some time tonight to respond to the questions
Bennett poses.
<p>
We should welcome this debate. One of the things that has been
so dispiriting about the abortion debate in this country is the
intellectual dishonesty that attends so much of the discussion.
When the election of 1992 finally ended, columnist Charles Krauthammer
wrote that the abortion debate had been decided.
<p>
Many of us cried out that the abortion <I>debate</I> had never
even been held.  Bennett's message is an enticing one. Who among
us is not tired of the trench warfare we have been fighting for
the past 23 years? Isn't it very tempting to break out of the
exhausting and unproductive rut of &quot;politics as usual?&quot;
<p>
Of <I>course,</I> we seek the lowering of the number of abortions.
We know that one and a half million abortions a year is a tragedy.
But are we likely to take the steps necessary to reduce that terrible
toll if we don't think that <I>one</I> abortion is a crime?  What
we see today is the result of a cynicism by public figures. Stalin
said, &quot;A single death is a tragedy, a million deaths is a
statistic.&quot; Too many of our political leaders pay &quot;lip
service&quot; to the tragedy of abortion, but act as if it is
merely another item in the index of leading cultural indicators.
<p>
Of <I>course, </I>we would like to see a president who wholeheartedly
believes that abortion is wrong and who is willing to speak out
against it. A little history will help. America has never had
a president who thought <I>lynching</I> was nice. Most publicly
deplored it. But it was not until President Eisenhower signed
a civil rights law in 1957 that a president acted effectively
to put a stop to lynching. Would lynching have ended sooner if
Eisenhower had supported the choice of legal lynching while using
the White House to speak up for <I>alternatives to lynching</I>?
Ike and Mamie, culturally conservative as they were, could have
been the poster people for opponents of lynching. But it was <I>President
</I>Eisenhower's willingness to use federal marshals and federal
troops that assured the rule of law in such places as Little Rock,
Arkansas.
<p>
Bennett knows philosophy, so he would recognize Thomas Jefferson's
famous taunt. Mr. Jefferson said that if you put a moral question
to a plowman and a philosopher, the plowman would be more likely
to answer rightly. That's because the man who knows little is
closer to the truth than the man who knows many things that aren't
true.
<p>
One of the main things that isn't true is that we pro-lifers would
somehow <I>prefer</I> a president who gives us lip service instead
of solid and constructive action on a life-saving agenda. We were forced 
to <I>accept</I> such weak leadership: we never <I>asked</I> for it. To 
present us only two alternatives -- the pro-abortion president who, 
in his heart, thinks it should be discouraged and is willing to
say so publicly or the insincere pro-life president who pays mere
lip service to a human life amendment -- is to engage in the logical fallacy 
of the &quot;false dilemma.&quot;
<p>
Few people have given so much to our country as Bill Bennett on
a host of issues. When he was interviewed on Dr. James Dobson's
broadcast several years ago, Bennett gave us many wise insights.
On the troubling questions of gays in the military and women in
combat, no one can top Bennett. He told Dr. Dobson's 
listeners that there is a masculine, martial ideal. That ideal
calls upon men, in obedience to lawful authority, to take up arms in defense 
of the weak, the innocent, the vulnerable in order to restore justice
and peace. Bennett gave us an excellent summary of the &quot;just
war&quot; doctrine so wisely taught by Saint Augustine, and so
well elaborated by Martin Luther. Bennett went on: Those who seek
to recruit gays for the military and to place women in combat
seek the destruction of the masculine ideal, the feminine ideal
and the military they have always loathed. No one in American
life has understood these issues better than Bill Bennett, who
never spent a day in the armed forces. No admiral, no four-star
general, <I>not even one particular four-star general,</I> has
understood the challenge so well.
<p>
That is what is so deeply hurtful about the current controversy.
It <I>is </I>a family feud. And <I>you </I>are all part of the
family and you have a right to know what is being argued over.
But it is more than that.
<p>
We thought for a long time we would have to battle for the pro-life
planks in the Republican party platform.  We had no illusions
that the Arlen Specters, Pete Wilsons, Bill Welds and Christine
Todd Whitmans would let this brave statement stand unmolested.
But we never dreamed that we would have to defend the platform
from our friends.
<p>
What <I>does </I>the Republican platform say and why is that important?
Since 1976, the Republicans have been committed to a pro-life
position as a matter of party principle. It is vital that they
remain so. That is because no other major political party in the
world is so committed. Certainly not the conservatives in Britain,
nor the right-wing parties of France, Germany, Canada or Australia.
<p>
The platform adopted in 1984 and secured through 1988 and 1992
said that &quot;the unborn child has a right to life which cannot
be infringed.&quot; It pledged the Republicans to work for a Human
Life Amendment. It further urged the selection of judges at every
level who &quot;respect the sanctity of life and traditional family
values.&quot;
<p>
By saying that he could support a pro-choice president, Bill Bennett
has effectively moved to throw out the 20-year commitment of the
GOP to unborn human life. A platform is a statement the party
makes in advancing its candidates, particularly its presidential
ticket. Bennett has taken up the challenge, saying that we should
not pursue the <I>chimera </I>of a Human Life Amendment.
<p>
This is not the first time he has said this. Several years ago,
in response to a reporter's question on radio station KKLA in
Los Angeles, Bennett said of the pro-life plank that it was OK
with him if they wanted to put that in there. As a practical matter,
he said, it isn't going to happen. So what we should concentrate
on is reducing the numbers.
<p>
Well, as a practical matter, we are not going to get a Human Life
Amendment if our leaders disparage the effort. Scripture tells
us <I>where there is no vision, the people perish. </I>But I think
it a grave mistake to turn from leadership to punditry. We are
every day faced with extraordinary realities which few <I>practical
</I>observers would have predicted.
<p>
Take, for example, the collapse of the Soviet Union. Who, writing
the Republican platform of 1988, would have said the party demands
the reunification of Germany, her inclusion within NATO? Who would
have required the evacuation of all Soviet troops from restored
and sovereign Baltic states before the United States would give
Russia a penny in foreign aid? Anyone writing such a platform
plank in `88 would have been thought mad. But, by 1992, <I>no
platform could even be written </I>which did not take into account
the new <I>practical</I> realities.
<p>
From our own history, we know vast change is possible. In 1860,
the Republicans who met in this city to nominate Abraham Lincoln
and write their platform would not have dared to call for the
abolition of chattel slavery and the extension of U.S. citizenship
to the freedmen. But, <I>by</I> 1864, that change was a <I>practical
</I>reality.
<p>
We do not ask our leaders to do the impossible. We certainly do
not ask them to take us into war. But we do not want them to foreclose
the possibility of great and beneficial change in the <I>practical
</I>realities. 
<p>
The tragedy of Bill Bennett's defection is that it comes at a
time when we can see great and hopeful changes occurring. Naomi
Wolf, a feminist, pro-choice author, has written a remarkable
article in <I>The New Republic.</I> Entitled &quot;Our Bodies,
Our Souls,&quot; Miss Wolf's article is an unusual recognition
of the stakes in this vital question. She writes:
<p>
<blockquote><i>Norma McCorvey explained what happened to her in terms of
good and  evil; she woke in the middle of the night and felt a
presence pushing  violently down on her, &quot;I denounce you,
Satan,&quot; she announced.  This way  of talking about evil is
one of the chief class divisions in America:  working-class people
talk about Satan, and...those who run the country  talk instead
about neurotic guilt. While the elite scoff at research that 
shows most Americans maintain a belief in the embodiment of evil--&quot;the
 devil&quot;--they miss something profound about the human need
to make moral order out of chaos.</i></blockquote>
<p>
Miss Wolf is not an ally. She ends her article where she began
it: staunchly supporting what she calls abortion rights. But the
article is filled with amazing concessions and bold statements.
She dares to tell the truth that every abortion stops a beating
heart. And one word of truth, as Solzhenitsyn says, can move the
world. 
<p>
As if <I>The New Republic's </I>publishing this article were not
amazing enough, it was matched in September by a cover story in
<I>The Atlantic Monthly</I>. George McKenna is a law professor.
He urges pro-life politicians to recognize a woman's constitutional
right to choose abortion, but to take effective, practical measures
to restrict abortion. Ultimately, none of us can accept Professor
McKenna's position, but it is in the <I>laying out </I>of that
position that McKenna does the greatest service to all of us.
For he exposes to the light of day the absurdity underlying the
pro-choice arguments. He links them with the arguments made by
Stephen Douglas' Democrats in the 1850s. How marvelous in our
eyes. <I>Atlantic, </I>a flagship of the liberal prestige press,
has publicly accorded the anti-abortion position the dignity of
the Great Emancipator's cloak. This has not happened before.
<p>
While we are taken up, necessarily and painfully, with the fight
in our own divided house, we should not fail to note that our
adversaries' house is in shambles. Their leader thinks abortion
should be &quot;safe, legal and rare.&quot; If it is a fundamental
constitutional right, as the Supreme Court has told us it is,
then why should it be rare? Is there any other <I>fundamental
</I>human right which any of us would even wish to be rare?
<p>
Lincoln knew all about such hypocrisy. In 1860, he said:
<p>
<blockquote><i>Let us apply a few tests. You say that you think slavery 
is wrong, but you  denounce all attempts to restrain it. Is there
anything else that you think  wrong, that you are not willing
to deal with as a wrong? Why are you so  careful, so tender of
this one wrong and no other? You will not let us <b>do</b> a 
single thing as if it was wrong; there is no place where you will
allow it to  be even <b>called</b> wrong! We must not call it
wrong in the Free States  because it is <b>not</b> there, and
we must not call it wrong in the Slave States  because it is there;
we must not call it wrong in politics because that is  bringing
morality into politics, and we must not call it wrong in the pulpit
because that is bringing politics into religion; we must not
bring it into the  Tract Society or other societies, because those
are such unsuitable places,  and there is no single place, according
to you, where this wrong thing can  properly be called wrong!</i></blockquote>
<p>
Last year, the First Lady told <I>Newsweek</I> interviewers that
abortion was wrong. This was about a week before the mid-term
elections. In September, she went all the way to China to tell
the world that forced abortion is wrong.  One would think from
those statements that the wrong thing would not be included in
her health care plan. We might think that this wrong thing would
not be pressed on every country on earth by means of a diplomatic
cable to every U.S. embassy. We might even hope that this wrong
thing would not be pushed on U.S. military hospitals. Or we might
have thought that abortion would not be part of &quot;coordinated
community services&quot; targeted at public schools in states
which accept funds under federal <I>Goals 2000</I> legislation. From 
all these examples, it appears that their true goal is to make abortion 
safe, legal and <I>well done. </I> But, as Lincoln said, some of us are very
<I>tender</I> and <I>careful </I>about the things we call wrong.
<p>
How much we could have used Bill Bennett's strong voice in pointing
out such lethal inconsistencies. Instead, unfortunately, he has
said that it is Dr. Dobson and Paul Weyrich who are inconsistent.
They are inconsistent, he says, because if they <I>really </I>believe
that human lives are being unjustly taken in abortion, they would
be leading the public effort to put women in jail.
<p>
This is a painful wound, coming from a friend. It speaks volumes
about the circles that Bennett is moving in if he really believes
this. He should know better. Bennett knows American history. He
knows American law. He should know that in all of American history
we have found only <I>two </I>instances of women being prosecuted
for having abortions. The good, protective pro-life laws which
existed in every state until the early sixties, and which saved
the lives of millions of unborn children and their mothers, sought
to punish, discourage and stigmatize the <I>abortionist.</I> That's
the truth, and Bennett should know it. And if he doesn't <I>know
</I>the truth, we would at least appreciate his not taking his
debating points from Planned Parenthood's briefing book.
<p>
Bill Bennett had no greater supporters and enthusiasts than us
when he was taking on the hateful, violent and vulgar products
of gangsta rap. Those who sing about raping women and killing
cops should not be cultural heroes. And those who profit from
this execrable trade should be publicly shamed. And God bless
Bennett for doing it.
<p>
Now he has joined with Sen. Joe Lieberman, Democrat of Connecticut,
to attack daytime TV talk shows. Again, we say, &quot;Good for
you!&quot; Bennett has called the toxic waste spewing forth from
the tube &quot;an affront to human dignity.&quot; How right he
is.
<p>
But, while he has Joe Lieberman's ear, could he put in a word
about <I>another </I>affront to human dignity?  Could he mention
to his friend how helpful his support would be in the fight against
partial birth abortions?  We must understand how inevitable a
degraded and violent culture becomes when we have accepted the
degrading violence of abortion.
<p>
We just won a great victory in the House, as you know. That vote
of 288-139 to ban partial-birth abortions spanned a broad spectrum.
We won the votes of Henry Hyde, Linda Smith and Helen Chenoweth,
to be sure. But we also gained the support of Dick Gephardt, David
Bonior and even young Patrick Kennedy. Bill Bennett should recognize 
that a pro-life commitment <I>can</I> be the source of great
strength. More than that, a pro-life commitment is the <I>only
</I>way a conservative majority can be sustained in this country. As Gary 
Bauer has noted, can Newt Gingrich point to any <I>other </I>bill that gained 
such strong support in the House?
<p>
Many of us, as pro-lifers, are powerfully moved by the fate of
unborn children. We identify strongly with the child in <I>The
Silent Scream.</I> We empathize strongly, and we want to help
defend and preserve the lives that are threatened with abortion.
We believe that God Himself has called us to do this work.
<p>
But there may be more arguments that can be made to the author
of such works as <I>The Book of Virtues </I>and <I>The Moral Compass,
</I>for one of the cardinal virtues that is wisely taught in the
great Catholic tradition is <I>justice. </I>Abortion is not only
violent and bloody. War is that. Abortion is also <I>unjust. </I>And
those who sit on the nation's highest court, who have told us
that the right to abortion is to be found in the &quot;liberty
interest&quot; of our Constitution, are not dispensing justice,
but <I>injustice.</I>
<p>
Lincoln was certainly moved by the fate of the poor slave. He
said that even a dumb brute, <I>even an ant,</I> knows when he
is wronged. But it was this conscious embrace of <I>injustice
</I>which Lincoln likened to a wen, a cancer, a dread disease.
If unchecked, Lincoln knew, it would one day claim the life of
the country itself.
<p>
It is also the federal judiciary which has so consistently undermined
law enforcement in our country. Small wonder, then, that when
justices are indifferent to justice, juries nullify verdicts and
people get away with murder. So, we must tell our neighbors, don't
expect that the blood-rimmed tide will ebb before it gets to <I>your
</I>doorstep. Making abortion legal makes America a violent, bloody
and dangerous place to live. Making abortion legal unravels the
very fabric of society.
<p>
Edmund Burke said we should love our country, that in order to
be loved our country should be lovely. A pro-abortion America
can never be lovely. How can we assert our own right to life if
we, as a nation, deny it to others?
<p>
I wish I could report to you tonight that the fight between Bill
Bennett and the rest of us is just--Washington loves this word--a
flap. I would be happy to say it will soon be smoothed over, and
we will all be friends again. But abortion is not simply an <I>issue</I>,
as Bennett sometimes calls it. It is no more <I>an issue</I> than
Pilate's calling for a choice between Jesus and Barabbas was a
straw poll. To say that we might advance our cause by choosing
leaders who don't understand or believe in our cause is to risk
all that we have accomplished in public policy, all that moves
us to take part in civic life.
<p>
So I am here to report to you that the mood of pro-lifers in Washington
is resolute, unyielding. And I sense that yours is, too. We are
ready to walk with you in the footsteps of the faithful. We will
not break faith with God or with you. If we suffer defections, broken 
friendships, that is regrettable. But that will not deter us.
Churchill, who knew what it was to stand alone, kept faith in
his time with the long history of Christian civilization against
a brutal, pagan tyranny. He would not speak of dark days, but
of <I>stern </I>days. These, too,  are stern days. 
I think we can win the fight for the Republican pro-life platform.
But, no matter what happens, I know that we will never give in.
Thirteen years ago, Jean Garton spoke to a right to life convention
in Connecticut. She spoke memorably then, as she always does.
Her word at that time was <I>reticulation</I>. She described it
as the veins in a leaf. If one was blocked, or cut off, others
could always take its place. So, if we are blocked in the political realm, 
we can still find paths of service. All that is needed is that we continue 
in the footsteps of the faithful. Thank you and God bless you.

<title>FAMILY PRIVACY PROTECTION ACT HEARING</title>
<body>

<h2>FAMILY PRIVACY PROTECTION<br>
ACT HEARING</h2>
<p>
<h4>Testimony of Robert H. Knight<br>
Director of Cultural Studies, Family Research Council</br>
regarding HR 1271<br>
before the<br>
Committee on Governmental Affairs<br>
of the<br>
United States Senate<br>
November 9, 1995</h4></center>
<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>
Thank you for inviting me to speak on behalf of the Family Research
Council, and, by extension, on behalf of many parents all over
the United States.
<p>
The Final Report of the White House Working Group on the Family
includes these words:
<p>
&quot;Parental nurturing and education of the young is our most
important national investment.  It is the fundamental task of
humanity.&quot;
<p>
Notwithstanding a few cataclysmic events, such as the collapse
of the Soviet empire, nothing has happened since then to alter
the truth of this observation, penned in 1986 by Gary Bauer, who
is now president of Family Research Council.  Indeed, it could
have been said at any time and in any place.
<p>
We often hear from child rights advocates that &quot;it takes
a village to raise a child,&quot; but  parents are indispensable.
 Not even a whole village can replicate them.  As the people most
responsible for and most equipped to discern the needs of their
children, parents must be accorded deference in all matters related
to education.  Children in public and private schools are taught
by dedicated professionals, but only because parents consent to
have these professionals participate in their children's education.
<p>
No one but a parent can understand how parents feel about their
own children.  And I am talking about adoptive parents as well
as biological parents.  Mother Teresa describes such devotion through a 
firsthand observation at her clinic in Calcutta:
<p><blockquote>
<i>I never forget, I gave a child to a Hindu family, and after
a few months, I heard that the child became very, very sick. 
And I sent for the family, and I told them, give me back that
child.   I'll take care of the sick child, and I'll give you another
healthy child.  And the father looked at me and said, 'Mother,
take my life rather than take the child.'&quot;</i>
</blockquote><p>
Like this Indian father, most parents would lay down their lives
for their children.  And they are acutely aware of their responsibility.
 So decisions about what kind of information is conveyed to children
or extracted from them are the parents' natural prerogative.
<p>
Any research methods that place a barrier between children and
their parents should be outlawed.  Increasingly, parents have
found themselves fighting for their most fundamental rights against
some hostile educators and government officials who honestly believe
that they, not parents, know what is best for children.  Such
officials work overtime to acquaint children with revisionist
history, graphic sexual materials and relativistic notions of
morality -- all in the name of education.
<p>
Often, parents are unaware of what the children are receiving.
The concept of informed consent is faulty because there are too
many ways for it to fail.  Parents are not given adequate information.
And a teacher may send a child home with an announcement about
an upcoming survey, but unless the parent signs a permission form,
there is no way to determine if the message got through.
<p>
To those who argue that written requirements are cumbersome and
expensive, well, the loss of parental freedom to determine a child's
education is a far higher cost -- one that is unacceptable.  Besides,
there are other ways that information can be obtained on dangerous
behaviors.  Documentation of the number of cases of out-of-wedlock
pregnancies, sexually transmitted diseases, suicides, drug overdoses
and the like is readily available. The drive to target all teens
because of the actions of the unfortunate few is a manifestation
of the educational dogma that information in and of itself, with
no moral reference, can make a difference.  But two decades of
research have shown that giving youngsters more &quot;value-free&quot;
information about sex, for instance, has not resulted in any behavioral
change, except perhaps earlier experimentation.
<p>
With the advent of Goals 2000, and its emphasis on national standards
and accountability, the role of testing is becoming paramount.
Outcome-based education, as implemented by Goals 2000, moves
schools away from the strictly academic and toward the production
of certain &quot;attitudes.&quot; Consequently, the line is becoming
blurred between what is educational and what is therapeutic.
<p>
Parents are concerned over surveys for two reasons:
<p>
1) Some questionnaires may reveal information that is nobody's
business but that of the family; and 2) some questionnaires convey
information to which parents would rather not expose their children.
<p>
The issue of parental consent for research has been driven primarily
by a spate of sex, suicide and drug surveys among young teens,
some of which have been politically motivated and manipulated.
A few years ago, a national youth survey on sexuality contained
questions that were so graphic as to be, in many parents' estimation,
pornographic.
<p>
Concern over research on hapless children has also been driven
by revelations of abuses by federally-funded researchers going
as far back as the sex studies of Dr. Alfred C. Kinsey in the
1940s.  It was under grants from the congressionally chartered
National Research Council that Dr. Kinsey collected his materials
for what became known as the Kinsey Report, the largest sex survey
ever at that time.  Under the rubric of science, systematic molestation
of some 317 children was analyzed and recorded in graph tables.
Nowhere is there evidence that parental consent was given for
what were clearly criminal acts.  In fact, no one, not even parents,
could give consent for such acts, but that did not stop the Kinsey
&quot;scientists.&quot;
<p>
Further documentation of this shameful episode of scientific abuse
can be found in the Family Research Council documentary video
<I>The Children of Table 34</I>, which I am submitting for the
record, and in <i>Kinsey Sex and Fraud, The Indoctrination of
a People</i>, by Dr. Judith A. Reisman, Edward W. Eichel, with
Drs. J. Gordon Muir and John Court as editors (Huntington House:
1990).
<p>
Now, we are not suggesting that the mere taking of a survey is
equivalent to the kind of abuse that Kinsey recorded.  Just that
there is a temptation to gather information because it <I>can</I>
be done without asking whether it <I>should</I> be done.
<p>
Sometimes, the impact on the survey taker seems calculated to
increase curiosity about deviant behavior.  Surveys that ask questions
about suicide or drug usage, for example, can plant the idea of
either activity as an option, when a teen may never have entertained
the thought before.  Through sheer repetition of reference, harmful
activities can lose their power to inspire natural resistance.
After all, a teen may reasonably conclude,  &quot;If we are talking
about all this stuff so much, doesn't that mean that everybody
is doing it?&quot;  Children were exposed to descriptions of homosexual
activity, for example, which is a way of forcing the topic to
the front burner.  As a homosexual activist once wrote:  &quot;The
main thing is to talk about gayness until the issue becomes thoroughly
tiresome.&quot;
<p>
Sex surveys in and of themselves are notoriously unreliable, being
skewed toward the sexually unconventional.  They can also be objectionable.
Little Susie responds to a question that asks if she is a virgin.  If she 
answers yes, then she is supposed to skip through several detailed questions 
about sexual activities, such as how many sex partners she has had.
After an exercise like that, she may feel like a sexual underachiever
for having kept chaste.  Teens are very peer conscious, and can
feel left out and stigmatized for having to exempt themselves
from a battery of questions. Likewise, if the onus is on the parent
to opt a child out of such intrusive experiences, the possibility
for stigma is greater than if all parents have to opt their children
in.  Those who administer surveys are more interested in high
compliance than parental input, so they tend to be opposed to
such safeguards.  But in the scheme of things, parents' rights
must come first.
<p>
Family Research Council supports efforts to safeguard the rights
of parents to direct their children's education and welfare, and
that includes how, where and when children are included in research.
Parents are assigned that task by no less an authority than God
Himself.  It would be the epitome of hubris to tamper with that
bond because some educational experts feel that they are smarter
than everybody else.

<title>THE CASE FOR REBUILDING CIVIL SOCIETY</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">
<h2>THE CASE FOR REBUILDING<br>
CIVIL SOCIETY</h2>
<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by<br>
Dr. Michael Novak</i></center>
<p>
<i>This speech was the keynote address at the Family Research
Council's &quot;World Without Welfare&quot; symposium on December
13, 1995 at the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C.</i>
<p>
Thank you for allowing me to come to this important conference
and to share in the really central work of the Family Research
Council.
<p>
When we talk about welfare, it's good to make a distinction right
up front.  The war on poverty in the mid-1960s did make a real
difference for the elderly, for the sick, and for the disabled
that we shouldn't disregard.  It was in certain aspects a great
success for the elderly, for example.  In 1965, the largest group
of the poor were those over age 65.  In the 1960s, in John Kennedy's
campaign and when Michael Harrington's book was being bruited
about, pictures of the poor on the covers of <I>Life</I> magazine
or <I>Look</I> or other magazines of the time were inevitably
pictures of the elderly.  If you look today, by almost every measure,
the elderly are almost entirely out of poverty.  If there are
elderly poor, it's because they are not connected to systems that
are in place to help them.  Moreover, in 1965 we counted as elderly
all people who were 65 or over.  Today, the real worrisome part
of the elderly is the &quot;elderly elderly,&quot; the over 85s,
whose numbers have increased to proportions that are comparable
to the proportions of those over 65 just 30 years ago.
<p>
Now the financial aspects of this accomplishment, the funding
mechanisms that we used, are still serious problems.  And thus
we're quite worried about the future of Medicare and even the
future of Social Security.  But the programs in and of themselves
were a great success, and I think it's worth setting that aside
from our discussion for the moment -- although the funding mechanisms
do need a great deal of attention.  It is also true that the position
of the disabled and the sick is much better than it was just 30
years ago.
<p>
<center><h3>THE FAILURE OF AFDC</h3></center>
<p>
There is, nonetheless, a sense in which welfare programs have
dramatically failed.  When we say welfare, we typically mean the
poverty programs that were addressed to young people, young adults
between the ages of 16 and 45 in particular.  And the chief program
that has been worrisome has been AFDC, Aid to Families with Dependent
Children.  In the late 1930s when it was founded, AFDC was predominantly
a program for widows; and for many years afterward, 95 percent
or more of the people who received aid under that program were
widows whose husbands were hurt in mining accidents or mill accidents
or some other kind of accident.  Then after 1965, with great rapidity,
AFDC became a program predominantly for young single women having
children out of wedlock.  When we say welfare in America, when
the public hears that word, that's the part of the problem they
almost always fix on.  And it is very well worth fixing on.
<p>
The Family Research Council is one of the organizations that grew
up to respond to the insight that, if you help the family -- often,
I should add, unformed families not based on marriage -- you have
identified the surest and most direct safeguard against poverty.
If the family is healthy and functioning well, you don't need
what used to be called the Department of Health, Education and
Welfare.  That's what the family does when it's functioning well.
And when the family isn't functioning well, not everything that
all the Departments of Health, Education and Welfare do can make
up for the loss.  As I once put it, the family is the only Department
of Health, Education and Welfare that works.
<p>
Now, one of the insights that the public senses, but many critics
of welfare reform don't seem to grasp, is the sheer devastation
wrought by the programs we launched in 1965.  Those of us who
supported the War on Poverty, as I certainly did, did not warn
the citizenry that if you adopt this program we will bring you
a 600 percent increase in violent crime and a 500 percent increase
in births out of wedlock.  That wasn't our intention.  Nobody
foresaw that happening or wanted it to happen.  But that's what
did happen.  In other words, it's important to grasp the damage
that welfare is doing.  The reason for being concerned about welfare
reform today -- and trying to imagine a &quot;world without welfare&quot;
-- is not a budgetary reason.  It's not its cost.  The cost is
not insuperable.  If welfare were doing good, we would gladly
support it.  Most of us would.  I think the vast majority would.
What's disconcerting to people is that welfare is manifestly
doing harm.  Or, to put it another way, it's not achieving the
goods it set out to achieve.  And the problems it set out to address
are not getting better.
<p>
Witness John Kennedy's statement in early 1963 about the first
move toward welfare reform, which later became the War on Poverty
after his death.  The message he sent to Congress said it was
intended to strengthen the American family, to put an end to juvenile
delinquency.  Can you imagine how quaint a term that later would
become?  Who speaks of &quot;juvenile delinquency&quot;?  That's
a term from the 1950s and 1960s.  That's long gone.  It's violent
crime.  Juvenile delinquency was ended.  It became violent crime.
But those were the intentions of the program, and it failed to
achieve them.
<p>
I want to warn you to be careful here too.  It's very hard to
show that welfare has caused all the civic destruction that has
happened since 1965 among families we intended to help.  So many
other things happened, television and affluence and urban renewal.
It's hard to isolate any one explanation.  But at a minimum,
one can say that welfare in this narrower sense that I'm using
was aimed to address these problems and didn't succeed.  The problems
have grown worse than they were 30 years ago.
<p>
<center><h3>HALVING THE FAMILY</h3></center>
<p>
In Washington, D.C., where we are meeting, 64 percent of all pregnancies
end in abortion.  Of those young children who survive that, 70
percent plus are born out-of-wedlock.  Now the fact that they're
born out-of-wedlock means in reality that these youngsters will
be born without the presence of half of an extended family.  That
is, they will generally lack grandparents, uncles, and aunts on
one side of the family.  And on the woman's side of the family,
perhaps the family will be supportive.  Usually it is, but it
may not be.  But already the child's world is cut in half from
what a child would normally have.  And if the child is born into
a household which is disconnected from the world of work and disconnected
from neighbors who also work, that child is born without connections
to the world of work.  The prognosis for later employment is very
poor.  The health prognosis is poor.  The prognosis for finishing
school is poor.  The prognosis for involvement in the criminal
justice system is very high.  In this city, the chances of involvement
in the criminal justice system by the age of 30 are about 80 percent.
So those who want to continue welfare as we know it carry on
their shoulders a very heavy burden of proof.  I believe that
the Catholic bishops who are resisting some of the move for reform
are not facing as directly as they ought the moral responsibility
that accrues to them for continuing the program as it now is.
<p>
One of the worst features of the welfare program as it now is,
especially for the young, is that it takes good healthy young
people who are able to be creative and energetic and to show initiative
and it leaves them in a state of dependency in two respects. 
First, many of them are not there to be able to take care of their
children or their parents.  In other words, the healthy young
adults are usually the ones on whom the elderly depend, not on
whom children depend.  And for the most part, because they are
not working, they do not have the means to take care of those
who depend on them.  But secondly, this seems to bring with it
certain psychic wounds because many such people are not able to
be independent themselves.  They throw themselves on the care
of the government, on the care of the larger society, both for
the care of their dependents and for their own care.  And then
there's a third sense of dependency, too, for a very high proportion
of them.  While their schooling is free, they don't complete school.
Many become involved in alcohol or drugs and in other sorts of
behavior that are self-destructive. 
<p>
In all three of these senses, we have learned since 1965 that
poverty -- that is, a lack of material resources -- is not the
worst consequence but dependency in these three senses is much
worse.  It takes someone who ought to be a self-governing citizen,
self-reliant, brave, showing initiative, creating jobs, and leaves
them in the state of counting on others for the most basic things.
I hate even to bring up this aspect, but generally it leaves
them also with a great loss of spiritual morale, or self-esteem.
It's the self-esteem I hate to mention.  But it is in these cases
a very important reality with which to cope.  It's hard, when
you're not achieving, to have a sense of proper adult achievement.
<p>
America was never founded to be a society for dependent people.
The American experiment is an experiment in self-government,
and I want to talk about that in the second part of my remarks
now.  What it means to have republican government is to have a
government which allows most decisions, most social activities,
to be undertaken by the citizens themselves.  They're self-governing.
They are able to manage their social lives.  They are able to
manage their social necessities.  One of the most extraordinary
things about the founding of this republic, commented on by Tocqueville
50 years after the founding, is the capacity of Americans to organize
themselves to take care of their own needs.
<p>
<center><h3>ASSOCIATION: THE AMERICAN CHARACTER</h3></center>
<p>
My wife and I recovered the diary of an ancestor of hers.  Believe
it or not, his name was Charlie Brown.  He was the son of the
first Baptist missionary in the Iowa Territory before it became
a state, and Charles Brown writes in his diary day after day about
the importance of individualism, the importance of the individual.
But that's not what he describes.  What's in his head is how
much individual initiative it took to depart from the family back
east near Syracuse, and before that in Massachusetts, and to move
out to this new territory where the plow had not cut the soil
ever.  When he arrived, it was buffalo grass.  Not many people
lived there because the native Americans used it mostly as a hunting
ground.  It was not for farming, and most people passed on through.
Day after day, what Brown describes is like &quot;yesterday we
worked on the farm of so and so putting up a barn.&quot;  And
on another day they're putting a bridge over a creek.  And on
another day they're putting up the equivalent of a city hall.
And on another day they're working on the school.  The substance
of his days is working together with neighbors on projects to
make their common life go, to make it work.
<p>
What I'm trying to establish is that this is the building of civil
society.  This is the building of the ability of human beings
to live together in a good community when there's no government,
or only a very diminished form of government.  As Tocqueville
says, this is the great advantage the Americans had.  They were
so lightly governed.  The King and Parliament hardly paid them
attention, except to tax them.  They were organized first in villages
and townships and only much later in counties and states.  Only
after virtually 200 years were they organized in a federal government.
So, Americans learned how to conduct a social life for themselves
before they had government.
<p>
Tocqueville also remarks, in his reflections on the revolution
in France, that at the time of the revolution there were not 10
men in all of France who were capable of practicing the art of
association as Americans were.  What he meant by that was that
in France when something is needed people turn to the state to
do it.  And in Britain people turn to the aristocracy to fund
it. In America, they turned to one another.  They formed associations.
<p>
Tocqueville formed the principle that the first law of democracy
is the principle of association.  The very first law is that democracy
will only work where people are capable of self-government --
forming their own associations and making communal decisions,
and figuring out the mechanisms to make those fairly and well.
Tocqueville observed that people became practiced in the art
of association almost universally in America.  People formed associations,
he observed, to fund missionaries, to build colleges, to put up
buildings, to bring music to a village or town, to stage a play.
They formed associations for every imaginable purpose.  They
didn't turn to government because in the early days there was
no government to turn to, only a government of very limited resources
and very limited authority.
<p>
Now this is what our Framers intended by the experiment in self-government,
&quot;of the people, by the people, for the people.&quot;  For
this reason, governments are formed among men to secure these
rights. You do have to have a government, as the generation of
our Framers discovered for themselves when they were badly governed
by the Articles of Confederation.  They needed to form a more
perfect Constitution to form a more perfect union.  Their project
was not an anti-government program, in other words.  But it was
a matter of getting government right, and part of getting government
right was to leave space for people to govern themselves.  So
&quot;government by government&quot; would play as small a role
as necessary.  That is the original and has been the continuing
American experiment, and I think that the restlessness we are
seeing in the country is an urge to return to something like that
-- to &quot;devolve,&quot; as current rhetoric would have it.
Largely because of the great wars of the 20th century, the first
world war and the second, the federal government has far more
centralized power than anyone had earlier envisaged.
<p>
<center><h3>ESCAPING POVERTY THE FAMILY WAY</h3></center>
<p>
It isn't fair to say that all of our associations or social units
are voluntary.   Most are, but there are some that are given to
us by nature.  And one of those is the family.  I've already mentioned
the centrality of the family, but let me give you one more little
factoid that's impressive.  If you do three things in the United
States, it's very difficult to be poor -- less than a five percent
chance.  The first is to complete high school, which is free and
in fact mandatory.  In most states you can be picked up by a truant
officer for not attending school, but a substantial number of
people still don't.  Secondly, you are likely to avoid poverty
if you work full-time, even at a minimum wage job.   And finally,
you should get married or, with difficulty, manage to stay married.
<p>
Just a very few years ago, only about 6 percent of married couple
families were poor.  Today it's about 8 percent.  Marriage alone,
then, gives you a 92 percent chance of getting out of poverty.
The two incomes, in any case the support of two people, seem
to have some financial and also psychological power that is of
great assistance.  And, of course, with work and with at least
the minimum of a high school education, you do very well.  We
see this being realized every day.
<p>
One of the things that has changed the argument in the country
dramatically in the last 20 years is the influx of immigrants
from very poor backgrounds from all over the world.  They arrive
financially poor, but in a short time are <I>not</I> poor.  Their
success through family and work -- and particularly their success
in pushing their children in education -- has led them to move
out of poverty.  That in turn has restored our faith in the possibilities
within the American system for helping the poor regularly move
out of poverty.  What sticks in the craw of Americans, in fact,
is the vision before their eyes of so many people not moving out
of poverty.  That's what's uncharacteristic, that's what's unprecedented.
And that's what gives people the sense that the system is failing.
The system is meant to move people out of poverty within a decade
or so, a generation at most.  And when it's not doing that, that's
what makes people say there is something wrong with the system,
something we've done wrong in our design of it.
<p>
It's always wise to remind yourself that the vast majority of
people who are poor and who are on welfare are white.  The press
often tries to portray this as a &quot;black problem&quot; --
that is, they will frequently show black people when they talk
about welfare.  But any of you who come from states with more
rural settings, or states with smaller towns and cities, know
the increase in welfare among whites all over the United States.
Even the increase of illegitimacy today among whites is now higher
than it was in 1965 when Daniel Patrick Moynihan declared it a
disaster among blacks.  It's now higher among whites and growing
more rapidly than among blacks.
<p>
The family, therefore, is one of the crucial places to apply our
attention.  This is not habitual among social scientists and American
intellectuals in general.  Political thought for the last 200
years has been more or less mesmerized by the two great discoveries
of the last 200 years: the nation-state and the individual.  For
the first time in history, a great many individuals moved away
from their families through migration or through the opening up
of new occupations.  They moved into occupations untraditional
in their family.  Sometimes they changed their religious background.
It's been a hugely migratory two centuries.  All of us here are
a part of that migration to the United States over a very short
period, the greatest migration in human history. We became aware,
therefore, of separating from family, of being an individual.
And there are many other factors that led to this as well.  
<p>
<center><h3>&QUOT;THE GREAT DRAMATIC MIDDLE&QUOT;</h3></center>
<p>
But simultaneously, we became aware of the formation of the nation-state.
And thus by and large progressives -- liberals as we tend to
call them in this country -- when presented with a problem, typically
tend to think of a state solution for it.  And on the other hand,
conservatives faced with a problem typically have tried to think
of something that the individual could do.  And our social thought
has been oscillating between these two extreme views: the individual
and the state.  We have overlooked the great dramatic middle in
which most human life is lived.
<p>
I don't know about you, but practically the only place I get to
be alone is on an airplane.  And I get to be alone only after
I answer two questions.  The person next to me always eventually
says, &quot;What do you do?&quot;  And I figured out the answer
that stops most of them cold.  I say, &quot;I teach,&quot; in
roughly that tone of voice.  Most of them have dreadful memories
of school, and that usually ends the conversation right there.
A few of them are brave souls and they will say, showing their
sophistication, &quot;What do you teach?&quot;  And I have a perfect
answer for that too.  I say, in as brief a voice as I can, &quot;Humanities.&quot;
And they say, &quot;Oh.&quot;  And that's it, I'm free.  There
are no committee meetings and no telephones.  For an hour and
a half or four hours, or whatever it is, I have the first solitude
I've had in days.  The rest of the time seems to be spent in committees
and meetings.  Most of our time is spent with other people.
<p>
American life is probably the most social life in the world. 
One of the most difficult tasks in America is getting the whole
family to sit down together at the dinner table because somebody
always has band practice or hockey practice, or a meeting.  And
if you want to get one night together, you almost have to enforce
it the way the Mormons do.   It has to be a family night, and
everybody must be home.  I had an Italian friend, and I asked
him why he came to work in &quot;Cleave-a-land,&quot; which is
how he said it. &quot;To make money, to find fortune,&quot; he
said.  &quot;And why did you go back to Italy?&quot; I asked.
&quot;To live,&quot; he said.  In Italy you take a shave and
a haircut -- two hours.  In America, eight minutes.  In Italy
you have dinner all evening -- four hours, normal.  In America,
in the evenings you're at meetings.  He said the trouble with
America is that you work eight hours a day and then you go to
eight hours of meetings.  We're a very social people, with our
families and all the different organizations and groups that we
belong to.  We live a richly social life.
<p>
It's not a community life in the way the Europeans imagined community,
however.  When the Europeans imagine community they always think
of a village somewhere in the mountains where everybody shares
the same faith and the same outlook and families have known one
another for hundreds of years and are almost like family together.
That's the European sense of community.  It is not, I think,
the highest sense of community.  It's a lovely form of community,
but it is quite oppressive and often xenophobic.  It distresses
others, and it is often repressive of the talents and abilities
of rare people within it.
<p>
Well, to pick up the theme I began with, the family, the association,
the capacity of Americans to look around, see a need and form
an organization to meet it -- that is what a &quot;world without
welfare&quot; is going to call on Americans to do more and more.
My friend Phil Merrill, who is the publisher of the <I>Washingtonian</I>
and other newspapers in this city and a shrewd observer of life,
predicts that in the next 20 years there's going to be the most
massive transfer of wealth in the history of this republic.  He
points out, &quot;Just look at pictures of the city of Washington
30 years ago and overlay them with a photograph of today.  Look
at how many new buildings have gone up.  Look at areas like Bethesda
and Falls Church and the whole surrounding area that were residential
communities and today are bustling communities with factories
and offices of every sort all over.  Think of the fortunes that
have been made in auto dealerships and real estate.&quot;  People
have more money than they are going to be able to leave to their
children.  Most of that money will go into the greatest outbreak
of philanthropy that the country has ever known, and therefore
that the world has ever known.
<p>
The stock market, in the 12 months of this year, has gone up one
trillion dollars of new wealth.  It's just astonishing what is
going on around us.  New industries, new technologies that were
not even thought of, are coming on-line.  When people talk about
our children being worse off than we were when we grew up and
lacking the same opportunities, they are overlooking the wealth
in home ownership and pensions -- the hidden forms of wealth that
are not usually counted.  When you see these comparisons of the
concentration of wealth, they almost all leave out your home,
your personal possessions, your compact discs.  What most of us
count as our wealth isn't counted.  What they count as wealth
is stock ownership, which some 20 to 30 million American families
have, but not everybody.  Thus, those studies have a necessary
conclusion that wealth is concentrated because they count only
a certain kind of wealth.
<p>
<center><h3>CATS, CHOICES, AND CHARACTER</h3></center>
<p>
Now, the last requirement of a self-governing society -- beyond
the capacity to form associations, to strengthen families, and
to form associations to meet whatever needs we discern -- is the
personal requirement.  The project of self-government will only
succeed with a certain kind of people.  It's a fantasy, Madison
said, to imagine that a republic can be made to work without virtue.
Now by the word &quot;virtue,&quot; the Framers meant certain
habits that a people must have if it wishes to be a free people.
They thought that there are peoples on this planet who are not
capable of liberty because they do not have the habits of self-government.
And they, therefore, will not be able to make self-government
work.  Now what did they mean by &quot;self-government&quot;?
They meant the capacity for two actions in particular.  Out of
all the things human beings do, there are two that are most particular
to our being human.  One is the capacity for reflection or deliberation.
And the other is the capacity for choosing.  And the two together
are what make liberty.
<p>
The capacity for deliberation or for reflection is a simple one.
I can best explain it in relationship to the two cats we have
at home.  I hate cats, you have to understand.  But our daughters
when they were 6 and 7 years old, each brought home a cat and
begged us to adopt them, lest they meet a terrible fate.  They
promised they would take care of the cats forever, and the parents
would never have to do anything.  The only problem is our children
are grown up and gone, and we still have the cats.  We can't even
leave home without finding a catsitter.  One is orange, and one
is black and white.  One is thin, and one is fat.  And one is
quick, and one is slow and dimwitted.  There's no question that
our cats have different personalities.
<p>
On the other hand, there's one thing we never have to worry about,
as we do have to worry with our children -- What career are they
going to choose?  Our children act.  They think of things that
we wish they wouldn't think of and then do them.  Our cats, on
the other hand, behave as cats always have since the time the
first one posed for the Sphinx.  In 5,000 years, cats have done
nothing original.  It's behavior.  Our children are capable of
reflecting on the future, seeing alternatives and choosing among
them.  They're capable of looking back on the past and finding
things that they're sorry for and things they're pleased with
and happy about.  That capacity to reflect is crucial to liberty.
<p>
Our Framers distinguished between two different kinds of liberty.
Tocqueville points this out in the first pages of <I>Democracy
in America</I>: the liberty proper to animals and the liberty
proper to human beings.  Our cats just do what they please.  Whatever
instinct tells them to do, they do.  They cannot do other than
obey their instincts.  Human beings have several different sets
of instincts which are at war with one another.  And human beings
have to choose which instincts to follow.  The capacity for self-government
is the capacity to choose under the light of reflection and deliberation.
The French built the Statue of Liberty to reflect this new idea
of liberty.  The idea of &quot;libert&eacute;&quot; failed in
the French Revolution, but the idea of liberty succeeded in North
America -- the kind of liberty that Pope John Paul II has insisted
on calling Ordered Liberty ever since his first visit to America.
That, he said, is the great contribution of American civilization
to world civilization.  The concept of the practice and institutions
of ordered liberty.
<p>
The French didn't know what sort of monument to build.  They wanted
to build one of the great monuments of the world.  They formed
a committee.  Being French, their first decision was easy.  It
would be the figure of a woman.  A woman is the symbol of liberty
in French oceanography from at least the fifth century.  Not the
young male with a weapon, but a woman, Lady Wisdom.  In her right
arm, they put the torch of reason, of light against the mist and
fog of bigotry and passion and ignorance.  And in her other arm
they put the book of the law.  Liberty under reason, liberty under
law.  It's a distinctive understanding of liberty.  To be free
is to act from reflection and deliberation, which is hard.  Often
we act out of instinct, out of passion, out of impulse.  But to
act soberly with reflection and self-mastery, as Jefferson and
Washington are described, is the very model of self-government.
Now how, Madison asked, can you have self-government in the republic
if you don't have self-government in the citizens?  You can't
imagine that a people incapable of self-government in their private
lives can practice self-government in their public lives.
<p>
Now I think what we need to understand is that this is our model
for the poor.  It always has been -- just as it has been for the
rich.  The capacity for self-government, the capacity for a certain
independence, for reflective and deliberate behavior, and the
acceptance of the consequences of decisions.  And that's exactly
what our current welfare programs have destroyed in large numbers
of people.  And poor people coming from around the world see this
and tell themselves, &quot;Stay off welfare.  It's a honey trap.
It can so easily destroy.&quot;
<p>
<center><h3>TOWARD A &QUOT;WORLD WITHOUT WELFARE&QUOT;</h3></center>
<p>
Well, when we talk about reconstituting civil society, that's
our agenda.  It's an agenda on a very full spectrum.  Everything
from recovering the habits that Bill Bennett tried to bring to
our attention in the <I>Book of Virtues</I>, to renewing the spirit
of volunteerism, the habit of Americans to look around and see
what needs doing, and then do it themselves without turning to
government.  If we have government help, then we will often need
to find ways of having the government help indirectly rather than
directly.  Rather than giving direct subsidies, we should find
an indirect way of helping institutions that encourage the independent,
self-reliant, community-minded behavior that is proper to self-government.
We need a whole new imagination about what we're going to ask
of government and how we're going to ask it to help.
<p>
We know that in a society as mobile and intercontinental as we
are, there are going to be people who fall through the net.  Families
aren't going to be there to help them because they're far from
their families.  In this sense, we understand that there has to
be a welfare net of some kind.  But how to provide this help?
It does not have to be done in the manner in which it has been
done for the last 30 years.  We've succeeded for the elderly,
but it was a grand failure for young people despite all good intentions.
So our agenda is a very large one, and it's useful as we begin
these reflections for the day to keep in mind how many different
things we have to do at once.  It's an entire rethinking, reformulating
or reconstituting, of the American experiment -- something that
Jefferson said that we ought to do every 18 and a third years
just on principle.  Thank you very much.

<title>EFFECTIVE COMPASSION</title>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">
<h2>EFFECTIVE COMPASSION</h2>
<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>
<i>by<br>
Dr. Marvin Olasky</i></center>
<p>
<i>This speech was presented at the Family Research Council's
&quot;World Without Welfare&quot; symposium on December 13, 1995
at the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C.</i>
<p>
This is somewhat of a difficult assignment for me.  At this point,
the only time I get nervous in speaking is when my wife is in
the room.  My goal in life is to try to please her, and I start
to wonder and worry.  As I look around the room here today, I
see not my wife -- she is happily warm in Texas -- but so many
other people from whom I've learned so much and whom I honor.
John Perkins over here, who has been doing wonderful things for
30 years.  Wayne Gordon with the Christian Community Development
Association.  Guy Condon with Care Net.  Duane Higgins in Alabama.
Reverend Ron Moore in Mississippi.  Father Sirico of the Acton
Institute in Michigan.  Bill Schambra from the Bradley Foundation.
Reverend John Woods and Mrs. Woods from the Gospel Mission here
in Washington.  I was noting down the people as I came in the
room.  It just goes on and on.
<p>
So what can I possibly do to explain what's going on to all these
folks from whom I've learned so much?  Just a few thoughts.  And
this may not be the best-organized speech you will have heard
this year, but it comes from the heart.
<p>
<center><h3>WELFARE: THE THIRD CHARGE</h3></center>
<p>
I start out by thinking about all the people here who are not
only well-intentioned but also intent on seeing good results,
who understand the difference between effective compassion and
what is well-intentioned but often does exactly the opposite of
what it sets out to do.  I have found in traveling around the
country this year lots and lots of soft hearts, wonderfully soft
hearts.  But, alas, they tend to go along with soft heads.  You
see this in church bulletins with notices about helping the homeless.
Here are three that have been brought to my attention this year.
First, &quot;Thursday night:  dinner for the homeless.  Medication
to follow.&quot;  Here's another, &quot;At the evening service
tonight the sermon topic will be 'Seeing Hell Close Up.'  Come
early to meet homeless visitors.&quot;  And one more, &quot;Don't
let homelessness kill you.  Let the church help.&quot;  A lot
of good intentions, a lot of soft hearts, some soft heads as well.
<p>
This is a wonderful hotel to be meeting in.  This is the hotel
where U.S. Grant used to hang out when he came here right after
the Civil War -- or as we call it in Texas still, the &quot;War
of Northern Aggression.&quot;  U.S. Grant, when he stayed here
following the Civil War, did not have much of a sense of humor.
But you could excuse him for that.  He had seen too much during
that terrible war in which 600,000 soldiers died.  Recently I
visited the Cold Harbor Battlefield southeast of Richmond.  That's
the one where Grant ordered three frontal assaults against strong
Confederate positions.  It was obvious to the soldiers that they
could not make it.  It was so obvious that they sewed their names
and addresses to the backs of their uniforms before the battle
so that their bodies could be identified and the next of kin notified
more easily.  Grant later said that his biggest regret of the
whole war was ordering that third charge.  The first, maybe, just
to see whether it could be done.  The second, dubious.  The third,
just a total tragic disaster.  The body count just went on and
on.  People stacked up in an area the length of about a football
field and the width of maybe a couple of fields.
<p>
At least U.S. Grant admitted that he had made a mistake.  And
that is far more than some liberal defenders of the welfare status
quo are now doing.  The <I>Washington Post</I> yesterday had a
headline, &quot;Daschle Says Final Welfare Plan Has Lost Democratic
Support.&quot;  And so all that's left apparently is to defend
the status quo.  That should be an oxymoron:  a liberal defender
of the status quo.  That's a combination that is not quite right,
like &quot;dry rain&quot; or &quot;trustworthy Clinton.&quot;
But alas, the liberals who come from such a proud tradition of
looking at the horizon, going where no man has gone before (or
at least sometimes no sane man), are now left with defending the
status quo.  Liberals, with this wonderful tradition of so much
progress, particularly in racial matters, are defending the status
quo.  How the mighty have fallen.
<p>
It's even worse.  We saw through the 1970s and the 1980s how children
suffered as families dissolved or never were formed by people
who had the consciousness of the sixties.  Some had soft hearts,
but many had soft heads.  And now in the '90s, the last refuge
of liberalism with its great tradition is to defend the status
quo and to push forward the children again as hostages.  The body
count of those children over the last 30 years is enormous.  They're
stacked up like soldiers were at Cold Harbor.  But liberals' last
refuge is to go at it again.  It is a third charge at Cold Harbor,
and at least the folks who defend the status quo could have the
decency to sew the name tags on the backs of those children.
<p>
<center><h3>THE COMPASSION DEFICIT</h3></center>
<p>
As you can see, I'm not fond of what passes for the Democratic
position these days.  But I can give only one or two cheers for
the Republican position because conservatives have not really
taken advantage so far of the opportunities to replace welfare
that have been created by the failure of liberalism.  Many conservatives
are still content to be the party of hardheadedness and, in perception
and sometimes reality, hardheartedness as well.  They tend to
say, &quot;Okay, we're hard.  We have hard heads.  Maybe we have
hard hearts, but you folks on the other side have soft heads and
soft hearts, and when it comes right down to it the voters will
prefer hard-hard to soft-soft.&quot;  Well, maybe they're right
politically.  I tend to think not.  I don't think they'll be successful
in retaining public confidence long enough to really end the budget
deficit if they do not deal with the compassion deficit.  And
that's something the Republicans have not really dealt with yet
for the most part.  Maybe they can get away with it politically,
hard-hard versus soft-soft, but what's right and what the American
people want are folks who are warmhearted but tough-minded.  People
want that combination, and so far neither party has really been
producing it as its main position.  And so, conservatives need
to realize that cost is not the main reason at all to fight governmental
welfare programs.  It's a factor certainly.  It becomes a huge
tax burden for middle-class taxpayers, for example.  But the real
fundamental problem is that we're too stingy in what's truly important:
treating people as human beings made in God's image, not as animals
to be fed, caged and occasionally petted.
<p>
The real need is for leaders who are tough-minded, but also tenderhearted.
And willing to recognize the creation of people in God's image
and the need to treat people that way -- not just looking at it
through green eyeshades as a budgetary matter.  There are some
conservatives who've realized that.  There are some who understand
that.  Newt Gingrich does.  He's getting terrible press these
days.  He's gotten hard press all year, but he understands this.
Bill Bennett understands this.  There are some senators -- Dan
Coats, John Ashcroft, Rick Santorum -- who understand this.  There
are some members of Congress, and some governors I've met in my
travels around the country this year: George Allen, Kirk Fordice,
Fife Symington, and John Engler.  I think they have a sense of
this, and it's starting to come out in the way they speak.  It's
starting to come out in the types of legislation that they may
be moving through their states.  The critical understanding here
is that private programs that are challenging, personal, and spiritual
can do a better job than these failed governmental programs and
that people who are really concerned with helping the poor and
protecting children should not be doing any more to defend this
failed status quo.
<p>
Until that becomes the common understanding and message, until
liberals are ready to move away from the status quo, until conservatives
are ready to understand that it's not primarily a budgetary matter
-- that it's a matter of dreams and not just dollars -- then poor
people will stay on the welfare plantation and folks who want
to misuse the word &quot;compassion&quot; to derive political
capital will still get away with it.  At this point, it's hard
to say what's going to happen with this year's welfare bill. 
It may go down.  It's hard to predict from one moment to the next
what President Clinton will do.  I'm not sure he himself knows.
And so there's a lot of bad news these days.  But when you get
around the country, outside Washington, there's absolutely no
reason to be in social or political despair.  Why?  Because both
history and the present-day efforts represented by many people
here in this room show us the alternative to either softheadedness
or hardheartedness.  And that's what I want to emphasize right
now: the positive alternatives.  There is a way that good things
can come out of this year's effort, despite the failure of both
political parties to approach the question adequately.
<p>
<center><h3>UNDERSTANDING HISTORY</h3></center>
<p>
Let me just mention quickly the history.  After all, the reason
I'm speaking to you today is because I spent a year in the bowels
of the Library of Congress searching through old records.  I became
a witness to what the predecessors of many folks here in this
room, striving so diligently, accomplished.  I can testify to
all these folks whom the standard history books have forgotten.
And if you had history courses in high school or college, I suspect
that you've never heard of some of these people whom I'll refer
to today.  And there are lots more who are great heroes of faith
in practice.
<p>
Men like Charles Brace.  Here's a guy who over a 40-year period,
from 1850 to 1890, built lodging homes in New York City that provided
shelter to several hundred thousand abandoned children.  Over
the years, he placed 91,000 children in adoptive homes.  This
was his life.  This was his career.  This was his calling, and
he performed it wonderfully.
<p>
Women like Helen Mercy Woods.  From 1881 to 1903, she ran a shelter
in Chicago for pregnant and unmarried women.  Month after month
she gave personal attention to each newcomer.  She rejoiced as
their babies were born.  She helped some of her charges get married,
others to place their children for adoption, some to get jobs.
She kept at it year after year, as many people in this room have
kept at it year after year.
<p>
I can testify about some other forgotten heroes and heroines.
Annie Richardson Kennedy.  She ran a home for unwed moms in New
York City between 1900 and 1920.  Her goal was, first, to bring
the girls in touch with their Savior and then to build character.
She provided love and opportunity for thousands, and then she
disappeared into the fog of history.  My wife doesn't mind when
I fall in love with women like Helen Mercy Woods or Annie Richardson
Kennedy.  They've all been dead for a long time.  The text books
are silent.  They've been forgotten, and I want to testify to
the contributions they made.
<p>
They're part of a larger story that none of us learned about in
high school or college.  During the 19th century, before the federal
government ever got involved, there was a war on poverty that
was far, far more successful than our own -- especially considering
the degree of difficulty they had, considering that America was
a much poorer nation a hundred years ago than it is today.  It
was a war waged by tens of thousands of local, private charitable
agencies and religious groups around the country.  It was successful,
not because they abolished poverty, but because they witnessed
movement out of poverty by millions of people.  It was successful
because there were springs of fresh water flowing among the poor,
not just blocks of ice sitting in a perpetual winter of multi-generational
welfare dependency, always winter and never Christmas.  It was
successful because the optimism that was prevalent then contrasts
so sharply with the demoralization among the poor and the cynicism
among the better off that's so common now.  I can testify that
there was a great cloud of witnesses to effective poverty-fighting.
They succeeded in large ways by knowing and doing small but vital
things.
<p>
They knew first of all that the literal meaning of &quot;compassion&quot;
is not just writing a check, but having personal involvement with
the needy -- &quot;suffering with them.&quot;  That's what &quot;compassion&quot;
means: suffering with people, not just giving to them.  The poverty-fighters
of old knew that welfare doesn't mean passing a bill, but helping
a person to fare well.  These are some simple, elementary things
that our legislators seem to have forgotten.  The older generation
knew that people should be challenged.  When an able-bodied man
came to a homeless shelter, for example, he often was asked to
chop wood for an hour or two.  Or maybe whitewash the wall of
a building.  That way he could provide part of his own support
and also help those unable to chop.  They knew.  They demonstrated
through those work tests that even the most run-down person is
not just a taker.  He can also be a giver.  They knew that everyone
is made in God's image and is capable of helping.  Why have so
many people forgotten that?  Well, we don't know much about history.
<p>
History has taught us what to avoid.  Those poverty-fighters warned
us.  I'll give you just a few of their warnings, amazingly prophetic.
Mary Richmond, one of my heroines from the Baltimore Charity
Organizing Society in 1897:  &quot;Relief given without reference
to friends and neighbors is accompanied by moral loss.  Poor neighborhoods
are doomed to grow poorer whenever the natural ties of neighborliness
are weakened by well-meant but unintelligent interference.&quot;
<p>
Carl Herrick is here from the Daylight Foundation in Louisiana,
trying to get some good stuff going there.  Well, the New Orleans
Charity Organization Society in 1899 wisely noted that  &quot;intelligent
giving and intelligent withholding are alike to charity.  Giving
money to a poor person by itself is morally neutral.  The action
can hurt if not done wisely.  If done well with discernment, it's
the best thing in the world.  If done poorly, you're only helping
a person continue on the path of destruction.&quot;
<p>
And New York charity leader Josephine Lowell:  &quot;The problem
before those who'd be charitable is not how to deal with the given
number of the poor.  It's how to help those who are poor without
adding to their numbers and constantly increasing the evils they
seek to cure.&quot;
<p>
They were very forceful.  I'll give you one more quotation here:
&quot;It's important to reform those mild, well-meaning, tenderhearted,
sweet-voiced criminals who insist upon indulging in indiscriminate
charity.&quot;  Well, they were prophetic.  But we don't know
much about history.  We've forgotten America's past successes
in poverty-fighting, and the result has been the waste of not
just billions of dollars each year but the death of part of the
American dream.
<p>
<center><h3>THE CHALLENGE OF REAL COMPASSION</h3></center>
<p>
Now let me take a moment to mention this.  This is something that
some members of the Congress, I think, understand very well. 
But others need to just drop the green eye-shades and get into
real people, real lives, real dreams, and not just the dollars.
The critical part, the essential problem of the welfare system
now, is that sometimes it succeeds in keeping people fed.  But
it kills dreams.
<p>
It kills the helping dream of many Americans.  You know, most
of you, that millions of other people would like to be generous
at the entrance to the Metro here in Washington or at street corners
in your own towns.  But if you know, and there have been studies
showing this, that most homeless recipients will use any available
funds for drugs or alcohol, the tendency is to end up walking
by, avoiding eye contact.  And there's a subtle hardening that
occurs once more.
<p>
Welfare also kills the dreams of social workers.  A lot of conservatives
sometimes talk as if social workers are our enemies.  Not so at
all.  For the most part, these are extraordinarily well-intentioned
people.  The common lament they have is, &quot;All we have time
to do is move paper.&quot;  Here's a comment from a young social
worker who had the calling, who worked at it for a couple of years
and then just couldn't do it anymore.  He said, &quot;I had a
calling.  It was that simple.  I wanted to help.&quot;  And then
he resigned.  Frustrated and worn down, burned out, realizing
that he just wasn't doing any good.
<p>
And then there are some conservatives who talk as if the enemy
is poor individuals themselves.  Again, for the most part, not
so at all.  Welfare kills dreams among poor individuals who gradually
become used to dependency.  The worst thing for children is the
fatalism that often sets in.  And we've seen this, and there are
studies that show, that after a generation or especially two generations
of welfare there is a sense of, &quot;Whatever I do, it's not
going to do any good.  My mom was this way.  I'm going to be this
way.  Probably my children are going to be this way.&quot;  It
just goes on and on and on.  A fatalism.
<p>
Children need challenge.  Kids need a sense of opportunity.  They
don't get that in the welfare system.  And, in fact, they see
that adults who sacrifice leisure time and work hard to remain
independent are often called chumps rather than champs.  It kills
the dreams among children who grow up without fathers.  Those
of you who've coached a Little League team know this.  If there
were kids without fathers there, you knew.  You can tell who's
in that situation.  They alternately cling and show standoffishness
in a way that kids with functioning dads don't.  And it breaks
your heart.  So welfare kills.
<p>
A couple of weeks ago, I spent some time in south central Los
Angeles talking with some welfare moms there who told me about
-- here's an expression I didn't  know before -- 
&quot;county-check-pillow-pimps.&quot;
That's the expression they use.  Guys who come in on the last
day of the month.  They're called &quot;county checks&quot; because
in California you get the welfare check through the county.  Guys
come in on the last day of the month, they spend the night, they
get part of the welfare check that comes from the county the next
day.  So welfare has deprived kids of fathers, and it has deprived
women of husbands.  And I'm not saying that welfare is the cause,
but it certainly is an enabler.  Instead of helping to ennoble
people in poverty, helping them to fight, welfare tells people
to give in.  It enables them to stay in it.  And it kills.
<p>
Welfare packs a theological as well as a cultural punch.  After
all, how do children understand the nature of God the Father?
How do wives understand that Christ is the good husband for His
bride, the church, when they have no experience?  They've had
no experience at all with good fathers or good husbands, and they
don't know anyone who has in their whole block.
<p>
So Washington conservatives need to spend more time with folks,
poor people who are striving to get out of welfare.  If more people
actually walked the mean streets a little bit, they'd come to
understand this crucial point.  The reason to fight these governmental
welfare programs is not because they're too expensive, but because
they're inevitably too stingy in what is truly important: treating
people as human beings made in God's image, not as animals.
<p>
<center><h3>RECOVERING THE LOST TOOLS OF CHARITY</h3></center>
<p>
But again, no reason to despair.  There is good news around the
country.  Folks here in this room who are doing it know it.  We
are recovering the lost tools of charitable success.  We're seeing
a new great cloud of witnesses emerge.  We're living in an era
with many heroes, or, I should say, ordinary people who become
heroic as they show through hard &quot;suffering-with&quot; that
the American dream of compassion is not dead.  I don't know whether
John Perkins was heroic 30 years ago.  I've read his autobiography,
and I guess that he was heroic.  But he has grown in stature,
I suspect, over these years.  He has grown in grace and the knowledge
of our Lord and Savior, Jesus Christ.  You continue to grow and
develop.
<p>
There are other people I've met who, when they started out in
their ministries, were really folks you would not consider to
be charismatic individuals at all.  They've become so over the
years.  They've learned.  They've grown.  One example.  A friend
of mine now, Bob Cote in Denver.  He's a tall, white ex-boxer.
He spent a year on the streets as an alcoholic in the early '80s.
Then he pulled together a few of his fellow winos and junkies
to start a homeless shelter, a program in Denver that's known
as Step 13.  Bob showed me around his four-story building -- he'd
be glad to give you a tour if you're in Denver sometime.  He showed
me how mostly dead people from off the streets can step-by-step
come back to life.  They can get jobs with increasing responsibility.
They can get rooms within that building that gradually reflect
greater independence.  They go from a big dormitory, to kind of
an alcove, to separate rooms with a lock on the door.  And they're
buying their own furniture and getting their own phone accounts,
and they're ready to step out and lead independent, responsible
lives.  It's a tough, time-intensive process, but Bob Cote has
been there himself.  He's there to help others.
<p>
A person right here in Washington, Hannah Hawkins, who lives down
in Anacostia.  A great person to visit.  She's short, black and
retired, but she voluntarily runs an after-school program that
has several dozen children doing their homework, receiving the
love they often don't get at home.  You go down there and sometimes
it's wild.  Sometimes those kids run around like lost sheep, but
she knows each one of her lambs by name.  It's challenging, it's
personal, it's spiritual.
<p>
I wish you'd come with me and visit Freddy Garcia in San Antonio.
He's a softhearted but hardheaded Hispanic ex-addict.  He formed
Victory Outreach some 30 years ago in San Antonio to help substance
abusers.  Groups based on his teaching now have spread throughout
Texas to California, even as far south as Peru.  I've sat in his
home this year.  I've watched the way he patiently counsels and
teaches those whom everyone else has abandoned.
<p>
This has been a good year for me, with all the travel and hubbub
and so forth.  I've really been blessed to see and come to know
some of these people.  And I'm here to testify that they succeeded,
and they're still succeeding and others can too.  They have the
common understanding.  They picked it up somewhere, somehow, that
in order to be effective, compassion must be challenging, personal
and spiritual.  CPS for short.  Just like CPR can bring back to
life a dying person, CPS can bring back to life that dying American
dream.
<p>
Again, if you're not familiar with some of these places, go and
visit.  Go down about a mile away to Clean and Sober Streets here
in Washington or the Gospel Mission with Reverend Woods.  At Clean
and Sober Streets, it's interesting that there are really tough
rules just as there are at the Gospel Mission.  One strike, you're
out.  There is compassion that is challenging, personal, and spiritual
at the Right Alternative Center in Milwaukee.  This is something
that Bill Schambra from the Bradley Foundation knows about well,
and has helped quite a bit.  People sometimes say that AFDC moms
will be stuck on the government rolls for a lifetime.  You go
there and you talk with the folks, and you will learn that the
moms there take a 13-part pledge.  They pledge to change their
own behavior.  Not to swear, not to shack up, not to do drugs.
And the leaders there challenge them to stick to their pledges.
And when they do, their lives change.  Some of them get married,
some of them get jobs, they run their households better, their
kids start doing better in school, the kids break out of their
fatalism.  That's the key enemy: not poverty, but fatalism.
<p>
There's compassion of that sort at the Union Gospel Mission in
Portland, the Disabled Businesspersons Association in San Diego,
and the Resources, Inc. program in Brooklyn -- the Samaritan Award
winners who are here today.  I've read their reports.  Challenging,
personal, spiritual.  Not easy.  Not easy at all, but possible.
<p>
I have personally seen some successes over the years.  I've seen
lives of pregnant, unmarried women turned around.  I've seen abandoned
children happily adopted.  I've seen failures.  Recently, I was
working with a homeless ex-con.  I thought that he was making
good progress, but now he has slipped back into irresponsibility.
He's in jail right now.  He's having a hearing next week.  Maybe
he'll get out and have another start.  I sent him over to the
most challenging shelter in Austin, Texas the same day I sent
my oldest son to college.  But my homeless friend, Fred, just
lasted three days at the shelter, and then he went back out on
the streets and is now in jail.  My son is still at the University
of Texas.
<p>
So, it's not easy, but it is possible.  People do change.  God
changed me.  He moved me out of the Marxism that I adhered to
25 years ago.  He brought me to a knowledge of Christ, and I'm
thankful to Him.  Other people can change.  You see it all the
time, and there's lots of experience in the room testifying to
that as well.
<p>
<center><h3>TOWARD A THEOLOGY OF CHARITY</h3></center>
<p>
But in order to really have confidence that this change can occur,
we have to do a couple of things.  And they're not primarily political.
The first thing we have to do is just awaken ourselves theologically
and put God's principles to work.  Only after that do we have
to start working on some public policy matters.
<p>
There is a lot of false gospel that's being offered now.  There
are those on the religious left who say that the Bible mandates
the government transfers of resources to the poor on the grounds
of, for example, Jesus' statement, &quot;Whatever you did to the
least of these, brethren, you did to Me.&quot;  Now I take that
verse very seriously.  But before we blindly use it to justify
the welfare state, we need to ask who are the least of these in
America?  What kind of help is real help?  Certainly, children
threatened with death before birth by abortion are among the least
of these, and I would love for all of the groups on the Christian
left that have been proclaiming so vociferously their love for
the unwanted, the poor, and the neglected to really work hard
on abortion.  Women abandoned by their husbands, children who
grow up without fathers.  They also have it very rough and the
concern should be: How do you give them hope?  How do you break
out of that fatalism?
<p>
But what about able-bodied homeless men?  One of the prime changes
in the welfare legislation that is chugging through Congress,
shortly to hit President Clinton's desk, is a cut (actually a
real cut) in aid to homeless men who are addicts or alcoholics.
Here's a hard case.  Here's something that I think obviously
should be changed.  Does irresponsibility qualify a person for
the ranks of the least of these?  Jesus does not include in his
list of commended charitable acts, &quot;When I was strung out,
you gave me dope.&quot;  If we take seriously Christ's words in
Matthew 25, &quot;Whatever you did to the least of these, my brethren,
you did to Me,&quot; then giving money that goes for drugs is
akin to sticking heroin into Jesus' veins.  So rather than proclaiming
the dire effect of cuts generally -- instead of rushing into the
guns at Cold Harbor -- why not accurately and carefully look at
some of these measures and say, &quot;Aha, this is something that
really should be cut&quot;?  Instead, we're not really getting
to that level of specific detail.  Instead, we're just hearing
the blanket condemnations of any movement away from the status
quo as if anything at all, any change at all, is an indication
of hardheartedness.
<p>
Well, if we straighten out the theology, the practice follows.
When I was a Marxist, I believed in top-down approaches, emphasizing
government redistribution.  But as a Christian, I understand that
change comes one by one from the inside out.  Straighten out the
theology of those who are rich, and there will be a tremendous
expansion of effective compassion.  Straighten out the theology
of those who are economically poor because of poor values, and
their attitudes and behaviors will change.  And they will make
progress.  So the essence here is revival and reformation among
both rich and poor.  That will transform American poverty-fighting.
There would be such an outpouring of private charity, if we had
that revival and reformation, that governmental programs could
rapidly be replaced.  We would not even have to debate the question
of tax credits for charitable contributions.
<p>
<center><h3>PUBLIC POLICY, POVERTY, AND THE PREAMBLE</h3></center>
<p>
But while we can hope and pray for revival and reformation, it's
not something that we can count on.  And so here we do come to
questions of public policy.  I'd suggest that a firm distinction
that needs to be made is the constitutional distinction between
&quot;providing&quot; and &quot;promoting.&quot;  The Constitution
talks about &quot;providing&quot; for the common defense, but
&quot;promoting&quot; the general welfare.  There's such a huge
difference between, say, renting a hall for a convention and manning
every booth in that hall yourself.  That's the difference between
providing and promoting.  We're in the mess we're in right now
because the government has attempted to provide welfare, and instead
it has given us entitlements and bureaucracy.  There's a legitimate
role for government, promoting the general welfare, but not providing.
<p>
That's where we come to this question of tax credits on either
a state or national level.  Frankly, I'd rather see it done on
a state-by-state level because we don't know exactly what the
best tax credit mechanism is.  The best way will promote discerning
giving on the part of individuals while avoiding government entanglement
with religious and other charities as much as possible.  We don't
know whether a hundred percent tax credit is absolutely the best
thing, or whether a 90 percent tax credit would generate just
about the same amount of income for private and church charities.
But a 90 percent tax credit would encourage considerably more
discernment on the part of givers because they'd be putting up,
let's say, a hundred dollars of their own money on a thousand
dollar contribution.  They might think a little more seriously
about where it's going.
<p>
I'm also worried about credits without any personal involvement.
It would be much better if we could offer tax credits only to
the individuals who also spend some time at the charities to which
they are giving.  The bookkeeping in that may be too complicated.
It may not work.  But I'd actually prefer to see things go on
a state-by-state basis so we would have some experiments.  Tax
credits, I think, are a very good idea.  And the constitutional
questions of interference with religious groups can be resolved.
If you have a coalition strong enough to pass tax credits, you
have a coalition strong enough to protect religious groups from
federal interference.
<p>
There is no reason, in fact, why you can't have a national approach
and state approaches at the same time, trying out different things
over these next few years to see what will best promote community-based,
poverty-fighting charities.  What I don't understand is why some
of the big philanthropic and charitable groups are not getting
on the team for tax measures to encourage giving.  You'd think
that they would be eager for such a reform, or else they're just
in the position of saying &quot;no, no, no&quot; to any change,
more and more vehemently.  I'd challenge those big charities like
Catholic Charities, but others also.  Why don't they propose something
positive instead of defending to the death a failed status quo?
If their concern is adequate funding for poverty programs, why
not tax credits?  Or else you have to start raising the question:
Are they more concerned about the poor, or about holding on to
their own power?  I'm not sure.  Everyone I've met from those
organizations is well-intentioned, but they've grown so used to
kissing up to government officials instead of going to individual
taxpayers and making the case to them that they deserve support.
Well, I don't know, but it's a problem.  It's a sad state of
affairs.
<p>
There are people who say, well, any other alternative just simply
will not work.  I was reading the other day about the case of
a student of management named Fred Smith, who went on to found
Federal Express.  And he described, in a term paper, his idea
for a reliable overnight delivery service.  His professor gave
him a &quot;C&quot; and explained that the concept was interesting
and well-formed.  &quot;But in order to earn better than a 'C,'&quot;
he said, &quot;the idea must be feasible.&quot;  Charity tax credit
proposals are feasible.  We need to experiment a little bit, but
we need to fight for them.  And we need to push the big philanthropies
and the big philanthropic trade organizations like Independent
Sector and the Council on Foundations to support them also.
<p>
This public policy stuff is important, but the tendency -- especially
here in Washington -- is to fall into the trap of thinking that
a particular piece of legislation is the solution.  Charity tax
credits are a great mechanism to take money off the top of the
governmental superstructure and stick it back on the bottom in
private and religious charities where it can do the most good.
But it's still just a mechanism.  The more time I spend in Washington,
the more I feel as if I'm reading from a manual for medical emergencies
put together by people whose goals exceed their wisdom.  This
is like a recommendation from a student in a junior high school
science class for a nose bleed: Put the nose much lower than the
body until the heart stops.
<p>
The public policy change is essential, but we can't wait for that.
Again, I am somewhat aghast at the thought of mentioning this
to some of you who have done so much over the years.  You know
the answer to this question very well because you've lived it.
But the question is: How does each of us individually help children
and adults now one by one?  How do we create models for the way
the entire welfare system can be transformed and replaced?  What
first steps can those of us in this room take?
<p>
<center><h3>TAKING FIRST STEPS</h3></center>
<p>
Especially in this group, I'm nervous about mentioning any of
the things that my wife and I have been involved in, but they've
been educational for us.  And again, as a number of you who know
me know, I am not always the most diplomatic person around.  Frederica
Mathewes-Green knows.  She is one of our national correspondents
at <I>World</I> magazine, and so she and I discuss editorial matters
and stories occasionally.  I want to be kind of a hard-nosed editor
at times, and so I tend not to be the nicest guy around.  My wife
is a much better person than I am in that regard.  But I tend
to think, okay, as bullheaded as I am, I have been able with my
wife to give a room in our home to needy individuals, to coach
kids in baseball, to tutor children, to mentor some folks, and
to adopt a child.  If I -- not a particularly hospitable individual,
a guy who would rather spend time in the bowels of the Library
of Congress than actually helping someone directly -- if I once
and awhile can do something a little bit decent, why can't people
with much greater merits, with much greater abilities and niceness
and goodness, do the same or even much more?
<p>
I know that many of you already give of yourselves a lot.  Can
you do even more?  Again, some of you I know are just working
already to the max.  Some of you have not probably been involved
with the poor at all.  Will you take a first step?  Just think
for a moment.  If I were a liberal, I would want you to close
your eyes and visualize world peace.  As it is, I want you to
visualize in your mind's eye one poor person whom you have directly,
personally helped during the past year.  A lot of you, I'm sure,
can do that and can probably visualize lots and lots of people.
If you don't see anyone, I pray that you'll take a small step
during 1996, and maybe then even a larger one: tutoring a child
for one hour a week, being a big brother or big sister, or Little
League coach, mentoring an adult who's gotten in trouble, providing
Biblical counsel to a young, unmarried pregnant woman, maybe giving
her a room in your home, maybe adopting a child.  Those steps
are hard, but we're surrounded.  We are just so surrounded by
a great cloud of witnesses, men and women like ourselves who have
taken first steps and then many more.  This is what I have learned
by going around the country this year.
<p>
Remember chapters 11 and 12 of Hebrews talking about the great
cloud of witnesses?  Hebrews 12:1 says, &quot;Therefore, since
we are surrounded by a great cloud of witnesses, let us lay aside
every weight.  Let us run with patience the race that is set before
us.&quot;  Let's work theologically, let's work politically, let's
work personally.  As we work and pray, let's remember that 2,000
years ago Jesus Christ came into the world to suffer with us,
to die for us, and in this year of our Lord 1995 it is such a
great blessing to see godly people who follow in His steps.
<p>
It was six years ago, just before Christmas 1989, that I began
trying in my own real small way to resurrect the word &quot;compassion&quot;
among conservatives and to promote some compassionate alternatives
to failed welfare programs.  I gave a talk six years ago at the
Heritage Foundation, and I just ran across a copy in my files
a couple of days ago while thinking about what I would say here
today.  I gave it at the time when I was in the middle of my historical
research at the Library of Congress.  But it still seems relevant
to me, and I haven't talked about this for a long time.  Let me
just read the ending of that talk:
<p>
<blockquote><i>It's beginning to look a lot like Christmas.  A time when 
God came to earth to teach, to suffer, and to save by suffering. 
A generation ago, Whittaker Chambers wrote that 'suffering is
at the heart of every living faith.  That is why a man can scarcely
call himself a Christian for whom the crucifixion is not a daily
suffering.'  Chambers knew that Christianity is rooted in suffering.
I would add 'suffering with.'  But he recognized that the meaning
of the faith 'has been blurred as Christianity, in common with
the voices of a new age, seeks new escapes from the problem of
suffering.  Nothing is more characteristic of this age than its
obsession with an avoidance of suffering.'  Are we in America,
and conservatives especially, serious people?  Frankly, I do not
always know whether I am.  I do not know whether you are.  I hope
we are.  I pray that we are, but I do not know.  I do not know,
but finding out is the challenge of the 1990s for the conservative
movement.</i></blockquote>
<p>
That was what I was saying in 1989.  Now it's 1995, and we've
made some progress.  The battle for the word &quot;compassion,&quot;
the understanding of compassion, is now on.  But the body count
is growing.  Those bodies that are Cold Harbors all over the inner
cities of this country are just piling up.  And the defenders
of this status quo are tenacious.  At least we're in the fight.
It's hard, but it's glorious.  I've been glad to be fighting
alongside a lot of you this year.  And I pray that that will continue
and that we will overcome with God's grace.
<p>
Thank you very much.

<h2>RELIGIOUS PERSECUTION<br>
AROUND THE WORLD</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<h4>Testimony of Martin J. Dannenfelser, Jr.<br>
Assistant to the President for Government Relations<br>
Family Research Council<br>
before the House Committee on International Relations<br>
Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights<br>
February 15, 1996</h4></center>

Thank you, Mr. Chairman. First, I would like to express the apology
of our president, Gary Bauer, for being unable to testify. He
did intend to be here. He wanted to thank you for your leadership
on this issue and to express that apology.

<p>

Mr. Chairman, it is truly ironic that some of the world's biggest
problems fail to attract the notice they deserve. That is the
message we get on the global problem of anti-Christian persecution.
That persecution is growing, both in frequency and in cruelty.
We are appalled at the lack of concern and public attention being
paid to the hidden horror of anti-Christian persecution.

<p>

This persecution takes many forms. Under predominantly Islamic
and former Communist governments, Bibles and religious services
are being banned, missionaries and converts are being imprisoned,
and in Ethiopia believers are actually being crucified. One of
our staff members, Rosanne Dupras, was a volunteer worker overseas
for seven years and has traveled extensively throughout Asia.
She has witnessed the persecution of individuals because of their
religious faith. For example, India is hailed as the world's largest
democracy, with a population of almost 1 billion people. Eighty-five
percent are Hindu, 12 percent Muslim, and 1-2 percent are Christian.
Although the national government describes itself as a secular
democracy with freedom of religion for all -- the government has
taken a less-than-tangible approach to the outcries of persecution.

<p>

Miss Dupras recalls how Sunil, a native of India and a Christian,
was jailed, harassed, stripped naked and interrogated for an endless
number of hours. The compound where he lived was vandalized. He
was slandered and vilified in the local press by persecutors who
included police officials, government intelligence agents, as
well as radical Hindu fundamentalists. The state government participated
in and initiated many of the attacks -- the federal government simply 
turned a blind eye. Atrocities like this occur frequently in 
nation-states that give lip-service to freedom of religion while 
persecuting any deviance from their own ideology of religion.

<p>

Allow me to clarify that this persecution extends beyond Christianity
to include other faiths, although persecution of Christians seems
to be the most widespread. In Ayodhya, Miss Dupras reports that
Hindu groups slaughtered Muslims as the police watched and in
Bombay the police themselves were the ones who massacred Muslims.
A young Muslim Bengali woman in Bangladesh had to flee for her
life after writing a book which was sympathetic to Hindus rather
than to Muslims. She is still hiding somewhere in the West.

<p>

So far, the U.S. Government has largely turned a deaf ear to this
rising tide of terrorism and these human rights violations. Saudi
Arabia, our recent ally in the Gulf War, has pressured the U.S.
on two fronts. The first was to close a U.S.-sponsored nightclub
frequented by American servicemen in Saudi Arabia. Our government
said &quot;No way!&quot; to closing it. The Saudis also demanded
that we stop Sunday worship services at our embassy. To this,
we buckled under. In Turkey, the U.S. has turned a blind eye as
Turkish officials forcibly returned Christian refugees to the
clutches of Iran.

<p>

On January 15, 1996, <I>The Wall Street Journal</I> reported,
&quot;China's religious authorities ordered all places of worship
to register with the government in what may be the beginning of
a new crackdown on religion.&quot;[1] A Mona Charen column elaborated:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

. . . persecution is commonplace in China, where only a fraction
of the estimated 30 million to 70 million Christians belong to
government-approved sects. Amnesty International reports cases
of Christian women hung by their thumbs from wires and beaten
with heavy rods, denied food and water, and shocked with electric
probes.[2]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

Ms. Charen's column described the following abuses under Sudan's
Islamic government:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

many of the black Sudanese in the southern part of the country
(the north is Arab) have resisted conversion, in many cases because
of adherence to Christianity . . . As punishment, the Sudanese
government has denied food and medicine to Christians in famine
areas and has sold thousands of Christian children -- some as
young as 6 -- into slavery.[3]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

Tolerating episodes such as these conflicts not only with the
inalienable rights of life, liberty, and the pursuit of happiness
in our own Declaration of Independence but even those basic human
rights universally accepted. These rights include, under the Universal
Declaration of Human Rights: the right to life, liberty and security
of person (Article 3); freedom from slavery or servitude in all
their forms (Article 4); freedom from torture or cruel, inhuman
or degrading treatment or punishment (Article 5); equal protection
of the law without any discrimination (Article 7); the right to
freedom of thought, conscience and religion; freedom to change
his religion or belief and to manifest his religion or belief
in teaching, practice, worship and observance (Article 18); freedom
of opinion and expression (Article 19); and the freedom of peaceful
assembly and association without compulsion to belong to a particular
association (Article 20). Christian persecution is a gross violation
of human rights.

<p>

In the United States, an historical example of our defense of
religious minority rights abroad is the 1974 Jackson-Vanik amendment,
which made Jewish emigration a condition for aid to the Soviet
Union.[4] Title 22 of the United States Code Service contains the
following passage:

<p><blockquote>

<i>

The Congress declares that the individual liberties, economic
prosperity, and security of the people of the United States are
best sustained and enhanced in a community of nations which respect
individual civil and economic rights and freedoms... Furthermore,
the Congress reaffirms the traditional humanitarian ideals of
the American people...[5]

</i>

</blockquote><p>

The U.S. development cooperation policy emphasizes the encouragement
of development processes in which individual civil and economic
rights are respected and enhanced as one of its four principal
goals. It insists that the &quot;. . . pursuit of these goals
requires that development concerns be fully reflected in United
States foreign policy.&quot;[6] Our policy toward humanitarian violations
is quite clear, and the real tragedy here is the appalling lack
of concern here at home and the lack of action by the administration.

<p>

It's time to end the silence of our President and his administration.
President Clinton must waste no time in addressing the American
people, issuing demarches to offending nations, initiating letters
to Heads of State, and working with the State Department desk
officers in the offending nations. The President's focus should
begin with the most egregious violators such as China, Ethiopia,
and the Sudan. Hopefully, other countries will begin to change
their policies when they see the tangible consequences of their
inhumane actions.

<p>

As a candidate for president in 1992, Bill Clinton criticized
former President George Bush for &quot;coddling dictators&quot;
in his policy toward China. Ironically, it is the Clinton administration
that has now totally decoupled the issues of human rights and
Most Favored Nation (MFN) trade status for China. This action
sends a signal that the U.S. Government is prepared to do nothing
more than pay lip service to China's human rights abuses, which
include persecution of Christians, forced abortion, and slave
labor. We call on President Clinton to heed his own advice and
stop coddling persecutors of Christians. The time has come for
rhetoric to be joined with actions and results.

<p>

It's time to end the silence of Congress in decrying these outrageous
violations of freedom of speech. This kind of brutality compels
Congress to action: &quot;Dear Colleague&quot; letters, House
Resolutions, floor speeches, and necessary adjustment in our foreign
economic policy. I strongly suggest an expanded bipartisan coalition
to establish a checklist of conditions required for economic aid
with a commitment to inquire, track, reprimand, and call for sanctions
against violators. Consistent action is demanded in order to stop
the <I>de facto</I> tolerance of such grievous offenses.

<p>

It's also time to end the silence of the citizens and churches
of America. The Family Research Council is committed to doing
our part in educating citizens and churches, and encouraging their
involvement and participation. America as a whole can no longer
remain silent.

<p>

America has an obligation and responsibility to speak out against
manifestations of tyranny and oppression. Indeed, it was our forefathers
who fled to this country for freedom of religion, speech, and
expression. These are values that unite this country, and we should
defend them. The <I>Department of State Bulletin</I> from December,
1984 put it succinctly: &quot;the moral bases of democracy --
the principles of individual rights, freedom of thought and expression,
freedom of religion -- are powerful barriers against those who
seek to impose their will, their ideologies, or other religious
beliefs by force.&quot;[7] If we fail to speak out forthrightly in
defense of the freedoms endowed by our Creator, we will undermine
our nation and the principles it is built upon. It is a central
element of our national heritage to stand up and, as documented
again in a September 1989 <I>Department of State Bulletin,</I>
&quot;stress the protection of freedom of thought, conscience
and religion, and of freedom of opinion and expression; for without
these freedoms, other rights cannot be fully realized.&quot;[8]

<p>

Some argue that they cannot speak up, because it will only tempt
the tyrants to greater cruelty. But history teaches the opposite
lesson. Speaking fearlessly is the only thing that deters tyrants.
The time has come for Americans to demand that our government
act now to stop this unconscionable persecution. Clearly, the
pro-family and religious communities need to be full partners
in the quest to bring an end to the horror of religious persecution.
Failure to do all within our power will sear at our collective
consciences as we hear the anguished voices of our brothers and
sisters overseas who cry out, &quot;Why have you forsaken us?&quot;

<title>THE IMPORTANCE OF FAMILIES AND MARRIAGE</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">

<h2>THE IMPORTANCE OF FAMILIES<br>
AND MARRIAGE</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<h4>Testimony of Robert H. Knight<br>
before the<br>
Senate Health, Education and Social Services Committee,<br>
State of Alaska<br>
regarding SB 308, which would amend the state's marriage statute<br>
March 18, 1996</h4></center>

Thank you for inviting me to testify on behalf of the Family Research
Council. I've been asked to give a brief statement summarizing
the importance of families and of marriage.

<p>

One of the Family Research Council's functions is that of a clearinghouse
on research about families. Over the years, we have seen studies
pile up to an overwhelming magnitude which show that children
do best in mother-and-father families, and that communities are
healthier where you find the most intact families.

<p>

Likewise, numerous studies show that marriage is a societal good,
leading to more fulfilled, and even longer lives. Typical is a
study in the <I>American Journal of Sociology</I> that finds married
couples have longer lifespans than unmarried people. The authors
conclude that &quot;for both sexes, the hazard of dying falls
significantly with marital duration, suggesting a cumulation of
the benefits of marriage over time.&quot; The researchers say
their findings are hardly surprising: &quot;The relationship between
marriage and death rates has now reached the status of a truism,
having been observed across numerous societies and various social
and demographic groups.&quot;[1]

<p>

The heart of family life is marriage, the key organizing principle
behind all civilization. Marriage, which brings the two sexes
together in a unique legal, social, economic and spiritual union,
has had special protection within the law and the culture because
it is indispensable to civilized life. No other relationship provides
society what marriage does. No other relationship transforms young
men and women into more productive, less selfish and more mature
husbands and wives, and fathers and mothers, than marriage. No
other relationship affords children the best economic, emotional
and psychological environment. Only as we have drifted from
the defense of marriage have we experienced soaring social problems,
such as divorce, illegitimacy, sexually-transmitted diseases,
and crime. The answer is not to push the envelope further but
to restore the primacy of marriage within the law and the culture.

<p>

Over the years, there have been attempts to redefine marriage
outside the one-man, one-woman definition. In the mid-1800s, some
people tried to legalize multiple-partner unions, but were soundly
rebuffed. In fact, the U.S. Supreme Court declared in 1885 that
any prospective state had to have law resting on &quot;the basis
of the idea of the family, as consisting in and springing from
the union for life of one man and one woman in the holy estate
of matrimony; the sure foundation of all that is stable and noble
in our civilization, the best guaranty of that reverent morality
which is the source of all beneficent progress in social and political
improvement.&quot; (<I>Murphy v. Ramsey</I>)[2]

<p>

Marriage is not something that can be taken lightly, or altered
without much impact. Same-sex proponents often point out that
some states once banned interracial marriage, but the comparison
is invalid. Skin color is inborn and benign, while sexual behavior
has everything to do with character, morality and society's basic
rules of conduct. Eliminating one entire sex from an institution
defined as the bringing together of the two sexes is a quantum
leap from eliminating racial discrimination, which did not alter
the fundamental character of marriage.

<p>

Marriage reflects the natural moral and social law which is in
evidence all over the world. No society has loosened sexual morality
outside of man-woman marriage and survived. Analyzing studies
of cultures spanning several thousands of years on several continents,
Harvard sociologist Pitirim Sorokin found that virtually all political
revolutions that brought about societal collapse were preceded
by a sexual revolution in which marriage and family were devalued.[3]
When marriage lost its unique status, women and children most
frequently were the direct victims.

<p>

Giving same-sex relationships or out-of-wedlock heterosexual couples
the same special status and benefits as the marital bond would
not be the expansion of a right but the destruction of a principle.
One can no more expand a definition of marriage than one can expand
the definition of a yardstick and still use it as a reliable measure.

<p>

If the one-man, one-woman definition of marriage is broken, there
is no logical stopping point for continuing the assault on marriage.
If feelings are the key requirement, than why not let three people
marry, or two adults and a child, or consenting blood relatives
of legal age?

<p>

Marriage-based kinship is essential to stability and continuity.
A man is far more apt to sacrifice himself to help a bona fide
son-in-law than some unrelated man (or woman) who lives with his
daughter. Kinship imparts family names, heritage and property,
secures the identity and commitment of fathers for the sake of
the children, and entails mutual obligations to the community.
Same-sex relations are a negation of the ties that bind, which
are the continuation of kinship through the procreation of children.

<p>

Even childless married couples retain the possibility of becoming
parents either biologically or through adoption, thus providing
children with role models of both sexes. Marriages benefit more
than the two people involved, or even the children who are created.
Their influence reaches children living nearby, as young minds
seek out clues to appropriate sexual behavior. Deliberately creating
motherless or fatherless families is not remotely in the interests
of children or the community, and benefits only a particular political
agenda.

<p>

Homosexual activist Michaelangelo Signorile put it candidly when
he wrote that activists should &quot;fight for same-sex marriage
and its benefits and then, once granted, redefine the institution
of marriage completely, to demand the right to marry not as a
way of adhering to society's moral codes but rather to debunk
a myth and radically alter an archaic institution....&quot;[4] Likewise,
homosexual activist Tom Stoddard admits that &quot;I am no fan
of marriage&quot; but he sees &quot;gay marriage&quot; as a way
of forcing society to accept homosexuality because marriage &quot;is
the centerpiece of our entire social structure, the core of the
traditional notion of 'family.'&quot;[5] But when homosexuals talk
about marriage and monogamy, they mean something different from
what folks usually mean. Evidence is overwhelming that few gay
couples are stable, and those that are, have an understanding
to have outside sexual contacts. Andrew Sullivan, the homosexual
editor of <I>The New Republic</I>, concedes in his book <I>Virtually
Normal</I> that homosexual relationships are quite different.
He contends that many homosexual households reflect &quot;greater
understanding of the need for extramarital outlets between two
men than between a man and a woman.&quot;

<p>

Clearly, those who care deeply about children, about morality,
about the well being of the larger society, must resist the attempts
by a tiny segment of the population to seize marriage for their
own purposes. The aggressors here are not ordinary people, who
are doing their best to live according to ages-old, time-tested
morality and family definition, but those who are trying to harness
the power of the law to force acceptance of their agenda. Individuals
struggling with same-sex desires should be accorded compassion,
but this does not mean they should be given a mandate to radically
redefine marriage.

<p>

Marriage must be protected, and creating counterfeit versions
would undermine the special status of marriage in the law and
in the culture -- to the detriment of children, families and, finally,
to civilization itself.

<p>

Thank you.

<title>WELFARE REFORM AND ILLEGITIMACY</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">

<h2>WELFARE REFORM AND<br>
ILLEGITIMACY</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<h4>Written Testimony submitted by Gary L. Bauer<br>
to the<br>
United States House of Representatives<br>
Ways and Means Subcommittee on Human Resources<br>
March 12, 1996</h4></center>

<p>

In the welfare debate last year, President Clinton himself stated
that &quot;the real source of [the] problem is the inordinate
number of out-of-wedlock births in this country.&quot;[1] He also
conceded that &quot;there's no question that [ending welfare for
unwed mothers] would work. The question is... 'Is it morally
right?'&quot;[2]

<p>

While the President's proposed policies leave much to be desired,
he has formulated precisely the right question to frame the current
debate over welfare reform in general and illegitimacy in particular.
There can be no more important policy objective than the preservation
-- or more properly in this day and age, the revitalization --
of our nation's moral capital.  As James Q. Wilson wrote in his
oft-cited article, &quot;The Rediscovery of Character: Private
Virtue and Public Policy&quot;:

<p><blockquote>

<i>The essential first step is to acknowledge that at root, in
almost  every area of  important public concern, we are seeking
to induce  persons to act virtuously....Not only is such conduct
desirable in  its own right, it appears now to be necessary if
large improvements  are to be made in those matters we consider
problems.</i>[3]

</blockquote><p>

There exists a striking public consensus that the welfare state's
practice of subsidizing illegitimacy is not only a massive problem,
but a moral problem at root.

<p>

Even so unlikely a source as Bruce Reed, President Clinton's leading
aide on welfare reform, once acknowledged that the essential purpose
of reform must be to reverse the alarming rise in out-of-wedlock
births.[4] If not driven exclusively by AFDC &quot;benefits,&quot;
the increase has at least been sustained and perpetuated by the
expansion of a system that pays recipients to bear illegitimate
children.  Current trends indicate that by the year 2015 -- some
studies project as early as 2000 -- one of every two American
babies will be born to a single mother, and illegitimacy will
surpass divorce as the main cause of fatherlessness.

<p>

Already, according to the Census Bureau, approximately one of
every three babies born in the United States is born to a single
mother.  In the black inner city, more than 80 percent of children
are born without fathers.  In many poor white communities, the
figure is nearing 50 percent -- and illegitimacy is increasing
more rapidly among whites than any other racial group.  Illegitimacy
ratios for the country's white population have now climbed higher
than the illegitimacy ratios in the black community that compelled
Senator Moynihan to issue his famous warning about the breakdown
of the black family.

<p>

Even if a job program can succeed in putting more unmarried welfare
mothers to work (which is unlikely),[5] we will still be left with
roughly the same number of fatherless children.  While Great Britain
has already succeeded in implementing reforms that make work economically
more attractive than welfare, the reforms of the 1980s have only
served to underscore in both Britain and America the fact that
little progress can be made without addressing the collapse of
the family.[6]

<p>

When the Moynihan Report appeared over thirty years ago, liberal
intellectuals excoriated the author for &quot;defending middle-class
values.&quot;  &quot;What may seem to be a disease to the white
middle class may be a healthy adaptation to the Negro lower class,&quot;
Bayard Rustin intoned.[7] Today, however, overwhelming empirical
evidence demonstrates that there is nothing at all &quot;healthy&quot;
about the decay of families and that not all personal choices
are equal in terms of their impact on children, families, and
communities.  The evidence itself has propelled illegitimacy to
the forefront of the current national debate over welfare reform
-- or at least, <I>had</I> propelled illegitimacy to the forefront
before President Clinton and the Governors signaled their retreat.

<p>

Retreat is inexcusable, for the fact remains that intact families
bestow upon individuals and communities advantages that simply
come no other way.  We cannot repeat too often, in a climate rife
with attempts to seize the moral high ground, that no moral judgment
even need be adduced.  The empirical evidence amassed by social
scientists in the last 10 years (and chronicled by Barbara Dafoe
Whitehead in her April 1993 <I>Atlantic</I> article, &quot;Dan
Quayle Was Right&quot;) has confirmed in exquisite detail what
those who have lived in broken families already know.  A single
woman with children is not a viable economic unit for the vast
majority, but children need biological fathers for much more than
the extra dollars they add to the family budget.  As social scientist
Charles Murray has written, single parenthood is &quot;damaging
to children in so many ways that to list them individually would
be to trivialize them.&quot;[8]

<p>

<I>Children born to single mothers are more likely to experience
abuse or neglect; and they have higher infant mortality rates
and lower birth weights regardless of the age or race of the mother</I>.
The proportion of low birth-weight babies, for example, increases
by 50 percent if the mother is not married.  Dr. Nicholas Eberstadt,
author of &quot;Why Babies Die in D.C.&quot; (<I>The Public Interest,
</I> Spring 1994), observes that &quot;so substantial are the differentials
associated with illegitimacy that an American baby born to a teenage
mother is less likely to register low birth weight if the
mother is married and black than if she is unmarried but white.&quot;[9]
In the early 1980s, black and white babies alike were less likely
to survive the first year of life born to an unmarried college
graduate than to a married high school dropout.[10]

<p>

For those children born out-of-wedlock who do survive, long-term
life prospects are equally discouraging.  According to data from
the National Fatherhood Initiative, only 4.4 percent of children
who live with both parents are expelled or suspended from school.
By contrast, 15.5 percent of fatherless children will be dismissed
or suspended.  Among children living with a never-married mother,
29.7 percent repeat a grade in school as opposed to 11.6 percent
of children overall.  And a 1988 University of Illinois study
of adults born outside of marriage found that the longer the time
spent in a single-parent family, the less education the child
ultimately attained -- regardless of the parent's income level.

<p>

Children born out-of-wedlock also have greater problems with behavioral
development.  The National Survey of Children found that children
from single-parent families are two to three times more likely
to have emotional problems -- three times as likely to find themselves
in psychotherapy.  Lack of self-control is a common failing.

<p>

Not surprisingly, Charles Murray has concluded that &quot;illegitimacy
is the single most important social problem of our time...because
it drives everything else.&quot;[11] According to the Bureau of
Justice Statistics, more than 70 percent of all juveniles in state
reform institutions come from fatherless homes.  Raymond A. Knight
and Robert A. Prentky have reported in the journal <I>Criminal
Justice Behavior</I> that 60 percent of all violent rapists who
were repeat offenders came from single-parent households.  And
a Michigan State University study reported in 1987 in <I>Behavioral
Sciences and the Law</I> found that 75 percent of the adolescent
murderers surveyed had come from homes where the parents were
divorced or never married. <I>The relationship between crime
and one-parent families is so powerful, in fact, that controlling
for family structure erases the relationship between crime and
race and between crime and low income</I>.

<p>

Compounding the cycle of despair, illegitimacy feeds itself too.
Young white women who grow up without a father in the home are
more than twice as likely to bear children out-of-wedlock and
to do so during their teenage years when they are most likely
to form long-term attachments to AFDC.[12] Research by the Heritage
Foundation, based on the National Longitudinal Survey of Youth,
found that young girls raised in single-parent homes in public
housing are roughly five times more likely to bear children out-of-wedlock
themselves than girls raised in two-parent homes.[13]

<p>

If those on the welfare rolls have suffered most conspicuously,
it is also true that the welfare system has corrupted the ideals
and narrowed the vision of many who live well beyond the bounds
of the inner city -- even as it is now threatening our most cherished
civic institutions.  One obvious casualty is the weakening of
our conviction that the so-called &quot;bourgeois virtues&quot;
are available to all, regardless of race or class.  Early American
social workers, like Mary Ellen Richmond, understood the importance
of middle-class norm-setting.  &quot;The way to reintegrate the
deviant into society,&quot; she argued, &quot;is to educate and
indeed direct them toward the shared values of the mainstream
culture.&quot;[14]

<p>

The role of the traditional two-parent family is essential in
sustaining the institutions of a free society precisely because
it is the vehicle by which values are transmitted from generation
to generation.  If the family fails to impart virtues that temper
and restrain behavior, broad legal freedoms must give way.  So,
too, human dignity and equality, as the Founders understood them.
Virtue, historian Gertrude Himmelfarb has said, is the only true
basis of equality and the only requisite for citizenship.[15] As
Charles Murray made clear in his now famous op-ed, &quot;The Coming
White Underclass,&quot; either we act now to reduce illegitimacy
and to reinfuse our public policy with a commitment to higher
and nobler things -- or we run the risk of sabotaging the entire
experiment in democratic self-government.

<p>

Or, as Michael Novak put it:

<p><blockquote>

<i>[T]he project of self-government depends on the capacity of
citizens to govern their own  passions, urges, habits, and expectations.
If they cannot govern their own lives  individually, how can
they be successful in self-government as a republic?  The project
of self-government is moral -- or not at all.</i>[16]

</blockquote><p>

The Founding Fathers and many succeeding generations understood
that only a virtuous people can be free.  Do we?

<p>

Given the consequences for the individual child, the surrounding
community, and the national polity, bringing a baby into this
world without a sense of sacred responsibility cannot long be
regarded as a morally neutral act.  In a report issued in December
1994, the Progressive Policy Institute, policy arm of the Democratic
Leadership Council, joined others in acknowledging that &quot;it
is wrong -- not simply foolish or impractical -- for women and
men to make babies they cannot support emotionally and financially.&quot;[17]
Donna Shalala made the same concession a year earlier, however
reluctantly, when she said in an interview, &quot;I don't like
to put this in moral terms, but I do believe that having children
out-of-wedlock is wrong.&quot;[18]

<p>

Congress should now recognize that it is also wrong to sanction
such activity by subsidizing it.  Republican strategist Bill Kristol
has said that &quot;neither our politics nor our sociology can
ultimately be neutral as to the content of the laws of Nature
and Nature's God,&quot;[19] chief among which is the fact that we
were made to live in families.  Charles Murray asks rhetorically,
&quot;If a social policy that induces people to believe that they
are not responsible for their lives is one that
inhibits the pursuit of happiness and is to that extent immoral[,]
[c]an then a policy that <b>fails</b> to stigmatize be a moral
one?&quot;[20]

<p>

Historical experience, related by Marvin Olasky and others, does
indeed demonstrate that the most effective social services have
been offered by private community groups, without any illusion
of moral neutrality.  In her seminal historical study <I>Poverty
and Compassion</I>, Gertrude Himmelfarb writes that:

<p><blockquote>

<i>[a]fter making the most arduous attempt to objectify the problem
of poverty, to divorce  poverty from any moral assumptions and
conditions, we are learning how inseparable the  moral and material
dimensions of that problem are.  And after trying to devise social
policies that are scrupulously neutral and value-free, we are
finding these policies fraught  with moral implications that have
grave material and social consequences.</i>[21]

</blockquote><p>

George Liebmann says, more simply, in a recent issue of <I>The
American Enterprise</I>, &quot;Rescuing an underclass is by definition
a highly moralistic undertaking.&quot;[22] While controlling welfare
spending is a happy byproduct of terminating benefits to teen
mothers, even more promising is the opportunity to begin reversing
the message of the counterculture that has so eroded the character
of our people, in part by assaulting the family.

<p>

Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan has used the phrase &quot;defining
deviancy down&quot; to describe Americans' tendency to ignore
excess levels of deviancy by normalizing what used to be considered
pathology.  Only by &quot;defining deviancy down&quot; have we
been able to ignore until now all the signs of impending disaster
that attend a burgeoning illegitimacy rate.  Barbara Whitehead's
1993 <I>Atlantic</I> article heralded a real and significant change
in the public mood, however; and the near-mythic ascendancy of
Charles Murray's &quot;Coming White Underclass&quot; piece the
same year seemed to confirm a general convergence of public opinion.
In a recent Family Research Council survey of 1,000 Americans,
a substantial majority (81 percent) of respondents indicated that
&quot;women having babies out of wedlock that they can't support
financially&quot; is a serious problem.  The mounting public consensus
presents a unique opportunity to implement more than symbolic
change in the 104th Congress and to make sanctions against illegitimacy
the focus of that change.

<p>

In sending his welfare package to Congress more than 30 years
ago, President Kennedy articulated contemporary liberals' fundamental
misunderstanding of the causal role welfare plays in boosting
illegitimacy rates.  He said:

<p><blockquote>

<i>[W]elfare programs must contribute to the attack on . . . family
breakdown [and]  illegitimacy. . . . Unless such problems are
dealt with effectively, they fester, and grow, sapping the strength
of society as a whole and extending their consequences in troubled
families from one generation to the next.</i>[23]

</blockquote><p>

Kennedy's insight about the consequences has proven historically
accurate, but his &quot;service&quot; approach to curbing illegitimacy
worked no better than the current President's will -- a fact which
an unnamed aide on the Clinton welfare task force acknowledged
last year.

<p>

While the President advocates a massive and expensive public relations
campaign against teen pregnancy, the anonymous aide confided to
<I>Newsweek</I> reporter Joe Klein: &quot;We looked at a hundred
different programs around the country that were trying to deal
with this problem, and not one of them moved the needle.  There
just weren't any results.&quot;[24] Likewise, a formal study of
the Teenage Parent Demonstration, sponsored by the Department
of Health and Human Services in response to &quot;persistently
high rates of teenage pregnancies and births,&quot; found that
&quot;[t]he program had an unusual and disappointing pattern of
impacts on pregnancy and birth rates . . . despite . . . the substantial
efforts of the programs to empower [the] young mothers to take
control of their fertility.&quot;[25]

<p>

Out-of-wedlock births, moreover, remain a strong predictor of
poverty.  A recent U.S. Census Bureau report on poverty found
that the median household income for women householders with no
husband present is only $19,872.  For black Americans, the median
single-parent household -- which now represents the family structure
of 48 percent of all black families -- is less than $12,000 per
year.  Married black families, by contrast, receive a median income
of $45,041.  Both Republican William Bennett and Democrat William
Galston have noted that, according to the Census Bureau, the family
income of black, two-parent families is almost two-and-a-half
times the family income of white single-parent families.  Children
of white, single parents are two-and-a-half times likelier to
be living in poverty than children in black, two-parent families.
Today's major economic indicator, in other words, is family stability
-- not race.

<p>

In a meticulously researched article in the January 6, 1996 issue
of <I>World</I> magazine, Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation
demonstrates that it is neither easy to raise family income through
welfare transfers nor historically true that higher welfare benefits
and broadened eligibility have improved children's life prospects.
It <I>is</I> true, however, that unwed mothers are not only more
likely to rely on government to support their children, but are
also more likely to spend years dependent upon welfare.  Because
illegitimacy feeds both poverty and itself, we cannot reasonably
expect to address welfare dependency until we address illegitimacy.

<p>

Charles Murray anticipated the problem in his 1988 book <I>In
Pursuit of Happiness and Good Government.</I>  &quot;The task,&quot;
he concludes, &quot;is not to devise a public relations campaign
to discourage single teenage girls from having babies, but to
neutralize whatever is impeding the age-old impulse of human beings
to form families.&quot;[26] Eliminating grants to unwed teenage
mothers will be necessary, but not sufficient, to restore the
integrity of the family unit.

<p>

The primary argument is <I>not</I> that women have babies just
to get the dollars -- although anecdotal evidence does exist to
suggest that welfare checks can drive fertility directly.  There
is the story of a five-month-old girl named Ariel Hill who was born 
on Christmas Eve 1992 and died a brutal death in May of 1993. She lived 
with her 22-year-old mother and four other siblings in a squalid unit
of public housing.  The family's chief source of income was welfare.
One day, her mother grew tired of her screaming and dumped her
in a sink of scalding water as punishment.  She died, weighing
less than seven pounds.  She had not been fed in days.  When investigators
examined the apartment, they found a scrap of paper with the name
of each child and the dollar amount of welfare that child earned
for the mother.

<p>

In all probability, however, Ariel Hill's mother is an aberration.
The chief concern is simply that welfare <I>enables</I> men and
women to indulge in irresponsible behavior by shielding them from
the natural economic consequences of their actions -- actions
that often do issue in tragic results for the children who are
born of their thoughtlessness.  &quot;By lessening the costs attached
to unwed reproduction,&quot; anthropologist David Murray argues,
&quot;welfare subsidizes choices that interfere with future opportunity.
. . .  A monthly increase in cash is usually not enough to 'cause'
someone to bear a child.  But by increasing the benefits and reducing
the burdens of a choice that is desirable on other grounds, welfare
becomes a catalyst in the timing and frequency of the decision.
How could it be otherwise?&quot;[27] Unless, of course, one assumes
that welfare recipients are less likely to be rational judges
of their own self-interest.

<p>

Fealty to the premise that all individuals are morally autonomous
creatures argues against such a premise.  And the migration of
welfare recipients to states with higher welfare benefits provides
empirical corroboration that welfare mothers are indeed capable
of making rational decisions to govern their own lives.  Welfare
mothers are dependent, we believe, not because they are incompetent
or morally lacking but because they have made rational decisions
in an irrational system.

<p>

Moral concern, informed by empirical evidence, demands admission
that the service approach to both family breakdown and welfare
dependency has failed.  Welfare reform that fails to curb the
cash that subsidizes illegitimacy is not a vision of reducing
dependency, but a vision of administering &quot;benefits&quot;
to an ever-expanding population that will always be mired in dependency.
It is an abandonment of the conviction that people on welfare
are fully human and fully capable of achieving self-sufficiency.
And it is an insidious guarantee that welfare spending will continue
to crawl steadily upward while illegitimacy continues to increase
as well.

<p>

If the amount of money we are spending on welfare were buying
healthy families and stable communities, we would raise no objection.
Our concern is not that we are spending too much, but that we
are killing off marriage and all the blessings and safeguards
marriage buys for women and children.

<p>

Admitting the failure of the service approach will require tough
political choices.  Those choices will undoubtedly offend both
the welfare industry and feminist ideology.  But politicians should
take heart from polling data that demonstrates broad-based public
support for modest but real steps to reduce illegitimacy.

<p>

According to a poll conducted by Voter/Consumer Research for Family
Research Council in mid-October 1995, three out of four Americans
believe welfare encourages illegitimacy.  By a ratio of two to
one, Americans feel that reducing illegitimacy is a more important
-- and more realistic -- goal than &quot;getting single mothers
with few job skills into jobs that will pay them enough to support
themselves and their children.&quot;  Voters favor a preventative,
anti-illegitimacy strategy, in other words, rather than a remedial
workfare strategy.  And by an overwhelming margin of 84 percent
to 13 percent, they favor the family cap provision as a modest
first step toward reversing the trend in illegitimacy.

<p>

Only by historical accident were unwed mothers -- of any age --
ever included in the AFDC program.  Frances Perkins, President
Roosevelt's Secretary of Labor and chief architect of welfare
policy, opposed extending federal entitlements to unmarried mothers
because she foresaw that subsidizing illegitimacy would escalate
family breakdown.  And, tragically, she was right.  While less
than 3 percent of the young beneficiaries of the program in the
late 1930s were the children of unwed mothers, today the tables
have completely turned.  In the year between October 1991 and
September 1992, only 1.6 percent of the children on AFDC qualified
because a parent was deceased.

<p>

It would be ironic at best if the current majority in Congress
were to find themselves to the left of the most liberal member
of the Roosevelt Administration because they rejected her intuition,
now confirmed by years of sad experience.  It is the potential
to reverse that sad experience that must define &quot;compassion&quot;
in the present debate.  As the one policy option that promises
to effect change in the current system, restrictions on benefits
by definition constitute the compassionate alternative.

<p>

Gertrude Himmelfarb notes that the word &quot;compassion&quot;
once described &quot;a moral sentiment, not a political principle,
a sentiment evoked by misery or sorrow, not by poverty as such.&quot;[28]
As political salvationism sought to preempt traditional morals
in the last 30 years, it was only natural that moral sentiments
should be confused with political principles.  Likewise, that
misery and sorrow should be equated with material poverty; for
the redefinition of compassion required a highly artificial view
of man as no more than a material being.

<p>

If compassion is once again properly understood, perhaps then
it will become more obvious that the object of our concern must
be &quot;misery&quot; and &quot;sorrow,&quot; not economic poverty,
and that the &quot;misery&quot; most evident today is the spiritual 
and moral deprivation visited upon dependents of the welfare system. 
It is time that we stop suppressing the moral responsibilities that 
make life precious for a resident of the inner city just the same as 
for a middle-class suburbanite.  It is time, in short, to secure equal
access to the central satisfactions of family, virtue, and freedom.

<p>

In the end, we will adopt answers by default only because there
is no alternative strategy.  There are two competing alternatives
currently at play to define the future of the welfare state. 
Either we will treat welfare dependents as wards of a custodial
state, and we will spend lavishly to keep them comfortable while
we ask them simply to leave us alone.  Or we can begin relimiting
government and restoring social functions to neighborhoods, communities,
and churches.

<p>

The family cap is a symbolic first attempt to begin reversing
the big-government policies that have proven so obviously destructive
to children and families -- and an important opportunity to begin
dissolving the wall that separates welfare families from middle-class
society.

<p>

We can't afford to wait any longer to act.  Senator Moynihan,
who led the charge against illegitimacy thirty years ago, has
already fallen victim to despair.  While candid about the human
cost of the current system, he argues for the status quo simply
because he believes there is no longer any alternative.  Young
males in the inner city &quot;can be horrid to themselves, horrid
to one another, horrid to the rest of us,&quot; he says.  Dismantle
the current system, and they will be unleashed on the rest of us.

<p>

It seems appropriate to us to subject Moynihan's &quot;containment
policy&quot; to the test President Clinton formulated in the early
days of the welfare debate -- &quot;Is this morally correct?&quot;
We would have to answer &quot;no.&quot;  Surely the underclass
is no less human and no further beyond reclamation than the rest
of us flawed individuals.

<p>

Moynihan also bases his opposition to reform on projections about
the number of children who will be thrown into the streets.  Social
scientist Charles Murray responds that, &quot;like all policy
projections, this analysis reflects a set of assumptions&quot;[29]
-- namely, that limiting welfare will do nothing to change behavior.

<p>

But Father Robert Sirico has noted an interesting demographic
trend that suggests otherwise.  Food stamp rolls have fallen dramatically
-- without any change in underlying economic data.  And the bulk
of the drop occurred since January 1995, when Congress convened
to announce new limits on entitlements.  During the previous four
years, the rolls had steadily swelled, sometimes expanding by
40,000 recipients per week.  Sirico concludes that food stamp
recipients factored in expectations of what the new Congress would
do and acted accordingly.  &quot;Poor people are a lot smarter
than social scientists give them credit for being.  Like everyone
else, they plan ahead, with a view toward a certain amount of
future financial stability, which sometimes leads them to the
want ads and to churches and community organizations,&quot;[30]
he says.

<p>

Political opponents cannot merely claim that Republican reforms
will cause suffering and expect to maintain their credibility.
In addition to thinking creatively about the ways policy affects
human behavior, we also have to come to terms with the degree
of suffering that is occurring now.  Proponents of the status
quo say that only the federal government has the resources to
maintain existing welfare programs.  But perhaps existing welfare
programs should <I>not</I> be maintained precisely because they
have caused so much duress for the children and adults mired in
dependency.  The degree of Senator Moynihan's despair is an argument
that we can do no less than search for a radically different approach
to welfare.  The time to begin is now.

<h2>CHRISTIAN COMMUNITY<br>
DEVELOPMENT</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
Dr. John M. Perkins</i></center>

<p>

<i>The following speech was presented at the Family Research Council's
&quot;World Without Welfare&quot; symposium on December 13, 1995
at the Willard Hotel in Washington, D.C.</i>

<p>

Wayne Gordon and I are going across America in something that
we are calling the American Cities Campaign.  We are taking into
cities across the country the concepts of neighborhood and community
development that have emerged from the church.  I am the chairman
of the Christian Community Development Association, and Wayne
Gordon is the president.  He has spent 20 years in Chicago developing
ministries there.  His great ministry has been building up Lawndale
Community, one of the 15 poorest neighborhoods in America.  Because
of efforts by people like Wayne Gordon, young, indigenous people
-- predominantly black -- are going off to colleges and universities
and returning to their home communities to provide new leadership
for a new generation.

<p>

<center><h3>SUGGESTED RESOURCES</h3></center>

<p>

Wayne Gordon has described his effort in a book called <I>Real
Hope in Chicago</I>.

<p>

The book that best summarizes the philosophy that I will share
with you today, however, is a book called <I>Beyond Charity</I>.
This book outlines how we have been working for the last 35 years
in neighborhood and community development.  And a new textbook
for community development today has just been published under
the title <I>Restoring At-Risk Communities</I>.  I edited the
book, but it was written by practitioners -- people who are a
part of the Christian Community Development Association (CCDA).

<p>

The Christian Community Development Association is made up of
about 4,000 individuals and about 400 organizations.  The purpose
is really not something from the top down; it's something from
the bottom up.  It belongs to the people, one of the things that
motivated me to come here today.  I don't really believe that
major organizations, whether they're government organizations
or national organizations, can implement indigenous leadership and 
produce the kind of motivation and incentive that people need at the 
bottom.

<p>

We do need organizations that affirm the dignity of the people.
The rationale for a national organization ought to be to inspire
those people to take responsibility for their own lives.  Then
we can come along beside them to help them realize their hopes,
goals, and aspirations.  I think you have heard today that our
big federal government is taking that incentive away.  I think
that's what's motivating the movement for welfare reform.  You
can't isolate crime and violence and all these other problems
from the fact that well-intended people are doing things without
believing in the inherent dignity of the individuals being helped.

<p>

The programs that work are those programs in which the initiative
starts first with the people themselves.  Alcoholics Anonymous
is working.  It is working because the individual says &quot;the
problem is mine&quot; and decides to take responsibility for himself.
Then other people come along beside him and help.  Our work should
be to bring about that kind of motivation, incentive, creativity
and the hope that people can do for themselves what they need
to do.  Our newest book, <I>Restoring At-Risk Communities,</I> outlines
strategies for success.

<p>

The last book I want to mention specifically is <I>Resurrecting
Hope</I>.  We have looked at 12 churches in America that have
taken the principles that I am talking about in terms of community
development and have put those principles to work at the grass-roots
level.  There's a West Los Angeles church, for example, that is
the largest black worshipping congregation in the United States.
I worked with that church, and they are in the book.  There is
also Redeemer Presbyterian Church in New York City, along with
10 other congregations that are doing successful community development
work.

<p>

Finally, we have created <I>Urban Family</I> magazine because
we were concerned about the philosophy of the liberal establishment.
I am not stating that fact to pit liberals against conservatives.
I object to liberalism simply because the system created by the
liberal establishment has made black people think of ourselves
as helpless victims who cannot do much for ourselves -- despite
the fact that people like Booker T. Washington and others came
out of slavery and developed the great institutions of our day.

<p>

We now have all the resources, but we act like victims because
the government has come in and taken the responsibility away from
people.  We fault racism and everything else for all of our problems,
and we never play to our advantages.  And so we created a magazine
called <I>Urban Family</I>. It looks at people in the community
who have taken the initiative and are doing things very creatively,
and it encourages blacks to begin building on our strengths instead
of just compounding our weaknesses and always acting like victims.

<p>

There is no other national Christian magazine that is written
from a black perspective in America.  The voices and the aspirations
of black folks themselves are not being heard -- we hear only
the liberal-victimization type of mentality that is being spoken
for us by somebody else in society.  And so this magazine is published
from the urban community, by people within the urban community.

<p>

The last publication that I want to mention is our newest magazine,
called <I>Reconciliation</I>.  Of course, one of our operating
assumptions -- even as we talk today about the church taking responsibility
for the problem -- is that the church itself has a major problem.
The problem is that the church has lost its central message of
the Gospel, which is the love of God <I>demonstrated</I>.  The
purpose of the Gospel is to reconcile alienated humanity to a
holy God and to each other across racial, social, and economic
barriers.

<p>

But instead we have created a church that perpetuates those barriers,
and that's the reason that all our social action has not yet prevailed
against racial division. The church is essentially operating as
a black church or a white church or a Chinese church -- which,
again, is a major heresy because the very idea of the Gospel was
to reconcile those people together in one body and the world would
know that we were Christians because of our love one for another.
If we take all the money from the federal government and somehow
shift all responsibilities to the local church, we still would
not have solved our problem.  We still would not be able to communicate
the central message of the Gospel -- that the world will know
we are Christians by our love.

<p>

<center><h3>PHILOSOPHICAL FOUNDATION</h3></center>

<p>

So let me just share with you a little bit about the philosophy
on which our ministry is based.  Our ministry is based on the
fact that we are created in the very image of God.   This must
be the first effort of Christians -- to establish that all people
are created in the image of God, that all people therefore have
dignity, and that our dealings with each other should reflect
that sense of divinely-endowed dignity.  But how do we affirm
the dignity of individuals?  If we affirm the dignity of people,
then we can create the motivation and incentive for their own
development in society.  So how do you do that?  How do you meet
people where they live?

<p>

You must meet people at their basic need as they perceive it.
That's why uniform government programs organized in Washington
by task forces and imposed on people down at the community level
are going to further cripple people because top-down programs
do not represent their greatest aspirations.  We need to start
with the deepest felt needs of people.  Then we need to love those
people around those needs as they perceive them before we try
to change them.  Our loving them, in other words, is the change
agent.  We cannot change anyone before we choose to love him as
he is.

<p>

If you affirm dignity by meeting people at their deepest felt
needs, then we can motivate them.  That's why Jesus became bread
to people who were hungry.  That's why He became water to people
who were thirsty.  He met people at their basic need.  He loved
them around that need, and you can't do that from afar.  The felt-need
concept, then, is the basic philosophy that grounds community
development.  We are not necessarily accepting wrong behavior.
Instead, we are accepting that behavior as an expression of their
need at the time and then loving them until we can motivate them
to see that they have a deeper need that will require a change
in their lives.

<p>

How do you implement that change?  Let's look at the three basic
human needs that people have in society.

<p>

<center><h3>THREE BASIC HUMAN NEEDS</h3></center>

<p>

The most basic need that people have is the need to be loved and
nurtured.  We know that fact by observing broken families that
are lacking in love and nurture.  If you ask most people who study
urban crime, they will tell you that the vast majority of juvenile
delinquents come from a home without a father -- without that
early childhood nurture.

<p>

The second need that people have is the need to know that they
are significant.  Human beings are not &quot;niggers,&quot; 
&quot;honkies,&quot; and &quot;gooks.&quot;  Human beings were created in 
the image of God and have absolute dignity.  That dignity needs to be 
expressed in their own creativity.  Their own creativity is work.  Work
is absolutely crucial to the reflection of God's image.  God worked,
and He created us to express His dignity by our own creativity
and our own work.

<p>

The third need is the need for a reasonable amount of security.
Everybody has that basic need.  The most crucial problem in our
society is not simply the breakdown of the family, although that
in itself is a reflection of the problem.   The great problem
we have in our society is the breakdown of the community itself.
Families break down from time to time.  But when the community
breaks down, then the society falls apart.  Most social or government
action doesn't really get at the crux of the problem because it
is dealing with symptoms of the problem.  In reality, it takes
the village to raise the child and so we need to re-fix the village.
Mankind was created to live together in a neighborhood, the perfect
village.  So how do you tend to the village?  How do you develop
the community?

<p>

When I arrived in Mississippi, I realized that our education and
social welfare system did not affirm dignity.  Education merely
transported young folks out of the village, leaving the community
poorer and poorer as they went away.  The greatest problem we
have today is that people with the skills remove themselves from
the places of need -- and in their absence, we send in our welfare
system to make the needy dependent.  People need our presence
in the neighborhood with them.  They need our inspiration.

<p>

I can see that in Mendenhall.  I remember saying to my wife Vera
Mae 30 years ago, &quot;We're going to make a difference in this
little village of Mendenhall, this little poverty village.  What
we have to do is stay in this little village long enough so that
we can win some of these young people to Jesus Christ.  We have
to be able to nurture them in their faith.  We have to help them
get a love for God, a love for themselves and a love for the community.
That's a greater love than consumerism and materialism.  Then
we will help them to go off to college and to secure an education
with a purpose.  We will teach them to get the education and then
return with their new-found knowledge to help develop the resources
of the community.&quot;

<p>

I stayed in that community 12 years.  It happened.  I left there
and went to Jackson, and I stayed in that community for 10 years.
It happened there, too.   And then I went to California and stayed
in a neighborhood for 13 years.  My own children there have developed
a school in that community to carry on and to educate those children
within that neighborhood.  So, it is possible.  But our concept
of development must be &quot;indigenous.&quot;  First, we must
plant ourselves within the community.  The reason Wayne Gordon
has succeeded in Chicago is that he moved into that neighborhood
20 years ago and has lived there, inspiring people day by day.

<p>

<center><h3>THREE &quot;R'S&quot;</h3></center>

<p>

So the first &quot;R&quot; in development is <I>relocation</I>,
living in the community with the people.  The people in the community
must be able to take responsibility for their own lives.  Outside
people must come in if necessary to live among them and to inspire
individuals to take responsibility for their own lives.   Then,
those individuals in turn will have the joy of developing their
own neighborhood in their own community.  This approach to redevelopment
will take a generation to accomplish.  But you must live in the
neighborhood.  You can do some hopeful, nice things; but if you
are not living in the neighborhood, you may be convincing the
poor that they do not have worth.  You may be creating more violence
within them and giving them false hope.

<p>

The second &quot;R&quot; of development is <I>reconciliation</I>.
If the church does not believe in that, our country will be hopelessly
divided.  The new leader in the black community is a black Muslim
who does not believe that the Gospel is to reconcile people together.
The rise of Islam will aggravate racial tensions -- unless the
white congregation recalls to its senses the fact that the purpose
of the Gospel is to reconcile man to God and man to man.

<p>

The third &quot;R&quot; of development is something I call 
<I>redistribution</I>. By the word &quot;redistribution,&quot; I don't 
mean taking all the money from the rich and giving it to the poor because 
that would only mean that we have deified money.  Deifying money is
a basic problem in our society and a central problem of government.
Even a tax credit for charitable contributions runs the risk
of deifying money.  Remember that tax money didn't originally
belong to the government.  It originally belonged to the people,
and it is the responsibility of the government to manage those
resources for the greater good of society.  The first need that
people have is not money, but incentive.  They need the incentive
of community before they get money.  They need motivation.  They
need education.  They need skills, and all of these are more important
than money.

<p>

If the churches become contractors for the government, moreover,
this will be a disaster for our nation at the most fundamental
level.  I do believe that the church can inspire economic and
all other kinds of development at the grass-roots.  But if you
have churches competing for government money -- and every day
in the newspapers there is another church that, like government
poverty programs, has used the money poorly -- we will have destroyed
the last life we have within the urban community and the last
healing program we have.

<p>

Those programs that are really healing in the community are not
those that are funded by the government.  Those programs that
are really healing people are ones that have taken the initiative
and have been able to put together the private resources to do
the kind of work that the Christian Community Development Association
encompasses.

<p>

On the other hand, I would be in favor of programs like vouchers
for schools or other services.  At least the vouchers would be
based more on production and creative competition -- unlike block
grants, where the resources would be quickly wasted and swallowed.
The public schools are too big and the classrooms are too clumsy
to give nurture or cultivate Christian values at the community
level.  And in our community, we must have the motivating force
of faith.

<p>

Faith-based discussions build on the dignity and the historical
behavior of black people in our society.  The discussion of faith
must take place -- or else, we are destined still to be driven
by racism and bigotry.  And our people will still suffer.

<title>RECLAIMING THE FAMILY: WHAT PETER UHLENBERG CAN TEACH US</title>

<h2>RECLAIMING THE FAMILY:<br>
WHAT PETER UHLENBERG CAN TEACH US</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
William R. Mattox, Jr.</i></center>

<p>

<i>This speech was presented at the James Madison Institute's
&quot;Reclaiming America's Cultural and Moral Heritage&quot; conference
on April 20, 1996 in Clearwater, Fla.</i>

<p>

One of the first questions that nearly every public opinion pollster
in Washington asks survey respondents is, &quot;Do you think the
country is generally on the right track or on the wrong track?&quot;
Answers to this question typically offer a crude indication of
the public's mood at any given point in time and a useful measurement
for monitoring shifts in attitudes over time.

<p>

For many years, there was a strong correlation between people's
perceptions about the country's direction and the health of the
U.S. economy.  When the economy was up, people thought America
was on the right track.  When the economy was down, Americans
perceived that we were off course as a nation.  In fact, so closely
did these two measurements track together that if there were a
significant change-up or down-in the index of leading economic
indicators, pollsters could reliably predict that a corresponding
shift in the mood of the country would begin showing up about
six months later.  It was all very predictable.

<p>

But several years ago, something dramatic happened.  As America
began to pull out of the recession that hit in the early 1990s,
the public mood did not shift significantly.  It remained in the
doldrums.  While the country experienced improving economic conditions,
roughly two in three Americans continued to maintain that the
country was on the &quot;wrong track.&quot;  Understandably, this
caught many pollsters off guard.  They began to ask follow up
questions to see why so many Americans were pessimistic about
America's future.

<p>

What they found was quite interesting.  While some pessimists
cited downsizing or joblessness or other sorts of economic concerns,
most identified cultural concerns as the primary reason for their
pessimism.  Indeed, several recent polls have shown that as many
as four out of five Americans believe that it is significantly
tougher for a kid to grow up in America today than it was a generation
or two ago.

<p>

If we were to transport ourselves back in time, I suspect the
situation we now find ourselves in would surprise many Americans.
Imagine, for a moment, a scene from, say, 30 or 35 years ago.
A pollster knocks on the door of a young couple and says, &quot;Three
decades from now, there will be no more Soviet Union.  There will
be no more Berlin Wall.  There will be no more Cold War.  America
will be the world's only military superpower.  It will have a
Gross National Product at least three times its current size.
Given these conditions, do you believe America will be or will
not be on the right path?&quot;

<p>

I suspect many at that time would have answered affirmatively,
imagining that America had entered a glorious age.  Yet, if you
ask the American people today, they'll tell you something very
different.  They will tell you that while living standards may
be increasing in America, the quality of life is declining.  And
lest one attribute such downbeat conclusions to Americans' unrealistic
expectations, it bears mentioning that schoolchildren today do
not crawl under their desks to participate in some sort of a mock
nuclear attack drill -- in some schools, students crawl under
their desks to escape real bullets shot in one direction or another
by one of their peers.

<p>

In thinking about cultural decline and some of the problems that
have arisen in the last 35 years, I think there are at least three
lessons to be learned from the work of a sociologist at the University
of North Carolina named Peter Uhlenberg.   While I recognize that
his work may be unfamiliar to many of you, it should be noted
that long before Dan Quayle ever took on <I>Murphy Brown</I>,
or Bill Bennett ever introduced his <I>Index of Leading Cultural
Indicators</I>, or Hillary Clinton ever penned <I>It Takes a Village
to Raise a Child</I>, Peter Uhlenberg was addressing many of the
questions we are wrestling with today in the public arena.

<p>

Indeed, 10 years ago in 1986, Uhlenberg and one of his colleagues
wrote an essay that appeared in Irving Kristol's <I>Public Interest</I>
called, &quot;The Declining Well-Being of America's Youth.&quot;
The article began by arguing that the 1960s and the 1970s should
have been a golden age for young people if you look simply at
the factors social scientists say are most critical to healthy
child development.  During this time period, median family income
rose, average family size declined, and the educational background
of parents increased.  Moreover, Uhlenberg reported that the 1960s
and the 1970s were a time when there was a great deal of government
spending on programs directed toward children, most especially
public education.

<p>

Yet, at the end of this 20 year period, children's lives had not
improved dramatically.  Quite the opposite.  Citing a litany of
statistical indicators that would later make their way into Bill
Bennett's index, Uhlenberg showed that virtually every common
measurement -- teen pregnancy, juvenile crime, school test scores,
and the rest -- showed a decline in the well-being of America's
youth.

<p>

In reporting these (surprising) results, Uhlenberg challenged
social scientists -- and the public policymakers who feed off
of their work -- to consider the limits and the inevitable shortcomings
of their work.  He wrote:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Could it be that social scientists have overlooked the most crucial
determinants of children's welfare?  Could a preoccupation with
variables that are amenable to empirical measurement or to public
policy manipulation have diverted attention from variables that
are more important?</i>

</blockquote><p>

If, according to Uhlenberg, most of the scientific and policy
elite were barking up the wrong tree, what did he and his colleague
believe was responsible for the decline in children's well being
during the 1960s and 70s? Interestingly, Uhlenberg attributed
this decline to a decrease in &quot;sacrificial love.&quot;  Now,
he didn't use those words exactly.  No self-respecting social
scientist would ever use the &quot;L&quot;-word in a scholarly
journal, even one as unprententious as <I>The Public Interest</I>.
But make no mistake -- that is precisely what Uhlenberg was talking
about.  In fact, he said that while there had been a significant
increase in public investments in children, there had been a corresponding
decrease in private investments in children.  Most notably, there
had been a significant decline in the number of children that
were being raised in broken homes and a decline as well in the
amount of time two-earner families were spending with their children.

<p>

All of this gave Uhlenberg reason to believe that there were more
kids growing up without the &quot;one key ingredient&quot; that
Cornell psychologist Urie Brofenbrenner has called essential to
successful child development -- that &quot;someone has to be crazy
about the kid.&quot;

<p>

Now Uhlenberg admitted, of course, that &quot;craziness&quot;
about children is something very difficult for social scientists
to measure.  He wrote:

<p><blockquote>

<i>It is very difficult to define and even more difficult to measure
the quality of relationships.  It is even more difficult to design
policies for improving the relationships between individuals in
an intimate environment.  By contrast, measures of income, or
inequality, or family size or school expenditures are rather straightforward,
and policies designed to transfer more goods and services to children
can be conducted with relative ease.  But if the problems of American
youth stem from the state of parent-child relationships, those
who propose to improve the situation by designing policies which
bypass the family are embarking on a futile quest.  Perhaps we
are faced with a situation in which there is no change in public
policy that can have much effect or at least it seems that the
changes needed lie in an entirely different direction than those
generally advocated.</i>

</blockquote><p>

The first lesson, then, that we can derive from Peter Uhlenberg's
work is that we need to appreciate the limits of social science
and the limits of public policy.  Certainly this is a lesson for
liberals  in our day who have, over the course of the last several
decades, put a great deal of hope in government programs.  Not
only have these programs often failed to meet the high-minded,
well-intentioned goals of their sponsors, but they have in many
cases had all sorts of unintended consequences that have made
matters worse.  As Charles Murray has noted, the classic example
of the Law of Unintended Consequences is the modern welfare state,
and specifically the provision of cash entitlements to women who
bear children out of wedlock.  While such programs were intended
to help single mothers deal with a very difficult situation, they
have actually had the effect of encouraging greater illegitimacy
while discouraging the very behaviors likely to help one avoid
or overcome poverty.

<p>

Clearly, for those of us who see the folly of big government and
who want to see the well-being of children improve, there is much
work to be done in the public policy arena.  We need to be about
the business of clearing the underbrush of government programs
that are choking the health of our society and exacerbating many
of the social problems entrenched especially in the inner city.
We need to offer tax relief for families with children to make
it easier for parents to invest time in their children.  We need
to  pass divorce reform legislation that makes it considerably
more difficult (if not impossible) for individuals to walk away
from their marital commitments unilaterally.  We need to pass
school choice measures that make it easier for parents to be involved
in the most important decisions surrounding their children's education.

<p>

In addition to the conventional, pro-family policy agenda, we
need to consider other issues that affect the well-being of America's
children.  For example, I would like to see an investigation into
the role of old-age entitlements and the degree to which many
well-intentioned programs diminish bonds between generations.
I'd also like to see an exploration of zoning ordinances, and
the degree to which they contribute to the fact that many Americans
live in cookie-cutter enclaves with people whose social class,
race, age, and income are very much like their own.

<p>

Having said that, there is reason for liberals to take note of
Uhlenberg's observations about the limits of public policy (and
having argued for a conservative counter-revolution to free Americans
from the influence of big government), I think it is important
to encourage conservatives to heed Uhlenberg's cautions about
the limits of public policy as well.  Conservatives -- most especially,
religious conservatives -- should be careful not to place too
much hope in a political revolution. Yes, a conservative revolution
can bring about pro-family tax relief -- but it cannot guarantee
that parents will spend the extra discretionary time tax cuts
buy investing in their children.  Yes, conservative revolutionaries
can straighten out divorce laws -- but no law can make a man love
his wife in the way that he ought.  Yes, conservative revolutionaries
can give parents school choice -- but choice alone cannot guarantee
the kind of parental involvement that is so critical to student
achievement.

<p>

Now my point is not to suggest that public policy does not matter.
Obviously, it matters a great deal.  My point instead is simply
to suggest that a conservative revolution cannot produce the shining
city on a hill that Margaret Thatcher referred to last night.
I think we need to be reminded of this particularly since this
is an election year, when many Americans, to one degree or another,
imagine some sort of political knight in shining armor riding
in to make everything right with the world.  Surely, the outcome
of elections is critically important, but it is a mistake to put
our hope in a political savior.   As Peter Uhlenberg's work reminds
us, we must appreciate both the benefits and the limits of science
and government.  We must not look to either to save us.

<p>

The second lesson we need to learn from Dr. Uhlenberg's work may
surprise you.  In a 1986 speech he gave amplifying some of the
themes that he had originally laid out in the <I>Public Interest</I>
article, Uhlenberg said it takes a whole village to raise a child.
Now, those weren't his exact words.  And he had something very
different in mind than some who have picked up on this theme in
recent months.  But Uhlenberg makes an interesting -- and much
needed -- point.  Here's what he says:

<p><blockquote>

<i>The isolated nuclear family tends to be a fragile and vulnerable
organization.  Critics of the nuclear family are correct in asserting
that it is unreasonable to expect a husband and wife to meet all
of the social, economic, and emotional needs of each other and
of their children, especially in times of crisis.</i>

</blockquote><p>

He goes on later in his speech to say:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Families are not designed to stand in isolation but rather should
be enmeshed in strong webs of other supportive relationships.
The caring and rearing of children is certainly the responsibility
of parents, and the burdens and the joys of child rearing should
be shared with persons outside of the nuclear family.</i>

</blockquote><p>

Lest one interpret this as a call for government activism to support
families, Uhlenberg is quick to point out that he has something
very different in mind.  He said, &quot;Rather than concluding
that families should be bypassed and that government bureaucracies
relied upon to meet these needs, families could be encouraged
to join together in supportive networks.&quot;

<p>

I hadn't really given a great deal of thought to Uhlenberg's observations
about the importance of supportive networks until two years ago
when a not-so-random-act-of-kindness by a woman named Betty Rudisill
left me speechless.

<p>

Betty Rudisill is a woman who lives in the &quot;village&quot;
where I was raised.  A long-time family friend and one-time neighbor,
Mrs. Rudisill is best remembered by me as the woman who used to
save all her junk mail so that I could put it in my &quot;business
box&quot; and pretend to be a businessman.  (Some would say that
I am still pretending.)

<p>

Mrs. Rudisill is one of the first people my mother turned to when
she needed help of some kind with her kids.  Indeed, it was at
Mrs. Rudisill's house one day after school that I received a jubilant
phone call from my father at the hospital maternity ward telling
me that I had a new kid brother.

<p>

Well, I haven't seen Betty Rudisill in probably 10 years.  But
a couple of years ago, she learned that my two oldest kids were
in town visiting their grandparents.  So, she invited my mother
to bring the kids over to her house for a little tea party.  Mrs.
Rudisill then proceeded to offer these two kids she had never
even met before one of the most enchanting afternoons of their
young lives.  Mrs. Rudisill introduced my daughter to an elaborate
collection of delicate dolls with which her daughter had once
played.  And she gave my boy an opportunity to thoroughly check
out the collection of Matchbox cars that had once delighted her
son.  Needless to say, it was quite a party.  And it made quite
an impression on my children.

<p>

Now, I don't want to get carried away here.  I don't want to exaggerate
the importance of this episode.  In the end, Mrs. Rudisill's tea
party is not apt to rank as one of the most important events in
my children's lives.  Times spent with family members like Mom
and Dad and Grandmother and Papa are likely to be far more important.

<p>

But it is also true that my children's lives are richer because
of Mrs. Rudisill's kindness.  Indeed, episodes like this serve
to reinforce what my wife and I try to teach our children with
our words and actions -- that they are more of a delight than
a bother, that they are important human beings who are worth making
a fuss over.

<p>

Part of the reason why Mrs. Rudisill's tea party had such an effect
on me is that it caused me to ask:  Who will be the Betty Rudisill
in the lives of my future grandchildren when my kids send their
kids to come visit us?  And in what child's life will my wife
and I get to play the role of a Betty Rudisill?

<p>

I find myself not being able to answer those kinds of questions
as easily as I suspect my parent's generation answered them. 
And given the go-go pace of modern life, the growing transience
of our population, the weakening of community ties, and the waning
appreciation for those who quietly invest their lives in other
people, I suspect that many of my peers would struggle with these
questions as well.

<p>

In a recent article, author John Whitehead observed:

<p><blockquote>

<i>The entire concept of the neighborhood is lost to us, and our
children are growing up in a bland world.  Rarely can a child
see people working at their trades, for everyone is out of sight.
Children can no longer listen to community talk at the post office
or at the park bench and there are no abandoned houses, barns,
or attics that children can safely explore.  Forced by the many
dangers of an empty home and neighborhood to remain behind locked
doors, children wile away their hours after school by interacting
with their computers and video games.  Cyberspace has replaced
the neighborhoods familiar to their grandparents.</i>

</blockquote><p>

Now, again, don't misunderstand me.  I am not saying -- nor was
Uhlenberg saying -- that we should devote more attention to rebuilding
strong neighborhoods and communities than we do to rebuilding
strong families.  Quite the opposite.  But the health of the nuclear
family is significantly affected by the strength of the surrounding
community.  In fact, even if we were only concerned about families,
we would need to give attention to the strength and health of
the social networks in which families are enmeshed.

<p>

In this regard, I was struck several years ago by some surprising
differences in divorce rates by region.  Interestingly, divorce
rates tend to be significantly higher in the Sunbelt (and even
Bible Belt) regions of the country than in the Northeast or Midwest.
There are a number of reasons for this, but University of Texas
sociologist Norval Glenn has determined that the single greatest
predictor of divorce rates in a community is the degree to which
the people are rooted in a larger social network.  In areas of
the Midwest and the Northeast where you have more stable communities
-- where you often have strong ethnic communities -- divorce rates
tend to be lower because there is a surrounding web of individuals
who are working to try to help that couple succeed.  In more transient
areas of the country, particularly in areas where there is low
church participation, divorce rates tend to be higher because
many couples are existing very much as Uhlenberg described --
in isolation, lacking some type of supporting network to help
them and to challenge them and to hold them accountable.

<p>

I must say here that Dr. Uhlenberg not only can speak to this
question from his professional observations as a scholar.  But
he can also speak to this concern from his own personal experience.
I don't know about you, but my family has taken a great interest
in the new television show, <I>Second Noah,</I> that depicts the
life of a couple that is based here in Tampa.  The couple has
a rather unique story.  Over the course of time, they have adopted
eight or 10 different kids of varying races and backgrounds to
raise as their own.

<p>

In many ways, that television show closely resembles the life
of Peter Uhlenberg and his wife Pam.  Over the last two decades,
they have adopted a dozen or so children.  Some of these children
have physical handicaps; some come from mixed racial backgrounds;
some have learning disabilities; some have no special needs --
except the need for a devoted Mom and Dad. If you wish to pay
tribute to the kinds of sacrifices that Peter Uhlenberg and his
wife are making in their lives with those kids, they will be quick
to tell you that it would not be possible for them to be involved
in the work that they are doing in their home were it not for
the surrounding network of support that they get from the local
church congregation in which they play a part.  Indeed, there
are members of that congregation that have established big brother
or big sister relationships with different members of the Uhlenberg
family.  I'm sure that they are right-that if it were not for
that supportive network, the really heroic work that Peter Uhlenberg
and his wife are doing would  be very difficult, if not impossible.

<p>

The third lesson, then, that I think we can learn from Peter and
his wife (and his entire congregation, for that matter) is this
-- if we hope to turn things around in this country, if we hope
to see America become the shining city on a hill, it's going to
cost us something.  It's going to cost us personally. It's going
to require sacrificial love on our part, if I can use the &quot;L&quot;-word.
I'm not speaking of the hollow, feel-good love that was celebrated
by the '60s counterculture when Peter Uhlenberg was a student
at the University of California at Berkeley.  I'm speaking about
the gritty, unconditional, sacrificial love that he and his wife
have found and are now sharing with their kids.  That is a love
that is costly, to be sure, but it is a love that offers great
rewards.

<p>

I don't know about you, but I am very much looking forward to
the Olympics that will take place later this year.  I always set
aside time to view them because I'm interested in seeing who will
show themselves to be the fastest sprinter or the highest jumper
or the longest javelin thrower.  But the greatest honor that is
reserved at the Olympics goes not to one of these individuals
who has managed to develop a specialized skill to a greater extent
than anyone else.  The greatest honor goes to two athletes; one
in the men's division called a decathlete who participates in
10 different events, and the other to a female heptathlete who
participates in seven different athletic events.  Now these athletes
cannot outperform everyone on the planet in every single one of
these categories.  Instead, they are the athletes best able to
outperform others in a combination of them all.  They are, in
a sense, the best all-around or most well-rounded athletes.

<p>

We live in a day when 15 minutes or more of fame is quite often
available to anyone who can excel in a single area of life --
even if that success comes at the expense of meeting more important
responsibilities in other areas of life. In many ways, then,
the challenge for each of us personally is not just to seek to
make an important contribution in our work, or in our neighborhood,
or in our churches or synagogues, or in our homes.  It is instead
to seek to make an important contribution in all of these areas
simultaneously.  The challenge for us is to strive to be as well
rounded as the decathlete or the heptathlete, never allowing our
pursuit of excellence in one area to come at the expense of the
others.

<p>

Peter Uhlenberg, in my mind, is meeting that challenge.  He is
a whole man.  If the serious social problems Uhlenberg tracks
in his work are to be reversed, we will need to become more like
him -- people who not only wring our hands about various social
problems, but people who take personal action in our own homes
and neighborhoods to address these serious problems.

<p>

Thank you very much.

<title>KIDS HOPE USA: A VISION FOR CHURCHES AND CHILDREN</title>

<h2>KIDS HOPE USA:<br>
A VISION FOR<br>
CHURCHES AND CHILDREN</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
Dr. Virgil Gulker</i></center>

<p>

<i>The following speech was presented at the Family Research Council's
&quot;World Without Welfare&quot; symposium, held at the Willard
Hotel in Washington, D.C. on Dec. 13, 1995.</i>

<p>

My wife overheard someone recently call me an expert on the care
and nurture of children.  She was quite amused by that comment.
She simply smiled and walked away, and we haven't talked about
it since.

<p>

If your wife is like my wife, she remembers those times when we
have done anything but illustrate expertise in parenting.  I recall
the time, for example, when I disciplined my 4-year-old, and,
following the discipline, realized that I had made a mistake.
I had disciplined her for something that I had misinterpreted.
So I got down on my knees and put my hands on her little shoulders
and said, &quot;Emily, Daddy was wrong.  Will you forgive Daddy?&quot;
And Emily looked me in the eye and said, &quot;Sure, Daddy. I
forgive you lots.&quot;  I think all of you can relate to that
at some level.

<p>

I have two passions.  One is children and the other is the church,
the body of Christ.  I've listened today.  I've heard about so
many church-based organizations, but I haven't heard much about
the church itself.  My passion is the church.  I look at the 350,000
religious congregations in this country -- with an average membership
of roughly 100 people per congregation -- and I think of what
those 35 million Christians could accomplish.  The potential is
awesome.  We have five times more churches than post offices and
35 times more churches than McDonald's restaurants.

<p>

The church is clearly the most sustainable local organization,
yet I hear so little about the role the church and its members
can play in this process of reaching, reconciling and healing
lives.  The experience of an organization I founded called Love,
Inc. says very clearly that there are Christians in every community
who are prepared to help, to give hope, to share love if 
they are approached -- if they have the appropriate training --
and if they are affirmed for that relationship.  What I learned
with Love, Inc., through the 300,000 volunteers, was that we don't
need heroes.  We need very simple, very basic people.  People
like me and like many of you who are prepared to come alongside
someone who needs principally love, nurture, and affirmation.

<p>

I was challenged two years ago by an organization called International
Aid to put my passions to work.  They said, &quot;Virg, can you
create a model that will somehow engage church members themselves
in the lives of the most at-risk children and families?&quot;
I spent a year researching that.  Instead of promoting answers,
I asked questions.  I went to people who were involved with health
services and human services, education, religion, government services,
and professional volunteer services.  I asked them three questions,
and the answers to those questions forever transformed my approach
to ministry.

<p>

<center><h3>THREE QUESTIONS TO THE HELPING COMMUNITY:</h3></center>

<p>

The first question was: <i>&quot;What are the needs faced by
our children and families?&quot;</i>

<p>

We all read these things in the newspaper, but I wanted to know
how the experts would define the need.  What I heard absolutely
broke my heart.  If you can look into some of the faces of these
children experiencing the pain and despair that is a part of their
lives and <I>not</I> cry, you have a problem.  I came to the conclusion
that America either does not care for its children or does not
know how to care.  How else can you explain the fact that more
children in this country will be pregnant, murdered, drug-dependent,
incarcerated, or poor than the children of any other industrialized
country?  How else can you explain the fact that 0-3-year-old
children are now some of the most neglected children in the entire
world?  One out of every four of our children lives in poverty.
Thirty-one percent live in fatherless homes.  The litany of woe
goes on and on.

<p>

Then I wanted to find out, <i>&quot;Why so much need?&quot;</i>

<p>

I went into my own community and discovered to my dismay that
in Holland, Michigan, an idyllic place along the Lake Michigan
shoreline, with literally a church on every corner and an unemployment
rate of  3 percent, we have had a youth violence increase of 400
percent over the last five years.  Four hundred percent!  That
exceeds the national average by 300 percent.  &quot;Why?&quot;
I asked.  &quot;Why are so many of these young people engaging
in personally and socially destructive behaviors?&quot;  Every
expert said to me, &quot;It's because these young people and children
are desperate for affirmation and for value. Someone needs to
say to them, 'You have value.  You have purpose.  You have meaning
in this community.  Your life has meaning.'&quot;

<p>

Children are looking in all the wrong places for affirmation.
Affirmation is the key need for all of us, and we will find it
-- if not in appropriate ways, then we will find it in <I>in</I>appropriate
ways.  More and more young people are turning toward gangs, for
example.  Michigan has 83 counties, and we have organized gang
activity now in 44 of the 83 counties.

<p>

A 15-year-old boy in my community joined one of four major gangs,
two of which came out of Los Angeles.  The ceremony was as brief
as it was brutal.  They said to him, &quot;Armando, all you have
to do is stand here and take our beating for two minutes without
resisting.&quot;  All the men wore steel-toed boots.  For two
minutes they brutalized this kid.  Absolutely brutalized him.
At the end of two minutes, he was required to stand up, embrace
each man, and call him brother.  Then he was allowed as a reward
to participate in front of all the men in sex with a girl who
had also become part of the gang.  The initiation ceremony for
girls, as some of you know, is much, much worse.

<p>

The next day someone went to him and said, &quot;Armando, why?
Why would you allow yourself to go through that?&quot;  His answer
was immediate.  He said, &quot;I knew this was going to hurt really
bad, but I felt that if I could take it for just a couple of minutes,
I'd be surrounded by people who loved me.&quot;  That's the name
of the game, friends.

<p>

My second-grade daughter (two years ago) was asked to join a gang
by a little girl whose principal characteristic was her body odor.
She would crawl under the teacher's desk periodically and moan,
&quot;No one loves me.  No one loves me.  No one loves me.&quot;
Children would not stand in line with her.  They would point
at her and laugh.  Finally, she also began to move toward gang
activity.  Second grade!  She wanted my daughter to go along with
her.  But my daughter did a revolutionary thing.  Instead of reporting
her to the teacher, she began to pray for her and said to me,
&quot;Daddy, I'm going to be her friend.&quot;  My daughter became
her friend.

<p>

Other teenagers, young people, are turning to pregnancy.  Talk
to anyone working with pregnant girls.  Ask them why these girls
are pregnant.  Sex has nothing to do with it.  These girls in
most cases are so desperate for someone to love and value them,
for someone to hold them, for someone to be intimate for 20 minutes,
that they will endure anything, including pregnancy.  It's a desperate
situation out there.

<p>

Others who do not find affirmation turn to suicide.  Our suicide
rate for young people is up three times -- a three-time increase
in 10 years.  One of the second-graders we had hoped to place
in a loving relationship through Kids Hope is no longer eligible
for our program.  He tried to kill himself and was institutionalized.
I was horrified.  I went to the school and I said, &quot;You're
going to have to help me understand this.  I have a second-grade
daughter.  How does a second-grader arrive at trying to kill himself?&quot;
The teacher said, very simply, &quot;These children, whose lives
are so desperate and without hope, conclude that death is safer
than life.  So they choose death.&quot;  It's happening more and
more.

<p>

Experts told me that we can expect to lose a generation of children.
This will be the first time we have lost a generation in this
country without a war.

<p>

My next question for them was: <i>&quot;What should the church
do?  Do you see a role for the church?&quot;</i>

<p>

Almost to a person they gave me the same answer.  &quot;Virg,&quot;
they said, &quot;it's really not very complex.  Tell the church
to mobilize its members to form one-to-one relationships with
the youngest children.  Tell them to go in to the elementary schools
and work with children who are at that critical age when values
are formed, self-esteem is developed, and critical academic and
problem-solving skills must be acquired.  Virg, tell them to do
that.&quot;

<p>

The mayor of my city when asked what we should do about the violence
in our city said, &quot;We don't need any more programs.&quot;
Michigan, as you may know, has 40,000 non-profit organizations,
not counting churches.  We don't need any more programs.  We need
more caring adults to put an arm around a troubled child and say,
&quot;I love you.  I love you, Judy, Tom, Mary, Sammy, Armando.
I love you.&quot;

<p>

Ron Vogel, former national director of the WIC program, met with
me once to talk about church involvement.  I said, &quot;What
do you think, Ron?  Can a church play a role in meeting the needs
of the WIC mothers and their children?&quot;  He said, &quot;Tell
you what.  I can give the churches a strategy that they can use
to single-handedly reduce the incidence of infant mortality, low
birth weight and long-term dependence on the public health system.&quot;
I said, &quot;Ron, let's do it.  How much will it cost?&quot;
And he said, &quot;Nothing.  All I want the church to do is to
mobilize its mothers and its grandmothers to form one-to-one relationships
with pregnant young women.  Talk to the young women about breast-feeding
and get them to the clinic on time.  If they do only that, they
will transform a generation of young, black women.&quot;

<p>

Anacostia, in southeast Washington, at that point had the highest
infant mortality rate in the country.  At precisely the same time
I heard that statistic, an African-American young woman who worked
in a local ministry came to me and said, &quot;We don't know what
to do.  We have African-American grandmothers who are complaining
to their pastors and others that they no longer have any value
in their church or their community.&quot;  This is all about people.
We have to reestablish the people issue.  It's not about welfare
reform.  That can be a very nice intellectual dodge, but the reality
is that we're talking about people with resources and people in
pain.

<p>

Sometimes people who are very cynical say to me, &quot;Virg, do
you really think that God is in our world?&quot;  I say, &quot;Absolutely.
I can take you right to where He is.&quot;  They say, &quot;Well,
where would I go?&quot;  And I say, &quot;At the intersection
of a caring Christian and a child or any other person in need.
That's where my God lives.&quot;  He's out there right now. 
People in urban ministry encounter God countless times every day
and every month and every year.  That's the potential.

<p>

I recently asked someone who works with troubled children in my
area what kind of children he wants Kids Hope to love.  I expected
a wonderfully learned and long-winded answer.  He surprised me.
He said, &quot;Virg, focus on the children who need hugs.&quot;
I've been thinking about that now for about six months.  I like
what that says about the potential of the body of Christ.  What
if the local body of Christ were known as that distinctive organization
within the community that formed relationships with kids and families
and hugged them?

<p>

<center><h3>FOLLOW-UP QUESTIONS TO THE CHURCH:</h3></center>

<p>

I asked the experts one last question: <i>&quot;Will the church
do that?&quot;</i>

<p>

Without any hesitation, almost everyone said the same thing: 
&quot;No way.  We know we can count on the church for commodities,
for holiday food baskets, for food pantries, for clothing closets,
for a ride to the doctor, for Vacation Bible School, and for all
that is wonderful and necessary in many cases.  We have found
to our dismay, however, that we cannot rely upon the church for
relationships.  We've had to turn elsewhere for relationships.&quot;

<p>

I didn't want to believe that because I have worked with church
volunteer programs for 20 years.  I went out and began to survey
pastors -- determined to prove these people wrong because I believe
that relationships are at the heart of our Gospel.  Without relationships,
there is no reconciliation.  I'm not sure there is redemption.
So I surveyed pastors from churches ranging in size from 50 members
to 6,000 members.

<p>

I asked one question:  <I>&quot;How many of your members are engaged
in one-to-one relationships with at-risk elementary school children
in the neighborhood of your church?&quot;</I>  Out of a combined
membership of 30,000, I found fewer than 20.

<p>

My follow-up question was: <i>&quot;How many of your families
are in relationships with some of the families of the children?&quot;</i>
The answer was fewer than 10.

<p>

That doesn't make sense to me.  Seventy-nine percent of all church
growth is attributed to a person, a friend or a relative, telling
someone about Jesus Christ.  We're investing all kinds of money
in programs and agencies.  Only 10 percent of Americans now have
any sort of significant relationship with a non-believer.  Eighty
percent of all people who accept Jesus Christ do so by age 18,
yet every church I visited was dedicating the vast majority of
its outreach and evangelism money to programs touching people
20 years old and older.  It's a wonderful strategy to fail, and
sadly, it's not reaching these hurting children and their families.

<p>

Do Christians care?  Absolutely.  I get letters and phone calls
virtually every day and have for 20 years.  When we were establishing
Love, Inc., I had calls from every state.  Then we began to get
calls and letters from other countries.  Every request sounded
the same.  People said,  &quot;We want to share the love of Christ
with the poor and we don't know how to do it and our church doesn't
know how to help us.  Can you get something started here?&quot;
There are so many people who care.

<p>

Recently, I went into a large church and I said to them, &quot;Your
church is going into the neighborhood school in eight months to
work with at-risk elementary school children.  Next Sunday, I'm
going to walk from this church to that school.  I invite you to
go with me one mile.&quot;  I had a feeling that my wife, my two
daughters and I would have a very leisurely stroll.  God surprised
me.  I showed up at the church the next Sunday, and 250 men, women
and children were standing there.

<p>

We walked a mile to the school, and then we held hands as we circled
the school.  Forget church-state.  We simply held hands.  We prayed
for those children.  We prayed asking God to bless our commitment
to transform and love those children.

<p>

I still have people coming up to me saying, &quot;Virg, what we
needed was a symbol.&quot;  Bob Woodson has said very appropriately
that conservatives, Christians and Republicans -- not necessarily
in that order -- are much less adept than liberals and Democrats
at using symbols.  I'm finding that so many people want to rally
around this vision of helping and loving a child -- especially
when given a symbol.

<p>

The key problem I found in churches is not a lack of compassion.
As I inquired into the organizational structure, every church
I worked with had the same problem.  They lacked any sort of system
or infrastructure for the recruitment, training, supervision and
affirmation of volunteers. It's like a small business trying to
operate without a personnel department.  Most of these churches
could characterize their ministry by saying, &quot;We pay, we
pray, and we give stuff away.  We do wonderful, wonderful things,
but we never change any lives or any situations.&quot;

<p>

Our call at Kids Hope is to go into one church at a time and to
create that infrastructure within each individual church so that
they can engage their members in the lives of other children.
My past work has all been devoted to community agencies.  I would
go into communities and set up agencies to draw together the resources
of hundreds of churches.  I've changed.  I found that, when many
churches are involved in a project, every church owns it and no
church owns it.  The director of the church-based organization
will spend 70 percent of his or her time raising money, 10 percent
managing public relations, and the rest just feeling generally
frustrated.

<p>

The church is the one most sustainable local organization.  If
we can give them an infrastructure, a personnel department designed
to link their members with children and families in the neighborhood,
we can change the lives of the church members and the lives of
those people needing help.  The church simply giving out food,
money or clothing is not going to make it.  That's the same kind
of commodity distribution that the welfare system has tried for
so long, and it has not worked.

<p>

We are the body of Christ.  We have the most awesome potential,
not just to share Christ but to share that transforming, reconciling
message that can change and empower lives.  That's what we can
do.  If we have 35 million Christians in this country, I contend
that we need to apply the Gideon principle to them.  Remember
when Gideon fought the Midianites?  He started with a ridiculously
small army of 32,000.  God stripped His army until He was left
with less than 1 percent.

<p>

If we look at 1 percent of the existing church membership, we're
looking at 350,000 people.  If each of those people gives a dollar
a week for a year, that will amount to $18,200,000.  If each volunteers
an hour a week, valued at $10 per hour, that labor will be worth
$182,000,000.  That remnant alone can contribute $200,200,000
to transforming outreach.  We must not demean the potential of
the body of Christ -- the very means, the arms and the legs that
He has given us to reach out.

<p>

Let me conclude by sharing the metaphor that has really guided
my ministry.  Because I'm about children and the church, this
really struck me.  A number of years ago, during the Vietnam conflict,
a number of Vietnam veterans were shipped to a hospital in San
Diego.  What they shared in common was that they had lost all
of their arms and legs.  They were lying with simply their heads
and torsos on beds.  They had fallen into such a profound depression
that they simply could not speak.  They were hiding within themselves.
The registered nurse on the floor tried everything to get them
out of their depression, but she failed.

<p>

Finally, in creative frustration, she called the other nurses
together and said, &quot;Gather up all of the terminally-ill babies
in the hospital and strap them face down to the torsos of these
veterans.&quot;  As she left the room, she said to the veterans,
&quot;Gentlemen, these babies are dying.  Most have no visits.
No one to love them.  There is no one to bond with them, and
you have nothing to do.  Your job is to love these babies.&quot;

<p>

The nurses left the room.  They did this day after day.  And in
less than one week, all of the Vietnam veterans had escaped their
depression and were orchestrating the care of the babies.  Each
man fought it, but every time he opened his eyes the eyes of a
little baby were penetrating his soul, looking for that heart
of compassion that had to be in there.

<p>

Those terminally-ill babies, I think, are the children and the
families in our society.  We're losing them.  We are losing a
generation of children.  The veterans, I believe, are the body
of Christ, if it refuses to minister in the name of Christ.  If
it refuses to be the arms and legs of the church, the church and
Christ Himself will be powerless.

<p>

But the church could also be the nurses.  God calls us to be that
creative force, calling the culture -- not just to an awareness
of the need -- but to a realization of what the Christian community
can do in responding to that need.  Our task is, not simply to
hold that baby up in the maternity ward to show people how cute
it is, but rather to hold the baby up and to suggest specific
strategies that the church, the body of Christ, can use in reaching
out to children.  We must love them, touch them, put an arm around
those babies as they grow older and say, &quot;I love you.  Jesus
Christ loves you, and that will make all the difference in your
world and mine.&quot;

<p>

One of our dear volunteers has shown the humor of God.  This woman
is one of the wealthiest women I have ever met.  She works with
Kids Hope through her church.  She has been assigned to a child
from one of the poorest families in her county.  She noticed that
Billy needed shoes, badly.  The teacher said, &quot;Don't buy
them.  It will cause a major disruption in the family.&quot;

<p>

The volunteer came to me and said, &quot;Virg, it's killing me.
I need to buy Billy a pair of shoes, but they won't let me.&quot;
This woman could buy Billy a shoe store if she wanted to.

<p>

I said to her, &quot;What did the teacher ask you to do?  Did
she ask you to buy shoes?&quot;  She answered, &quot;No.  She
said, 'Minnie, could you love this boy?  Could you help this boy
understand how important he is?'  So that's what I've been doing.&quot;

<p>

I talked to Minnie the next week and I said, &quot;How's that
coming, that love business?&quot;  She said, &quot;It's incredible.
I came into school last week and Billy was on the other side
of the school, at the other end of the hallway, and he saw me.
He opened his arms and he began to run down the hallway shouting
at the top of his lungs, 'Mrs. Matthews!  Mrs. Matthews!  Mrs.
Matthews!'  Then he came next to me and scooped me up in a hug.&quot;

<p>

This is a first-grade boy.  He didn't need shoes nearly as badly
as he needed love.  The church has always been there to give Billy
shoes.  The Billy's in our world now need above all else to be
loved and valued.

<p>

No agency -- public, private or para-church -- can do that because
their role is to respond to need.  The role of the church is to
respond to people.  We can do it.  We have the answer to this
problem.  We can create an army to attack these child and family
problems, but we need the people and they need the vision of a
healing and loving God.  Thank you.

<title>HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES HAVE WORSENED</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">

<h2>HUMAN RIGHTS ABUSES HAVE<br>
WORSENED SINCE CHINA<br>
RECEIVED MFN STATUS</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<h4>Testimony of Gracie S. Hsu, Policy Analyst<br>
Family Research Council<br>
Submitted to the House Committee on International Relations<br>
Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights<br>
June 18, 1996</h4></center>

<p>

Mr. Chairman, the Family Research Council is pleased that the
Subcommittee on International Operations and Human Rights has
chosen to address the human rights consequences of extending &quot;most
favored nation&quot; (MFN) trade privileges to China.  This hearing
is especially timely considering the fact that the House of Representatives
is scheduled to vote on legislation regarding China's MFN status
in the coming week.

<p>

Mr. Chairman, for 15 years, the United States has extended &quot;most
favored nation&quot; trade status to China.  Originally, it had
been argued that an economic &quot;open door&quot; might encourage
the Chinese government to shape up their human rights policies,
but in these past 15 years, we have only seen the barbarity and
cruelty of this communist regime increase.

<p>

Thus, the Family Research Council strongly urges Congress to pass
legislation revoking China's &quot;most favored nation&quot; trade
status because of China's continuing human rights abuses.

<p>

It was seven years ago when 700 Chinese democracy-seekers were
ruthlessly gunned down at Tiananmen Square.  It was only last
year when Hong Kong newspapers reported that aborted human fetuses
were being cannibalized in China, sold as health food.  Last September,
directly before the United Nations Fourth World Conference on
Women in Beijing, the Chinese government executed nine prisoners
to &quot;send a message&quot; to their own people that they should
not attempt to demonstrate against the Chinese government.

<p>

In addition to these &quot;newer&quot; human rights violations,
other abuses which existed in China prior to their receiving MFN
status continue to go unabated.  For example, the Chinese government
continues to exploit prisoners for slave labor in their gulag
system known as &quot;laogai,&quot; as Harry Wu has demonstrated.
Mr. Chairman, it is these same slaves which make many of the
products which China exports for profit.

<p>

Furthermore, Chinese women continue to be forcibly aborted and/or
involuntarily sterilized.  It is well documented that women, even
in their eighth and ninth months of pregnancy, have been literally
dragged from their homes by &quot;family planning&quot; officials,
tied down with their feet in stirrups, and forcibly aborted.

<p>

China's one-child-per-couple mandate has also led to widespread
sex selection abortion, and unborn baby girls are most often the
innocent victims of this crime against humanity.  But even for
those little girls who are born alive, many are immediately abandoned
by their parents.  China has chosen to deal with this &quot;problem&quot;
of abandoned children by starving the little girls to death in
state-run orphanages.

<p>

Religious persecution also continues to abound in China.  As Family
Research Council President Gary Bauer testified before this Subcommittee
in February, Christians are systematically intimidated, tortured
and imprisoned in China.  Indeed, Amnesty International reports
cases of Christian women hung by their thumbs from wires and beaten
with heavy rods, denied food and water, and shocked with electric
probes.

<p>

These, Mr. Chairman, are crimes against humanity.  These are the
brutal and unjust actions of a communist regime to which our nation
has extended &quot;most favored nation&quot; trade privileges
for 15 years.

<p>

The failure of the United States to hold China accountable for
its heinous behavior has only encouraged the communist regime
to become more oppressive because it no longer fears that any
sanctions will be taken against it.  Year after year, the United
States has issued only empty threats against the Chinese government,
and in doing so, we have strained our credibility and undercut
our own stature as a moral leader in the world.  Indeed, the U.S.
has sent the shameful message that, as a country, we care more
about succeeding economically than about championing universal
human rights.

<p>

It is time for the United States to put teeth to our convictions
and revoke China's &quot;most favored nation&quot; trade privileges.

<title>TESTIMONY ON THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">

<h2>TESTIMONY ON THE<br>
DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<h4>Testimony of<br>
Gary L. Bauer<br>
President, Family Research Council<br>
on the Defense of Marriage Act (S. 1740)<br>
July 11, 1996<br>
United States Senate Judiciary Committee</h4></center>

<p>

Ladies and Gentlemen, thank you for inviting me to testify.

<p>

As the head of an organization supported by 300,000 families,
I am often asked to provide information on various issues that
are important to family life, from tax credits to welfare reform.
But in all my years of pro-family work, I cannot recall an issue
that was so central to the very idea of family.

<p>

The Defense of Marriage Act would have seemed unnecessary and
even unthinkable just a few years ago, even though marriage has
been under siege for some time.  No-fault divorce, a sex-saturated
culture, and growing fiscal and social pressures have sundered
many a marriage or, in some cases, discouraged them from happening,
even with children in the picture.  Many Americans are wrestling
with the pain of broken families and are trying to rebuild their
lives.

<p>

The decline of marriage has spawned America's most destructive
social problems, as fatherless households have multiplied.  You
probably have heard the litany by now, but let me take a moment
to mention some of the devastation caused by a lack of support
for marriage: out-of-wedlock pregnancies, sexually-transmitted diseases, 
alcohol and drug abuse, educational failure, community decline, and 
last but not least, a frightening epidemic of crime that has changed 
the way we live.

<p>

A visitor from another land might well observe that we seem caught
in a quickening downward spiral.  As marriages fail, the pain
spreads out through the next generation to the ones that follow.

<p>

The solution seems self-evident:  If the collapse of marriage
is the problem, why don't we move to strengthen this irreplaceable
institution?  Well, we could and should.  Yet we are being asked
by some groups with a radical agenda to do precisely the opposite.

<p>

We are being asked not only to ignore the mounting evidence that
the mother-and-father family is the foundation of civilization,
but to weaken marriage further by redefining it.  We are being
asked to pretend that marriage is no longer about bringing the
two sexes together in a biological, social, economic, legal and
spiritual union.  We are being asked to restructure our entire
sexual morality and social system to embrace a concept that has
never been accepted anywhere in the world by any major culture.
We are being asked to pretend that somehow two men could replace
a mother in a child's life or that two women could take the place
of a father and that it won't make any difference to children.

<p>

Often I am asked, what does it matter if two men or two women
down the street want to call what they have &quot;marriage?&quot;
Why does that hurt you or your marriage?  Well it doesn't --
unless they bring the law into it.  Then the fiction is imposed
on everyone and the counterfeit will do great harm to the special
status that the genuine institution has earned.  There are many
relationships in which love is involved.  But marriage is a unique
bonding of the two sexes, with the probable expectation of procreation
of children.  It is the core of civilization and is universally
honored.

<p>

Marriage is more than a union of two people who have strong feelings
for one another.  Marriage establishes bloodlines, kinship, the
passage of family traditions and values through the generations,
the passing on of family names and property and it is the most
important source of social stability.  If we all existed for only
one generation, we would not have as strong a case for creating
legal and cultural safeguards for marriage.  But the protection
of marriage is not only about social harmony.  It is about creating
a future for our children.

<p>

Nobody is denied the &quot;right&quot; to marry.  They just have
to meet the requirements.  The two sexes must be present for it
to be marriage.  If that definition is radically altered based
on the &quot;feelings&quot; of those in other relationships, then
there is no logical reason for not letting several people marry,
or for gutting other marital requirements, such as minimum age,
blood relative status or even the limitation of the relationship
to human beings.

<p>

Marriage is blessed by all major religions as the union of a man
and a woman, so creating a counterfeit would be a slap in the
face to millions of Americans.  As George Washington observed,
government is not eloquence or suggestion; government is force.
If the government imposes a definition of marriage on all citizens
that runs directly counter to the teachings of the great religions,
it forces millions outside the civil law.

<p>

The state would be telling many, many people that their beliefs
are no longer valid, and would turn the civil rights laws into
a battering ram against them:

<p><ul>

<li>Businessmen and women would be prosecuted if they failed to
offer spousal health benefits to homosexual &quot;spouses&quot;.

<p>

<li>Children would necessarily be taught in schools that homosexual
relations represent the moral equivalent of marital love.

<p>

<li>Same-sex &quot;marriage&quot; would give a mighty tool to
those pushing for adoption of children in homosexual households.

<p>

<li>Private organizations like the Boy Scouts of America would
come under increased pressure to abandon their moral standards.

</ul><p>

We are here today because a few judges in Hawaii, against the
expressed wishes of the Hawaiian people, are poised to strike
down Hawaii's marriage law and legalize homosexual &quot;marriages.&quot;
Under the Full Faith and Credit Clause of the U.S. Constitution,
it is likely that homosexuals from other states would fly to Hawaii,
get a marriage license and then come home, demanding the exact
same status as married couples in other states.  This would create
legal havoc and opportunities for further judicial mischief.

<p>

The Defense of Marriage Act merely puts the federal government
on record as defining marriage as the union of a man and a woman
as husband and wife, and it asserts Congress' constitutional prerogative
of interpreting the Full Faith and Credit Clause so that the other
49 states will not be forced to submit to a handful of judges
in Hawaii.

<p>

On May 20, in <I>Romer v. Evans</I>, the U.S. Supreme Court showed
how little regard some powerful jurists have for the right of
people to govern themselves in a democratic republic.  Congress
needs to act now to reassert the legislative branch's constitutional
role as the voice of the people and the maker of the laws.  It
needs to send a message to the Supreme Court and other courts
that they cannot be permitted to exchange morality for immorality
in the nation's laws.

<p>

In his powerful and eloquent dissent, Justice Scalia warned that
we are at a crossroads in which the very idea of a self-governing
federal system is hanging in the balance.  We cannot afford to
let judges usurp any more power and tyrannize an already besieged
moral code. The Defense of Marriage Act is a powerful antidote
to the destructive trend that has gripped this country at the
hands of some injudicious judges.

<p>

Finally, I would like to add that ordinary people did not pick
this fight.  They are not the aggressors.  They are merely defending
the basic morality that has sustained the culture for everyone.
Yet good men and women of varying beliefs have been subjected
to a barrage of name-calling and abuse simply for saying that
marriage ought to be the union of a man and a woman and that the
law should protect this vital social norm.  It is not hatred to
prefer normalcy.  It is not bigotry to resist radical redefinition
of marriage. It is not intolerance to believe in traditional
morality.

<p>

The Defense of Marriage Act is a matter of common sense.  It is
sorely needed.  I doubt that in all you do here, you will do anything 
more important. I urge you to give it swift approval so that the 
Congress can move to protect our society's irreplaceable institution.

<p>

Thank you very much.

<title>WHY WE NEED THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT</title>

<h2>WHY WE NEED THE<br>
DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
Robert H. Knight</i></center>

<p>

<i>This speech was presented at a July 2, 1996 Capitol Hill briefing
regarding the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).  The briefing was
sponsored by the Family Research Council.</i>

<p>

The thing I hear most often in debates about the Defense of Marriage
Act is, &quot;Who will it hurt if two gays or two lesbians down
the street want to share their love?&quot;

<p>

Well, if you put it that way, the answer is almost nobody, if
they keep it entirely to themselves and their behavior does not
involve the transmission of AIDS and other diseases that are epidemic
among homosexuals. That is probably unrealistic.  And they hurt
themselves in living a less fulfilling life.

<p>

Most Americans believe in the philosophy of  &quot;live and let
live.&quot; They don't want to make the plight of homosexuals
any more difficult than it already is.  But tolerance is not what
homosexual activists are seeking.  They are demanding that society
elevate homosexuality to the moral level of marriage.   When they
bring the law into it, they are no longer just minding their own
business but imposing it on every single citizen.

<p>

If you are a devout Christian, Jew or Muslim, or merely someone
who believes homosexuality is immoral and harmful, and the law
declares homosexuality a protected status, then your personal
beliefs are now outside civil law.  This has very serious implications,
for if the law declares opposition to homosexuality as bigotry,
then the entire power of the civil rights apparatus can be brought
against you.

<p>

Businessmen will have to subsidize homosexuality or face legal
sanctions.  Schoolchildren will have to be taught that homosexuality
is the equivalent of marital love.  Religious people will be told
their beliefs are no longer valid, and their independence will
be challenged.

<p>

While homosexuals say they want only tolerance, they are being
dishonest.  They already have tolerance, but are aiming for government-
and corporate-mandated acceptance.  Where gay rights have become
law, people of conscience are already being targeted for punishment
in the name of &quot;diversity&quot; training.

<p>

The Boy Scouts of America are under legal attack in the states
which have special rights for &quot;sexual orientation.&quot;
The Scouts, a private group, are being told to abandon their
moral code of more than 80 years and to place young boys under
homosexual men on camping trips -- or face financial ruin.  The
attack against the Scouts is really an attack on parents, because
parents have the right, in a free nation, to entrust their children
to organizations that reflect the parents' most deeply held beliefs.
If they cannot do this, then we are living in tyranny.  That
is the real, ugly side of gay rights that the media will not show
-- the tyrannical reality.

<p>

Here's an example of where we are headed.  In Hamilton, Ontario,
the mayor was asked by homosexual activists to declare a &quot;gay
pride week.&quot;  Hamilton being a blue-collar, largely Catholic
town, the mayor declined.  He was hauled before a human rights
commission, personally fined $5,000, and told that he had committed
the crimes of &quot;gay bashing&quot; and hatemongering.

<p>

If homosexuals achieve the power to force others to pretend that
their unions are &quot;marriages,&quot; then people of conscience
will be told to ignore their God-given beliefs and to support
what they regard as immoral and destructive.

<p>

Homosexuality has been discouraged in all cultures because it
is inherently wrong and harmful to individuals, families and societies.
The only reason it has been able to gain such prominence in America
today is the near blackout on information about homosexual behavior
itself.  We are being treated to a steady drumbeat of propaganda
echoing the stolen rhetoric of the black civil rights movement
and misrepresenting science.

<p>

Here are some of the myths:

<p>

<b>The 10 percent estimate of homosexuality in the population.</b>
Based entirely on the discredited Kinsey studies, the figure
is a fiction.  The reality is nearer to 1 percent or, at most,
2 percent.

<p>

<b>Genetic studies.</b> Activists say homosexuality is just
like skin color.  But there are thousands of former homosexuals,
but no former blacks or Hispanics.  Virtually all gay genetic
studies have been done by homosexual activists.  All have huge
methodological flaws, and many point to the opposite conclusion
-- that homosexuality is a learned behavior rather than in-born.

<p>

<b>Gay teen suicide.</b> We are told that one in three teen suicides
are gay teens, but this comes from a single report that was repudiated
by Health and Human Services Secretary Louis Sullivan.  Other
studies repudiate the figure as well.

<p>

<b>Psychological studies.</b> In the 1950s, UCLA psychologist
Evelyn Hooker conducted three tests comparing groups of 30 hand-picked
homosexual men with 30 randomly-selected heterosexual men.  In
two of the three tests, the gays were easily picked out because
they sexualized their drawings.  Yet this study was cited in 1973
as the centerpiece of research leading the American Psychiatric
Association and the American Psychological Association to remove
homosexuality from their lists of emotional disorders.

<p>

<b>Hospital visitation.</b> Homosexuals claim that they have
difficulty visiting loved ones in hospitals because families have
primary visitation rights.  Yet an informal survey of hospitals
in the Washington, D.C. area and other metro areas reveals that
no homosexuals are being denied any visitation rights.  A Nexis
search of July 2, 1996 also shows no news stories about homosexuals
being denied visitation rights.  It's a non-issue manufactured
to foster the &quot;victim&quot; image that homosexuals use to
advance their agenda.

<p>

<b>Military security studies.</b> During the debate over gays
in the military, the government unveiled a study that included
a chapter on the moral history of America.  It was full of anti-religious
sentiment and was written by a man who sits on the board of a
journal that promotes man-boy sex.

<p>

<b>Gay parenting studies.</b> Conducted and evaluated by lesbians
or homosexuals, these studies have major problems, but even so,
indicate that children in homosexual households are four times
more likely to identify as homosexual or get involved in homosexual
behavior than children raised in single-parent households.

<p>

I could go on.  Suffice to say, America is being fed a diet of
propaganda that has gone largely unexamined by major media.  The
point is to create the falsehood that homosexuality is normal,
healthy and of no consequence, and should be accorded the same
treatment in the law as benign characteristics such as skin color
or ethnicity.

<p>

The language of gay rights is tolerance, but the aim is raw power
to criminalize dissent from the view that &quot;gay is good.&quot;
In the name of freedom, this agenda must be exposed and halted.
A good place to start would be the passage of the Defense of
Marriage Act.

<title>THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT: AN INSIDER'S VIEW</title>

<h2>THE<br>
DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT:<br>
AN INSIDER'S VIEW</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
Anthony Falzarano</i></center>

<p>

<i>This speech was given at a July 2, 1996 Capitol Hill briefing
regarding the Defense Of Marriage Act (DOMA).  The briefing was
sponsored by the Family Research Council.</i>

<p>

My name is Anthony Falzarano.  I am the executive director of
Transformation Ex-Gay Christian Ministries of Washington, D.C.
We are the Washington, D.C.-affiliate of the largest ex-gay network
in the world, Exodus International, which is based in San Rafael,
California.

<p>

I am here this morning standing in solidarity with the rest of
my colleagues to voice my strong approval of The Defense of Marriage
Act (more commonly known as DOMA).  I really find it incredible
that this bill would even have to come before the halls of Congress.
For many years the term &quot;marriage&quot; never had to be
defined because this country was founded on Judeo-Christian beliefs.
Our founding fathers looked to our heavenly Creator for His definition
of marriage in the pages of the Holy Scriptures in the following:
Genesis 2:24, Matthew 19:5, Mark 10:7, and Ephesians 5:31.  It's
a sad day for America when we would even have to debate this issue
publicly.  The United States of America has taken a dangerous
moral nosedive in the last 35 years and it's about time that we
say &quot;enough is enough&quot; to the enemies of this country
that we have allowed to infiltrate the halls of Congress with
their voices of destruction.

<p>

The politically-motivated homosexual movement in this country
has stepped over the line.  This movement is extremely well funded
and well connected.  It has been working for the last 30 years
like an army of termites, secretly eating away the floorboards
of moral integrity in this country.  It is time to expose the
agenda of these gay political organizations and call them what
they are -- evil.  The gay community shocked us in the 1970s by
coming out of the closet, gained our sympathy in the 1980s with
the horrible pandemic called AIDS and is now trying to force our
acceptance of their lifestyle using the legal system of this country.

<p>

I speak to you today not just as an observer of this movement,
but as one of them.  I am a former homosexual.  I lived that lifestyle
from the time I was 17 until I was 26.  I entered the gay lifestyle
thinking that there really wasn't any choice for me.  What I didn't
realize is that, although I didn't choose to be homosexual, I
did not have to be gay.  I had a choice.  I could change my orientation
from gay to straight.  My healing process was a long and difficult
one.  However, change is possible.  The four national ex-gay networks
are currently ministering to more than 10,000 former homosexuals.
Many of us are sick and tired of a lifestyle that initially seems
very freeing but eventually puts us in all kinds of bondage and
eventually will kill us.  I have lost over 35 of my friends and
acquaintances to the disease of AIDS and don't want to see one
more person become infected with this deadly disease.  The organized
gay community is telling us that AIDS is no longer a gay disease
and although it is spreading into the heterosexual population
in this country very quickly, 61 percent of people that are coming
down with this deadly disease in the U.S. are homosexual, according
to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.

<p>

The gay lobbyists in this country do not want DOMA to pass.  They
know that they cannot force the homosexual agenda into the organized
Christian churches in America (although they are trying), so they
are attempting to push their agenda on the American public and
the civil government using the argument that &quot;they are being
discriminated against.&quot;  I say that their cries of discrimination
have been grossly exaggerated.  When I was a homosexual, as long
as I didn't push my lifestyle into the face of my landlord, no
one kept me from getting an apartment.  As long as I didn't push
my sexual preference into the face of my employer, no one ever
denied me a job.

<p>

America must take a very strong stand against the very highly
organized gay community in this country by supporting The Defense
of Marriage Act.  If we don't say &quot;no&quot; to the organized
gay community now, the United States will suffer the consequences
of our complacency.  America needs to start helping homosexuals
recover from their sexual brokenness.  Putting a stamp of approval
on a lifestyle by legally recognizing it (and even calling it
marriage) is not really helping homosexuals.  It's perpetuating
a myth and delivering them over to a deathstyle.  Just take a
look back into the history books, when homosexuality was openly
accepted into the civil governments of the Greeks and Romans.
Shortly thereafter God passed judgment on those civilizations
and they ceased to exist.  Please don't allow history to repeat
itself.  America isn't bleeding spiritually, it's hemorrhaging.
Please don't allow history to repeat itself.

<title>STATEMENT ON HOMOSEXUALITY</title>

<body>

<h2>STATEMENT ON HOMOSEXUALITY</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
Jeffrey B. Satinover, M.D.</center>

<p>

This speech was presented at a July 2, 1996 Capitol Hill briefing
regarding the Defense of Marriage Act. The briefing was sponsored
by the Family Research Council.</i>

<br><br><br><p><center>

<i>In this age, in this country, public sentiment is everything. With it,<br>
nothing can fail; against it, nothing can succeed. Whoever molds<br>
public sentiment goes deeper than he who enacts statutes, or<br>
pronounces judicial decisions.</i>

<p>

-- Abraham Lincoln

</center><p>

On July 15, 1993, National Public Radio made a dramatic announcement
on stations across the country -- a team of scientists at the
National Institutes of Health had perhaps found the gene that
causes homosexuality. Their report would be published the next
day in <I>Science,</I> the most prestigious scientific research
journal in the world.[1]

<p>

The discussion that followed explained for the listening public
the implications of these findings for social attitudes toward
homosexuality and for public policy concerning it. Science had
proven what many had long argued -- that homosexuality is innate,
genetic and therefore unchangeable; a normal and commonplace variant
of human nature. In the light of these findings, only the bigoted
or ignorant could condemn it in any way.

<p>

Shortly after the announcement, amidst a blizzard of press discussions,
the study was highlighted in the watershed legal battle over &quot;Amendment
2.&quot; This popularly-enacted legislation precluded making sexual
orientation the basis of &quot;privileged class&quot; minority
status. Recently, Amendment 2 was overturned by the U. S. Supreme
largely because opposition to homosexuality was argued by the
court to have no substantive basis -- it was but an &quot;irrational
animus.&quot; The Court's argument was quite consistent with the
way that studies such as this were now being understood.

<p>

Among the many crucial issues raised by the legislation was the
question of whether homosexuality was indeed normal, innate and
unchangeable. Certainly, the message promulgated by NPR's report
on this research, and by all the discussions that followed, was
that it was indeed innate and unchangeable. In a few weeks, 
<I>Newsweek</I> would emblazon across its cover the
phrase that would stick in the public mind as the final truth
about homosexuality: &quot;Gay Gene?&quot;

<p>

Of course, just near the end of the NPR discussion, certain necessary
caveats were fleetingly added. But only an expert knew what they
meant -- that the research actually showed nothing whatever in
the way of what was being discussed. The vast majority of listeners
would think that homosexuality had been proven nearly conclusively
to be &quot;genetic.&quot; But is there such a &quot;gay gene&quot;?
In fact, the researchers responsible for this and other studies
being put forth as supporting such a claim, clearly acknowledge
that it does not -- but you need to be a scientist to understand
why and what <I>is</I> meant by the studies. Here is the nub of
the matter: <I>Almost every human behavioral trait -- homosexuality
included -- is &quot;heritable.&quot; Almost none are &quot;genetic&quot;
or are &quot;inherited.&quot;</I> Is this a contradiction?

<p>

In fact, it isn't, but most people will assume that the two statements
mean the same thing when they actually mean very different things.
All the touted studies to date confirm that, like everything else
in human personality, homosexuality is &quot;at least somewhat
heritable.&quot; None come even close to suggesting that it is
genetic (or inherited).

<p>

When it comes to questions of the genetics of any behavior, homosexuality
included, all of the following statements are likely to be at
least roughly true:

<p><ol>

<li>&quot;Such-and-such&quot; a behavior is &quot;genetic&quot;
<li>There are no genes that produce the behavior
<li>The genes associated with the behavior are found on such and
such a chromosome
<li>The behavior is significantly heritable
<li>The behavior is not inherited

</ol><p>

The scientific distinctions that make these seeming-contradictions
perfectly reasonable and consistent are at best completely misunderstood
by the media who reports on them.

<p>

In response to the &quot;gay gene&quot; research, <I>The Wall
Street Journal</I> headlined their report (which appeared the
next day), &quot;Research Points Toward a Gay Gene.&quot;[2] A subheading
of the <I>Journal</I> article stated, &quot;Normal Variation,&quot;
leaving the casual reader with the impression that the research
led to this conclusion. It did not, nor could it have. The subhead
alluded to nothing more than one researcher's personal, unsubstantiated
<I>opinion</I> that homosexuality, as he put it, &quot;is a normal
variant of human behavior.&quot; Even <I>The New York Times</I>,
in its more moderate front-page article, &quot;Report Suggests
Homosexuality is Linked to Genes&quot; noted that researchers
warned against overinterpreting the work, &quot;or in taking it
to mean anything as simplistic as that the 'gay gene' had been
found.&quot; (In October of 1995, the whole process repeated itself
when the same author published a follow-up study.)

<p>

At end of the <I>Journal</I> article, at the bottom of the last
paragraph on the last page deep within the paper, a prominent
geneticist was quoted for his reactions to the research. He observed
that &quot;the gene . . . may be involved in something other than
sexual behavior. <I>For example, it may be that the supposed gene
is only 'associated' with homosexuality, rather than a 'cause'
of it</I>.&quot;

<p>

This rather cryptic comment would be most difficult to understand
without the needed background. Yet it is the most critical distinction
in the entire article <I>and is the central issue in the entire
question</I>. Why bury and fail to explain what it means? Perhaps
the motives were innocent, but in fact, the belief that homosexuality
is &quot;biological&quot; or &quot;genetic&quot; causes people
to develop more positive attitudes toward it. They need not have
the foggiest understanding of what &quot;biological&quot; or 
&quot;genetic&quot; really mean:

<p><blockquote>

<i>105 volunteer[s]... were exposed to one of three... conditions....
[T]he experimental group read a summary... emphasizing a biological
component of homosexual orientation.... [O]ne control group
read a summary... focusing on the absence of hormonal differences
between homosexual and heterosexual men. [A]nother control group
w[as] not exposed to either article.... As predicted, subjects
in the experimental group had significantly lower[3] scores [more
positive attitudes toward homosexuals] than subjects in the control
groups.</i>[4]

</blockquote><p>

And:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Analysis indicated that subjects who believed that homosexuals
are &quot;born that way&quot; held significantly more positive
attitudes toward homosexuals than subjects who believed that homosexuals
&quot;choose to be that way&quot; and/or &quot;learn to be that
way.&quot;</i>[5]

</blockquote><p>

What was actually going in the study the media was trumpeting?
The research in question was a variety of behavioral genetics
study now becoming widespread -- the so-called &quot;linkage study.&quot;
Researchers identify a behavioral trait that runs in a family
and then look to see whether there is a chromosomal variant in
the genetic material of that family, and if that variant is more
frequent in the family members who have the trait.

<p>

To the uninitiated, a positive finding (&quot;correlation&quot;
or &quot;association&quot; of a genetic structure with a behavioral
trait) is taken to mean that the trait &quot;is genetic.&quot;
<I>In fact, it means absolutely nothing of the sort, and there
is virtually no human trait without innumerable such correlations.</I>
We will see shortly just how this is can be so. The most important
take-home messages will be these:

<p>

(1) All the research that has been done on homosexuality seems
as though selectively trumpeted through the press in order to
shape public opinion -- hence public policy -- in predictable
ways. The research itself means almost nothing.

<p>

(2) The research projects that would <I>truly</I> mean something
are scarcely being done because they would all explicitly or tacitly
lead to two currently unpopular ends: a) the uncovering of factors
<I>having nothing to do with homosexuality per se</I> (whether
environmental or temperamental) that place an individual at greater
risk for homosexuality; and b) once these factors are known, are
even suspected, the development of better methods than already
exist to reverse and prevent homosexuality.

<p>

(3) The quality of some of the research has been severely criticized
-- but this point is a distraction. Even were it superb, the findings
would still mean almost nothing. Higher-quality studies will without
question produce comparable results that mean equally little.

<p>

(4) To whatever extent this research has been good enough to generate
valid conclusions at all, these conclusions are precisely the
opposite of what is claimed in the press.

<p>

Before we talk about specifics, here is what serious scientists
think about the recent behavior-caused-by-genes research.

<p>

From <I>Science,</I> 1994:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Time and time again, scientists have claimed that particular genes
or chromosomal regions are associated with behavioral traits,
only to withdraw their findings when they were not replicated.
&quot;Unfortunately,&quot; says Yale's [Dr. Joel] Gelernter, &quot;it's
hard to come up with many findings linking specific genes
to complex human behaviors that have been replicated.&quot;...
All were announced with great fanfare; all were greeted unskeptically
in the popular press; all are now in disrepute.</i>[6]

</blockquote><p>

A scientist at Washington University School of Medicine calculated
what would be required for a confirmatory replication. He:

<p><blockquote>

<i>...projected that if the trait [in question] was 50 percent heritable...
detecting [just] one of [its] genes would require studying 175
families -- that is, almost 2000 people.[7] Replicati[on] would require
studying 781 families -- another 8000 people.... [E]ach additional
gene (for a polygenic trait), researchers would need... the
whole business again. &quot;Suddenly you're talking about tens
of thousands of people and years of work and millions of 
dollars.&quot;</i>[8]

</blockquote><p>

Using arguable-at-best methods, two American activists recently
published studies showing that if one of a pair of identical twins
is homosexual, the odds that the other one is, too, are more than
50 percent. On this basis, they argue that &quot;homosexuality
is genetic.&quot; British researchers generated comparable results
in a similar study. Their conclusion? The surprisingly low odds
that both twins were homosexual:

<p><blockquote>

<i>confirmed that genetic factors are insufficient explanation for
the development of sexual orientation.</i>[9]

</blockquote><p>

Two Columbia University researchers (who have published the most
comprehensive research summary on the subject to date) note the
unexpectedly:

<p><blockquote>

<i>... large proportion of monozygotic twins who [did not share]
homosexuality despite sharing not only their genes but also their
prenatal and familial environments.[10] The... [50 percent odds]...
for homosexuality among the identical twins could be entirely
accounted for by the increased similarity of their developmental
experiences. In my opinion, the major finding of that study is
that 48 percent of identical twins who were reared together [and
where at least one was homosexual] were discordant for sexual
orientation.</i>[11]

</blockquote><p>

Two other genetics researchers (one heads one of the largest genetics
departments in the country, the other is at Harvard) comment:

<p><blockquote>

<i>... recent studies seeking a genetic basis for homosexuality
suggests that... we may be in for a new molecular phrenology,
rather than true scientific progress and insight into behavior.

<p>

While the authors interpreted their findings as evidence for a
genetic basis for homosexuality, we think that the data in fact
provide strong evidence for the influence of the environment.</i>[12]

</blockquote><p>

The author of the lead article on genes and behavior in a special
issue of <I>Science</I> notes:

<p><blockquote>

<i>... the growing understanding that the interaction of genes and
environment is much more complicated than the simple &quot;violence
genes&quot; and &quot;intelligence genes&quot; touted in the popular
press. Indeed, <I>renewed appreciation of environmental factors
is one of the chief effects of the increased belief in genetics'
effects on behavior</I> [My emphasis]. The same data that show
the effects of genes also point to the enormous influence of non-genetic
factors.</i>[13]

</blockquote><p>

The director of the Center for Developmental and Health Genetics
at Pennsylvania State University comments:

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;Research into heritability is the best demonstration I know
of the importance of the environment.&quot;</i>

</blockquote><p>

(Note the term &quot;heritability.&quot; We will be returning
to it in detail as it lies at the heart of much confusion).

<p>

With regard to Hamer's work on what the press calls &quot;the
gay gene,&quot; genetics researchers from Yale, Columbia and Louisiana
State Universities noted that:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Much of the discussion of [Hamer's et al.] finding [of a purported
gene locus for homosexuality] has focused on its social and political
ramifications. [But] inconsistencies... suggest that this finding
should be interpreted cautiously....

<p>

[Hamer's et al.] results are not consistent with any genetic model....neither
of these differences [between homosexuality in maternal versus
paternal uncles or cousins] is statistically significant....small
sample sizes make these data compatible with a range of hypotheses.

<p>

[T]he... data... present no consistent support for the results.</i>[14]

</blockquote><p>

It does not seem to have been widely reported that Hamer responded
carefully, and accurately, to his fellow scientists, as follows:

<p><blockquote>

<i>We did not say that [the chromosome segment under study] 
&quot;underlies&quot; sexuality, only that it contributes to it in 
some families. Nor have we said that [it] represents a &quot;major&quot; 
gene, only that its influence is statistically detectable in the 
population that we studied.</i>[15]

</blockquote><p>

Setting aside possible flaws in the research, would the findings
actually point to this more modest claim with any degree of certainty?
In fact, they don't -- as Hamer himself acknowledges, but in language
that will surely evade general understanding -- and that is likely
(because of its complexity) to be avoided by the press:

<p><blockquote>

<i>the question of the appropriate significance level to apply to
a non-Mendelian trait such as sexual orientation is problematic.</i>[16]

</blockquote><p>

English translation: &quot;It is not possible to know what the
findings mean, if anything, since sexual orientation can't be
inherited the way eye-color is.&quot; The bottom line, in his
words, is what serious researchers know, but the public doesn't:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Complex behavioral traits are the product of multiple genetic
and environmental antecedents, with 'environment' meaning not
only the social environment but also such factors as the 'flux
of hormones during development, whether you were lying on your
right or left side in the womb and a whole parade of other things'...the
relationships among genes and environment probably have a somewhat
different effect on someone in Salt Lake City than if that person
were growing up in New York City.</i>[17]

</blockquote><p>

English translation: You're more likely to become gay growing
up in Manhattan than in Utah among Mormons and Christian fundamentalists,
even if everything else is the same, including genes.

<p>

Activists are readily able to feed the public what they wish only
in part because of an easily-led or poorly-educated press. The
major reason is really that the ideas being distorted beyond recognition
once they leave the labs are inherently complex, even when presented
properly. There are no &quot;lite,&quot; sound-bite versions that
aren't fundamentally in error in one way or another.

<p>

Nonetheless, if one grasps at least some of the basics, in simple
form, it will be possible to see exactly why the current research
into homosexuality means so little -- and will continue to mean
little even should the quality of the research methods improve
-- so long as it remains driven by politics.

<p>

<center><h3>TWO BASIC PRINCIPLES</h3></center>

<p>

There are really only two major principles that need to be carefully
assimilated in order to see through public relations distortions
to the actual meaning of recent research. They are as follows:

<p><ol>

<li><I>Heritable</I> does not mean <I>inherited</I>.

<p>

<li>Meaningful genetics research identifies and then focuses on
traits that <I>are</I> directly inherited.

</ol><p>

Let's begin with the first point -- that <I>heritable</I> does
not mean <I>inherited</I>.

<p>

<I>Heritability</I> studies can be done on almost any human trait
-- physical, behavioral, emotional, etc. -- and will show positive
results. That is, almost every human characteristic you can think
of is in some measure <I>heritable</I>. But few human behavioral
traits are directly <I>inherited</I> the way simple physiological
traits are (e.g., eye color).

<p>

&quot;Inherited&quot; means &quot;determined directly by genes,&quot;
with little or no way of changing the trait by choice, or by preventing
it, or by modifying the environment in which the trait has emerged
(or is more likely to emerge).

<p>

Here is a hypothetical example, but it is 100 percent plausible.
It tracks the kinds of studies that have been done with innumerable
other traits, including homosexuality. (But only in the area of
homosexuality has the meaning of such studies been so badly distorted.)

<p>

Suppose that for political reasons you want to demonstrate that
there is a &quot;basketball gene&quot; that &quot;makes&quot;
people become basketball players -- BBPs. (Suspend your intuitive
sense that the idea is absurd.) To make your case, you would use
the same research methods as with homosexuality. These methods
fall into three categories, and represent important preliminary
research when investigating any trait:

<p><ul>

(a) twin studies

<p>

(b) brain dissections

<p>

(c) gene &quot;linkage&quot; studies

</ul><p>

<b>(a) Twin Studies</b>

<p>

The basic idea in twin studies is to show that the more genetically
similar are two people, the more likely it is that they will share
the trait you're studying. So, you create a study set of pairs
of people, divided into categories according to how genetically
similar they are, as follows.

<p><hr><p>

<center><pre>
<b>Pair Type                   Degree of Genetic Similarity</b>
<b>                            (% same genes)              </b>

<i><b>Identical Twins</b></i>                    100%                 
<i><b>Fraternal (Non-identical) Twins</b></i>     50%                 
<i><b>Non-Twin Brothers or Sisters</b></i>        50%                 
<i><b>Unrelated People</b></i>                    &lt;5%                 

</pre></center>

<p><hr><p>

The most similar are identical twins, the next most similar are
fraternal twins (who are on average as different as non-twin brothers
or sisters, but no more so), the least similar are unrelated people.

<p>

Then you identify those pairs of twins in which at least one is
a BBP. It will not be difficult to show that if one such identical
twin is a BBP, his brother (or her sister) more frequently will
be, too, than would a non-identical twin or a non-twin sibling
or a non-sibling. You would create groups of such different kinds
of pairs to make the comparison in a large number of cases. (One
set of identical twin pairs, one set of non-identical twin pairs,
one set of non-twin siblings, and so on.) From the &quot;concordance
rate&quot; in each set (the percentage of pairs in each set in
which either both are BBPs or both aren't. Pairs in which one
was and the other wasn't would be called &quot;discordant for
BBP&quot;) you would calculate a &quot;heritability&quot; rate.
(Perhaps you have an armchair guess as to how many identical twin-pairs
either <I>both</I> play or <I>both</I> don't play basketball.
Probably a good deal more than half, the concordance rate for
homosexuality in such twin-pairs.)

<p>

You respond to the reporter from <I>Sports Illustrator</I> that
&quot;our research demonstrates that BBP is very strongly heritable,&quot;
and you'd be right. But the article that comes out that month
reads something slightly different, but completely wrong. &quot;&#133;
recent research shows that basketball playing is probably inherited.
A number of outside researchers examined the work and found it
substantially accurate and well-performed. They cautioned against
arriving at hasty conclusions, however.&quot; No one notices the
difference.

<p>

Thus, the authors of a widely-reported set of twin studies describe
their intent to alter &quot;public sentiment&quot; as follows:

<p><blockquote>

<i>These studies were designed to detect heritable variation, and
if it was present, to counter the prevalent belief that sexual
orientation is largely the product of family interactions and
the social environment.</i>[18]

</blockquote><p>

But they themselves acknowledge in their own paper that:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Although male and female homosexuality appear to be at least somewhat
heritable, environment must also be of considerable importance
in their origins.</i>[19]

</blockquote><p>

<b>(b) Brain Dissections</b>

<p>

Second, your colleagues perform a series of autopsies on the brains
of some dead people who appear to have been BBPs. (Old jerseys,
high-top sneakers and Knick's ticket-stubs were found among their
possessions, for example.) They do the same with a group of dead
non-players (no sneakers, jerseys or tickets.) They report that,
on average, &quot;certain parts of the brain long thought to be
involved with BBP are much larger in the group of BBPs than in
the controls.&quot; Certain nationally-renowned newspapers in
the Northeast pick up on the story and editorialize, &quot;It
will be very difficult for anyone except poorly-educated yokels
who believe in Santa Claus, the Tooth-Fairy and God to argue that
basketball playing isn't inborn. For not only has it been proven
to run in families, even the <I>brains</I> of basketball players
are different.&quot;

<p>

In a pretense of balance, some of these papers interview die-hard
believers in the old view -- yokels who still think that one must
decide to play basketball, and play it for a long time, before
you really can be considered &quot;a BBP.&quot; One of them is
quoted as claiming that &quot;maybe if you do something long enough
your brain changes as you get better at it, and that part of the
brain gets bigger.&quot; (Remarkably enough, this surmise seems
obvious to the old-time believer.) The reporter doesn't merely
report the comment, however, he also hints that it's especially
idiotic -- typical of die-hards and yokels -- since everyone knows
the brain doesn't change. For example, with regard to homosexuality,
<I>The Wall Street Journal</I> chided:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Some religious fundamentalists even suggested that homosexual
activity somehow could have caused the structural differences
[in the brain].</i>[20]

</blockquote><p>

Of course, you yourself are well-aware that among neuroscientists
it is extremely old news that the brain indeed changes, quite
dramatically, in just the way the old die-hard guessed: those
parts responsible for an activity get much, much bigger over time
(and there are definitely parts that are more utilized in BBP.
Similarly:

<p><blockquote>

<i>... in individuals who became blind as adults and then learned
Braille, the part of the brain governing the right index finger
became progressively enlarged.)</i>[21]

</blockquote><p>

Thus, the editor of <I>Nature,</I> the world's most eminent scientific
journal (the British counterpart to <I>Science</I>) remarked on
this research that:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Plainly, the neural correlates of genetically determined gender
are plastic at a sufficiently early stage. . . . Plastic structures
in the hypothalamus allowing the consequences of early sexual
arousal to be made permanent might suit [those who claim an environmental
origin to homosexuality] well.</i>[22]

</blockquote><p>

<b>(c) Gene &quot;Linkage&quot; Studies</b>

<p>

Now for the <I>coup de grace</I>. You find a couple of families
of BBPs and compare them to some families of non-BBPs. You have
a hunch that of innumerable genes of every imaginable sort likely
to be &quot;associated&quot; or &quot;linked&quot; to BBP (you
never use the word &quot;causing&quot; because you don't need
to -- no one knows the difference), there are some genes on, say,
the X-Chromosome. After a few false starts, sure enough, you find
what you're looking for: among the BBP families is more commonly
found (though not always) one particular chromosomal variant (cluster
of genes) than among the non-players.

<p>

Now, sympathizers in the press were long-ago quietly informed
of your research, since they want people to come around to certain
beliefs, too. So, as soon as your work hits the press, they're
on the air: &quot;Researchers are hot on the trail of the 'Basketball
Gene!' In an article to be published tomorrow in <I>Sports Science</I>....
&quot; Learned-sounding commentators muse about the enormous public
policy implications of this superb piece of 
science-in-the-service-of-humankind. Two weeks later, there it is 
again, at a jaunty angle across the cover of the major national 
newsweekly: &quot;Basketball Gene.&quot;

<p>

Now what's wrong with this scenario? It's simple: of course BBP
is <I>heritable</I> (&quot;has a non-zero <I>heritability</I>&quot;
to use the words of genetics researchers). That's because many
physiological traits, such as muscle strength, speed, agility,
reflex speed, height, etc., are themselves directly <I>inherited</I>,
and they make it more or less likely that one can, and will want
to, and will successfully, and will therefore continue to want
to, and will, in fact, continue to, play basketball. In short,
because of intermediate <I>inherited</I> traits <I>associated</I>
with BBP (none of which <I>are</I> BBP), it shows significant
<I>heritability</I>. (The genetic <I>association</I>, of course,
is in no way necessary or predetermined, and is highly 
culturally-conditioned: there were no BBPs at all in, say, ancient 
Greece, yet the same genes were there.)

<p>

BBP also shows a strong <I>biological representation in
the brain,</I> both at birth (e.g., nervous system factors contributing
to reflex speed) and especially later (e.g., the parts of the
cortex that are cultivated and become responsible for the movements
of basketball).

<p>

And the specific genes that run in families that are responsible
for height, athleticism, etc. can surely be found and they will
be statistically <I>linked</I> to BBP. If one identical twin decides
to play basketball, the unusually strong emotional bond between
such siblings will make it even more likely that his twin will,
too. (The fact of their genetic <I>identity</I>, not their specific
genes, is here influencing an outcome above and beyond the indirect
contributions from any specific genes.)

<p>

The basic problem is this: BBP is &quot;influenced&quot; (made
more or less an easy and enjoyable thing to do) by the presence
or absence of other associated traits. For BBP we can readily
guess what they are and so immediately see that the &quot;genetic&quot;
component of BBP has nothing to do with the game itself but with
these associated (facilitating) traits. What are these traits?
Height, athleticism, bone structure, reflexes, muscle refresh
rate, and so on. So obvious are the specifics of this association
that no one will waste his time looking into the genetics of BBP
proper. They willconcentrate on the obvious intermediate traits
-- height, athleticism, and so on.

<p>

The same is true for homosexuality, except (a) the more important,
intermediate traits with which it is associated are mostly unknown
and suspected ones are harder to confirm and (b) the research
agenda seems diverted by the political requirement that no such
associated traits be discovered and that homosexuality be presented
as directly inherited.

<p>

Good genetics research must identify and then focus on traits
that are directly inherited. Research into merely <I>heritable</I>
traits is useful only in generating hypotheses about what the
directly inherited traits might be. Here's what this means:

<p>

Let's imagine that it wasn't immediately evident to us that the
heritable aspects of BBP were intermediate traits such as height.
A good researcher would not be at all tempted to conclude from
the studies we described that BBP itself was inherited. He would
conclude however that, indeed, there must be some inherited traits
that facilitate BBP, and it would be these as-yet-unknown traits
that were producing the &quot;non-zero heritability&quot; results.
If he could identify the traits correctly, <I>he would find that
the heritability results, when he redirected his genetics research,
would increase dramatically.</I> 

<p>

In other words, studying the genetics of BBP is really a crude
way of unwittingly studying the genetics of height and athleticism.
If he selects his population on the basis of the indirect trait
(BBP), when it is other traits that are really inherited, his
results will be &quot;fuzzed up&quot; by the inevitable proportion
of BBP's who lack these traits, or have them in lesser degree.
But if he correctly identifies the traits in question, his next
round of studies will &quot;divide the herd&quot; more efficiently,
corralling his subjects not by BBP (or &quot;sexual orientation&quot;),
but by height. Of course, there will be more BBPs among the tall
subjects than among the short, but that's incidental. He will
seek out other tall people who aren't BBPs, and in his new study,
the heritability factor (height) will be even more concentrated.

<p>

How might he guess at what the most important traits are, and
then try to confirm his guess, so he could investigate the genetics
of these traits? Very simply. He looks, does the best he can to
name what he sees, and tries not to run afoul of any currently-fashionable
taboos. He'll probably have no trouble studying height, but he
might run into difficulties if he thinks that athleticism (or
even height) has a racial association. (More people of Nordic
stock, being taller, are likely to become basketball players than
do people of Appenzeller Swiss stock, being short. Perhaps other
such groupings might occur to a researcher.)

<p>

In the case of homosexuality, the <I>inherited</I> traits that
are more common among homosexuals (and that produce &quot;non-zero
<I>heritability</I>&quot; in studies) might include such qualities
as greater than average tendency to anxiety, shyness, sensitivity,
intelligence, aesthetic abilities and so on. (Of course, these
traits may themselves be further reducible to a variety of 
mutually-influencing, associated genetic and non-genetic factors.) 
The brain changes that are more prevalent among homosexuals, the 
increased tendency of homosexuality to run in families (and to vary 
with degree of genetic similarity within families) and the presence 
of associated chromosomal markings are all certainly due to as yet 
unresearched and therefore not-yet-identified intermediate traits. 
There is <I>no</I> evidence that homosexuality itself is inherited.

<p>

Like height and BBP, these traits -- intelligence, say, or anxiety
-- are surely widely distributed in the population at large and
densely present therefore in groups that are properly selected
to have them. If researchers had divided their population by shyness
or aesthetic sensibility, and ignored the homosexual-non-homosexual
division they might well have found even stronger chromosomal
linkages and heritability.

<p>

<center><h3>CHANGE</h3></center>

<p>

The effect on &quot;public sentiment&quot; of the widely-believed
but unsubstantiated claim that &quot;homosexuality is inherited&quot;
is to convince people that it is unchangeable. That people wrestling
with homosexuality sincerely and accurately have detected homosexual
impulses in themselves since childhood lends credence to the 
&quot;innate&quot; argument. But if, as the evidence strongly 
suggests, homosexuality is not inherited (even if deeply embedded, and 
far from a simple choice), the converse should be true -- it should be 
changeable.

<p>

Indeed, a dispassionate examination of more than 50 years of research
in homosexual change confirms that it is changeable in just the
way that deeply embedded impulses are: with difficulty, and in
the absence of a consistent long-term program of unbiased research,
with less than 100 percent but very significant success. As the
following studies suggest, many including long-term follow-up,
success rates above 50 percent are already achievable. There is
every reason to expect that a purposeful, well-supported program
of research could achieve considerably more.

<center><h3>Conclusions</h3></center>

<p>

Two profoundly mistaken ideas have sunk deeply into public sentiment
where they exert a powerful influence in the shaping of public
policy as it relates to family, sexuality and marriage. These
are:

<p><ol>

<li>That homosexuality &quot;is genetic,&quot; and that, consequently;
<li>Homosexuality is unchangeable.

</ol><p>

Neither idea is true, and in fact there is substantial scientific
evidence to the contrary. There are two groups of Americans being
severely harmed by the propagation of these untruths:

<ol><p>

<li>The very large number of homosexuals who wish nothing more
than to rid themselves of these unwanted impulses and establish
quiet marriages and families. The gay and lesbian activism that
claims to speak for all homosexuals speaks for these many struggling
fellow citizens in no way whatsoever. Even more completely ignored
are the very large number of people who have already successfully
negotiated this difficult, but extraordinarily rewarding, passage.

<p>

<li>The rising generation of youngsters, an ever-growing proportion
of whom -- because of the rapidly deteriorating family -- are
at risk for profound identity confusion of every sort, sexual
as well. If our children are not correctly instructed as to the
true possibilities for homosexual change, as well as of its nature,
many will be misguided into accepting a way of life which, in
they end, they do no want, and which is in conflict with their
most cherished private beliefs.

</ol><p>

Perhaps even more troubling is this: Epidemiologists around the
country have confirmed that among young gay men there is a significant
return to the unsafest of sexual practices in spite of more than
15 years of massively-funded education programs. Multiple studies
at centers around the country suggest that a shocking 30 percent
of all currently 20-year-old young men who identify themselves
as &quot;gay&quot; will be either HIV-positive or dead of AIDS
by the time they are 30 years of age.[32]

<p>

Yet, as is indicated by recent research, many of these young men
will spontaneously leave homosexuality behind, and formal outcome
studies in homosexual change from before the political chill show
average success rates from a variety of psychotherapeutic (talk
only) treatment modalities (including long term follow-up) of
more than 50 percent. Even were the change rate but 10 percent,
that alone would save the lives of 30 out of every 1000 such young
men.

<h2>THE IMPLICATIONS OF<br>
GAY 'MARRIAGE'</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
Hadley Arkes</center>

<p>

This speech was presented at a July 2, 1996 Capitol Hill briefing 
regarding the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).  The briefing was 
sponsored by the Family Research Council.</i>

<p>

During the hearings on the 
Defense of Marriage Act in May, Congressman Barney Frank (D-Mass.) posed
the rhetorical but earnest question:  Were he and his partner,
&quot;Herb&quot; -- settled, domesticated couple that they were
-- really imperilling the marriages of people in their neighborhood?
How could their example, as a gay couple, injure the institution
of marriage?  Had there been some decline, after all, in the attraction
of the sexes, so that men might cease being attracted to women
if they were suddenly more aware of gay men together as couples?
That would appear, on the surface, a plausible question, but
it masks a serious confusion about the standards of judgment or
evidence in assessing the problem.  We might as aptly ask whether
there would be any measurable fraying in the community if a brother
and sister took up residence as husband and wife.  Years ago,
in Stafford, Virginia, a 40-year-old mother was living in a common
law marriage with her 19-year-old son.  They were ordered by a
court to part, and as far as we know, their example produced no
breakdown of marriages in the town.  No one expects the sky to
fall in, or the local populace to break out in fits of stuttering.
That is not the test, and that is not the issue.

<p>

The question of what is suitable for marriage is quite separate from 
the matter of love, though it cannot finally be detached from love. 
No one doubts the love of men for men, or women for women, just as no
one doubts that there may be abiding relations of love between
brothers and sisters, grandparents and grandchildren.  In the
nature of things, nothing in those relations of love could possibly
be diminished in any way if they were not attended by penetration
or expressed in marriage.

<p>

As I remarked at the hearings in May,
it becomes impossible finally to discuss this matter of marriage
and sexuality without using the N-word:  nature.  The question
must return to that sexuality stamped in our natures, or what
has been called the &quot;natural teleology of the body&quot;
--  namely, the inescapable fact that only two people, not three,
only a man and a woman, can beget a child.  We don't need a marriage
to mark the presence of love, but a marriage marks something matchless
in a framework for the begetting and nurturance of children.
Even on those occasions when marriages break down, the framework
of law has the advantage at least of fixing responsibility for
the custody and care of children.

<p>

I posed then a question of principle
for the Committee on the Judiciary in this way:  If marriage were
detached from that natural teleology of the body, <i>on what ground
of principle could the law confine marriage to &quot;couples&quot;?</i>
If the law permitted the marriage of people of the same sex,
what is the ground of principle on which the law would refuse
to recognize a &quot;marriage&quot; in the people who profess
that their own love is not confined to a coupling of two, but
connected in a larger cluster of three or four?  The confining
of marriage to two may stand out then as nothing more than the
most arbitrary fixation on numbers.  But if that arrangement of
plural partners were permitted to people of the same sex, how
could it be denied in principle to ensembles of mixed sexes?
That is to say, we would be back, in principle, to the acceptance
of polygamy.

<p>

I sought to be clear, also, in the discussion
in the Judiciary Committee that I was not making a prediction
-- I was not predicting that, if we accepted same-sex marriage,
we would be engulfed by polygamy and incest.  I was a raising
question, again, of principle:  What was the ground on which the
law refused to accept the polygamous union once it accepted the
notion of gay marriage?  It could not be, &quot;That is not what
we do here,&quot; for that answer would suffice right now.  One
young legislator, testifying before the Committee, was pressed
on this matter of polygamy, and he replied that he simply understood
marriage as an exclusive contractual relation between two people.
Others might come back and retort that we happen to consider
marriage an exclusive, contractual relation between a man and
a woman.  On the level of assertion, one meets another;  but neither
one states a ground of principle for denying same-sex marriage
-- once marriage is detached, as I say, from its defining ground
in nature.

<p>

I would go further and say that I take Congressman
Frank and other gay activists at their word when they declare
that they do not wish to injure the family.  I credit their avowals
about their attachments to their own families, and their wish
that other people in the country may have the blessings of that
life in a family.  But the problem here, as I sought to explain,
was that their argument ran well beyond their intentions.  Those
arguments must put in place the kinds of premises and understandings
that make it impossible to reject any longer the claims for polygamy.
To put it another way, every argument for gay marriage is an
argument that would support polygamy.  The gay activists may not
have the remotest interest in promoting polygamy, but this much
may fairly be said:  They have the most profound interest, rooted
in the logic of their doctrine, in discrediting the notion that
marriage finds its defining ground in &quot;nature.&quot;  Their
rhetorical strategy, their public arguments, have all been directed
explicitly to the derision of that claim that sexuality in the
strictest sense involves the sexuality &quot;imprinted in our
natures.&quot;  For that reason, we can count on the fact that
there will be someone, somewhere, ready to press this this issue
by raising a challenge in the court and testing the limits even
further.

<p>

The irony then is that the notion of marriage cannot
accommodate couples of the same sex without so altering the cast
or character of marriage that it will cease to be that special
relation, which seems to be the object of such deep craving now
for so many people.  Once the notion of marriage is broadened
in that way, it will simply not be tenable any longer to hold
up marriage, in the laws, as a relation that deserves a special
place, a special commendation -- a special effort to sustain and
promote it.  And indeed, we fear that the movement to gay marriage
is fueled in part by a desire to remove that special standing
in principle -- to deny that there is anything about marriage
that deserves a special respect, or any favored standing in the
law.  And after all, people are not drawn to the &quot;gay&quot;
life because of an overpowering interest in raising children.
The question of marriage for gays or lesbians, or rights of adoption
for gay couples, take on their importance strategically:  They
provide further occasions for moving the law to pronounce that
homosexuality is, in the current phrase, &quot;virtually normal,&quot;
that homosexuality cannot stand on any lesser plane of legitimacy
than that sexuality &quot;imprinted in our natures.&quot;

<p>

But it is worth reminding the press, and the public, as to what provided
the urgency, for the Congress, to come forth at this moment, with
the Defense of Marriage Act.  The litigation in Hawaii was percolating
for a few years, but matters moved into an alarming phase with
the argument before the Supreme Court, last October, in <i>Romer
v. Evans</i>.

<p>

When I testified before the Judiciary Committee of the
House on May 15, the decision in that case was expected any day.
It arrived five days later, on May 20th, and it was quite as
bad as many of us had anticipated.  In that decision, the Court
struck down a constitutional amendment in Colorado that refused
to treat gays and lesbians as a protected or favored class, on
the same plane as the groups that suffer discrimination based
on race or gender.  We will hear, of course, different accounts
of that case, but in my own reading, that decision will be read
by many activists among the judges to produce this lesson:  that
a State may not incorporate in its laws or public policy an adverse
judgment on homosexuality, and it may not refuse to accord to
homosexuality the same standing or legitimacy that attaches to
that sexuality &quot;imprinted in our natures.&quot;  With this
move, the Court may have armed federal judges to tie up any legislation
in a State that refused to honor homosexual marriages:  After
all, the argument might run, the State refuses to credit this
marriage only because of the gender, or the &quot;sexual orientation,&quot;
of the couple.  Would this not be, on the face, but another 
&quot;discrimination&quot; against people because they happen to be 
gays or lesbians?

<p>

As it turned out, we did not have long to wait.  This argument has
already been sounded by Professor William Eskridge of the Georgetown
University Law School (in the June 17 issue of <i>The New Republic</i>).
Several weeks ago, I taped a television program on this subject
with Professor Eskridge, who affected not to be aware then of
any such development that could undercut the authority of the
States in refusing to honor gay marriage.  In the hearings, Congressman
Frank was especially contemptuous of this bill on the ground that
it was an unnecessary extension of federal power -- that Congress
would act here to confirm to the States a power they already had.
When I pointed out the implications of the coming decision in
<i>Romer v. Evans</i>, there was no acknowledgement on the part of Frank
that he was aware of the case pending there. In a piece in <i>The
New York Times</i>, Professor Laurence Tribe affected the same want
of awareness.  Tribe joined Frank in arguing that the bill was
unjustified precisely because it was unnecessary -- that the States
would not require any prop to their authority in rejecting gay
marriage.  But now Professor Eskridge seems to have let the truth
slip.  He has made it clear that gay activists would indeed read
the Romer case in the way I've suggested, and that they can of
course be expected to cite it -- as they would cite anything else
even remotely supportive of their arguments -- as they seek to
challenge in the courts the Defense of Marriage Act.

<p>

And yet, this Act is the most delicate and limited measure that the 
Congress could produce on the subject.  It treats subjects that are 
evidently within the reach of the Congress, and it makes the least 
intrusion into the domain of State law.  What other institution could 
possibly have the authority to clarify the meaning of terms in federal
legislation, if not the federal legislature?  It surely cannot
be a novelty to make explicit what has ever been our tradition,
that marriage &quot;means only a legal union between one man and
one woman as husband and wife.&quot;  In the second sentence of
the Full Faith and Credit Clause the Constitution reads:  &quot;And
the Congress may by general Laws prescribe the Manner in which
such Acts, Records and Proceedings shall be proved, and the Effect
thereof.&quot;  Once again, we may ask:  If Congress may not legislate
under this federal clause, what other institution could possibly
claim the authority to legislate?  How could we legislate in any
more minimal way here than in the way the Congress has chosen
to legislate -- namely, by providing merely that no State would
be obliged to honor, as a marriage, anything but what we have
known traditionally as &quot;marriage,&quot; the legal union of
a man and a woman, as husband and wife?  As I say, it is hard
to imagine any law on the subject that moves with more delicacy
or with less intrusion into the powers of the States.  The States
that wish to honor gay marriage will suffer no restriction in
this measure.  But on other hand, this provision on the part of
Congress may supply the only ground of support for a State in
refusing to credit same-sex marriage, especially if a federal
court moves to strip from a State every other source of resistance.

<p>

In my own testimony last May, I anticipated that questions would
be raised about the power of Congress to legislate on the subject
of marriage through the Full Faith and Credit Clause.  That clause
was obviously not meant as a grant of power to Congress to legislate
more broadly on the subject of marriage, and that is the not the
power that the Congress is undertaking in this case.  I pointed
to some of the earlier flexing of congressional authority under
the Full Faith and Credit Clause, in dealing with the custody
of children and the protection of former spouses from threats
of violence.  The Clause had been used, in other words, to deal
with some of the fallout from divorce and the rupture of families,
in matters that ran beyond the powers of the States.  The same
situation would present itself here.

<p>

I suggested in my testimony
that an even more dramatic instance of the problem was supplied
in 1803, when Congress barred the shipment of slaves into any
state that itself prohibited the import of slaves.  The problem
did not arise for States in the North where slavery was prohibited,
for there was no point in shipping slaves into those States. 
The problem arose for States in the South, where slavery was protected
under the law, but where there was an effort to ban the import
of more slaves.  Under the Constitution, of course, a State could
not cast up barriers to trade across the boundaries of the States.
Only Congress had the power to regulate interstate commerce,
and so the power of Congress was called in here as an annex to
the policy of the State in forbidding the import of new slaves.
Yet, under the Constitution, Congress could exert no authority
over the import of slaves from abroad until 1808.  And it was
widely assumed that Congress had no authority to legislate directly
on slavery within the States.  Clearly, Congress was not thought
to possess the authority to legislate on the substance of slavery
within the States; it could deal only with the problem of fugitive
slaves, moving from one State to another.  But just as clearly,
Congress alone could close off the borders of a State to slaves
shipped from other States, and that authority had to be the source
then of this interstitial power to legislate on the substance
of slavery.

<p>

It seems to me that no more or less has been claimed
in this case, with the Defense of Marriage Act.  There is no way
to avoid touching upon the substance of marriage, and yet the
legislation bears all the marks of an effort simply to touch this
matter in the most minimal way.  It is evident that the drafters
assert no authority here to legislate more fully on the subject
of marriage.  The purpose, plain to any onlooker, was to make
the least intrusion into the powers of the States.

<p>

In contrast, there have been rather emphatic intimations, in other 
parts of our law, that the federal government could indeed reach far 
more widely in the domain of marriage and the family.  Chief Justice
Marshall once remarked in passing, in the Dartmouth College case
(1819) that an apt question might arise under the Contract Clause
if a State passed an act, say, &quot;annulling all marriage contracts,
or allowing either party to annul it without the consent of the
other.&quot; [<i>Dartmouth College v. Woodward</i>, 17 U.S. (4 Wheaton)
518, at 629]  When the federal courts strike down arrangements,
in the States, to assign custody to children on the basis of race,
they engage the Constitution in this matter, and with the effect
of remodelling, in substance, the laws of custody in the States.
[<i>Palmore v. Sidotti</i>, 466 U.S. 429 (1984)]  With this act in Defense
of Marriage, the Congress uses but the slightest portion of the
authority it might it claim to act in this field.  And again,
that deliberate confining of its reach must be taken as a measure
of the intent of the drafters to move with the lightest hand,
in touching nothing more than Congress needs to touch.

<p>

But as restrained, and as limited, as the reach of Congress is in this 
case, this move on the part of Congress is quite telling.  In fact, the 
studied silences in this bill, the simplicity and spareness of its moves,
serve to convey even more powerfully its significance as a legislative
act.  For it represents nothing less than a willingness of Congress
to take up again its warrant to act as an interpreter of the Constitution,
along with the courts and the Executive.  Against the concert
of  judges, remodelling on their own the laws on marriage and
the family, the Congress weighs in to supply another understanding,
and a rival doctrine.  But it happens, at the same time, to be
an ancient understanding and a traditional doctrine.  The Congress
would proclaim it again now, and suggest that the courts take
their bearings anew from this doctrine, stated anew, brought back
and affirmed by officers elected by the people.

<p>

This effort on the part of Congress to weigh in, to participate again 
in the interpretation of the Constitution, was made more urgent by the
prospect of <i>Romer v. Evans</i>, and now it has been made ever more
urgent by the advent, by the presence, of that decision in <i>Romer
v. Evans</i>. The problem of gay marriage was not the only problem
deepened by the judgment in <i>Romer</i>, and if the Congress can counter
the courts on the question of gay marriage, it would be quite
as urgent for the Congress to take this first step, to begin acting
again, for the sake of inducing the courts to limit or narrow
the holding in <i>Romer</i>.

<p>

Here we offer no arrant speculation, but
we simply follow the precise warnings cast up by Justice Scalia
in his dissenting opinion, as he began to draw out for the public
the implications of this recent decision.  As Scalia pointed out,
the Association of American Law Schools now requires all of its
members to extract this pledge from law firms that are interviewing
candidates:  that the employer will be willing to hire homosexuals.
At the same time, the Supreme Court has now declared that people
who hold to the traditional Jewish and Christian teaching on sexuality
are fueled by an irrational &quot;animus.&quot;

<p>

As far as I know, no Moral Court has managed yet to refute the traditional
Jewish and Christian teaching on this ancient problem, and yet
the Court has now pronounced that teaching to be vacuous, to be
connected to no plausible or defensible purpose.  As Scalia has
observed, the Court now declares serious Jews and Christians to
be nothing less than bigots.  And so, as we put these strands
together, is there not an incentive now, for law firms, to gauge
whether the senior partners or young associates harbor views that
may put the firm at odds with the regulations of the law schools?
While affecting no prejudice, mind you, toward people who are
serious about their religion, the law firms may nevertheless screen
out people who acknowledge their seriousness as Christians and
Jews.

<p>

The incentives will not emanate simply from the conventions
of the law schoools.  After all, if the Supreme Court itself has
now declared that a moral objection to homosexuality is indefensible,
irrational, the distillation of unreasoned prejudice or &quot;animus,&quot;
does the Court not in fact install the predicate for grievances
and litigation?  If a young, gay associate is denied standing
as a partner, could it not be claimed that the climate in the
firm was poisoned at the outset, or set in a discriminatory cast,
by the presence of senior partners who bore moral reservations
about homosexuality?  What can be said in this respect for law
firms could be said even more forcefully about the colleges and
universities.  Given the litigious experience these days in the
academy, we can virtually <b>count</b> on the fact that grievances will
be filed.  What if a member of an academic department has simply
done what I have done -- given public testimony, or published
articles, staking out a position or defending a moral judgment
on gay marriage?  Might that supply a <i>prima facie</i> ground for a
grievance later?  Might it not be argued--and will it not be argued
-- that the situation was at least biased, or tilted, at the outset
by the presence of that member of the Faculty?  Can we expect
then certain pressures, subtle and unsubtle, to separate those
members of the faculty from the decisions on tenure -- or hiring.
And might it finally be best to remove the problem at the root
simply by avoiding the hiring of people who bear these religious
and moral sentiments, which the Supreme Court has now declared
to be prejudicial and irrational, without any redeeming features?

<p>

In sum, the Court has fashioned, in <i>Romer v. Evans</i>, a powerful
new instrument.  That decision provides now a &quot;clean&quot;
device for blocking from the academy, and the professions, people
who are &quot;overly religious,&quot; overly serious about their
Christianity or Judaism, which is to say, people who take seriously
the traditional moral teachings of Christianity and Judaism.

<p>

The uses of this decision are portentous in their possibilities
-- which is why it is so critical that Congress takes the first
step in forcing the question.  For in acting, the Congress sharpens
the question for the Clinton administration.  Mr. Clinton has
already indicated that he will sign the Defense of Marriage Act
-- something, presumably, he would not do if he thought there
was anything unconstitutional in this measure.  But at the same
time, his spokesman has announced that the administration welcomed
the decision in <i>Romer v. Evans</i> as quite appropriate or justified.

<p>

In that event, the administration will be pressed to settle
the jural mind of Mr. Clinton:  Would the administration agree
with Prof. Eskridge and the people who would extract the broader
principle from <i>Romer</i> and use it to challenge the constitutionality
of the Defense of Marriage Act?  If so, then presumably President
Clinton would veto this act as unconstitutional.  But if the President
is still inclined to sign the act, if he is inclined then to defend
its constitutionality, then his administration would be obliged
to show just where the gay activists are wrong.  They could help
to establish then just how the decision in <i>Romer</i> could be narrowed
and limited.  If the administration could do that, it would be
rendering, almost in spite of itself, a public service.  And if
the Congress induced the administration to perform that service,
then this Defense of Marriage Act will produce a good that moves
well beyond the question of marriage in the laws.

<p>

But I would return, in closing, to the problem I mentioned at the 
beginning of these remarks, the problem posed by Congressman Frank. I 
said that the sky would not fall in, there may be no signs of deterioriation
in the neighborhood, as a consequence of recognizing a gay marriage,
but that kind of evidence was rather beside the point.  We were
dealing here with certain questions of principle, and with harms
that may not be measured with immediate, material injuries.  Those
questions involved the grounds of principle that underly the laws
on marriage, and the ground on which we favor that structure of
commitment and lawfulness as the framework for begetting and nurturing
children.  Some of us drew attention to the problem of polygamy
as a place where those questions of principle may be sharply focussed.
But it also suggests the kinds of changes that may make a profound
difference for the character and fabric of our lives if the laws
of marriage begin to come apart.  During the hearings, Congressman
Frank's inclination was to treat these arguments with derision
and scoffing.  He was not aware of any national movement pressing
for the return of polygamy.  Mr. Ed Fallon, a legislator from
Iowa, had testified at the hearings in favor of gay marriage,
and when the problem of polygamy was posed to him by Congressman
Sensenbrenner, he remarked that polygamy simply &quot;wasn't a
big issue&quot; in his State.

<p>

But as I said, we had been raising
questions of principle, not making predictions about a new trend
toward polygamy.  Yet, the people who were inclined to dismiss
the matter so lightly were treating, with a certain nonchalance,
something that deserved to be treated with far more caution and
sobriety.  For as it happens, polygamy has persisted, in isolated
pockets in our own country, even in our own day.  For many years,
there have been centers of polygamy in southern Utah and northern
Arizona, which have proven intractable.  There were outbreaks
of violence in the late 70s, throughout the 80s, and on into the
90s, as the authorities carried out raids in an effort to repress
the practice.  Mr. Ed Fallon remarked, with offhandedness, that
polygamy just doesn't happen to be a big issue back in Iowa.
But it seems to have eluded this earnest man that polygamy doesn't
happen to be an issue in his State precisely because the law,
for many years, has cast up serious barriers to polygamy.  The
federal government once had to send troops into Utah as part of
the scheme to repress the practice.  If those barriers started
coming down, do we really think that our species is incapable
of manifesting an interest in that arrangement once again?

<p>

When the proponents of gay marriage show a flippant disregard then
for polygamy, they show not only a want of historical memory,
but a dimness of moral imagination. It does not apparently enter
their reckoning of the world that political movements are often
stirred on and channeled by &quot;principles.&quot;

<p>

Nor do they readily see that the argument for gay marriage would sweep 
away the impediments of the law that impede, among other things, the
interest in polygamy.  These innocent people, who casually dismiss
these prospects out of hand, are part of that tribe described
by Aristotle in the <i>Ethics</i>: Their defect of understanding &quot;is
not due to a lack of years but living the kind of life which is
a succession of unrelated emotional experiences.&quot;  As the
principles they are planting now work themselves out, and the
results kick in, these people, in their childish candor, will
be the first to record their surprise.  And to tell us, earnestly,
that they never expected things to go this far.

<h2>THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT:<br>
A SOCIAL WORKER'S VIEW</h2>

Brenda Destro, D.S.W.</center>

<p>

This speech was presented at a July 2, 1996 Capitol Hill briefing
regarding the Defense of Marriage Act.  The briefing was sponsored
by the Family Research Council.</i>

<p>

Good morning.  Today, I would like to discuss the following points:

<p><ul>

<li>Those who advance an agenda of homosexual rights and same-sex
relationships have shown little regard for the developmental needs
of preteens and teens.

<p>

<li>It is most evident in the design of sex education curricula
offered to 10- to 18-year-olds in most public schools throughout
our country.

<p>

<li>The subject of homosexuality, along with other topics, is
included in most sex education curricula more as the &quot;politically
correct&quot; thing to do, and not balanced with the cognitive,
emotional, social, and moral, needs of the children who participate
with harmful results.

<p>

<li>As homosexuality and same-sex relationships are further sanctioned,
then these topics will be given even greater recognition and a
higher profile in sex ed curricula.  This will result in more
harm, unless more recognition is given to teenage developmental
issues.

</ul><p>

Sex education contains many delicate and controversial topics,
such as homosexuality and same-sex relationships, which are not
presented with a lot of consideration to the developmental needs
of preteens/teens.  This puts these children at risk of problems
ranging from developmental delay to more serious emotional problems
or even physical harm.

<p>

Developmental theorists, such as Piaget, Erikson, Kohlberg, and
even Freud believe that there are distinct differences in personality,
in thinking, in socialization, and in morality among children
and adults of different ages.  The pattern by which each of us
goes through these stages is an individual, interrelated, and
interdependent process.  For the most part, each of us acquires
skills in a sequential manner.  Moving into one stage requires
the completion of the previous stage.  And, the absence of certain
skills, makes the learning of new 
behaviors much harder.  Most school curricula is designed around
the theories of Piaget, and to a lesser degree Erikson and Kohlberg.

<p>

Before I discuss the issue of homosexuality, let me give another
example of a less controversial topic in sex ed that is usually
presented in a manner that is not consistent with cognitive development
or the learning capabilities of preteens and teens:  decision-making.
Many sex ed curricula teach decision-making to children, ages
10-18, so that they make appropriate choices regarding their sexual
behavior.  They learn a model that helps them identify a problem,
develop options, assess options, and then make a decision.  Although
my first reaction, along with many parents, was that this is a
good thing for preteens and teens to learn, there is a problem.
Many preteens and teens are not able to think ahead, assess risk,
or fully consider the feelings of others.  Instead, they are more
likely to be self-centered, idealistic, present-oriented, and
impulsive.  The result is that these kids may be able to memorize
or learn the elements of a d-m model, but they are not likely
to use it.

<p>

But the problem is more serious than a teen or preteen not using
a d-m model.  It is a problem of expecting preteens and teens
to act like adults, when they should be acting like teens.  As
much as none of us like it, teens are supposed to be self-centered,
idealistic, and grounded in the present.  These characteristics
provide protection for the teen who is in the process of experimenting
with new ideas and behaviors.  Ultimately, they make mistakes,
but hopefully they learn from these mistakes.  It is much easier
to brush off mistakes when you are self-centered, present-oriented,
and oblivious to consequences.  The role of parents and adults
is to provide a structure that allows the teen to experiment consistent
with their capabilites, and then to be available to help them
learn from the experience.  What is taught in sex ed asks a child
to skip an important stage and try to make critical decisions
without the skills and guidance needed.  This expectation can
and does lure preteens and teens into high risk situation that
are beyond their current capabilities, placing them at risk of
an unwanted pregnancy or even AIDS.  What is needed is for the
child to experiment on a more gradual basis that does not overwhelm
them.  They should experiment, first, with safer tasks and gradually
learn to handle more risk, and always with the guidance of a parent
or other caring adult.

<p>

In the case of learning about homosexuality and same-sex relationships,
the potential for harm also exists.  These are topics that are
now commonly found in sex ed curricula offered through most junior
high and high schools as a result of the growing debate about
homosexuality.  But, as it's being taught, many of these teens
and preteens are entering a phase in their psychosocial development
where it is characteristic for a girls to have one close girlfriend
and boys to have one close boyfriend.  This is an important phase
in learning emotional intimacy that is critical to forming healthy
relationships.  Yet, there is no distinction made between the
two events in the sex ed curricula.

<p>

All of us, as children first learn emotional intimacy or closeness
in the family as we bond with mother, father, siblings, etc. 
As we reach puberty, we begin to reach outside the family to form
similar bonds with friends of the same sex, and then with groups
of friends of both sexes.  A healthy level of intimacy beomes
an important element of romantic relationships and sexual relationships
in marriage.  This process for the most part occurs in a sequential
fashion.  At each stage the child learns a new level of emotional
intimacy or closeness, if the child has acquired the necessary
skills in a non-threatening and non-sexual environment.  If they
skip a stage or experience a crisis in a stage, the negative aspects
of the stage will predominate making it difficult to handle the
tasks of the next stage.  One way to alleviate the problems is
to go back to that stage and complete the tasks.

<p>

So what happens to the preteens and teens who receive information
about homosexuality and same sex marriages at the same time that
they are bonding with their friends, around the ages of 11 to
14.  Probably for most preteens and teens, they is no harm because
of the support they have from family and friends who can help
them distinguish between the two events.  But for many children
with family or personal problems and no one to turn to for help,
there may be confusion.  That confusion can turn to a fear that
they may be homosexual, when they are not.  They may then turn
away from their friends and interrupt an important developmental
process.  In some cases, because of the confusion about this topic,
well-meaning but misguided counselors would even have these children
believe that they are homosexual, when they are not even sexually
mature.

<p>

As the debate continues and homosexuality and same-sex marriages
gain legitimacy, I foresee these topics gaining greater visibility
in sex ed curricula.  If it is not presented in the best interests
of children, but rather in the best interest of the homosexual
rights movement, there is potential for more harm.

<p>

Thank you.

<title>THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON EDUCATION OF HOMOSEXUAL 'MARRIAGE'</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">

<h2>THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON<br>
EDUCATION CURRICULA AND<br>
POLICY OF HOMOSEXUAL<br>
'MARRIAGE'</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
Linda Page</center>

<p>

This speech was presented at a July 2, 1996 Capitol Hill briefing
regarding the Defense of Marriage Act.  The briefing was sponsored
by the Family Research Council.</i>

<p>

The legal recognition of same-sex &quot;marriage&quot; has the
potential to wreak havoc on an already failing public education
system.  Without a doubt, it can fundamentally affect every aspect
of schooling for children.  It will only further erode the moral
base on which our society depends and which our young people so
desperately need.  How ironic that teachers are prohibited by
law from sharing their Christian faith, or school from even posting
a copy of the Ten Commandments at the same time that homosexuals
are radically attacking our bedrock institutions.  What message
are we giving to highly impressionable students regarding our
society's most crucial values?

<p>

Doesn't it signify that legally equating same-sex &quot;marriage&quot;
with our most important social institution is in direct contradiction
to the most deeply held beliefs and values of the overwhelming
majority of Americans?  When was democracy also redefined to mean
that the beliefs and standards of the majority must succumb to
the whims of a special interest group -- even when those whims
are devastatingly destructive to the common good?

<p>

I've been a classroom teacher, reading specialist, an early childhood
education coordinator, and principal in the public schools.  I've
taught first-graders as well as older students.  I've worked the
suburbs and in the inner cities.  I've seen countless programs
implemented throughout the years based on whatever the policymakers
decided schools should teach or on the latest government- or 
university-sponsored ideas. Whatever the latest education craze 
happened to be, educators have been pressured to jump on the bandwagon.

<p>

Phonics was displaced by whole language. &quot;Modern math&quot;
replaced an emphasis on mastery of computation and problem solving
skills.  Explicit sexual training replaced &quot;family life 
education.&quot;  Consider the recent
classic example of William Spady's Outcome Based Education developed
as Far West Regional Lab.  Hundreds of millions of dollars have
been spent using our children as guinea pigs and our classrooms
as labs for unproved educational notions.  Programs which are
in direct contradictions to the values of mainstream America have
been created using taxpayers' money and implemented wholesale
in the schools time and time again.

<p>

As we have progressively made our schools <I><B>less</B></I> about
academics -- only 41 percent of the time secondary students spend
in schools is on academic subjects -- we have virtually expunged
traditional core values from our curricula and textbooks.  The
most far-reaching and damaging method for accomplishing this ignominious
feat has been through the implementation of values clarifications
programs.  According to William Kilpatrick, &quot;For students
it has meant learning to question values they have scarcely acquired,
unlearning values taught at home, and concluding that questions
of right and wrong are always merely subjective.&quot;

<p>

Theodore Roosevelt once said, &quot;To educate a person in mind
and not in morals is to educate a menace to society.&quot;  When
combined whit the unrestrained pursuit of self-interest, the values
clarification approach, also known as the decision-making model,
is reaping results of violence, mayhem, and devastating of the
worst kind among our students.  Why would we even consider further
denigration of values which have stood the test of time and opt
instead for the ill-conceived supposition that all values are
equal?

<p>

<center><h3>POTENTIAL EFFECTS ON SCHOOL CURRICULA AND EDUCATION 
POLICY</h3></center>

<p>

Same-sex &quot;marriage&quot; recognized by law has the mind's
numbing potential to bring with it untold quantities of new and
ravaging educational mandates.  It is possible that classroom
teachers all over the country will be required to implement any
or all of a range of potential changes in our schools.  They might
include:

<ul><p>

<li>Providing new and more intensified self-esteem programs, with
a special homosexual emphasis.  Project 10 was founded by Dr.
Virginia Uribe in 1984 in LAUSD as the first openly homosexual
counseling program.  It also includes sensitivity training for
faculty and tactics to prevent &quot;homophobia&quot; within the
classroom.

<p>

<li>Teaching students that homosexuality is a positive choice.
Three key strategies in Project 10 materials &quot;for managing
heterosexism and homophobia in schooling&quot; are:  1) Include
lesbian and gay issues in curriculum; 2) Include readings which
address homosexual issues on required reading lists; and 3) Encourage
students to write about and discuss &quot;the ways in which homophobia
has impacted their lives.&quot; (Project 10 Handbook)

<p>

<li>An increased emphasis on teaching critical thinking skills
based on students' <I><B>feelings</B></I> about issues instead
of the facts.

<p>

<li>Orwellian &quot;doublespeak&quot; of many new vocabulary words
to accompany the new definition of family.

<p>

<li>Using newly-revised tests and textbooks which are politically-correct.
A 15-page segment in the 443-page <I>Children of the Rainbow</I>
curriculum titled, &quot;Fostering Positive Attitudes Toward Sexuality&quot;
was authored by lesbian Elissa Weindling at the request of the
Gay and Lesbian Teacher's Association.  As a lesbian herself,
she states that, &quot;Teachers of first-graders will have an
opportunity to give children a healthy sense of identity at an
early age.  Classes should include references to lesbian/gay people
in all curricular areas. . . .&quot;

<p>

<li>Teaching &quot;tolerance&quot; of homosexuality in the context
of school to work preparedness.

<p>

<li>Teaching state and national standards which support the value
of homosexual &quot;marriage&quot; while undermining traditional
values.

<p>

<li>Stronger moral relativism in all school programs.

<p>

<li>Teaching increasingly liberal, permissive sex education.

<p>

<li>Supporting students in the scorn of virtue and self-restraint
while promoting increased narcissism and self-gratification.

<p>

<li>Teaching the complete redefinition of the family in every
grade level and in every curricular area, beginning with kindergarten
and preschool students (since their social studies curriculum
is about the family).

<p>

<li>Teaching literature to which parents object.  (Selections
which could be included and required with the societal sanction
of same-sex &quot;marriage&quot; and the lifestyle which spawned
it should cause every parent to be alarmed.)

<p>

<li>Using more of the already-diminished academic time on social
engineering.

<p>

<li>Teaching new revisions in history which could encompass a
scope far more vast and revisionist than those in the original
proposed national history standards.

<p>

<li>Supporting the politically-correct reinvention of society
even while &quot;research has documented that children without
fathers more often have lower academic performance, more cognitive
and intellectual deficits, increased adjustment problems, and
higher risks for psychosexual development problems.&quot; (George
Rekers)

<p>

<li>Teaching students that whatever they <I><B>think</B></I> is
right or <I><B>feel</B></I> is right <I><B>is</B></I> right, instead
of teaching students genuine critical thinking which necessitates
learning to discern and express what is true -- to submit to truth
and to a set of absolutes.

<p>

<li>Teaching students circular reasoning where they start with
the desired premise and make statements to support it which &quot;prove&quot;
the issue as fact.

<p>

<li>Teaching segments of the <I>Children of the Rainbow</I> curriculum
which promote homosexuality beginning at the earliest levels of
schooling.  (The implementation of this &quot;experiment&quot;
caused a furor in New York City not many years ago with its use
of primary-level reading books such as <I>Heather Has Two Mommies</I>
and <I>Daddy's Roommate</I> which states that &quot;gay is just
another kind of love.&quot;  These books blatantly and frankly
promote same-sex parenting.)  What will happen to educators who
refuse to teach the new curricula endorsing same-sex &quot;marriage&quot;?

<p>

<li>Teaching major revisions in curricula for literature, reading,
health, sex education. P.E. and drama.

<p>

<li>Supporting extracurricular activities which accommodate gay
and lesbian dating. In May 1994, LAUSD authorized the first gay and 
lesbian prom in the country. (Michael Quintinella)

<p>

<li>Further undermining of parental values and beliefs with more
intensive erosion of the traditional rights of parents.  Same
sex marriage with the force of law will take the rights of parents
away to decide what their children are taught about homosexuality.

<p>

<li>Diluting character education programs to accommodate the new
value system.

<p>

<li>Implementing new state and national standards which present
homosexual marriage as equal to traditional family values.

</ul><p>

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>

<p>

At precisely the time when schools and society are recognizing
the serious need for character education -- for personal responsibility,
self-discipline and other core virtues -- the most important social
institution on our society is receiving the most serious threat
it has faced in recorded history.

<p>

When doing what <I>feels</I> good matters more than doing what
is right, character education based on absolutes and traditional
moral standards will become a complete misnomer.  Self-control
and responsibility for the greater good will be a contradiction
to the same-sex &quot;marriage&quot; value system.  Since absolutes
of right and wrong will be negated, cheating in schools and students
stealing from each other will also have to be &quot;tolerated,&quot;
among other &quot;values.&quot;

<p>

As Thomas Sowell has stated so well, &quot;To teach issues instead
of intellectual principles to school children is like teaching
calculus to people who have not yet learned arithmetic, or surgery
to people lacking the rudiments of anatomy or hygiene.  Worse,
it is teaching them to go ahead and perform surgery, without worrying
about boring details.&quot;

<p>

Our schools reverberate with violence, declining achievement,
and disrespect for authority.  Legalization of same sex marriage
will only further erode the morel underpinnings and the culture
of the family which has been a primary source of strength throughout
the history of this country and of western civilization.

<p>

At one time in the history of our country, education was virtually
synonymous with moral training.  The traditional virtues and cultural
mores were passed down from generation to generation because they
work.

<p>

Our students have been guinea pigs in Russian roulette with their
futures long enough.  Same-sex &quot;marriage&quot; is a result
of a destructive, narcissistic way of thinking and of 
&quot;value-neutral&quot; curriculums.  One can only shudder to 
consider the horrific possibilities which may occur on the sexuality 
continuum with the perpetuation of such policies.

<p>

Instead of &quot;tolerance and diversity&quot; training for teachers,
we need to implement training programs where educators learn the
noble facts about our country's history and how to teach them
to our students.  They need to become well-versed in the legal
parameters for teaching about religion and the values and virtues
which strengthen our society.

<p>

Amitai Etzioni in <I>The Spirit of Community</I> states, &quot;To
shore up the moral foundations of our society, we start with the
family.  Second in line are the schools.  They are more than places
in which people acquire skills and knowledge....Education includes
the reinforcement of values gained at home and the introduction
of values to those children whose parents neglected their character
formation and moral upbringing.  Third are the social webs that
communities provide in neighborhoods, at work, and in ethnic clubs
and associations....Fourth, the national society must ensure that
local communities will not lock in values that we ars a more encompassing
and overriding community, abhor...&quot;

<p>

He states further, &quot;In the 50s we had a well-established
society, but it was unfair to women and minorities and a bit authoritarian.
In the 60s we undermined the established society and its values.
In the 80s we were told that the unbridled pursuit of self-interest
was virtuous.  By the 90s we have seen the cumulative results.&quot;

<p>

Where do we go from here?  The destruction of one of our most
vital institutions is threatened.  We must protect our children
now.

<h2>DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT:<br>
HOW ADOPTION POLICY IS<br>
AFFECTED</h2>

<p>

<i>This speech was presented at a July 2, 1996 Capitol Hill briefing
regarding the Defense of Marriage Act.  The briefing was sponsored
by the Family Research Council.</i>

<p>

Whenever there is a discussion of adoption it is generally useful
to remind the audience of the purpose of adoption.  In the United
States, adoption has traditionally been an institution to create
families for children when their biological families could not
or would not raise them.  The law has been very careful to ensure
that adoptive families are treated the same, for all intents and
purposes, as families who gave birth to their children.  In addition,
the law also requires that the child be at the center of all adoption
policy and practice.  Unfortunately, in recent years, some who
have attempted to reform adoption laws and policies are not addressing
the needs of children, but instead are promoting the cause of
adults.  Discussions about &quot;right to adopt&quot; are clearly
not child-centered, but adult-driven.

<p>

Adoption law varies substantially from state to state in matters
relative to time frames for taking consents or overturning adoption
decrees.  But the states are unanimous on one point:  an adoption
cannot be granted  by a judge unless it is proven to be in the
best interest of the child.  While there may be a difference of
opinion about what is in the best interest of a particular child,
the law is clear that it is the child that matters, not the adults.

<p>

Except for a very few exceptions, adoption law and policy has
attempted to stay away from categorizing who can and cannot adopt.
The exceptions generally would be limited to prohibiting persons
with a history of abuse or crime from adopting.  In addition,
Florida and New Hampshire prohibited by statute homosexuals from
adopting.  In virtually every other state, until recently, the
law has allowed only married couples or a single individual to
adopt.  The reason  for this policy, which I believe is sound,
is that the state believed that adults should make a legal commitment
to each other before making the commitment to a child to ensure stability
for the child.  A true family, which adoption is intended to create,
cannot exist if the only legal relationship between the parties
exists through the child only.

<p>

While it is true that this policy has prevented two homosexuals
from adopting a child, it also has prevented unmarried heterosexuals.
There have been exceptions to the rule as individual courts have
allowed adoptions by unrelated adults to proceed.  One of the
more celebrated cases is the Woody Allen/Mia Farrow adoptions.
Obviously, if states begin to recognize marriage between homosexuals,
it will likely become easier for two homosexuals to adopt a child
because they will be meeting the marriage requirement.

<p>

However, while it is true that a judge must give final approval
to an adoption once he or she determines it to be in the best
interest of the child, the real decision making generally occurs
at an earlier point by the individual or agency making the placement.
While few of us would want social service agencies to arbitrarily
prevent appropriate people from being able to adopt, I do believe
that we must be very careful about suggesting that any individuals
or groups should have the right to adopt.

<p>

There is no &quot;right&quot; to adopt and to create one would
be contrary to the best interests of children because instead
of finding the most appropriate family for a child, the state
and its agents would have to ensure that adults are allowed to
adopt a child.  Since a &quot;right&quot; is a guarantee, the
state would be required to &quot;guarantee&quot; a child for adoption.
The absurdity of that position is obvious.  Yet, I am troubled
by discussions in recent years by some who are promoting &quot;gay
rights&quot; who are proposing that there ought to be a right
to adopt.

<p>

Instead, decisions about children should be made based on an individual
child's needs, taking into account any existing relationships
the child may have.  We have a growing body of evidence which
shows the damage done to children who are raised without fathers.
Much of that research emphasizes the differences in parenting
styles between mothers and fathers and shows that each is important
for the healthy development of children.  It is clear that it
is not an issue of quantity when it comes to parenting.  A child
who is raised by his mother and grandmother, may have tow parents
for all intents and purposes to share the load, but the absence
of a father is still very apparent in his development.

<p>

There is no denying that many children raised by single parents
and children raise by homosexuals are doing very well.  But the
child who is raised by a mother and a father has an easier time
of it and has the opportunity to experience and model the behaviors
of both sexes.

<p>

In adoption, it has traditionally been the responsibility of the
field and the state to stack the deck in favor of the child. 
Many policies appear to be unfair to adults, but again adoption
is not about  adults.  For example, many individuals balk at the
notion that adopting parents should be in good health arguing
that many individuals who give birth have chronic health conditions
or that none of us knows when we might be hit by a car.

<p>

While both of those arguments are valid, it is the obligation
of the social worker or agency to weigh the odds in favor of the
child.  It is more likely that healthy parents will be around
to see a child grow to maturity than a parent with a serious medical
condition.  So, too, policies which give preference to married
heterosexuals stack the deck in favor of the child.  While it
may be true that in certain cases, where an individual has a relationship
with a particular child or has a special gift to match the special
needs of a particular child, it is in the best interest of a child
to be adopted by a single person, whether heterosexual or homosexual.

<p>

But, if we truly are looking at the best interest of the and not
concerned about the appearance of being tolerant of adults, we
will select whenever possible, a mother and a father for child.
Kids do not care about being politically correct.  They just
want a mommy and a daddy.

<title>'HOMOSEXUAL CORRECTNESS' ADVANCES IN AMERICA'S SCHOOLS</title>

<body>

<h2>'HOMOSEXUAL CORRECTNESS'<br>
ADVANCES IN AMERICA'S SCHOOLS</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
Peter LaBarbera</center>

<p>

This presentation was given at a July 2, 1996 briefing on Capitol
Hill regarding the Defense of Marriage Act (DOMA).  The briefing
was sponsored by the Family Research Council.</i>

<p><br>

<center>&quot;Marriages between homosexuals should be recognized....<br>
We must accept a homosexual orientation in young people in the same<br>
manner we accept a heterosexual orientation....&quot;</center>

<p>

These are two recommendations by gay activist Paul Gibson in his
paper, &quot;Gay Male and Lesbian Youth Suicide,&quot; which is
being used to promote &quot;gay friendly&quot; policies in schools
nationwide.  Recent months and years have witnessed the beginnings
of an unprecedented campaign by homosexual activists to affirm
homosexuality and so-called &quot;gay youth&quot; in schools.
This effort, advanced on a hundred fronts from Utah to New Hampshire,
has made steady gains while the nation's attention is focused
on another radical homosexual goal: legalizing gay &quot;marriage.&quot;

<p>

The campaign to teach schoolchildren and teens that &quot;gay
is OK&quot; benefits from the usual coordination of a united &quot;gay&quot;
movement which has the advantage of pressing for a <I>single radical
goal</I>, versus its pro-family opponents who face a multiplicity
of challenges.  Parents who simply want a good education for their
children are increasingly confronted with the prospect of seeing
precious educational resources spent on talking about homosexuality,
and they are drawn into time-consuming and divisive debates over
this issue.

<p>

Of course, the questions of homosexuality instruction in schools
and &quot;gay marriage&quot; are linked, as homosexual activists
and their educational allies argue that students need to be presented
with &quot;positive&quot; images of &quot;gay role models&quot;
to counter the negative representations of &quot;homophobic&quot;
society.  What could be more positive than teaching children that
-- just like heterosexuals -- gays and lesbians get married and
raise children?

<p>

As surely as summer follows spring, legal homosexual &quot;marriage&quot;
would quickly be seized upon by pro-gay educators as the latest
teaching tool to inculcate the normalcy of homosexuality to young 
minds.  How young?  The publishers of the latest homosexual children's 
book, &quot;Daddy's Wedding&quot; tell us it is &quot;appropriate 
for children ages 2 to 6.&quot; The book uses colorful pictures to 
tell the story of a young boy, Nick, who is &quot;best man&quot; at 
the &quot;wedding&quot; ceremony between his &quot;gay&quot; daddy 
and his homosexual lover. One page shows the men kissing at the altar 
as young Nick looks on.  &quot;Daddy's Wedding&quot; is published by the 
same company that gave us &quot;Heather Has Two Mommies&quot; and 
&quot;Daddy's Roommate.&quot;

<p>

<center><h3>THE &QUOT;GAY YOUTH&QUOT; CAMPAIGN AND &QUOT;SAFE 
SCHOOLS&QUOT;</h3></center>

<p>

Efforts to affirm so-called homosexual youth advance under the
rubric of promoting &quot;diversity&quot; and enhancing 
&quot;self-esteem&quot; -- two fads in today's faltering public 
schools.  The campaign rests on several tendentious suppositions 
that have barely begun to be fully debated by larger society, 
foremost among them is the myth that a certain percentage of kids 
have a &quot;gay&quot; (or <I>lesbian, bisexual or transgendered</I>) 
&quot;identity&quot; which they were likely born with, and which is 
unchangeable. Educators are tasked with affirming such children and 
helping them cope in the midst of a homophobic culture.

<p>

With this goal in mind of shoring up the &quot;gay minority&quot;
of students, gay activists have chosen a strategy of promoting,
not homosexuality, they say, but &quot;safe schools.&quot;  The
cunning strategy relies heavily on winning public sympathy for
&quot;gay youth&quot; as a besieged victim group in schools. 
It was  best outlined in a recent speech by Kevin Jennings, a
homosexual and former high school teacher who is now executive
director of the Gay, Lesbian and Straight Teachers Network (GLSTN),
a 3,000-member organization crusading against &quot;homophobia&quot;
in schools.  Listen to Jennings describe how the &quot;safe schools&quot;
approach helped cripple the pro-family opposition and win passage
in Massachusetts of a 1994 law -- the first of its kind in the
nation -- banning &quot;discrimination&quot; in public schools
based on &quot;sexual orientation:&quot;

<p><blockquote>

<i>We immediately seized upon the opponents' calling card -- safety
-- and explained how homophobia represents a threat to students'
safely by creating a climate where violence, name-calling, health
problems, and suicide are common....We knew that, confronted with
real-life stories of youth who had suffered from homophobia, our
opponents would automatically be on the defensive:  they would
have to attack people who had already been victimized once, which
put them in a bully position from which it would be hard to emerge
looking good.</i>

</blockquote><p>

Keeping the above victim imagery in mind, it is easy to envision
pro-gay educators teaching their youthful subjects that the inability
of homosexuals to get married is just one more in a litany of
&quot;civil rights&quot; denied to homosexuals.  Hopefully this
will not be offered as part of a history course in the near or
distant future.

<p>

<center><h3>THE SUICIDE SCAM</h3></center>

<p>

Homosexual activists have shamelessly exploited the issue of &quot;gay
youth&quot; suicide to promote pro-homosexuality programs in schools,
hyping a non-existent &quot;epidemic&quot; to silence their critics
and frame the debate before an emotionally sympathetic public.
As Jennings said, &quot;In Massachusetts, no one could speak
up against our frame and say, 'Why yes, I do think students should
kill themselves.'  This allowed us to set the terms of the debate.&quot;

<p>

There are two major problems with Jennings' assertion.  Firstly,
his claim of a rash of &quot;gay youth&quot; suicides is baseless,
and relies mainly on a thoroughly discredited paper by a homosexual
activist.  Secondly, even it were true that self-perceived 'homosexuals'
are prone to commit suicide in higher numbers than other youth,
it does not mean that schools should be <I>confirming</I> young
teens in an immoral and dangerous lifestyle.  In fact, disproportionate
rates of (adult) suicide in even the most &quot;gay-friendly&quot;
areas like San Francisco indicate that this is yet another sad
fact of homosexual life, not the fault of society.  As Alan Medenger,
a former homosexual, says, &quot;It is tragic, even criminal,
to lead a child into homosexuality because he or she showed some
degree of sexual confusion in adolescence.&quot;

<p>

And yet confirming &quot;gay youth&quot; in their homosexuality
is precisely the goal of GLSTN and countless other homosexual
organizations who routinely repeat the claim that homosexual youth
make up one-third of all youth suicides.  The figure has its origins
in a paper San Francisco gay activist Paul Gibson wrote that was
part of an Health and Human Services report on youth suicide.
Gibson's report, which was repudiated by HHS Secretary Louis
Sullivan, made the claim that &quot;gay youth&quot; made up &quot;30
percent&quot; of all youth suicides by extrapolating from another
bogus &quot;gay&quot; number -- that homosexuals represent 10
percent of the population.  David Shaffer, a Columbia University
psychiatrist and one of the world's leading specialists on adolescent
suicide, said, &quot;I struggled for a long time over [Gibson's]
mathematics, but in the end it seemed more hocus-pocus than math.&quot;
Shaffer also wrote that Gibson's and others' claims that gay
suicide is common is &quot;an excellent example of how bad research
provides misleading answers that can come home to roost.&quot;

<p>

To illustrate the tendentious nature of Paul Gibson's &quot;research,&quot;
it is useful to examine some of his other claims and recommendations
found in the paper he submitted to HHS and later repudiated by
Secretary Sullivan:

<p><blockquote>

<i>&quot;A substantial number of youth -- perhaps one in 10 --
have a primary gay male, lesbian or bisexual orientation....&quot;

<p>

&quot;Transsexual youth who are open about their identity face
extreme abuse and rejection from their families....The only known
course of treatment is to help transsexuals adjust to their believed
gender identity and obtain sex-assignment surgery.  Most transsexual
youth, however, are unable to obtain or afford the help they need
in resolving their identity conflicts...&quot;

<p>

&quot;Homosexuality...is a natural and healthy expression of
human sexuality...All youth need to be presented with positive
information about homosexuality that presents it as a viable adaptation....It
is important for schools to hire openly gay male and lesbian teachers
to serve as role models and resource people for gay youth.&quot;

<p>

&quot;Religions need to reassess homosexuality in a positive
context within their belief systems....Religions should also take
responsibility for providing their families and membership with
positive information about homosexuality that discourages the
oppression of lesbians and gay men.  Faiths that condemn homosexuality
should recognize how they contribute to the rejection of gay youth
by their families and suicide among lesbians and gay male youth.&quot;</i>

</blockquote><p>

So, the next time you hear a homosexual activist claim that a
&quot;government study&quot; found that 30 percent of all youth
suicides are committed by homosexuals, remember that the same
gay activist who produced that &quot;study&quot; also calls for
reaching out to &quot;transsexual youth&quot; and says religions
need to shed their homophobia.

<p>

<center><h3>OTHER PRO-GAY PROGRAMS IN SCHOOLS</h3></center>

<p>

Beyond hyping suicide as a justification for homosexual-affirming
policies in schools, gay educators and their allies are promoting
a variety of other strategies to accomplish their goal of normalizing
homosexuality, among them:

<p><ul>

<li>Promoting the celebration of &quot;Gay History Month&quot;
in schools to provide students with positive homosexual role models.
In these programs, notables like First Lady Eleanor Roosevelt
are often portrayed factually as &quot;gay&quot; without giving
contradictory historical evidence.  Even if such figures did have
homosexual tendencies, many question why this aspect of their
lives should be stressed in history lessons.  Brilliance is, sadly,
often accompanied by destructive behavior.  Certainly quite an
impressive list of historical notables could be compiled if it
were to be decided that schools should celebrate &quot;Alcoholic
History Month&quot; or &quot;Adulterers History Month.&quot;

<p>

<li>Creating &quot;gay-straight&quot; youth alliances in high
schools, which frequently become conduits for pro-homosexual propagandizing
to student bodies. In the conservative town of Dedham, Massachusetts,
this was done with taxpayer monies as parents were stunned to
learn that a &quot;gay-straight&quot; alliance (which they didn't
even know existed) had received $2,000 in state funds to distribute
a questionnaire on &quot;gay&quot; issues to all homerooms at
the local high school.  One of the survey's questions was, &quot;Do
you feel lesbian or gay people should be allowed to marry?&quot;
It goes without saying that &quot;gay-straight&quot; youth groups
play perfectly to a youngster's tendency to adopt political positions
contrary to those of his or her parents.  Hence rallying behind
the &quot;civil rights&quot; of fellow &quot;gay&quot; students
wins ample student support and will be fully exploited by adult
homosexual activist groups like GLSTN.

<p>

<li>Affirming the right of openly homosexual teachers to proudly
affirm their gay &quot;identity&quot; to schoolchildren.  One
lesbian teacher recently made headlines by using a pink triangle
to inform students that her class was a &quot;safe zone&quot;
for &quot;gays.&quot;  Parents were not informed of the decision.
GLSTN held five regional conferences for homosexual teachers
during the 1996-96 school year. At one such conference in Los
Angeles, lesbian activist Donna Redwing declared, &quot;We're
here, we're queer, we're in the classroom.&quot;  The assembled
GLSTN-affiliated teachers cheered Redwing's declaration.  Hence
GLSTN conferences serve to radicalize homosexual teachers, making
them more likely to openly promote homosexuality as something
positive (or at least benign or neutral) to their students when
they return to their classrooms.

<p>

<li>Address the issue of how to combat &quot;homophobic&quot;
attitudes in young schoolchildren (kindergarten through sixth-grade).
The homosexual activist group GLAAD (Gay and Lesbian Alliance
Against Defamation) recently called on the FCC to demand that
children's television (&quot;Ernie and Bert,&quot; etc.) be used
to teach children about the &quot;horrors of homophobia.&quot;

</ul><p>

Homosexual activists are deadly serious about using the education
process to teach kids that homosexuality is okay, and that anyone
who thinks otherwise is a &quot;bigot.&quot;  If parents are not
vigilant in ferreting out such propaganda and countering it, they
will witness the rise of a generation hostile to five millennia
of Judeo-Christian teaching proscribing homosexual behavior.

<title>THE DEFENSE OF MARRIAGE ACT: EXPERT TESTIMONY</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">

<h2>THE DEFENSE OF<br>
MARRIAGE ACT:<br>
EXPERT TESTIMONY</h2></center>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>The following are excerpts from a July 2, 1996 Capitol Hill
briefing regarding the Defense of Marriage Act.  The briefing
was sponsored by the Family Research Council.</i>

<p>

<center><h3>RESEARCH</h3></center>

<p>

&quot;Two profoundly mistaken ideas have sunk deeply into public
sentiment where they exert a powerful influence in the shaping
of public policy as it relates to family, sexuality and marriage.
These are: 1) That homosexuality is genetic, and that consequently,
2) Homosexuality is unchangeable.  Neither idea is true, and in
fact there is a mountain of scientific evidence to the contrary.
The Americans being most severely harmed by the propagation of
these untruths are the very large number of homosexuals who wish
nothing more than to rid themselves of these unwanted impulses
and establish quiet marriages and families.  The gay and lesbian
activism that claims to speak for these many struggling fellow
citizens speaks for their interests in no way whatsoever.  Completely
ignored are the very large number of people who have already succeeded
in leaving homosexuality behind....Epidemiologists around the
country have confirmed that among young gay men there is a significant
return to the unsafest of sexual practices in spite of over fifteen
years of massively-funded education programs.  They have also
found that a shocking 30 percent of all currently 20-year-old
young men who identify themselves as 'gay' will be either HIV-positive
or dead of AIDS by the time they are 30. Yet, as is widely known
and confirmed by recent research, many of these young men will
spontaneously leave homosexuality behind....With respect to genetics,
even those recent studies widely touted as demonstrating the innate,
biological and genetically determined nature of homosexuality
demonstrate precisely the contrary, and a careful reading of the
authors themselves makes this clear.&quot; -- <I>Jeffrey B. Satinover,
M.D., psychiatrist, former Fellow in Psychiatry and Child Psychiatry
at Yale University, and author of</I> Homosexuality and the Politics
of Truth.

<p>

<center><h3>THE LAW AND MARRIAGE</h3></center>

<p>

&quot;Every argument for gay marriage is an argument that would
support polygamy.  The gay activists may not have the remotest
interest in promoting polygamy, but this much may fairly be said: They 
have the most profound interest, rooted in the logic of their doctrine,
in discrediting the notion that marriage finds its defining ground
in 'nature.'  Their rhetorical strategy, their public arguments,
have all been directed explicitly to the derision of that claim
that sexuality in the strictest sense involves the sexuality 'imprinted
in our natures.'  For that reason, we can count on the fact that
there will be someone, somewhere, ready to press this issue by
raising a challenge in the court and testing the limits even further.
The irony then is that the notion of marriage cannot accommodate
couples of the same sex without so altering the cast or character
of marriage that it will cease to be that special relation, which
seems to be the object of such deep craving now for so many people.
Once the notion of marriage is broadened in that way, it will
simply not be tenable any longer to hold up marriage, in the laws,
as a relation that deserves a special place, a special commendation
-- a special effort to sustain and promote it.  This Act is the
most delicate and limited measure that the Congress could produce
on the subject.  It treats subjects that are evidently within
the reach of the Congress, and it makes the least intrusion into
the domain of State law.  What other institution could possibly
have the authority to clarify the meaning of terms in federal
legislation, if not the federal legislature?&quot; -- <I>Hadley

<center><h3>REAL RECOVERY</h3></center>

<p>

&quot;I speak to you today not just as an observer of this movement,
but as one of them.  I am a former homosexual.  I lived that lifestyle
from the time I was 17 until I was 26.  I entered the gay lifestyle
thinking that there really wasn't any choice for me.  What I didn't
realize is that although I didn't choose to be homosexual, I did
not have to be gay. I had a choice.  I could change my orientation
from gay to straight. My healing process was a long and difficult
one.  However, change is possible.  The four national ex-gay networks
are currently ministering to more than 10,000 former homosexuals.
Many of us are sick and tired of a lifestyle that initially seems
very freeing but eventually puts us in all kinds of bondage and
eventually will kill us. I have lost over 35 of my friends and
acquaintances to the disease of AIDS and don't want to see one
more person become infected with this deadly disease.  The organized
gay community is telling us that AIDS is no longer a gay disease
and, although it is spreading into the heterosexual population
in this country very quickly, 61 percent of people that are coming
down with this deadly disease in the U.S. are homosexual, according
to the Centers for Disease Control in Atlanta.  America must take
a very strong stand against the very highly organized gay community
in this country by supporting The Defense of Marriage Act.  If
we don't say 'no' to the organized gay community now, the United
States will suffer the consequences of our complacency.  America
needs to start helping homosexuals recover from their sexual brokenness.
Putting a stamp of approval on a lifestyle by legally recognizing
it (and even calling it marriage) is not really helping homosexuals.
It's perpetuating a myth and delivering them over to a death-style.&quot;
-- <I>Anthony Falzarano, former homosexual, executive director
of Transformation Ministries.</I>

<p>

<center><h3>THE GAY RIGHTS AGENDA</h3></center>

<p>

&quot;Most Americans believe in the philosophy of 'live and let
live.'  They don't want to make the plight of homosexuals any
more difficult than it already is.  But tolerance is not what
homosexual activists are seeking.  They are demanding that society
elevate homosexuality to the moral level of marriage.  When they
bring the law into it, they are no longer just minding their own
business, but imposing it on every single citizen.  If you are
a devout Christian, Jew or Muslim, or merely someone who believes
homosexuality is immoral and harmful, and the law declares homosexuality
a protected status, then your personal beliefs are now outside
civil law.  This has very serious implications, for if the law
declares opposition to homosexuality as bigotry, then the entire
power of the civil rights apparatus can be brought against you.
Businessmen will have to subsidize homosexuality or face legal
sanctions; schoolchildren will have to be taught that homosexuality
is the equivalent of marital love; religious people will be told
their beliefs are no longer valid, and their independence will
be challenged....The Boy Scouts of America are under legal attack
in the states which have special rights for 'sexual orientation.'
The Scouts, a private group, are being told to abandon their
moral code of more than 80 years and to place young boys under
homosexual men on camping trips -- or face financial ruin.  The
attack against the Scouts is really an attack on parents, because
parents have the right, in a free nation, to entrust their children
to organizations that reflect the parents' most deeply held beliefs.
If they cannot do this, then we are living in tyranny.&quot;
-- <I>Robert H. Knight, director of cultural studies at the Family
Research Council.</I>

<p>

<center><h3>THE MYTH OF 'GAY TEEN SUICIDE'</h3></center>

<p>

&quot;Homosexual activists have shamelessly exploited the issue
of 'gay youth' suicide to promote pro-homosexuality programs in
schools, hyping a non-existent 'epidemic' to silence their critics
and frame the debate before an emotionally sympathetic public.
As (homosexual and former high school teacher Kevin) Jennings
recently said, 'In Massachusetts, no one could speak up against
our frame and say, &quot;Why yes, I do think students should kill
themselves.&quot;  This allowed us to set the terms of the debate.'
(Editor's note:  Jennings is now executive director of the Gay,
Lesbian and Straight Teacher's Network, or GLSTN, a 3,000-member
organization crusading against &quot;homophophia&quot; in schools.)
There are two major problems with Jennings' assertion.  Firstly,
his claim of a rash of 'gay youth' suicides is baseless, and relies
mainly on a thoroughly discredited paper by a homosexual activist.
Secondly, even it were true that self-perceived 'homosexuals'
are prone to commit suicide in higher numbers than other youth,
it does not mean that schools should be <I>confirming</I> young
teens in an immoral and dangerous lifestyle.  In fact, disproportionate
rates of (adult) suicide in even the most 'gay-friendly' areas
like San Francisco indicate that this is yet another sad fact
of homosexual life, not the fault of society....And yet confirming
'gay youth' in their homosexuality is precisely the goal of GLSTN
and countless other homosexual organizations who routinely repeat
the claim that homosexual youth make up one-third of all youth
suicides.  The figure has its origins in a paper San Francisco
gay activist Paul Gibson wrote that was part of a Health and Human 
Services report on youth suicide.  Gibson's report, which was repudiated 
by HHS Secretary Louis Sullivan, made the claim that 'gay youth' made
up '30 percent' of all youth suicides by extrapolating from another
bogus 'gay' number -- that homosexuals represent 10 percent of
the population.  David Shaffer, a Columbia University psychiatrist
and one of the world's leading specialists on adolescent suicide,
said, 'I struggled for a long time over [Gibson's] mathematics,
but in the end it seemed more hocus-pocus than math.'  Shaffer
also wrote that Gibson's and others' claims that gay suicide is
common is 'an excellent example of how bad research provides misleading
answers that can come home to roost.'&quot; -- <I>Peter LaBarbera,
editor and founder of</I> The Lambda Report on Homosexuality.

<center><h3>THE EFFECTS ON SAME-SEX FRIENDSHIPS</h3></center>

<p>

&quot;Many...(junior and high school) teens and preteens are entering
a phase in their psychosocial development where it is characteristic
for girls to have one close girlfriend and boys to have one close
boyfriend.  This is an important phase in learning emotional intimacy
that is crucial to forming healthy relationships....So what happens
to the preteens and teens who receive information about homosexuality
and same-sex 'marriages' at the same time that they are bonding
with their friends (around the ages of 11-14)...for many children
with family or personal problems and no one to turn to for help,
there may be confusion.  That confusion can turn to a fear that
they may be homosexual, when they are not.  They may then turn
away from their friends and interrupt an important developmental
process.  In some cases, because of the confusion about this topic,
well-meaning but misguided counselors would even have these children
believe that they are homosexual, when they are not even sexually
mature.&quot; -- <I>Brenda Destro, D.S.W., Adjunct Professor for
Studies on Marriage and Family at the John Paul II Institute and
former social work consultant for the U.S. Department of Health
and Human Services Office of Adolescent Pregnancy and the Institute
for Human Resources (IHR).</I>

<p>

<center><h3>NO 'RIGHT' TO ADOPT</h3></center>

<p>

&quot;Unfortunately, in recent years, some who have attempted
to reform adoption laws and policies are not addressing the needs
of children, but instead are promoting the cause of adults.  Discussions
about 'rights to adopt' are clearly not child-centered, but 
adult-driven....Obviously, if states begin to recognize marriage 
between homosexuals, it will likely become easier for two homosexuals to 
adopt a child because they will be meeting the marriage requirement....There
is no 'right' to adopt, and to create one would be contrary to
the best interests of children, because instead of finding the
most appropriate family for a child, the state and its agents
would have to ensure that adults are allowed to adopt a child.
Since a 'right' is a guarantee, the state would be required to
'guarantee' a child for adoption.  The absurdity of that position
is obvious.&quot; -- <I>Mary Beth Style, M.S.W., former vice president
for policy and practice of the National Council for Adoption.</I>

<p>

<center><h3>SEX EDUCATION</h3></center>

<p>

&quot;Our students have been guinea pigs in Russian roulette with
their futures long enough....Our kids will be bombarded with the
propaganda from books such as <I>Heather Has Two Mommies</I>....Same-sex
marriage is a result of a destructive, narcissistic way of thinking
and of 'value-neutral' curriculums.  One can only shudder to consider
the horrific possibilities which may occur on the sexuality continuum
with the perpetuation of such policies....We have communicated
to students that all values are equal.  How ludicrous...&quot;
-- <I>Linda Page, former school principal, education consultant,
talk show host and writer.</I>

<title>THE CASE FOR LIFE</title>

<h2>THE CASE FOR LIFE</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<i>by<br>
Gracie Hsu</center>

<p>

This speech was presented before the Washington Health Policy
Fellows Program of the American Medical Students Association on
June 20, 1996 in Washington, D.C.</i>

<p>

The first principle of the Hippocratic Oath is &quot;do no harm.&quot;
That pledge, which each of you will undoubtedly take before you
become full-fledged physicians, is grounded in the simple truth
that human life is valuable and precious at all stages of life
and that the high call of the physician is to help preserve, not
destroy, human life.  This could also be the motto of the pro-life
community, for it is that truth which motivates, indeed, compels
the pro-life community to do what we do.

<p>

And what is it that we do?  In the words of Proverbs 31, we &quot;speak
up for those who cannot speak for themselves.&quot;  On the individual
level, we help women who feel they have no other choice but to
abort their unborn children to choose a better, albeit not easy,
alternative.  We seek to minister to her emotional, spiritual,
physical, and financial needs because many women have expressed
the fact that they chose abortion because they lacked the resources
to meet these needs.  Indeed, the Alan Guttmacher Institute reports
that women usually choose abortion for three main reasons.  Three-fourths
of respondents say that having a baby would interfere with work,
school, or other responsibilities.  Two-thirds say say they cannot
afford to have a child.  Half of the respondents say they do not
want to be a single parent or that they have problems in their
relationship with their husband or partner.

<p>

Thus, the pro-life community strives to meet the needs of these
women through crisis pregnancy centers.  These centers help pregnant
women one woman at a time.  They find out her needs, and seek
to help her choose life for her unborn baby by aiding her either
through an adoption process or by providing the soon-to-be mother
with material goods such as maternity clothing and baby necessities.
Counselors provide emotional and often spiritual support and
are committed to helping that mother for as long as she needs.

<p>

On the policy level, we seek to influence members of Congress
to uphold laws that acknowledge the humanity of the unborn and
overturn those laws which do not respect the moral opposition that the 
public holds against abortion.  Banning partial-birth abortions and 
amending the abortion mandate for medical school accreditation are just
two examples of our efforts during this 104th Congress.  I will
address each of these initiatives in more detail later on in the
presentation.

<p>

For right now, though, the most important thing that I want to
communicate to you is why pro-lifers do what we do.  There are
three main reasons which can broadly be stated this way:  (1)
Abortion takes the lives of unborn children; (2) Abortion hurts
women; and (3) Abortion is detrimental to society.

<p>

I realize that those are broad generalizations, but I'd like to
delve into each aspect individually here, in more detail.  We'll
tackle the first aspect first:  Abortion takes the lives of unborn
children.  This is the most well-known of the three arguments.
I'm sure you're all familiar with the saying that &quot;abortion
stops a beating heart.&quot;  Well, it does.  With the development
of modern technology and advancements in the fields of embryology
and perinatology, the public is being made more aware that a fetus
is far from &quot;a blob of tissue,&quot; but rather an unborn
human being which bears great resemblance to, nothing less than,
a baby.  Although this should not be news to you as medical students,
for many, the perception that abortion only removes a &quot;blob
of tissue&quot; persists.  At least one feminist has said that
the reason pro-choicers cling to that belief is because it makes
abortion more comfortable, more justifiable, if it can be grounded
in the denial that the fetus is really a baby.

<p>

Regardless of what people choose to think, though, abortion does
indeed take the lives of unborn children.  It was a realization
like this one, in fact, which gave Norma McCorvey, the &quot;Roe&quot;
of <I>Roe v. Wade</I>, pause to begin reconsidering her position
on abortion.  As Ms. McCorvey tells it, she looked at a whole
row of empty park swings one day and asked herself, &quot;Where
are all the children?&quot;  She suddenly thought, &quot;Oh no!
They've all been aborted!&quot;  This was the beginning of Ms.
McCorvey's journey towards a pro-life perspective.  Today, Ms.
McCorvey has not only disavowed her pro-choice stance, but she
has also become 100 percent pro-life.  She believes that life
should be protected at all stages, from conception until natural
death.

<p>

The second reason why pro-lifers do what we do is because abortion
hurts women.  As the previous example of Norma McCorvey shows,
many women are haunted by abortion, a condition now known as post-abortion
grief or trauma.

<p>

Another person who could tell you about post-abortion grief is
someone you would not expect.  Naomi Wolf, a self-proclaimed pro-choice
feminist wrote a brutally candid article in <I>The New Republic</I>
entitled, &quot;Our Bodies, Our Souls.&quot;  In it, she writes
about a Cornell-educated cardiologist who said:

<p><blockquote>

<i>I had an abortion when I was a single mother and my daughter
was 2 years old.  I would do it again.  But you know how in the
Greek myths when you kill a relative you are pursued by furies?
For months, it was as if baby furies were pursuing me.</i>

</blockquote><p>

This being pursued by &quot;baby furies&quot; is a common symptom
of post-abortion grief, as counselors from Project Rachel will
tell you.  Project Rachel, a post-abortion healing ministry, helps
both men and women find healing and forgiveness from their feelings
of loss and guilt.

<p>

The numbers of women who are experiencing this grief and who are
now willing to talk about it is reaching a critical mass.  That
is not altogether surprising considering the fact that 1.5 million
abortions take place in the United States every year.  (That's
more than 4,100 abortions every day.)  That amounts to a lot of
women who are hurting and grieving not only for the child they
have lost, but also over the weight of their own guilt.  Counselors
at crisis pregnancy centers are overwhelmed at the numbers of
women who come to them for post-abortion counseling.  These counselors
do their best to provide comfort to post-abortive mothers in their
grief, helping them find healing rather than internalizing their
guilt.

<p>

Men also suffer from post-abortion grief. <I>The Washington Post</I>
recently published an extraordinary first-person article by one
of its regular staff writers entitled, &quot;Remembering Thomas.&quot;
Phil McCombs writes:

<p><blockquote>

<i>When the abortion was performed, I was out of town on business
too.  I made sure of that.  Whatever physical, emotional and spiritual
agony the woman suffered, I was not by her side to support her.
I turned my face away.  My behavior was in all respects craven,
immoral.

<p>

For some instinctual reason, or just imaginatively, I've come
to believe that it was a boy, a son whom I wanted killed because,
at the time, his existence would have inconvenienced me. I'd
had my fun.  He didn't fit into my plans.

<p>

His name, which is carved on my heart, was Thomas.</i>

</blockquote><p>

The writer continues:

<p><blockquote>

<i>I feel like a murderer -- which isn't to say that I blame anyone
else, or think anyone else is a murderer.

<p>

It's just the way I feel, and all the rationalizations in the
world haven't changed this.  I still grieve for little Thomas.
It is an ocean of grief.  From somewhere in the distant past
I remember the phrase from Shakespeare, &quot;the multitudinous
seas incarnadine.&quot;

<p>

When I go up to the river on vacation this summer, he won't
be going boating with me on the lovely old wooden runabout that
I can't really afford to put in the water but can't bring myself
to discard, either.

<p>

He won't be lying on the grass by the tent at night, looking
at the starry sky and saying, &quot;What's that one called, Dad?&quot;

<p>

Because there was no room on the Earth for Thomas.

<p>

He's dead.</i>

</blockquote><p>

Phil McCombs found solace from his grief through Eileen C. Marx,
formerly communications director for Cardinal James A. Hickey
of Washington and now a columnist for Catholic publications.
He was able to undergo a &quot;healing process of recognition,
grieving and ultimately forgiveness.&quot;

<p>

Another way in which abortion hurts women is that it separates
men from their pregnant wives or girlfriends during the critical
time when many women most need their support.  Abortion has contributed
to the sense that women are alone in their decision-making.  This
is what happened to Thomas' mother.  Feeling a sense of abandonment,
many women choose abortion because they feel that they have no
other choice but abortion.   Indeed, the law states that abortion
is purely a decision between a woman and her 
doctor -- no spousal consent, no parental consent (in many cases).
As a result, though the father of that child is just as responsible
for helping to create the growing life in her womb, he is forbidden
from taking measures to save his child's life if the mother chooses
abortion.  On the flip side, he's also removed from bearing responsibility
for his child should she decide to keep the child.  He can very
easily say that if he gets a woman pregnant, it is of no consequence
to him.  Why should he feel any obligation to marry her or to
support that child if it is born?  After all, she could have gotten
an abortion.

<p>

Third, abortion is detrimental to society.  Abortion has changed
our perception about unborn life, hardening both men and women
to view a pregnancy first through the selfish lenses which ask
the question, &quot;How does this pregnancy help or harm <I>me</I>,
<I>my</I> future, <I>my</I> life?&quot;  Again, I will quote from
Naomi Wolf's piece, &quot;Our Bodies, Our Souls&quot; in <I>The
New Republic</I>:

<p><blockquote>

<i>The pro-life warning about the potential of widespread abortion
to degrade reverence for life does have a nugget of truth:  a
free-market rhetoric about abortion can, indeed, contribute to
the eerie situation we are now facing, wherein the culture seems
increasingly to see babies not as creatures to whom parents devote
their lives but as accoutrements to enhance parental quality of
life.  Day by day, babies seem to have less value in themselves,
in a matrix of the sacred, than they do as products with a value
dictated by a market economy.

<p>

Stories surface regularly about &quot;worthless&quot; babies
left naked on gratings or casually dropped out of windows, while
&quot;valuable&quot; genetically correct babies are created at
vast expense and with intricate medical assistance for infertile
couples.  If we fail to treat abortion with grief and reverence,
we risk forgetting that, when it comes to the children we choose
to bear, we are here to serve them -- whomever they are:  they
are not here to serve us.</i>

</blockquote><p>

Although a direct causal link cannot be made between the increase
in child abuse and abortion, there certainly is an association
between the two.  Since abortion became legal, the incidence of
child abuse has dramatically increased and the degree of abuse
has steadily worsened.  Perhaps it is because the two do share
a common philosophy that children exist for the parents' convenience
rather than as wards in need of parental protection and nurturance.

<p>

Each of these three broadly-defined reasons -- abortion kills
unborn human beings, abortion hurts women, and abortion is detrimental
to civilized society -- continues to resonate within the hearts
of most of us, even though like many of you, I have never known
a world without legalized abortion.

<p>

As an aside, Generation Xers seem to be even more troubled by
abortion than their immediate elders, the Baby Boomers.  But regardless
of age, public opinion polls show that the American population
at large is deeply troubled by abortion.

<p>

A September 1994 Gallup poll commissioned by CNN and <I>USA Today</I>
found that 65 percent of Americans believe that abortions should
either be &quot;illegal in all circumstances&quot; or &quot;legal
under certain circumstances.&quot;  Only 33 percent agreed that
abortions should be &quot;legal under any circumstances.&quot;

<p>

Similarly, a January 1995 CBS/<I>New York Times</I> poll found
that 60 percent believe that abortion should either &quot;not
be permitted&quot; or have &quot;stricter limits.&quot;  The view
that abortion should be &quot;generally available&quot; is shared
by only 38 percent of the population.

<p>

The dichotomy of &quot;pro-life&quot; vs. &quot;pro-choice&quot;
doesn't adequately reflect the sentiments of the American people
about abortion.  Both terms have become highly charged and badly
stereotyped.  The more accurate reflection of how the American
public feels about abortion is noted in their moral opposition
to abortion.  In other words, the debate does not hinge on the
legality of abortion, but on the morality of abortion.

<p>

This now leads me to address a couple of legislative initiatives,
because what Congress or the President does directly impacts the
American people as a whole -- the same American people of whom
a majority morally oppose abortion.

<p>

By far, the most widely-talked about initiative during this 104th
Congress was the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban.  Through this legislation,
pro-lifers sought to educate the American public first about abortion
itself and then about the specific partial-birth abortion procedure.
A majority of Americans had not been aware that abortion was
legal through all nine months of pregnancy for any or no reason.
The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban sought to show people that not
only was it legal for an abortion to occur throughout all nine
months of pregnancy, but also that a procedure as horrific as
a partial-birth abortion could be and was being used without sanction
or restriction.

<p>

For those who do not know what a partial-birth abortion is, it
involves aborting partially-delivered babies from four and a half
months into the pregnancy up to even the ninth month.  The procedure
consists of partially delivering the live baby feet first so that
all but the head is outside the mother's womb.  The head remains
in the uterus while the abortionist kills the baby by stabbing
surgical scissors into the base of its head, then suctioning out
the brain by a small tube, and then completing delivery of the
now-dead baby.

<p>

Ohio Registered Nurse Brenda Pratt Shafer, who has assisted in
three partial-birth abortions, describes the process this way:

<p><blockquote>

<i>Dr. Haskell brought the ultrasound in and hooked it up so that
he could see the baby.  On the ultrasound screen, I could see
the heart beating.  I asked Dr. Haskell, and he told me that,
&quot;Yes, that is the heartbeat.&quot;  As Dr. Haskell watched
the baby on the ultrasound screen, he went in with forceps and
grabbed the baby's legs and brought them down into the birth canal.
Then he delivered the body and the arms, all the way up to the
neck.  At this point, only the baby's head was still inside.
The baby's body was moving.  His little fingers were clasping
together.  He was kicking his feet.  All the while his little
head was still stuck inside.  Dr. Haskell took a pair of scissors
and inserted them into the back of the baby's head.  Then he opened
the scissors up.  Then he stuck the high-powered suction tube
into the hole and sucked the baby's brains out.  I almost threw
up as I watched him do these things....

<p>

I never realized how perfect these babies really are at this
point.  When you hear the word &quot;fetus,&quot; I think a lot
of people think, as I did, of just a blob of cells, or a mass
or something.  It was very revealing to me.  I don't think about
abortion the same way anymore.</i>

</blockquote><p>

The Partial-Birth Abortion Ban would make it a crime to perform
this procedure except to save the mother's life.  It is but a
modest first step in preventing the horror of late-term abortions.

<p>

According to the Alan Guttmacher Institute, the research arm of
Planned Parenthood, approximately 13,000 abortions every year
occur after the 20th week of pregnancy (four and a half months).
While it is not known how many of these are partial-birth abortions,
two abortionists, including Dr. Haskell, have said publicly in
different interviews that they have performed 3,000 &quot;late-term&quot;
abortions, including the partial-birth procedure, between the
two of them.

<p>

As you know, President Clinton vetoed the Partial Birth Abortion
Ban even though it passed both Houses of Congress, garnering support
from many avowed pro-choice advocates, including Reps. Patrick
Kennedy, Majority Leader Dick Gephardt, Susan Molinari, and others.
Indeed, New York Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan said that he
would vote to override the President's veto because, he said,
the procedure is &quot;too close to infanticide.&quot;

<p>

The second legislative amendment that I'd like to discuss received
very little press this year, but was nonetheless extremely important.
It was the Coats amendment to stop discrimination in the provision
of federal funds to those medical schools which choose not to
mandate abortion training.  Last year, the
23-member Accreditation Council for Graduate Medical Education
(ACGME) voted unanimously to pass new regulations mandating that
all medical residents specializing in obstetrics and gynecology
be trained to perform elective abortions.  Individual residents
expressing moral or religious objections would be able to opt
out of the abortion training.  However, medical institutions opposed
to abortion, such as Catholic hospitals, would still be required
-- in order to maintain their accredited status -- to provide
their students with abortion training by arranging for their students
to receive such training at another location.

<p>

Programs which fail to comply with the new
regulations risk losing their accreditation.  Accreditation status
qualifies teaching hospitals to receive federal reimbursement
for services which medical residents provide to patients.  Moreover,
doctors must ordinarily graduate from accredited training programs
to get certified as competent in their specialties.

<p>

ACGME's mandate would have substantively changed
the way in which most medical schools currently operate. The new
policy would mandate that 100 percent of medical schools provided
abortion training to their ob/gyn residents.  However, in 1991,
only 12.4 percent of medical schools provided first-trimester
abortion training on a routine basis; 56.4 percent of schools
offered it on an optional basis.  In terms of second-trimester
abortion training, only 6.7 percent of schools routinely offered
second-trimester abortion training; 58.7 percent provided optional
training.

<p>

Furthermore, about one-third of medical schools
currently refuse to provide abortion training due to moral and/or
legal reasons.  For example, Catholic-affiliated hospitals --
which make up about 20 percent of all U.S. hospitals -- do not
perform elective abortions because of religious and moral beliefs.
Other hospitals, such as the publicly financed Truman Medical
Center in Missouri, are legally prohibited from performing abortions
because laws in several states -- including Missouri -- bar the
use of taxpayer money to fund abortions.

<p>

It is a well-known fact that few physicians
are willing to perform abortions.  A Columbia University survey
found that nearly half of the ob/gyn chief residents graduating
each year have never performed a first-trimester abortion.

<p>

Commenting on the diminishing number of programs
offering elective abortion training, Dr. Richard Schmidt, a former
president of the American College of Obstetricians and Gynecologists
(1977-1978) and residency review committee member, said that given
a choice, faculty and residents &quot;voted very clearly with
their feet&quot; not to perform abortions.

<p>

On behalf of those physicians who &quot;voted with their feet&quot;
and those medical institutions with moral objections to abortion,
pro-lifers succeeded in urging Congress to pass -- and the President
to sign -- a bill which would provide permanent protection for
medical schools that decline to provide abortion training.  This
law, first introduced by Senator Dan Coats, protects medical schools
from a loss of federal funds that would have occurred under the
ACGME's untenable directive.

<p>

In addition, pro-lifers have also worked to advance many other
legislative initiatives such as limiting federal funding for abortion
through the Hyde Amendment, promoting adoption as a pro-life alternative,
and halting human embryo experimentation, among many others. 
While I won't go into detail about these latter legislative items,
I hope that the discussion of the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban and
the ACGME abortion training mandate has sufficiently served to
demonstrate how the pro-life community has been involved on the
policy level to promote a pro-life message.

<p>

In closing, I ask that each of you, as future physicians and health
policy experts, consider the case for life.  Examine closely the
role which you will play, for it may not be too far in the future
when you personally stand face-to-face with a decision regarding
abortion, or physician-assisted suicide, or fetal tissue transplantation,
or human embryo research.  Now, more than ever, technological
advances in medicine require physicians to give thought to ethical
considerations.  Thus, it is vitally important for each of you
to possess a moral grounding, an underlying philosophy for what
you choose to do.  I hope that I have given you some insight not
only into <I>what</I> the pro-life community advocates, but <I>why</I>
we so strongly believe as we do.

<p>

Thank you very much.

<title>PROMOTING TRUE ABSTINENCE IN THE ADOLESCENT FAMILY LIFE ACT</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/podium/podium.gif">

<h2>PROMOTING TRUE ABSTINENCE<br>
IN THE ADOLESCENT FAMILY LIFE ACT</h2>

<p><hr size=3 width=50%><p>

<h4>Testimony of Gracie S. Hsu, Policy Analyst, Family Research Council<br>
before the Labor/HHS/Education Subcommittee<br>
of the Senate Appropriations Committee<br>
July 11, 1996</h4></center>

<p>

Thank you, Mr. Chairman.  As you are well aware, the Family Research
Council (FRC) has long been an advocate of premarital sexual abstinence
and of saving sex for its proper context within marriage.  We
also strongly encourage adoption as a superior alternative to
abortion.

<p>

In the past, the Family Research Council has also supported the
Adolescent Family Life (AFL) Act, or Title XX of the Public Health
Service Act, because it has historically been a solid abstinence-centered
and adoption-promoting program.  Indeed, the AFL legislation was
crafted in order to sponsor programs and research projects which
promote society's traditional sexual ethic of abstinence until
marriage.  The AFL Act articulates a compelling moral framework
for reversing the tide of adolescent promiscuity, out-of-wedlock
pregnancy and abortion, for it recognizes the fact that sex is
not simply a physical act, but that it also has moral, emotional,
and social consequences.

<p>

The two primary purposes of AFL are:

<p>

(1) To find effective means, within the context of the family,
of reaching adolescents before they become sexually active in
order to maximize the guidance and support available to them from
parents and other family members, and to promote self-discipline
and other prudent approaches to the problem of adolescent premarital
sexual relations, including pregnancy; and

<p>

(2) To promote adoption as an alternative for adolescent parents
(Sec. 2001 (b), (1) and (2) of the Public Health Service Act).

<p>

For years, AFL has stood alone in a sea of contraceptive funding,
promoting prevention rather than simply risk reduction.  Even
with its limited annual budget of about $7 million, AFL has succeeded
in helping young people choose the healthiest lifestyle of premarital
sexual abstinence.  Some AFL program successes include <I>Teen-Aid</I>,
<I>Choosing the Best</I>, <I>The Art of Loving Well</I>, and <I>Reasonable
Reasons to Wait</I>.

<p>

However, while the stated mission of AFL has remained unchanged,
in recent years, the policies undergirding AFL's mission have
been under attack by the Clinton administration, and thus, the
program's laudable characteristics have been compromised.

<p>

For example, this administration placed Felicia Hance Stewart,
a former Planned Parenthood abortionist and long-time advocate
of contraception, in charge of the Office of Population Affairs,
which oversees not only Title X, the federal family planning program,
but also AFL, the abstinence program.  Clearly, Dr. Stewart and
the Clinton administration do not subscribe to an abstinence-centered
philosophy, and their efforts to undercut and even defund AFL
are well-established.

<p>

As you will recall, the Clinton administration sought to completely
defund AFL for fiscal year 1995 and replace it with a new Office
of Adolescent Health, which would be dedicated to more &quot;comprehensive&quot;
health education and contraceptive information and services to
teens.  That this administration would consider eliminating the
only source of federal funding for teen abstinence and adoption
programs in favor of more contraceptive programs (which already
receive some $450 million every year through Title X, Medicaid,
and the Maternal and Child Health Block Grant, among others funding
streams) clearly demonstrates not only the administration's lack
of support for abstinence programs, but also its outright hostility
towards their existence.

<p>

Although the Clinton administration did not succeed in its attempt
to defund the AFL program, it has since engaged in other tactics
which undermine the program's promotion of a true abstinence-centered
message.

<p>

For example, under President Clinton, the Health and Human Services
Department modified the policy regulations regarding AFL grant
applications.  Printed in the Federal Register, this administration's
policy guidelines omit all references to parents' central role
and, indeed, even subvert AFL's core purpose of promoting abstinence-centered
programs by soliciting grant applications from contraceptive-based
projects.

<p>

Please allow me to delineate this point further.  During the Bush
administration, the Federal Register announcing AFL grant applications
stated the following:

<p>

&quot;Applications requesting support for prevention projects
should propose innovative, value-based, family-centered approaches
to promoting adolescent premarital abstinence.  Applicants should
promote parents as the primary sex educators of their children
and emphasize the provision of support by other family members,
voluntary associations, religious and charitable organizations
and other groups in the private sector in order to help adolescents
and their families deal with complex issues of adolescent premarital
sexual relations.&quot;  (Federal Register, Vol. 57, No. 19, January
29, 1992)

<p>

Under President Clinton, however, the policy guidelines regulating
the AFL program differed dramatically.  The December 22, 1994
Federal Register stated the following:

<p>

&quot;The OAPP encourages the submission of prevention applications
which propose to do the following:....(4) include medically accurate
information on sexuality, contraception, sexually transmitted
diseases (STDs) and HIV/AIDS, (5) offer educational services to
parents to assist them in communicating with their children about
sexuality, contraception, STDs and HIV/AIDS...&quot;

<p>

Mr. Chairman, as you can see from this example, the Clinton Administration
believes that parents are not the primary sex educators of their
children, but that the educational establishment must help parents
teach their children about sex.  This administration also believes
that AFL should not be a true abstinence program, but a contraceptive-based
program.  This double message about sex not only contradicts the
AFL program's stated mission, it also harms children in the process.

<p>

Therefore, Mr. Chairman, if the AFL program is to continue, with
or without increased funding, it is vitally important that the
language of the legislation be altered to reflect a true abstinence-centered
and adoption-promoting message.  We must prevent the current and
future administrations from wrongly interpreting the AFL statute.

<p>

The Family Research Council proposes that this committee take
into consideration the Faircloth-Talent abstinence language passed
within H.R. 4, the recent welfare bill that was vetoed by the
President. Under such explicit language, only true abstinence-centered
programs would be able to receive funding.  We believe that this
legislative step is necessary in order to remedy the executive
branch's tampering with the program.  Unless such a step is taken,
however, FRC cannot endorse the expansion of a program that is
so vulnerable to be used for harmful purposes.

<p>

Finally, I'd like to comment on the Family Research Council's
viewpoint regarding the government's role in funding social programs
which seek to promote any form of sexual behavior.  FRC strongly
believes that the responsibility for sex education belongs to
the parents of children.  We also believe that the federal government
does not have a legitimate role in federally subsidizing contraceptive
programs, or even abstinence programs.  Indeed, we have only advocated
for the existence of AFL in order to counter the federal government's
aggressive role in promoting contraceptive-based programs.  Therefore,
if the government is to play a role at all, it should at a minimum
sustain and promote self-restraint and marital commitment rather
than subverting them.

<p>

Mr. Chairman, we ask that you would take FRC's recommendations
under consideration.  Thank you very much.

<TITLE>THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT: IT'S TIME TO FREE THE ARTS</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/insight/insight.gif">
<P>
<H2>THE NATIONAL ENDOWMENT:<BR>
IT'S TIME TO FREE THE ARTS</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<CENTER>
<I>by</I>
<P>
<I>Robert H. Knight</I></CENTER>
<P>
After years of debate and attempted reform, it has become clear
that the National Endowment for the Arts is beyond reclamation
and should be zero-budgeted by the 104th Congress. 
<P>
Particularly with regard to the visual arts (drawing, painting
and sculpting) and &quot;performance&quot; arts (theater, film,
live acts), the NEA has been a platform for attacks on religion,
traditional art forms, traditional families and traditional values,
and a forum for the promotion of homosexuality.  In the name of
tolerance, it has shown increasing intolerance toward standards
of any kind, including ordinary standards of artistic skill. 
Its peer review process has long been a buddy system for awarding
grants to colleagues, friends and clients of panel members, who
are almost uniformly hostile to traditional culture.   
<P>
However, even if the federal agency did manage to clean up its
act, the entire idea of government sponsorship of art is a bad
one.  Whenever the government decides to subsidize one artist
and not another, the government, in effect, determines what is
art and what is not.
<P>
Unlike any other arts sponsor, the federal government has unique
authority and responsibility.  Its powers derive from its claim
to represent all Americans and its money from mandatory taxes.
 NEA grants greatly influence what is presented in museums and
theaters and what private donors feel is worthy of support.  As
former NEA Chairman John Frohnmayer noted: &quot;Our grantees
state unequivocally that fund-raising is substantially easier
because of an Endowment grant.  It is an endorsement -- a mark
of quality and achievement.&quot;[1]
<P>
And what has the NEA done with this awesome responsibility? 
<P>
Since its founding, the NEA has openly favored the avant-garde
-- defined by <I>Webster's Third New International Unabridged
Dictionary</I> as: &quot;Those who 
create, produce or apply new, original or experimental ideas,
designs, techniques...and sometimes: a group that is extremist,
bizarre, or arty and affected.&quot;[2]  Unfortunately, the NEA seems
to have taken the latter portion of the definition to heart. 
There is a place, of course, for experimental art, but it should
be funded privately, not by taxpayers whose money often is used
to disparage their most deeply held beliefs.
<P>
As a federal agency, the NEA should not be fostering a bias toward
one particular art style over another.  In fact its own grant
guidelines specifically forbid it to do so or attempt to direct
artistic content.[3]
<P>
One reason the NEA has been able to promote bad art without public
scrutiny is that the media are not telling the whole story.  TV
broadcasters and newspapers are restrained by the bounds of good
taste from reproducing the most offensive works funded by the
NEA.  A January 2, 1991 <I>Los Angeles Times </I>article about
an NEA grant to performance artist Karen Finley described her
work only as &quot;strongly feminist in tone.&quot;[4] This leaves
the impression that Finley, who calls herself the &quot;Queen
of Dung,&quot; is controversial merely for being a feminist, not
because of her vulgarities.  
<P>
Because of this kind of obfuscation, most Americans have only
an abstract concept of the works in question.  Senator Jesse Helms,
the NEA's most active critic, has offered to debate the issue
on any TV network providing he can show viewers what is being
debated.  All have refused.  And for good reason.  If NBC-TV actually
aired some NEA-funded works, it would violate Federal Communications
Commission rules against obscenity and risk losing its broadcasting
license.  One federal agency would find itself prosecuting a company
for displaying materials sponsored by another federal agency.
<P>
<H3><CENTER>THE CHAIRMAN'S VIEWS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Under the chairmanship of actress Jane Alexander, the NEA has
not curbed its hostility toward traditional values.  In fact,
Alexander told the homosexual magazine <I>The Advocate</I> that
she intended to use the NEA to &quot;introduce people gently to
gay themes all across the country. And I mean gently, because
if you start with a kind of very overt thing, people get scared....
 You gently bring in gay people and introduce them to the world
through art.&quot;[5]
<P>
When asked, &quot;What sorts of grants would you reject out of
hand,&quot; Alexander answered: &quot;It's hard to say at this
point if there is any grant that I might reject.&quot;[6]
<P>
Indeed, Alexander later defended a performance in February 1994
at the NEA-funded Walker Art Center in Minneapolis in which an
HIV-positive performer, Ron Athey, sliced into another man's back
with a knife, mopped up the blood with towels and sent them on
clotheslines over the horrified audience.  He also had two female
assistants weave acupuncture needles through his own scalp and,
in turn, pierced the women's cheeks with steel spikes.[7]
<P>
Asked by a reporter what she thought of the performance, Alexander
replied that she trusted the judgment of the Walker management,
and said, &quot;Not all art is for everybody....  Americans are
certainly not used to seeing bloodletting, except in films, and
when it happens in person, it must be surprising.&quot;  Alexander
added that she thought &quot;all appropriate precautions&quot;
regarding health had been taken, &quot;So what are we left with
that was considered controversial?  The sacrification [sic], the
ritual-like aspect?  Is it that the man is homosexual?&quot;[8]
<P>
Congress responded to Alexander's lack of action by cutting $4
million from the NEA budget.  Athey then performed his act at
another NEA-funded theater, New York's P.S. 122.  &quot;With full
knowledge of this,&quot; culture critics David Horowitz and Laurence
Jarvik note, &quot;The NEA again funded both P.S. 122 and the
Walker Art Center in the most recent grant cycle.  Plainly, the
agency is deaf to the concerns of Congress and the public.&quot;[9]
<P>
Some of the more serious problems[10] at the NEA include:
<P>
- Bias against religion; rejecting positive portrayals of religion
as violating the separation of church and state, but funding attacks
on religion as &quot;artistic expression&quot;;
<P>
- Elevation of &quot;freedom of expression&quot; and &quot;artistic
merit&quot; as the main criteria for grants, ignoring the NEA's
charter legislation of 1965, which set &quot;encouragement of
excellence&quot; as the No. 1 criterion, followed by &quot;access
to the arts for all Americans&quot;;  
<P>
- Confusion in upper management about how to comply with congressionally-mandated
standards;
<P>
- Confusion about the NEA's primary mission;
<P>
- Conflicts of interest in the grant-awarding process;
<P>
- A bureaucracy openly hostile to public scrutiny;
<P>
- Bias against traditional forms of art and traditional values
in general.
<P>
<H3><CENTER>HOSTILITY TOWARD RELIGION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The First Amendment prohibits Congress (and federal agencies authorized
by Congress) to infringe on religious liberties.  It is clearly
unconstitutional to use federal tax dollars to create and distribute
an attack on religious beliefs.  The government has no business
dictating the value of religious beliefs or prescribing changes
in them. 
<P>
Yet the taxpayer-supported NEA over the years has funded works
that degrade or mock religious belief, particularly Christianity.
<P>
- In June, 1993, the Whitney Museum of American Art, which received
$200,000 from the NEA during 1992-1993, displayed <I>Abject Art:
Repulsion and Desire in American Art</I>.  The exhibit's journal
explains the focus: &quot;Although 'abject art' is a play on 'object
art,' the term does not connote an art movement so much as it
describes a body of work which incorporates or suggests abject
materials such as dirt, hair, excrement, dead animals, menstrual
blood, and rotting food in order to confront taboo issues of gender
and sexuality....  Employing methodologies adapted from feminism,
queer theory, post-structuralism, Marxism, and psychoanalysis,
our goal is to talk dirty in the institution [of art] and degrade
its atmosphere of purity and prudery by foregrounding issues of
gender and sexuality in the art exhibited.&quot;[11]
<P>
The Whitney show included works by Joel-Peter Witkin, who received
four fellowship grants from the NEA: Fiscal year 1980, $3,000;
FY 1981 $12,500; FY 1986, $15,000; FY 1992, $20,000.[12] Witkin's
work includes &quot;Maquette for Crucifix,&quot; a naked Jesus
Christ surrounded by sado-masochistic obscene imagery, and many
grotesque portrayals of corpses and body parts.  Another Whitney
exhibit was a film by Suzie Silver titled &quot;A Spy,&quot; which
depicts Jesus Christ as a woman standing naked with breasts exposed.
 The Whitney also included &quot;Piss Christ,&quot; Andres Serrano's
photograph of a crucifix in a jar of urine, and a film by porn
star Annie Sprinkle titled &quot;The Sluts and Goddesses Video
Workshop or How to be a Sex Goddess in 101 Easy Steps.&quot;[13] Sprinkle
has performed numerous times in NEA-funded venues such as Highways
in Los Angeles and The Kitchen Theater in New York, where she
has had audience members come on stage to examine her exposed
genitals.
<P>
- Diamanda Galas, who was The Kitchen Theater's first artist-in-residence,
performed &quot;Plague Mass&quot; at the Cathedral of St. John
the Divine in Manhattan in 1990, during which she appeared topless
and covered with blood.[14] A member of ACT-UP, the AIDS activist
group, she was arrested during a demonstration at St. Patrick's
Cathedral in New York in 1989.[15] On July 8, 1993, she opened the
Serious Fun Festival at Lincoln Center, which was supported by
a $14,700 dance grant from the NEA.[16] As the New York Times explains,
&quot;Conceptually, her work is close to that of the late David
Wojnarowicz, the visual artist-writer who died of AIDS in 1992.&quot;
 In 1990, the NEA gave a $15,000 grant to Wojnarowicz, who specialized
in photographs of men performing oral sex, anal sex, anal-oral
sex and masturbation.  An essay in one of his exhibits described
New York's John Cardinal O'Connor as &quot;a fat cannibal from
that house of walking swastikas up on fifth avenue,&quot; and
a &quot;creep in black skirts.&quot;[17]
<P>
- Anti-Christian material is distributed through the NEA-supported
Video Data Bank at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago.[18]
The following are a couple of the offerings, with descriptions
cited from &quot;Gay and Lesbian Tapes Distributed by the Video
Data Bank&quot;:
<P>
<I>Popular Thought</I>.  This video equates the &quot;moral majority&quot;
with totalitarianism.  &quot;UThe message reverberates with the
interweaving of archival footage of Nazi Youth, book burnings
and modern day Ohio Youth for Jesus creating an audiovisual fabric
of hatredU -- Carole Ann Klonarides.&quot;
<P>
<I>Peccatum Mutum (The Silent Sin)</I>.  &quot;...explores relationships
among cloistered nuns....  Utilizing gothic expressionistic sets,
humor, serious kissing, and melodrama, this work expresses the
contradictions and ironic similarities between physical desire
and spiritual fervor.  A rare glimpse at the other side of Catholic
guilt.&quot;
<P>
<H3><CENTER>TARGETING THE FAMILY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Promotion of &quot;alternative lifestyles&quot; has long been
a staple of NEA grants.  A case in point is, again, NEA support
of the Video Data Bank, which offers these films and accompanying
synopses:[19]
<P>
- <I>Swamp</I>.  &quot;This subversive soap opera targets the
family, psychotherapy and property as the villains.&quot;
<P>
- <I>A Coalminer's Granddaughter</I>.  &quot;This hysterically
funny epic about a brutally realistic American family does for
lesbians what John Waters did for Baltimore....  Under the thumb
of her sleazy, evil father (brilliantly portrayed by novelist
Kevin Killian) Jane is not the hero of her own life....  <I>Coal
Miner's Granddaughter</I> opens up into the impressionistic world
of her sexuality...highly charged sexuality [that makes] staples
of lesbian erotica seem tepid and silly.&quot;

<P>
By validating the pro-homosexual viewpoint through taxpayer-supported
government grants, the NEA has helped legitimize pro-homosexual
theater in general.  <I>New York Newsday</I> arts critic Linda
Winer notes that: &quot;The fact is, much of the theater these
days is gay....  Indeed, much of it has been for a very long time....
 This season there have been so many gay projects that I've been
searching for an alternative to the term 'straight play' when
describing a nonmusical.&quot;[20]
<P>
NEA-funded venues such as The Woolly Mammoth Theatre in Washington,
D.C., The Franklin Furnace and The Kitchen in New York, Highways
in Los Angeles, and countless other NEA-funded theater groups
around the country present works promoting homosexuality and blasting
traditional morality.  The NEA also supports pro-homosexual projects
shown on the Public Broadcasting System.  Some recent examples
of pro-homosexual, NEA-supported works:
<P>
- In April, 1994, Woolly Mammoth staged NEA grant recipient Tim
Miller's one-man performance, &quot;My Queer Body,&quot; in which
he, among other things, describes what it's like to have sex with
another man, climbs naked into the lap of a spectator, and finally
arouses himself sexually in full view of the audience.[21]
<P>
- In January, 1994, the Public Broadcasting Service showed <I>Tales
of the City</I>, a three-part miniseries celebrating homosexual
life in San Francisco in the 1970s.  The series was full of gratuitous
nudity, crudity, lewdness and dozens of instances of foul language.
 Families are lampooned and homosexuality is portrayed as superior.
 The series was co-produced by American Playhouse, which received
$750,000 in NEA funds in 1993.  NEA received an on-screen credit
as a supporter of the film. 
<P>
- In August 1994, the Public Broadcasting Service aired <I>One
Nation Under God</I>, a misleading, one-sided documentary by two
homosexual activists that attempts to discredit ex-gay therapy
and counseling.[22] The NEA is credited as a main sponsor for the
film, which links Christian ministries to Nazi techniques such
as shock/aversion therapy, a practice which has long been denounced
by the ex-gay movement.  The film misportrays several homosexual
activists, misrepresents Evelyn Hooker's psychological studies
of homosexual men in the 1950's, and uses Biblical references
out of context.  The film also takes quotes from several therapists
and former homosexuals out of context.  In one clip, a former
homosexual explains that he used to think that &quot;God hates
homosexuals,&quot; but that he now knows that God loves them.
 The filmmakers include only the fragment, &quot;God hates homosexuals,&quot;
reversing the man's intended meaning.  Dr. Elizabeth Moberly,
author of <I>Psychogenesis</I> and founder of a Pennsylvania-based,
ex-gay ministry, says the filmmakers misrepresented themselves,
took her out of context in her taped interview and distorted severely
what she and other therapists had said.[23] The film was shown at
several gay and lesbian film festivals during the summer of 1994
and at the 1995 Gay Games and Cultural Festival in New York City.
 Over the years, the NEA has supported several gay and lesbian
film festivals, which have presented hard-core pornography and
anti-religious themes.[24]
<P>
- The NEA-supported Video Data Bank at the School of the Art Institute
of Chicago offers numerous homosexual films.  <I>Danny</I>, a
20-minute documentary, includes footage touting &quot; Uthe raw
sensuality of cruising and anonymous encountersU -- Robert Rosenberg,
Global Village.&quot;  <I>Jollies</I> is an 11-minute film by
Sadie Benning, who &quot;recounts her earliest sexual encounters.&quot;
 Another Benning work, <I>Me and Rubyfruit</I>, &quot;chronicles
the enchantment of teenage lesbian love.&quot;  Other titles in
the catalog are frankly pornographic.   
<P>
<H3><CENTER>TALKING POINTS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<B>Curbing the NEA would amount to censorship, and that's against
the First Amendment, isn't it?</B>
<P>
The First Amendment to the Constitution states that &quot;Congress
shall make no law respecting an establishment of religion, or
prohibiting the free exercise thereof; or abridging the freedom
of speech, or of the press; or the right of the people peacefully
to assemble, and to petition the Government for a redress of grievances.&quot;
<P>
The Constitution limits the federal government and, by extension
of the 14th Amendment, the states, from censoring protected speech,
as defined over the years by Supreme Court cases.  It does not
limit individual citizens nor private groups, which have freedom
to maintain their own standards of decency and their own viewpoints.
 The issue is one of sponsorship, not censorship.  There is no
constitutional &quot;right&quot; of an artist to a subsidy from
his fellow taxpayers.  
<P>
<B>But won't the arts collapse without federal aid?</B>
<P>
More than $9 billion in private giving sustains arts in communities
all over America.[25} The NEA's $175 million is important more for
its symbolism than for the actual dollars involved.   An NEA grant
validates an artist, and the government should not be in the business
of determining what is art.  That process smacks of &quot;official&quot;
art, such as is imposed on the artistic communities in totalitarian
societies.
<P>
<B>Can the NEA be reformed?</B>
<P>
No, it can't.  Congress has tried several times to rein in the
rogue agency, including appointing an independent commission to
study the NEA in 1990.  With some fanfare, the NEA adopted a few
reforms, but continued to fund the worst excesses in the art world.
 Even after Congress slightly cut the NEA's budget in 1994 as
a message of discontent, it continued to shovel money to artists
whose primary purpose is to insult the majority of taxpayers.
 Also, NEA officials consistently have displayed an arrogant disregard
for the taxpayers.  Even a pro-reform arts critic, the late Samuel
Lipman, who had been a member of the National Council on the Arts
during the 1980s, finally came to the conclusion in the 1990s
that the agency was irreparable and should be abolished.
<P>
<B>Besides ending subsidies for bad art, are there any other reasons
to defund NEA?</B>
<P>
Yes.  The federal deficit is out of control, so Congress must
find ways to cut back without endangering infrastructure.  Before
1965, the United States got along just fine without federal art
subsidies, which are a product of the Great Society's massive
government expansion.   Also, NEA funds are distributed in a grossly
distorted fashion, with certain areas such as New York, Los Angeles
and Minnesota receiving far more money than other states and cities.
 And many grants go to artists who are already successful and
do not need the money.  Finally, ending federal subsidies would
put a dent in cultural imperialism; pampered artists could no
longer use the federal government to tell the rest of the nation
what is art and what isn't.  Pulling the plug on NEA money would
mean that communities would support the arts that the people in
those communities wanted -- not the art that is dictated from
Washington, D.C.

<P>
Over the past decade, the federal government has spent billions
of dollars on HIV research, which has been geared predominantly
toward end-stage HIV (full-blown AIDS).  In Fiscal Year 1995,
the U.S. Public Health Service will spend $2.7 billion directly
on AIDS, the highest expenditure for any of the nation's 10 most
lethal diseases.[1]
<P>
AIDS ranks near the bottom of the list of the top 10 mortal diseases
and accounts for about 35,000 deaths annually.  Heart disease
claims 720,000 lives annually, and cancer kills 505,000.  Yet
the federal government will spend more on AIDS than on heart disease
($828 million) and cancer ($2.4 billion).[2]
<P>
The point is not that AIDS should cease receiving attention. 
HIV is a contagious disease and its victims deserve compassion
and help.  Funding should continue for treatment, prevention and
care.  However, AIDS funding must be brought into line with expenditures
for other life-threatening diseases, and the money must be redirected
toward more effective approaches.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>A CHANGING EPIDEMIC</CENTER></H3>
<P>
The scourge of AIDS, which began in America among white, male
homosexuals, has moved into poor, minority communities, driven
by prostitution, drug abuse and promiscuous sex.  Yet most AIDS
funding is still directed by, for and to the original target population.
<P>
AIDS funding generally is allocated according to the numbers of
people who ever have contracted AIDS -- including those who already
have died -- not those currently diagnosed with HIV.  This formula
has, for example, directed money to white, homosexual AIDS groups
in San Francisco while cities which now may have greater numbers
of HIV-infected patients get less financial aid.  The CDC has
reported that 55 percent of AIDS cases in 1993 came from minority
communities, with blacks having the worst rate of all the groups.[3]
Black women were approximately 15 times more likely than white
women to get AIDS, and black men were five times more likely to
get AIDS than white men.[4]
<P>
For many years, AIDS policy has been driven by the demands of
HIV-infected people who dominate AIDS organizations.  Their situations
are tragic, and their focus on finding a cure is understandable.
 But because of their considerable influence, the lion's share
of AIDS funding has been spent for treatment of end-stage HIV
(AIDS) and not on the full spectrum of HIV disease. 
<P>
Even the prevention efforts have been tailored toward protecting
the identities of those with HIV rather than toward measures that
have proven effective in stemming other serious epidemics.  Much
government time at AIDS conferences has been spent on perfecting
&quot;nonjudgmental&quot; vernacular, such as substituting &quot;people
living with HIV&quot; for the word &quot;victim&quot; or even
the word &quot;patient&quot; in order to reduce stigma.  In the
same vein, concern for confidentiality, while important, has been
overemphasized, and sound medical procedures have been thwarted
and often ignored.  The first step in stopping an epidemic is
identifying, on a confidential basis, those who have the disease.
 This process has been hampered by federally-funded AIDS activists,
who have defeated efforts to increase early diagnosis and confidential
partner notification, the surest ways to pinpoint the disease
and to help check its spread. 
<P>
Furthermore, the federal government's preventative response to
the epidemic has consisted largely of a million-dollar ad campaign
promoting condoms and hundreds of millions of dollars for AIDS
education that targets schoolchildren, acquainting them with graphic
materials explaining the various ways AIDS is transmitted, whether
they are at risk or not.  At the same time, populations that are
most at risk for HIV transmission are under-served, particularly
in black or Hispanic communities.
<P>
The current premise of many AIDS prevention efforts is that <I>uninfected</I>
persons have primary responsibility for stemming the epidemic,
not those already infected.  The focus must be changed to make
personal responsibility on the part of those infected the foundation
of future programs. 
<P>
The most successful AIDS eradication program in America has been
run by the U.S. armed forces.  Early diagnosis is the key.  Since
1985, every member of the military has been screened regularly
for HIV, resulting in a depth of knowledge about the disease that
is unparalleled.  Unlike civilian doctors, military medical personnel
are not &quot;flying blind&quot; in this epidemic and are getting
early treatment and notification to those affected.  There is
no &quot;AIDS epidemic&quot; in the military because aggressive
knowledge-based intervention prevents the spread of disease.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>IDEAS FOR POLICY MAKERS</CENTER></H3>
<P>
Here are some proposals to overhaul federal AIDS programs, with
thanks to Americans for a Sound AIDS/HIV Policy, a nonpartisan
Washington, D.C.-based research and advocacy group, for their
wise counsel on several of these points: 
<P>
<LI><B>Initiate prenatal HIV testing for all pregnant women</B>,
with an opt-out for those who want it.  Twenty-six percent of
HIV-infected mothers transmit the disease to their babies today
in the United States.  However, mothers who do not know they are
HIV-positive can unwittingly transmit it to the 74 percent of
uninfected babies by breast-feeding.  Furthermore, research shows
that when HIV-infected mothers are treated with the drug AZT,
the transmission rate drops from 26 percent to 8 percent.  Thus
knowledge of HIV status can save many lives.
<P>
<LI><B>Begin HIV partner notification programs in all 50 states,
the District of Columbia and U.S. territories</B>.  Partner tracing
is the fastest way to alert those in danger of infection and is
standard public health procedure for virtually all contagious
and sexually transmitted diseases.  Earlier this century, epidemics
of gonorrhea and syphilis were greatly reduced using this time-proven
procedure. 
<P>
<LI><B>Guarantee confidentiality to all who are tested.</B>  Concern
over misuse of HIV status has been the main obstacle to effective
testing programs.  But public health departments have reported
more than 400,000 cases of AIDS to the CDC without a single breach
of confidentiality in any of the 50 states.  Moreover, venereal
disease testing has been done for years without any serious breach-of-confidentiality problem. 
<P>
<LI><B>Overhaul the Ryan White Act</B>, which dispenses about $650
million annually in federal funds.  The Ryan White Act is due
to expire in 1995.  Hearings need to be held to examine how the
money is being spent.  And the spending formulas should include
the following changes:
<P>
1) Only those infected with HIV or AIDS who need care should receive
benefits.  Formulas based on &quot;AIDS prevalence&quot; distort
funding needs because they count the dead along with the living.
 Money ought to go where it is needed most, which is, increasingly,
to under-served minority communities.
<P>
2) People with HIV or AIDS should qualify where they are currently
living, not where they were diagnosed.  Slating funds to areas
of diagnosis misses areas where AIDS patients are actually residing.
 For example, someone might be diagnosed with AIDS in a large
city, but return home to a suburban or rural area for care.
<P>
3) Means testing for AIDS care dollars should be introduced. 
Those with adequate insurance should not be in the same pool with
those who truly have no other means of payment.
<P>
<LI><B>Overhaul HIV/AIDS education</B>, which now emphasizes condoms
and has not been shown to be effective.  In fact, programs seeking
funding renewal should be required to show evidence that they
have reduced HIV transmission. 
<P>
Sex education should be geared toward abstinence education and
knowledge of HIV status.  True abstinence programs (not those
that merely mention abstinence and then focus on contraception)
are the only sex education programs that have been proven to alter
behavior in positive ways.  &quot;Comprehensive&quot; (contraceptive-based)
programs have been proven to have either no effect or to actually
encourage earlier or more frequent sexual experimentation.  The
key to stopping AIDS and other sexually transmitted diseases is
not in the promotion of condoms but in the promotion of delayed
sexual activity and early knowledge of infection.  In a recent
test, three groups of people were monitored: 1) a group who received
HIV education, 2) a control group with no HIV education and 3)
a group who received HIV education, and who also underwent an
HIV test.  Only the latter group registered any behavioral change.
 Testing in and of itself heightens consciousness of the seriousness
of premature or promiscuous sex.
<P>
The federal AIDS education campaign has emphasized condoms first
and has treated abstinence as a largely unrealistic goal, even
though medical experts agree that it is the most medically sound
response.  Condoms are seen by some as a way of continuing high-risk
behavior regardless of HIV status.  But no honest medical professional
would recommend that an uninfected person have sex with an HIV-infected
partner using a condom for protection.  Condoms can reduce the
risk in a single encounter, but not to where it is anywhere near
acceptable to be considered in the context of &quot;prevention.&quot;
<P>
The CDC has even misrepresented the concept of abstinence, stating
in its literature that there is a &quot;26 percent failure rate
for periodic abstinence.&quot;[5] What they are really describing
is &quot;periodic sex.&quot;  There is no such thing as &quot;periodic
abstinence.&quot;  To understand the absurdity of this statement,
try imagining the police describing a burglar as having a 26 percent
&quot;periodic honesty&quot; failure rate.  Funding for all federal
AIDS programs that promote condom use and misrepresent abstinence
should be halted immediately.  Sex education programs under Title
X (a program that was a colossal, $3 billion failure over two
decades) should be zeroed out.
<P>
<LI><B>Focus research on the &quot;full spectrum&quot; of HIV</B>,
from inception on, instead of merely focusing on HIV's final stage
(AIDS).  Dr. Robert Redfield of Walter Reed Hospital notes that
finding a &quot;cure&quot; for this tricky retrovirus is only
a distant possibility (and still a worthy goal), but that early
detection is the key to prevention.[6] Also, research subject pools
need to include more women and people from minority communities,
where the epidemic is increasing at the fastest rates.
<P>
<LI><B>Change the formula for the Centers for Disease Control's
prevention planning committees.</B> They are currently biased
toward white, homosexual men, although the HIV epidemic has shifted
toward minority communities.  Testing authorization should not
be limited to licensed phlebotomists but expanded to include small,
trained groups that can operate within minority communities inexpensively
and efficiently, using the Orasure saliva-test collection device
recently approved by the Food and Drug Administration.
<P>
<LI><B>Support distribution of the saliva-based HIV test</B>, approval
of which was held up for nearly four years by the FDA.  The test
is a reliable, inexpensive and convenient way to detect HIV. 
The sample is processed in a lab, so public health professionals
can track the epidemic when names are gained through confidential
testing.  Conversely, an<I> anonymous</I> home test backed by
AIDS activist groups would help &quot;drive the epidemic underground,&quot;
a concern voiced, ironically, by those same groups whenever the
testing issue is raised.  Anonymous home tests would discourage
people from being tested in a manner that fosters early counseling
and treatment and that could be tracked by public health professionals,
and it would severely limit the impact of partner-notification
programs that are under way in many states.  Furthermore, the
trauma of discovering that one has HIV infection, experienced
alone, could lead some to suicide. 
<P>
Although concerns of confidentiality are not to be taken lightly,
the idea of anonymous HIV testing is being driven by the notion
that the primary responsibility for the epidemic should fall on
those who are uninfected, not on those who have the virus.  
<P>
<LI><B>Require routine testing of patients and health care workers.
</B> Both parties should be notified of the results.  Ignorance
of infection has never aided the cause of good medical care. 
In many cases, women do not show early signs of HIV infection,
and the first indication comes when the patient is actually dying
of AIDS.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</CENTER></H3>
<P>
In testimony before the House Energy and Commerce Committee in
1991, Dr. Robert Redfield said, &quot;The chilling reality is
that the AIDS epidemic of the next decade has already occurred.
 Central to the military response was the recognition of HIV infection
for what it is -- a sexually transmitted, progressively fatal
infection, which, although not yet curable, is treatable and preventable.&quot;
<P>
The AIDS epidemic of the year 2000, indeed, has occurred already.
 In fact, it took place around 1990.  The HIV virus' incubation
period typically takes 10 years, so when public policy makers
are addressing full-blown AIDS in 1995, they are dealing with
behavior and causes that occurred in 1985.  While care of AIDS
patients and basic AIDS research is essential, prevention efforts
need to be targeted toward current patterns of behavior and the
current population groups most adversely affected.  Homosexual
white males still account for the largest number of AIDS cases,
but the growth in HIV infections increasingly is among poor, black
and Hispanic urban dwellers, including women.  It's time to gear
the federal AIDS effort toward sound, time-tested medical procedures
such as early diagnosis, reporting and confidential partner notification,
and it's time to make individual responsibility the touchstone
of public policy.

Authorization for the Corporation for Public Broadcasting is due
to expire at the end of 1996.  But Congress must appropriate money
each year.  The new 104th Congress should decline to do so. 
<P>
There is no reason Congress should force the taxpayers to continue
subsidizing this outdated system, much of which (the best parts)
would survive nicely without federal aid.
<P>
The CPB, overseer of the Public Broadcasting Service and National
Public Radio, was created in 1967 to meet a perceived need for
taxpayer-financed alternative programming not provided by commercial
networks.  That need, if there ever was one, has passed.  The
advent of cable television, satellite dishes and improved radio
technology has created an enormous menu of broadcasting choices
for consumers.  America has more than 11,700 radio stations and
more than 3,100 television licensees, plus 109 cable networks[1]
and another 6,963 translators and boosters, which extend the reach
of existing stations.[2] In addition, computer technology has created
a multitude of interactive computer highways, such as the Internet.
 It is not as if consumers don't have enough access to information.
<P>
The basis for CPB's existence has always been an anti-free market
philosophy.   Proponents have said that the market is incapable
of providing good programming, so the government must step in
and do it, to the tune of $285.6 million annually.[3] This insults
the intelligence of the viewing/listening public, because it assumes
they won't appreciate or support good programming.  Yet the shows
that register high ratings on PBS turn out to be the very programs
that the public perceives to be excellent: <I>Sesame Street</I>,
<I>Barney and Friends</I>, <I>The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour</I>,
and <I>Masterpiece Theatre</I>, for example.  All of these shows
are generating more than sufficient revenue from sponsors, donors,
grants and product marketing.  They do not need taxpayer subsidies.
But there is other CPB programming that probably would fail to
attract a sufficient viewing/listening audience or donor support.
 These programs are so bad that their creators must dig into the
public purse.  Subsidizing bad art is a donor's prerogative, of
course -- unless the &quot;donor&quot; is the taxpayer, who has
no choice.  
<P>
In a time of massive federal deficits, it makes no sense to require
taxpayers to shell out their hard-earned dollars for art of any
kind.  And the CPB, like any government bureaucracy, has waste
built into it.  A Congressional Conference Report on the Public
Broadcasting Service discloses that &quot;a single individual
is paid $438,000 annually for his once a week 30 minute appearance.&quot;[4]
<P>
It also makes no sense when cable television and satellites are
providing hundreds of programming alternatives.  Anything that
is worth viewing on PBS, for instance, would be picked up by Bravo,
The Learning Channel, the Arts &amp; Entertainment Network and
other channels. 
<P>
Public broadcasting advocates acknowledge that major PBS and NPR
stations would continue to thrive without federal subsidies. 
Their concern, they say, is that smaller, rural stations would
be forced to close.  But rural radio listeners or TV viewers can
tune in to numerous commercial stations or even to National Public
Radio or Public Broadcasting Service stations in distant cities
merely by acquiring better equipment.  Would it really be a great
loss if rural folks were denied the ability to see <I>Tongues
Untied</I> on their own, local station? Living in the country
has its own rewards, but forcing other taxpayers to subsidize
money-losing operations and bad art should not be one of them.
<P>
Besides, there is no public clamor from rural people or suburbanites
or urban dwellers, for that matter, to continue to subsidize the
pet projects (and paychecks) of a small radical elite that is
at odds with most American values.  The case for CPB subsidies
is being made almost exclusively by those in &quot;the arts community&quot;
and radical political activists who stand to benefit directly
from taxpayer largesse.  A case in point is a recent letter from
Independent Television Service Executive Director James Yee to
public broadcasting advocates.  The taxpayer-supported (and, therefore,
in no way independent) ITVS was created in 1988 to provide new
programming for public broadcasting.  Yee urges his &quot;independent
colleagues&quot; to &quot;become involved in future efforts to
drum up support for public broadcasting, especially with your
local and national elected officials, local public broadcasting
station(s), media arts organizations, and civic and cultural institutions.&quot;[5]
Yee warned that &quot;an extensive informational outreach campaign
will have to be waged,&quot;[6] which means newspapers and broadcasters
will begin pelting their audiences with scary stories about the
demise of Big Bird, should budget cutters prevail.   
<P>
But the debate over CPB is not about grounding Big Bird.  Through
PBS and NPR, the CPB is peddling a political and social agenda
that is offensive to many.  For example, NPR reporter Sunni Khalid
revealed more than a bit of political bias when commenting on
the Republican Congressional victory during a C-Span <I>Journalists
Roundtable</I> (C-Span is not funded by CPB, but by America's
cable TV operators): &quot;I think there's a big difference when
people told Father Aristide to sort of moderate his views, they
were concerned about people being dragged through the streets,
killed and necklaced.  I don't think that is what [House Speaker]
Newt Gingrich has in mind.  I think he's looking at a more scientific,
a more civil way, of lynching people.&quot;[7]
<P>
The bright side is that few folks are tuning in to public broadcasting's
truly awful programs.   The bad side is that their money is being
used to produce shows that are used to validate attacks on them,
and then the same shows are foisted, in videocassettes, on unsuspecting
schoolchildren as &quot;educational&quot; supplements. 
<P>
Here are a few of the anti-family, anti-religious, pro-homosexual
offerings from public broadcasting in recent years:
<P>
<CENTER><H3>ANTI-FAMILY PROGRAMMING</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<LI>In July 1994, a mother in Akron, Ohio, was shocked to find a
program titled <I>What if I'm Gay</I> sandwiched between <I>Kidsongs
TV</I> and <I>Sesame Street</I> from 10:00 to 11:00 a.m. on her
local PBS station.  The mother's concern about placing such programming
at a time when many pre-school children and toddlers are watching
T.V. seems to have been largely ignored by the station.  After
the woman called the station to complain, the programming director
defended the show, saying, &quot;The quality of the program is
unquestionable.  It has good
writing and production and is well thought out.&quot;[8]
<P>
<LI>The Independent Television Service (ITVS) has been awarded more
than $38 million in public broadcasting funds since 1989.  For
that princely sum, according to public media watchdog <I>COMINT</I>
magazine, the public has received a mere nine hours of programming.
Perhaps this is a blessing, given ITVS's focus.  One five-hour
series called <I>Television Families,</I> for which ITVS (through
the taxpayers) ponied up $1.9 million, plans to feature &quot;tales
of more or less dysfunctional families&quot; which &quot;all fall
outside the mainstream.&quot; ITVS earlier had announced that
it is seeking programs that will &quot;test the boundaries, both
of form and content, that have defined the family's role on television.&quot;
 These include &quot;new alternative households, new patterns
for adoption and birth...new articulations of rights for children.&quot;
<P>
The anti-family agenda in this case is obvious.  It incorporates
and goes beyond <I>Murphy Brown's</I> glorification of single
motherhood.  The term &quot;alternative households&quot; is often
used to describe homosexual households and other non-traditional
households, putting them on the same moral plane as traditional
families.  &quot;New patterns for adoption and birth&quot; are
terms used to describe adoption of children by homosexuals and
artificial insemination.  &quot;Children's rights&quot; is the
anti-parent philosophy in which the state knows best when it comes
to handing out condoms, referring children to abortionists and
otherwise undermining the authority of parents. 
<P>
Another ITVS offering is <I>Dottie Gets Spanked</I>, a mockery
of 1950s American family life from the producer of the cult homosexual
films <I>Superstar</I> and <I>Poison</I>.  Yet another is <I>Terminal
USA</I>, described by the ITVS newsletter <I>Buzzwords</I> as
being about &quot;wholly unwholesome folks&quot; who &quot;cram
a lot of skeletons in their closet: drug abuse, homosexuality,
teen pregnancy, elderly abuse, unemployment, and infidelity (with
the pizza delivery boy) -- all under one roof.&quot; Making a
gratuitous slam on conservative Christians, <I>Buzzwords</I> concludes:
&quot;Unlike the absolute 'family values' of censorship-minded
evangelicals, <I>TV Families</I> values all kinds of families.&quot;[9]
<P>
<LI>In May of 1992 PBS broadcast a documentary called <I>What Kids
Want to Know About Sex and Growing Up</I>.  Produced by the Children's
Television Workshop, the show was an attack on traditional family
values in the guise of a pseudo-scientific presentation. 
<P>
The program contains graphic sexual information, aimed at children
as young as 8 years old.  Children are encouraged to use condoms
without being informed about high condom failure rates.  Abstinence
is given only a passing mention.  Parents are nearly invisible,
as are clergy or any other adults who would normally articulate
moral and familial ramifications of sexuality. 
<P>
Having a baby is illustrated through an exercise in which teens
carry around a bag of flour for a week and then talk about how
it cramps their style.  This exercise fails to take into account
the joys of parenthood.  It dehumanizes babies and subordinates
life itself to the cold sexual imperative. 
<P>
None of the instructors use the word &quot;marriage&quot; in any
context.  Sex is portrayed strictly as a physical act, without
the larger moral and social contexts that constitute the real
&quot;facts of life.&quot;  &quot;Husbands&quot; and &quot;wives&quot;
are not mentioned, just &quot;partners.&quot; This video is now
available in commercial video stores.
<P>
<LI>Children's Television Workshop also publishes <I>Sesame Street
Parents</I> magazine, which features an advice column by New York
University psychologist Lawrence Balter.   In the January/February
1994 issue, Dr. Balter advises parents that masturbation is a
&quot;tension-relieving activity that, much like hair twirling
and thumb-sucking, serves to soothe and calm children.  Masturbation
can also help a child learn more about his body and help him develop
positive attitudes toward sex....Avoid telling your son that touching
himself is 'not nice.'&quot;[10]
<P>
<LI>In 1992, the POV (Point of View) series began with <I>Color
Adjustment</I>, a documentary by homosexual writer and AIDS victim,
the late Marlon Riggs (see <I>Tongues Untied</I> item below),
who complained about the heterosexual bias of most family programming:
&quot;Have we exchanged the myths of pre-television America for
new fictions just as confining, for impossibly rigid, homogenized
fictions of the family, and the American dream....?&quot;[11]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>PRO-HOMOSEXUAL PROGRAMMING</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<LI>On January 5, 1995, National Public Radio's &quot;All Things
Considered&quot; ran what amounted to a promotion of homosexual
punk rock music, focusing on the new activist group Homocore.
 NPR reporter Rick Carr describes New York's Pansy Division as
&quot;one of hundreds of bands that infuse punk rock's do-it-yourself
aesthetic with gay themes.&quot;[12] 
<P>
<LI>In early 1994, PBS ran the miniseries <I>Tales of the City</I>,
a celebration of homosexuality in San Francisco during the 1970s.
 The series presents the homosexual lifestyle as superior to marriage
and family, with few apparent consequences from promiscuous sex
or illicit drugs.  The series is full of gratuitous nudity, crudity,
lewdness and foul language.  Traditional families are lampooned
through stereotypical caricatures of stupid fathers and meddling
mothers.  The only person dying from an incurable disease is a
heterosexual businessman who winds up cheating on his wife with
a transsexual.  Even an edited version of the series that ran
on Oklahoma public television caused a &quot;quite a bit of animosity
amongst a considerable number of legislators from rural areas,&quot;
Bob Allen of Oklahoma ETV told <I>Current</I>, a public broadcasting
trade journal.[13] The publication noted that <I>Tales</I> had also
drawn acclaim from critics and &quot;just about everywhere, local
outlets heard both praise and disapproval from viewers.&quot;[14]
<P>
<LI>In 1991, PBS aired a film documentary titled <I>Tongues Untied</I>.
 Written by ITVS grant recipient Marlon Riggs and shown under
the banner of POV, the documentary was so offensive that more
than 100 PBS stations refused to air it.  Still, many urban stations
did air the show, which contained full frontal nudity, bare buttocks
and 20 seconds of two men disrobing and having sex.
<P>
<LI>In June of 1992, PBS aired <I>The Lost Language of Cranes</I>
as part of Gay Pride Month.  The film features a father and son
&quot;coming out,&quot;  to declare their homosexuality.  The
movie also shows a man attempting to initiate anonymous sex with
a man in a homosexual porn theater.  Graphic scenes of homosexuals
kissing and engaging in sex are also featured.
<P>
Homosexual activists have acknowledged CPB's contribution to their
cause.  At a public hearing on CPB held in Washington, D.C. in
January 1994, Cathy Renna of the Gay and Lesbian Alliance Against
Defamation (GLAAD) congratulated CPB, which, she said, &quot;has
aired many documentaries, films, and series that have touched
on or dealt with gay issues.&quot; She urged CPB to &quot;continue
to bring as much gay-oriented programming as possible to the viewing
public without fear of reprisal or complaint.&quot;[15] At the same
hearing, Gregory King of the Human Rights Campaign Fund noted,
&quot;...the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, through your
support of National Public Radio and the Public Broadcasting Service,
has had an important impact on the ability of lesbian and gay
Americans to emerge from the shadows of society into the sunlight
of American life.&quot;[16] He singled out NPR's <I>Morning Edition</I>,
<I>The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour</I> and the <I>Charlie Rose Show</I>,
which &quot;regularly include discussions with gay and lesbian
Americans on issues of public importance,&quot; and praised CPB
for its support of gay-themed programming, such as <I>In the Life</I>,
<I>The American Playhouse</I>, <I>Longtime Companion</I>, <I>Andre's
Mother</I>, <I>The AIDS Quarterly</I>, <I>The Lost Language of
Cranes</I>, <I>Silverlake Life: The View from Here</I> and Armistead
Maupin's <I>Tales of the City</I> for bringing &quot;gay and lesbian
concerns into the mainstream of American life, where they belong.&quot;[17]
<P>
What King failed to add is that these aforementioned programs
are loaded with homosexual activists' propaganda and ignore the
health consequences of homosexual behavior.  They also ignore
the existence of the burgeoning ex-gay movement, reserving that
topic for the smear show, <I>One Nation Under God</I>.  PBS' pro-homosexual
programs also typically screen out any knowledgeable opponents
of the gay rights movement. 
<P>
In closing, King urged CPB to &quot;continue to provide leadership
in using the airwaves...to break the bonds of bigotry.&quot;[18]
<P>
Speaking of bigotry, public broadcasting harbors the last respectable
form of bigotry in America: Christian bashing.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>ANTI-RELIGIOUS PROGRAMMING</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<LI>On September 6, 1993, National Public Radio's <I>All Things
Considered</I> chronicled a controversy in Colorado Springs. 
The story was about some parents who objected to their children
being baptized without their parents' knowledge during a local
church carnival.[19] The controversy was real, and the conflict compelling.
 However NPR's handling of the story was anything but evenhanded.
<P>
Opening remarks by the reporter implied that children are no longer
safe in Colorado Springs because of the presence of Christian
groups.  No spokesmen are included to combat the anonymous charge
that Colorado Springs is fraught with &quot;religious extremism.&quot;
 The story presented an organization named The Citizen's Project
as a &quot;liberal volunteer&quot; organization that promotes
communication and understanding between its members and conservative
Christians.  However, on another program aired on NPR, which was
also openly biased against Christians, the Citizen's Project is
described as a &quot;watchdog&quot; organization that gives citizens
a sense of belonging by &quot;organizing opposition to [the Christian]
agenda.&quot;
<P>
<LI>In October of 1993, NPR broadcast a documentary titled <I>The
Politics of Bigotry</I>.  Described as an &quot;in-depth investigation
of the Christian Right...,&quot; the show was actually an ugly
smear of Christians which violated the First Amendment protection
against infringement on the free exercise of religion.  
<P>
The two-and-a-half hour documentary contains many opinions presented
as if they were fact and gives Christians no opportunity to respond
to the majority of statements made by their detractors.
<P>
<LI>A segment of PBS's <I>Bill Moyers' Journal</I> titled <I>The
New Holy War</I>[20] was supposed to be a documentary about Colorado's
&quot;Amendment Two,&quot; a statewide ballot initiative which
would have prohibited political jurisdictions across the state
from granting special rights to homosexuals.  Instead it was an
anti-religious hit piece disguised as balanced journalism.  The
issue is framed in terms of a struggle between homosexuals, who
Moyers portrays as oppressed victims fighting for their rights,
and Evangelical Christians, who are pictured as intolerant bigots.
<P>
Moyers works hard to pass himself off as an objective journalist.
 However, he reveals his bias when he conducts an in-depth critical
look at an organization supporting Amendment Two without so much
as mentioning any one of the several organizations fighting against
it.  Also, Moyers fails to inform viewers of vote totals, the
percentage of evangelical Christians in the state, or that many
non-evangelicals supported Amendment Two.  Moyers charges, but
fails to present any evidence, that the conflict was strictly
between homosexuals and Christians.[21]
<P>
Moyers' greatest omission was his failure to present an accurate
portrayal of the homosexual lifestyle.  The show features male
and female homosexual couples who are clean cut, monogamous and
well-spoken.  While this image may be true of the couples featured
on the show, it is in sharp contrast with what the research tells
us about the homosexual lifestyle.  Research shows that male homosexuals
typically are quite promiscuous, with many sexual partners over
the course of a lifetime.  In addition, homosexuals are at high
risk for a host of sexually transmitted diseases and violence
within relationships.  Homosexual males typically and tragically
have shorter lifespans.[22]  Homosexuals are also more likely to have
drug and alcohol abuse problems.[23]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>RADICAL POLITICAL PROGRAMMING</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Ultra-left <I>Pacifica</I> radio, along with PBS's <I>Frontline</I>,
<I>Point of View</I> and dozens of PBS specials, have been criticized
for left-wing bias.  Some recent examples:
<P>
<UL><LI> In 1992, KPFK, the <I>Pacifica</I> station in Los Angeles, broadcast
an <I>African Mental Liberation Weekend</I>.  The 26-hour marathon
of speeches and interviews was called a &quot;hatefeast&quot;
by members of the L.A. Jewish community.[24] Speakers included Louis
Farrakhan, who said that whites and Jews were &quot;the pale horse
with death its rider and hell close behind.&quot;[25] The broadcast
also featured black supremacist Leonard Jeffries lecturing on
Jewish involvement in the slave trade and Steve Cokely, who evoked
a &quot;Jew doctors conspiracy to infect black children with AIDS.&quot;[26]
<P>
<LI>In May 1994, NPR announced plans to run prison-life commentaries
by convicted cop-killer and former Black Panther Mumia Abu-Jamal,
claiming that the show would bring a &quot;unique perspective
to listeners.&quot;[27] Although the show was canceled after Sen.
Robert Dole took to the Senate floor to decry CPB's lack of balance,
the incident raised serious questions about CPB's judgment and
commitment to balanced programming. 
<P>
<LI>Several specials have been broadcast which support totalitarian
and anti-American causes.  For example: <I>Maria's Story</I>,
a show about the war in El Salvador from the communist FMLN's
perspective and <I>Cuba in the Shadow of Doubt</I>, which was
described by a <I>New York Times</I> critic as having &quot;...a
romantic infatuation with Cuba.&quot;[28] Another example is a PBS
documentary on families divided over the Castro regime entitled
<I>Miami-Havana</I>.  The credits of the film contain a &quot;special
thanks&quot; to the Combinado del Este prison.  According to Alberto
Mora, a Cuban-American lawyer, &quot;no prison has a grislier
reputation than Combinado del Este.  Mind you, this notoriety
stands out even in the context of a prison system infamous for
its barbarism.&quot;[29]
<P></UL>
<CENTER><H3>NO NEED FOR SUBSIDIES</H3></CENTER>
<P>
In a truly free broadcasting market, programs of very limited
appeal would most likely not garner advertising support.  They
would be confined to media that are supported by those who seek
this information.  Left-leaning foundations and individual donors
might be persuaded to fund them, but they have little incentive
to do so while it is so easy to tap the taxpayers.
<P>
The programs mentioned above are not the examples that CPB supporters
cite when they complain that good programming would be lost without
CPB.  Instead, CPB advocates point to popular shows such as <I>Sesame
Street</I> and <I>The MacNeil/Lehrer NewsHour</I>.  They fail
to mention that the popular shows will fare well in free market
competition.  Children's Television Workshop, parent company of
<I>Sesame Street</I>, has a stock and bond portfolio worth more
than $51 million.[30] And gross merchandising sales of Sesame Street
items rack up $1 billion annually, earning CTW about $100 million
in royalties.[31] One divisional CTW president had an annual salary,
including bonuses, of $625,000.[32] 
<P>
CPB funding makes up only 14 percent of public broadcasting's
total budget.[33] Federal grants from other agencies, such as the
National Endowment for the Arts, make up another 5 percent.  The
rest comes from donors, businesses, foundations, state governments,
public colleges and universities, auction participants and private
colleges and universities.  All told, 49 percent of public broadcasting's
budget comes from taxpayers at all levels, but the direct federal
component makes up only 19 percent.[34]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Pulling CPB's tax-funded plug would force producers to take into
account the tastes of their audiences and would motivate public
broadcasters to look to their lucrative offspring, like Barney
or Bill Moyers, to contribute more to the collective coffers.
 The result? Good programming would continue to thrive, and the
offensive and meritless programs would likely go the way of that
other big bird, the dodo.  
<P>
It's time to zero-budget the Corporation for Public Broadcasting.
 Big Bird should leave the nest of Big Government and fly on his
own.

TITLE X's FAMILY PLANNING FAILURE</H2>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<I>by </I>
<P>
<I>Gracie S. Hsu</I></CENTER>
<P>
Title X of the Public Health Service Act is a categorical grant
issued by the federal government to fund family planning projects
throughout the United States.  Enacted in 1970, Title X was supposed
to help reduce the unplanned pregnancy rate, especially in the
teenager population.  However, Title X has not only failed to
reduce the teenage pregnancy rate, but teenage reproductive health
has drastically worsened in every category.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>TITLE X'S IMPACT ON TEENAGE HEALTH</H3></CENTER> 
<P>
Over the lifetime of Title X, the number of teenage clients has
grown due to increases in both Title X funding and the overall
number of enrollees in Title X clinics.  Currently, an estimated
1.5 million Title X clients are teenagers, constituting approximately
one-third of the program's total clientele.  But even though more
teenagers are being exposed to these family planning &quot;services,&quot;
the rates of out-of-wedlock births, abortions, sexually-transmitted
diseases, and pregnancies have all risen significantly in the
teenage population since the program's inception.
<P><UL>
<LI><B>Out-of-wedlock births -- <I>Since the introduction
of Title X, the teenage out-of-wedlock birth rate has doubled.</B></I>
 The out-of-wedlock birth rate per 1,000 unmarried girls aged
15-19 rose from 22.4 in 1970 to 44.6 in 1992 (teen births have
declined since 1992).
<P>
This illegitimacy figure is especially important to note because
Title X advocates have sought to claim &quot;success&quot; by
pointing out that the overall teenage birth rate has declined.
 However, such a decline is only attributable to the decline in
<I>marital</I> births, <I>not</I> in illegitimate births.  In
1970, seventy percent of teenage births were marital; in 1991,
7 in 10 teenage births occurred <I>outside</I> marriage.
<P>
The same trend toward out-of-wedlock childbearing is evidenced
in the female population at large.  In 1970 when Title X began,
children living with one parent were more than four times as likely
to be products of divorce as they were to have been born out-of-wedlock.
 But by 1993, the Census Bureau reports found that American children
who live with one parent were almost equally divided between children
of divorce and those born to unmarried parents.
<P>
<LI><B>Abortions -- <I>Over the lifetime of Title X, the
teenage abortion rate has more than doubled.</B></I>  In 1972,
the abortion rate per 1,000 girls aged 15-19 was 19.1; in 1990,
the rate was 40.6.  While the abortion rate grew rapidly from
1972 to the early 1980s, the rate has apparently reached a plateau,
hovering between 40 and 43 abortions per 1,000 teenage girls over
the last 10 years.
<P>
While the rapid growth of the teenage abortion rate during the
early years of Title X is no doubt attributable, in large measure,
to the <I>Roe v. Wade</I> decision, the past decade's more stabilized
abortion rate cannot be viewed optimistically.  For during this
time, a rapid rise also occurred in out-of-wedlock births.
<P>
Interestingly, the women whom Title X clinics target -- low-income
women, minorities, and unmarried young people -- have the highest
abortion rates.  And, the Alan Guttmacher Institute reports that
half of all women having an abortion used a contraceptive method
in the month during which they conceived.
<P>
<LI><B>Sexually-Transmitted Diseases (STDs) -- <I>Sexually-transmitted
diseases among teenagers have increased dramatically despite the
fact that many Title X clinics provide both contraception and
STD screening.  In fact, teenagers now have higher rates of gonorrhea
than any other 5-year age group between 20 and 44.</B></I>  Currently,
one in four sexually experienced teenagers -- about 3 million
-- become infected with an STD every year.
<P>
For the first time ever, teenage girls have the highest gonorrhea
rates in the nation; teenage boys rank second.  The rate in adolescent
girls is 20 times higher than in women over 30, according to the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC).  Infectious
syphilis rates more than doubled among teenagers since the mid-1980s.
 Additionally, up to 15 percent of sexually experienced teenage
girls are infected with human papilloma virus, many of them carrying
a strain that can cause cervical cancer.  Chlamydia also has spread
explosively, currently infecting 22 percent of sexually active
girls and 10 percent of sexually active boys.  Finally, one in
five reported full-blown AIDS cases is diagnosed among people
in their 20s.  Due to the virus' long incubation period (about
10 years), most were adolescents when they were infected, according
to the CDC.
<P>
Sexually-transmitted diseases can lead to cancer, pelvic inflammatory
disease, ectopic pregnancy, infertility, and/or even death.  Estimates
from the general population indicate that between 100,000 and
150,000 women become infertile each year as a result of an STD,
and about 15 to 30 percent of the 2.3 million U.S. couples who
are infertile may be unable to conceive as a result of an STD.
 But beyond infertility, STDs also increase the likelihood of
contracting HIV.  According to some estimates, having an STD,
such as gonorrhea, increases by as much as 100 times the chance
of contracting HIV from an infected partner.
<P>
<LI><B>Pregnancies -- <I>Since the introduction of Title
X, the out-of-wedlock pregnancy rate among 15-to 19-year-old girls
has doubled.</B></I>  In the same time span, the <I>overall</I>
teenage pregnancy rate (marital and nonmarital) increased 23 percent,
climbing from 95.1 per 1,000 girls aged 15-19 in 1972 to 117.1
in 1990.  So not only did the overall teenage pregnancy rate increase,
but a greater proportion of these pregnancies are now out-of-wedlock.
 This trend is best evidenced by the growing rate of out-of-wedlock
births.  When Title X began, only 3 in 10 teen births were out-of-wedlock;
now 7 in 10 teen births occur outside marriage.
<P>
Despite the 23 percent increase in the overall teen pregnancy
rate, Title X advocates still claim &quot;success&quot; by stating
that &quot;fewer sexually experienced teenagers become pregnant
each year.&quot;  Advocates often remark that the pregnancy rate
among sexually experienced teenagers has decreased from 254 to
207 per 1,000 (19%) in the last two decades.  However, this figure
is derived from a statistical invention called the &quot;sexually
experienced teenage pregnancy rate&quot; (SETPR) which obscures
the disastrous changes in teenage sexual activity and ignores
the real indices of social health, i.e., the rates of teenage
pregnancy, abortion, out-of-wedlock births, and STDs.  The fact
is, a greater proportion of teenagers are sexually experienced
today than 20 years ago.
<P>
Consider the following hypothetical comparison of two nations,
Country A and Country B:
<p><pre><center>
<B>Country    # of teenage     # sexually     # pregnant    SETPR
          girls 15-19      active         annually           </B>
<P>
  A        1,000,000        500,000       200,000       400
  B        1,000,000        100,000       50,000        500
</center></pre><p>
In this straightforward example, Country B has a 25% higher &quot;sexually
experienced teenage pregnancy rate&quot; than Country A.  But
Country B has only one-fifth the sexual activity rate of Country
A and one-fourth of its teenage pregnancy rate.  In fact, it is
obvious that Country A can have a lower SETPR than Country B while
still having a higher sexual activity rate, a higher rate of STDs,
a higher number of pregnancies, and both four times as many abortions
and out-of-wedlock births as Country B!  SETPR may be of some
statistical interest at the margin, but as a measure of adolescent
well-being it is not merely useless, but grossly misleading.
</UL><P>
<CENTER><H3>TITLE X FUNDING</H3></CENTER>
<P>
By all accounts, teenage reproductive health has suffered under
Title X's watch.  Yet, incredibly, Title X programs continue to
receive <I>increased</I> government funding, currently reaching
an all-time high of $193 million for fiscal year 1995.  Why? 
Because there is <I>no</I> <I>accountability</I> or measure of
effectiveness connected to the funding of the program.  There
has never been an evaluation component included in the grants;
and in 1983, the Department of Health and Human Services discontinued
collecting client data.
<P>
The federal government is not only funding a failed program, it
is funding an <I>unauthorized</I> program.  Title X's funding
authorization officially expired in 1985, but the program continues
to receive federal dollars every year through inclusion in the
Labor/Health and Human Services Appropriations bill.
<P>
<B>PROHIBITION OF ABORTION</B> -- Section 1008 of Title X states
that &quot;none of the funds appropriated under this title shall
be used in programs where abortion is a method of family planning.&quot;
 Yet many of the clinics which receive Title X funds perform abortions
in addition to providing other family planning services.  These
clinics creatively &quot;obey&quot; the prohibition by maintaining
separate budgets for abortion and family planning.  However, when
self-titled &quot;family planning&quot; clinics perform abortions
and refer clients for abortion when contraception fails, an implicit
assumption exists that abortion is indeed a method of family planning.
 Additionally, many Planned Parenthood (PP) clinics receive Title
X funds.  And while not all of these PP clinics perform abortions,
Planned Parenthood's reputation as an abortion provider is undisputable.
 Thus, to the client, no relevant distinction is made between
abortion and family planning; in fact, the prohibition has been
reduced to a mere bookkeeping formality.  Such a misuse of the
statute must be immediately halted and the integrity of the prohibition's
original intent restored.
<P>
<CENTER> <H3>TEENAGE SEXUAL ACTIVITY AND CONTRACEPTIVE USE</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Poor teenage reproductive health outcomes and Title X funding
are clearly correlated.  But the question that begs to be answered
is, &quot;What accounts for the correlation?  What effect do contraceptive
counseling and dispensing have on teenagers' sexual behavior?&quot;
 While such questions cannot be answered easily, there are clues
which point in a common direction.
<UL><P>
<LI>Sexual activity rates among teenagers are higher now than ever
before.  Currently, fifty-six percent of girls and 73 percent
of boys have intercourse before age 18, compared to 35 percent
and 55 percent in the early 1970s.
<P>
<LI>A 1993 <I>Public Health Reports</I> article found that adolescent
males who had been instructed in sexual biology and birth control
were at a higher risk of early first intercourse than were those
who had received no instruction.
<P>
<LI>Research from Planned Parenthood shows that the number one reason,
by far, that teenagers initiate sexual activity is peer pressure.
 By promoting contraceptive use among teenagers, Title X clinics
reduce the number of outside forces bolstering teenagers' resolve
to save sex for marriage.
</UL><P>
<B>MULTIPLE PARTNERS</B> -- According to the Centers for Disease
Control, &quot;The initiation of sexual intercourse early in life
is associated with an increased number of sex partners and a greater
risk for sexually transmitted diseases (STDs).&quot;  Data show
that one-half of sexually experienced teenage girls wait almost
18 months between first intercourse and having sex with a second
sexual partner; another one-fourth wait almost 2 years.  Thus,
helping teenagers to delay sex initiation is especially important.
<P>
However, evidence also indicates that <I>contraceptive use leads
to increased sexual activity, with a greater number of partners.</I>
 Consequently, the dispensing of prescription contraceptives without
parental involvement by family planning clinics would serve to
exacerbate this trend -- which is, in fact, what is happening
today.
<UL><P>
<LI>Among sexually active girls aged 15-17, 55 percent have had
2 or more partners and 13 percent have had at least 6.
<P>
<LI>Between 1971 and 1988, the percentage of sexually experienced
women aged 15-19 living in urban areas who reported 4 or more
sex partners increased from 14% to 31%.
<P>
<LI>Forty-five percent of 15-24-year-olds who had initiated sexual
intercourse before age 18 reported having had four or more partners;
75 percent reported having had two or more partners.
<P>
<LI>Dr. Robert Kistner of Harvard Medical School, one of the developers
of the oral contraceptive, subsequently acknowledged that use
of contraceptives among teenagers is stimulating higher levels
of promiscuity:  &quot;About ten years ago I declared that the
pill would not lead to promiscuity.  Well, I was wrong,&quot;
he said (<I>Family Practice News</I>, 1977).
</UL><P>
<B>CONTRACEPTIVE FAILURE</B> -- Not only does contraceptive use
lead to increased sexual activity with a greater number of partners,
but contraception is not terribly effective at protecting teenagers
from unplanned pregnancy and/or STD infection.  Indeed, one-third
of teenage pregnancies occur <I>while a contraceptive is being
used</I>, and this figure does not even take into account the
STD transmission rate.
<P>
In part, this is due to the fact that no contraceptive method
is highly effective in protecting simultaneously against pregnancy
and infection.  Contraceptives with the best record for reducing
pregnancy risk offer little, if any, protection against STDs.
 On the other hand, condoms have a standardized failure rate of
15.7 percent at preventing <I>pregnancy</I> over the course of
a year; in teenagers, the rate is even higher.  In addition to
a poor contraceptive record, condoms have not been shown to be
effective at protecting women against STD infection.  A recent
<I>Family Planning Perspectives</I> article found that condoms
may protect women against some STDs, but the data are equivocal.
 In several studies, condoms showed no protective effect against
cervical human papilloma virus, chlamydia, or bacterial vaginosis
in women.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>MATERNAL AND INFANT MORTALITY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Maternal and infant mortality might not seem, at first glance,
to be related to a discussion of Title X's impact on teenagers;
but, in reality, the two concepts are inextricably connected.
 Title X's mandate is to reduce maternal and infant mortality
and to promote the health of mothers and children.  However, Title
X has miserably failed in fulfilling this mandate.  America ranks
24th in the world in infant survival, a very low ranking for a
developed country, let alone the wealthiest country in the world.
 And the problems associated with Title X -- out-of-wedlock births,
teenage pregnancies, and STDs -- are major factors undermining
maternal and infant health.
<UL><P>
<LI><B>Out-of-wedlock births</B> -- Nicholas Eberstadt and others
have shown that marital status at birth is the key indicator for
infant mortality, transcending both ethnicity and poverty.  And
the out-of-wedlock teenage birth rate has soared under Title X's
watch.
<P>
<LI><B>Teenage pregnancy</B> -- One major cause of infant mortality
is low birth weight, which is directly related to teenage pregnancy.
 Thus it comes as no surprise that Title X's failure to reduce
teenage pregnancy would also result in higher infant mortality.
<P>
<LI><B>Sexually-transmitted diseases</B> -- As was discussed earlier,
STDs have a negative impact on women's health, possibly leading
to cancer, infertility, and even death.  Ectopic pregnancies,
which can be caused by STDs, have quadrupled since 1970, and the
rate of infertility among women has also dramatically increased.
 But in addition to women, STDs hurt infants.  The infection of
infants from the mother's STDs (including, but not limited to
HIV) has become a significant problem and will only continue to
worsen as nonmarital sexual activity remains unchecked.
</UL><P>
<CENTER><H3>FRC RECOMMENDATIONS REGARDING TITLE X</CENTER></H3>
<P>
<B>(1)</B>  <B>Remove all funding from Title X</B> -- Title X
has not only failed to reduce the rates of teenage pregnancy,
out-of-wedlock births, and sexually-transmitted diseases, it has
exacerbated these problems.  The program's lack of evaluation
criteria and its approach as an open-ended project grant have
frustrated accountability.
<P>
Title X does not deserve to continue receiving taxpayer dollars
and, in fact, <I>should</I> not be receiving federal dollars,
as an unauthorized program.  The federal government has a responsibility
to use federal funds wisely, and it should not be funding programs
which, by all accounts, have produced worsened health outcomes.
<P>
<B>(2)</B>  <B>If Title X comes up for reauthorization, do not
reauthorize</B> -- Title X's authorization expired in 1985.  And
Title X should remain unauthorized because it has never been shown
to benefit the American public.
<P>
<B>(3)</B>  <B>Promote saving sex for the context of marriage</B>
-- If the federal government must play a role in &quot;family
planning,&quot; it ought to promote the optimum health message
-- that sex should be saved for marriage.  Research shows that
people who postpone sexual activity until marriage and practice
monogamy within marriage are more likely to be sexually satisfied,
to have enduring marriages, and to be free from the ravages of
out-of-wedlock pregnancies and sexually-transmitted diseases.

<P>
Adoption is a good choice and sound policy.  And now it is finally
receiving some well-deserved attention by Congress.  Under consideration
are two laudable reform proposals which would make it easier for
more people to choose adoption.
<P>
(1) <B>Reducing financial obstacles</B> -- The House GOP's Contract
with America includes the Family Reinforcement Act, of which adoption
assistance is a primary component.  This proposal would make adoption
a more affordable choice for prospective adoptive parents by allowing
a tax credit of up to $5,000 for qualified adoption expenses.
 These expenses could include adoption fees, court costs, attorney
fees, and other expenses which are directly related to the legal
adoption of the child.  Appropriately, the legislation explicitly
excludes payments to surrogate mothers and to individuals adopting
their spouse's children.
<P>
(2) <B>Reducing legal (and psychological) barriers -- </B>As
a proposed amendment to the welfare reform bill, the National
Council for Adoption has suggested that unmarried mothers who
place their babies for adoption should be exempted from provisions
which require welfare recipients to identify the father of the
child as a condition of receiving assistance.  The proposal recognizes
paternal rights by giving fathers a period of up to thirty days
after the child's birth to come forward and claim custody of the
child.  Should the father fail to do so, his rights would be terminated,
and the child would be eligible for adoption.  This proposal should
be reviewed as a possible alternative to single parenthood that
increases the incentive for unwed mothers to choose adoption.
<P>
These proposals are laudable because they encourage adoption --
a beneficial option for the birthmother, the adopted child, and
the adoptive parents.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>BENEFITS OF ADOPTION FOR THE CHILD</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Adoption holds many benefits for the child involved.  Recently,
the Search Institute conducted the largest U.S. study of adopted
adolescents and their families to evaluate the mental health of
these adolescents at a time when they are forming their identities.
 This study, combined with other research, found that adopted
adolescents reap the following benefits:
<P>
<UL><LI><B>A Loving, Intact Family</B> -- Ninety percent of adopted
children live with married parents, and these families exhibit
high levels of warmth, communication, discipline, and cohesion.
 Indeed, the Search Institute's representative sample found that
only 11 percent of adopted adolescents report divorce or separation
compared to 28 percent in a national survey of adolescents.
<P>
<LI><B>Deep Child-Parent Attachment</B> -- Adopted adolescents
are as deeply attached to their parents as are their non-adopted
siblings.  Fifty-four percent report strong attachment to both
parents; another 30 percent are deeply attached to one parent.
 Equally compelling is the fact that 95 percent of parents experience
strong attachment to their adopted child.
<P>
<LI><B>Strong Self-Identity</B> -- Most adopted adolescents have
a strong self-identity, exhibiting higher levels of self-esteem
than their peers.  They accept their adoptive status with relative
ease and are as likely to report a positive self-identity as their
non-adopted siblings.
<P>
<LI><B>Positive Psychological Health</B> -- Based on multiple
indices of psychological health, the study found that at least
three-quarters of adopted adolescents are within the zone of positive
psychological health, even surpassing a comparison sample of public
school adolescents on several measures.
<P>
<LI><B>Financial Provision</B> -- Fifty-four percent of adopted
children live in homes with family income three times higher than
poverty level.
</UL><P>
<CENTER><H3>BENEFITS OF ADOPTION FOR THE SINGLE MOTHER</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Research shows that young, unmarried women who choose adoption
for their babies reap many personal benefits.  Comparing favorably
to their counterparts, who choose single parenthood, women who
choose adoption exhibit the following characteristics.  They are:
<P>
<UL><LI>More likely to complete high school and advance further educationally.
<LI>More likely to be employed and have a higher income.
<LI>Less likely to live in poverty.
<LI>Less likely to receive public assistance than birth mothers
who chose to parent out-of-wedlock.  In fact, 60 percent of welfare
recipients are, or were at one time, teenage mothers.
<LI>More likely to marry subsequently.
<LI><B>Less likely to have a repeat out-of-wedlock pregnancy</B>
than the teenagers who choose parenting or abortion.
</UL><P>
<CENTER><H3>THE NEED FOR ADOPTION POLICY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Adoption provides children with the benefits of solid, two-parent
homes while giving birthmothers the opportunity to mature before
taking on the adult responsibilities of childrearing.  That policy
should encourage adoption as a positive alternative for women
facing crisis pregnancies seems especially prudent during this
time when our nation's rates of out-of-wedlock pregnancy, abortion,
and single parenthood are skyrocketing.
<P>
<UL><LI><B>Illegitimacy</B> -- Births to unmarried teenagers continue
to escalate dramatically.  In 1992, there were 365,000 out-of-wedlock
teenage births -- a six-fold increase since 1950.  But even in
the population at large (not limited to teenagers), illegitimacy
is rampant.  Thirty percent of all our nation's children were
born to unwed mothers in 1991; in the black community, the figure
was an astounding 68 percent.
<P>
<LI><B>Single Parenthood</B> -- The number of children being raised
in single-parent homes is rapidly rising.  In 1970, 7.5 million
children lived in single, female-headed homes; by 1993, the figure
had more than doubled to 15.6 million.  In fact, over 27 percent
of all children under 18 live in single-parent homes (1993).
<P>
<LI><B>Abortion</B> -- Abortion is strongly linked to unwed pregnancy.
 Indeed, unmarried mothers account for 70 to 80 percent of the
1.5 million abortions performed on U.S. women; 406,000 abortions
were obtained by teenagers in 1992.  Thus, helping to make adoption
a more viable option could mean (1) fewer abortions, including
repeat abortions, and (2) many women being spared from experiencing
the trauma of post-abortion syndrome.
<P>
<LI><B>Poverty</B> -- Regardless of race or socioeconomic background,
a high correlation exists between single parenthood and poverty.
 Of all children under age 6 living in poverty, 61 percent are
from single-parent families (1992).  In fact, children under age
6 from single-parent households are more likely to live in poverty
than not.
<P>
<LI><B>Breaking the cycle</B> -- For the child of a single parent,
the statistical odds of becoming an unwed mother later in life,
or fathering a child out-of-wedlock, are staggering.  One study
found that 80 percent of the girls who were mothers at 15 were
themselves daughters of teenage mothers.  Adoption can help break
that cycle.
</UL><P>
The American public overwhelmingly supports adoption policy. 
A recent Family Research Council survey of 1,000 Americans found
that, by a margin of 3-to-1, respondents favor efforts &quot;to
make it easier for children born out-of-wedlock to be adopted.&quot;
 And when presented with four options to resolve out-of-wedlock
teenage pregnancies, 33 percent of respondents thought it best
to &quot;have the child and put it up for adoption;&quot; 25 percent
thought it best for the mother &quot;to marry the child's father
and have the child;&quot; 13 percent thought it best for the mother
&quot;to have the child and raise it by herself;&quot; and only
10 percent thought it best for her to have an abortion.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>THE CURRENT STATUS OF ADOPTION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Even though most people agree that adoption is a good choice,
few exercise that option.  Only 6 percent of all teenage mothers
choose adoption for their babies; in the black community, adoption
accounts for less than one percent.  So while the number of potentially
adoptable children is theoretically large due to the high numbers
of out-of-wedlock births and crisis pregnancies, there remains,
ironically, a shortage of children.  An estimated one to two million
prospective parents are <I>still waiting to adopt a child</I>.
<P>
Perhaps one of the reasons why so few unwed mothers choose adoption
for their babies is that adoption frequently is not presented
to women as a viable choice.  One study found that nearly 40 percent
of pregnancy counselors fail to include adoption as an option
in their counseling.  Even worse, the counselors had a 40 percent
rate of uncertainty and inaccurate knowledge about adoption. 
Incredibly, some pregnancy counselors who thought adoption would
be a good choice still failed to present it as an option, because
they thought the girls would not want to hear about it.
<P>
Consequently, the number of adoptions reflects the lack of attention
adoption has received.  The latest available data show that 51,157
unrelated adoptions (adoptions by people not related to the child
by blood or marriage) of American children occurred in 1986. 
Of these 51,000-plus domestic adoptions, approximately one-half
were adoptions of healthy infants (under 2 years of age) of all
races and ethnic backgrounds.  The remaining adoptions were of
older kids or of children with special needs, i.e., physical,
mental, or emotional disabilities, part of a sibling group, etc.
<P>
In addition to the adoption of American children, there were 10,097
foreign-born children adopted by Americans in 1987.  However,
due to a decrease in the number of adoptions of South Korean children,
this figure has since declined to an estimated 6,500 adoptions
in fiscal year 1992.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>FURTHER POLICY RECOMMENDATIONS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Because of adoption's many benefits for both mother and child,
enabling more women to choose adoption should be a policy priority.
 Thus, in addition to the two proposals discussed earlier, the
Family Research Council recommends the following measures to make
the promotion of adoption more comprehensive.
<P>
(1)  Protocol for counseling women in crisis pregnancies should
include presentation of the adoption choice and its manifold benefits.
 This protocol should be used by counselors regardless of their
place of employment, i.e., crisis pregnancy centers, public health
facilities, and abortion clinics.  Inherent in this recommendation
is the expectation that such counselors would be properly trained
and adequately informed about the adoption option.  Furthermore,
the development of maternity homes should also be encouraged as
a way to promote adoption, as such homes have higher rates of
relinquishment than do other facilities.
<P>
(2)  The Department of Health and Human Services should collect
data on all adoptions, both public and private.  Currently, the
federal government only tracks adoption through the public system,
and the data available on the private sector is both limited and
outdated.  Data collection would also be enhanced through the
use of uniform data collection measures in each of the states.
 In addition to tracking the number of adoptions, the federal
government should encourage social science research regarding
adoption's impact on adopted children, birthmothers, and adoptive
parents.  This would not only add to the slim body of knowledge
already existing, it would also heighten awareness of the adoption
choice.
<P>
(3)  Reduce the barriers for prospective parents to choose adoption.
 This would include removing the obstacles hindering transracial
adoptions, reforming the insurance code to guarantee coverage
for adopted special-needs children, and speeding up the process
by which foster children could be adopted.

The American Psychiatric Association is a leading private, clinical
professional organization.  Over the years, the APA increasingly
has promoted greater acceptance of homosexuality.  And now, some
APA members are trying to outlaw counseling to homosexuals who
desire to change their orientation.
<P>
The association's pro-homosexual position is not shared by some
of its own members, and it offends many people of faith.  For
example, APA member Dr. Roy H. Hart writes from a Jewish perspective
in <I>Psychiatric News</I> that organized psychiatry does not
choose to understand religion's aversion to homosexuality.  He
writes in the May 1994 edition, &quot;Americans have the highest
rate of church attendance and membership in the Christian world,
but psychiatrists contribute little to those statistics.  What
is ego-alien for the psychiatrist -- religion -- is the center
of existence for a vast segment of the population.&quot;[1]
<P>
APA President John McIntyre tried to bridge the chasm with religion
when, after a pilgrimage to the epicenter of Mormonism, Salt Lake
City, he commented on the &quot;improved dialogue between religion
and psychiatry.&quot;[2]
<P>
The bridge McIntyre began to build in 1994 is now crumbling with
the advent of the January 1995 issue of the <I>American Journal
of Psychiatry</I>, the APA's official publication.  That issue
contains an article by Franklin D. Jones and Ronald J. Koshes,
&quot;Homosexuality and the Military&quot; which adds salt to
an old wound.[3] The article is noteworthy for its poor review of
research.  Its quick initial turn-around along with its array
of revisions suggests that the <I>AJP</I> editorial staff ignored
normal review procedures in order to publish a politicized article.

<P>
<B>1. Underwent an unusual review process.</B>  The article
was received by the <I>AJP</I> staff on July 14, 1993.[4] It was
subsequently revised four times before it was accepted June 17,
1994.[5] The first revision was received within four months, a very
brief time for this internationally recognized journal.  Following
the initial review there were at least three more revisions, suggesting
an unusual review process -- more like a dialogue than a peer-review
process.  In typical peer review, one or at most two revisions
are allowed. 
<P>
<B>2. Misrepresents the history of the military's homosexual
policy.</B>  The authors claim that the Pentagon's policy was
first formalized in 1982, and that the ban dates back to World
War II.[6] But the policy was formalized by President Carter and
became effective on January 16, 1981.  It was revised and updated
January 28, 1982.
<P>
The military's homosexual policy dates back to the British Articles
of War in 1775.  An individual was drummed out of the Continental
Army for attempted sodomy in 1778.[7] Prior to WW II, the legal
construction of the Articles of War and Army regulations were
broader in nature than today's.  Homosexual misconduct was prosecuted
under the categories of &quot;conduct unbecoming an officer&quot;
or, for enlisted members, &quot;conduct to the prejudice of good
order and military discipline.&quot;  After 1900, individuals
were punished for committing homosexual acts, which were lumped
under the rubric of sodomy.[8]
<P>
A WW I War Department circular, signed by the Surgeon General
in 1917, listed homosexuality as cause for rejection under the
category of &quot;psychopathic&quot; characteristics.[9] The 1921
enlistment standards included an implied homosexual policy excluding
people thought to be homosexual.[10] The right to make decisions
concerning the retention of enlisted men was delegated to relatively
low levels.  Discharges for &quot;inaptness or undesirable habits
or traits of character&quot; were handled under Section 8, Army
Regulation 615-360.[11]
<P>
The War Department's 1941 policy, which was harsher than previous
ones, emphasized that homosexual &quot;sodomists&quot; would not
be discharged but court-martialed.[12] Despite this increased penalty,
during the war there was an unofficial toleration of some homosexuals
because replacements were not guaranteed.  The policy was revised
in May, 1947 and, again, in 1949 to mandate that &quot;[h]omosexual
personnel, irrespective of sex, should not be permitted to serve
in any branch of the Armed Forces in any capacity, and prompt
separation of known homosexuals from the Armed Forces is mandatory.&quot;[13]
<P>
This fundamental was added to the Uniform Code of Military Justice
in 1951 with Articles 125 (act of sodomy) and 134 (assault). 
In September, 1958, Class III homosexuals (those who had committed
no homosexual act while in the military service) were furnished
honorable or general discharges based on the character of their
service.[14]
<P>
In the late 1970s, the Report of the Joint Service Administrative
Discharge Study Group recommended that the military reaffirm the
longstanding ban (indeed, it was more than 200 years old) on homosexuals
by incorporating into the policy the principled phrase, &quot;homosexuality
is incompatible with military service.&quot;  It also called for
the phrase, &quot;processing (for separation) is mandatory unless...the
allegations are groundless,&quot; to be included in all subsequent
Department of Defense (DoD) directives.  It also recommended some
leniency in cases of &quot;unsuitability,&quot; i.e., those involved
in homosexual tendencies or acts between consenting adults would
be honorably discharged.[15]
<P>
The 1982 policy cited in the <I>AJP</I> article incorporates the
aforementioned recommendations but was first published during
the last days of President Carter's administration.  That policy
was replaced by a law signed by President Clinton on November
30, 1993.  The Pentagon published implementing regulations on
February 28, 1994.
<P>
<B>3. Misrepresents the homosexual discharge history</B>.
 The authors cite homosexual discharge numbers and costs from
a discredited 1992 General Accounting Office study.[16] Other studies
show that the GAO underestimated the scope of homosexual discharges
and overestimated the costs to the government.
<P>
The GAO report stated that it costs the government $27 million
annually to discharge homosexuals.  But that figure is misleading.
 The military has a fixed number of authorized personnel, established
by Congress.  The projected annual number of enlistments is directly
related to the projected number of losses to achieve the established
end strength.  The cost to train new service members and to separate
other members is determined from the projected number of enlistments
and losses.  Those are sunk costs tied to running the training
base and a change of a few percent is of no real financial consequence.
<P>
Given the size of the military, the number of homosexuals discharged
is small.  For example, from 1980 through 1991, a total of 8,427,872
people served in the military.  During that same period there
were 17,840 non-judicial administrative discharges for homosexuality
--  .0021 percent of all of those who served during that period.
 An unpublished Army study during the same period puts homosexual
discharges in perspective.  It found there were 3,153 administrative
discharges for homosexuality between 1983 and 1991 but five times
(13,655) more for alcohol abuse and four times (10,845) more for
personnel being overweight.
<P>
The article also fails to mention homosexual punitive separations
which were not included in the GAO report.  A study obtained from
the Pentagon under the Freedom of Information Act analyzed 100
Army cases from 1989 to 1992.  Forty-nine percent of those cases
involved children as victims.  Eighty-five percent involved victims
who had not consented, and five percent of the offenders were
HIV-positive.[17]
<P>
The same report summarized a 1992 incident at Fort Hood, Texas,
where 60 homosexual men [soldiers and civilians] met in a public
toilet next to a child care center.  The men cut holes in the
walls to permit sex between men in adjacent stalls.  The men also
installed a mirror to allow them to see the approach of intruders.
<P>
These homosexuals were indiscriminate in their choice of partners
and often engaged in sex within moments of entering the bathroom.
 Sexual acts included oral and anal sodomy, mutual masturbation,
and fondling of the buttocks.  All soldiers in this incident received
disciplinary discharges which would not have been measured by
the 1992 GAO study.  This information was neither cited by GAO
nor by the <I>AJP</I> review.
<P>
<B>4. Relies on debunked Kinsey research to distort the
estimate of homosexuals in the military.</B>  The authors state,
&quot;Most authors feel this [4 percent exclusively homosexual]
is too conservative and that about 7 percent to 10 percent are
primarily homosexual in orientation.  Kinsey et al. also found
that 37 percent of males between childhood and old age had experienced
homoerotic orgasm, and another 13 percent claimed to have had
homoerotic stimulation without overt contact.  If these epidemiological
data are reliable, the policy of the Department of Defense would
severely limit the induction and retention of service members...strict
adherence to the Kinsey data and the policy of the Department
of Defense would result in the elimination of every other soldier
(37 percent plus 13 percent) in today's military.&quot;[18]
<P>
Alfred C. Kinsey, an Indiana University zoologist, who authored
<I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</I> in 1948, based his research
on 12,000 interviews.  Kinsey relied heavily on data gleaned from
criminals and extrapolated his findings to the general population.
 Psychologist Abraham Maslow said that Kinsey's work, like all
sex surveys, had a high margin of &quot;volunteer&quot; error
because many people are not honest or willing to talk about their
most intimate sexual secrets.[19] 
<P>
No reputable survey has replicated Kinsey's findings, and a number
of recent studies suggest that the homosexual population is considerably
less than 10 percent of the U.S. population.  For example, a 1991
national survey of sexually active adults done by the National
Opinion Research Center shows that 98.4 percent of adults were
exclusively heterosexual that year.[20] A 1993 survey by the Battelle
Human Affairs Research Centers found that only 1.1 percent of
all Americans are exclusively homosexual.[21] A survey conducted
by the Alan Guttmacher Institute in 1993 found that one percent
of men consider themselves exclusively homosexual.[22] And a 1994
National Health and Social Life Survey at the University of Chicago
found that 2.8 percent of men and 1.4 percent of women identified
themselves as homosexual or bisexual.[23]
<P>
A March 1994 article in the <I>American Journal of Psychiatry</I>
cites several surveys of American men showing the prevalence of
homosexuality.  For example, the National Survey of Men found
that only 1.1 percent of men have been exclusively homosexual
during the preceding 10 years.  Another study found that 2.4 percent
of men are currently homosexual.[24]
<P>
<B>5. Relies on outdated polls to indicate that the public
supports lifting the ban. </B>The article cites two surveys done
before the national debate to suggest that Americans now favor
lifting the ban.[25]  It does not cite surveys with contradictory
findings nor does it discuss these contradictions.
<P>
Public support for lifting the ban eroded as the debate intensified
in 1993.  Midway through the debate, support for lifting the ban
was no more than 40 percent.[26] A national poll by Fabrizio, McLaughlin
&amp; Associates in March 1993 found that a decisive 54 percent
to 37 percent of voters disagreed that President Clinton should
overrule military leaders such as General Colin Powell and require
the military to accept homosexuals.[27]
<P>
Most military personnel support the ban.  A February 1993 <I>Los
Angeles Times</I> survey found that 40 percent of service members
disapprove, on moral grounds, of lifting the ban and 46 percent
said lifting the ban would enter into their reenlistment decisions.
 Another 11 percent said flatly that they would not reenlist because
of it.[28] A February 1993 CNN/Gallup Poll found that 74 percent
of men who had not attended college opposed lifting the ban. 
This is the prime recruiting population.
<P>
In essence, this review selectively cites survey data to support
its position, implying that no other dissimilar results have been
found.  
<P>
<B>6. Ignores the law and relies on Clinton's inconsistent
policy.</B>  The article makes no mention of the military's homosexual
law which was signed by President Clinton on November 30, 1993.
 The authors suggest that the regulations will &quot;generate
a series of court cases based on the freedom of speech and self-incrimination
statutes of the U.S. Constitution.&quot;[29]
<P>
No doubt the new regulations will be contested in the courts.
 The fact that the law and the new regulations are inconsistent,
however, is significant.  This fact was ignored by the authors.
 Consider some of the problems:
<P>
<LI>The Clinton Administration interpreted the law to permit so-called
&quot;celibate&quot; homosexuals to serve.  This view, i.e., that
&quot;celibate&quot; homosexuals even exist, contradicts past
legal rulings and will lead to more homosexuals serving and fewer
investigations of their likely misconduct.
<P>
<LI>The regulations dropped the critical statement that &quot;homosexuality
is incompatible with military service.&quot;  While Congress has
carried this principle forward in the law, Secretary of Defense
William Perry failed to include it in the regulations.[30]
<P>
<LI>The new policy potentially cripples military discipline by creating
a number of new obstacles before investigations can be started.
 Thus the regulations prevent commanders from investigating soldiers
for homosexuality without clear evidence that they have done something
criminally wrong.  According to Perry, attending gay pride parades,
frequenting gay bars, and possessing gay materials are not &quot;credible&quot;
evidence to initiate an investigation.[31]
<P>
<LI>The &quot;Perry rules&quot; also prevent criminal investigation
agencies from looking into most cases of adult, private, consensual
sexual misconduct, e.g., sodomy and adultery.[32]
<P>
<LI>Under the Perry rules, and directly contrary to more than 200
years of military practice, the DoD no longer considers homosexual
or bisexual behavior a marker for increased security risk.  Questions
about homosexuality were removed from security background investigations,
and information discovered during a security investigation cannot
be used for adverse action without high-level political permission.[33]
<P>
Clinton's Pentagon appointees are now pointing to the constant
number of homosexual discharges as proof that the policy is fine
as implemented.[34] This is misleading.  Most homosexuals facing
discharge do not challenge their separation.  However, it takes
just one advocate to exploit the weaknesses in the regulations
and then a court, deferring to the &quot;military's&quot; interpretation,
will strike down the statute as unconstitutional.   
<P>
Meanwhile, many soldiers are uncertain about Clinton's policy.
 In October 1994, military sociologist Charles Moskos conducted
an informal survey of soldiers in Haiti.  He found that 39 percent
thought the policy too lenient, 36 percent thought it to be a
good policy, and 22 percent were not sure.[35]  
<P>
<B>7. Attacks current policy requiring military psychiatrists
to report homosexual service members.</B>[36] The military does not
recognize absolute doctor-patient confidentiality.  A military
physician treating someone for a disorder that disqualifies the
member from continued service is bound by the regulation to report
the situation.  This is important for deployment and health readiness
purposes.
<P>
<B>8. Distorts facts about allied military experiences
with homosexuals.</B>  The article states, &quot;a survey of the
policies and practices of NATO armies revealed that only 24 percent
(4 of 17: New Zealand, Portugal, the United Kingdom, and the United
States) had exclusionary and separation policies.&quot;[37] The authors
ignore the June 1993 GAO report on &quot;Homosexuals in the Military:
 Policies and Practices of Foreign Countries.&quot;[38] This report
certainly could have been obtained and cited, given the number
of allowed revisions.  The GAO reviewed 25 countries and selected
four countries for detailed analysis.  The report states that
11 countries have policies that do not permit homosexuals to serve
in the military, 11 have policies that do.  Three of the latter
11 countries do not have any laws, regulations, or policies that
address this issue.  An unpublished Pentagon study conducted in
December 1992 found that some of those countries that permit homosexuals
to serve do so with strict guidelines. 
<P>
Testimony before the Senate and House Armed Services Committees
(SASC and HASC) in April and May 1993 illustrates the dramatic
differences between foreign militaries and our own.  For example,
the Netherlands started a homosexual military experiment in 1974.
 That nation has 65,000 service members, including 40,000 conscripts
who serve 14 months and who primarily commute from home each day.
 The U.S. has 2.5 million active and reserve service personnel
stationed in the U.S. and around the world at any given time.
 The German armed forces, which are included among those that
do <I>not</I> have an exclusionary policy, will not induct acknowledged
homosexual volunteers because they would &quot;undermine military
order and discipline.&quot;[39] Of the 476,300 members, 43 percent
are conscripts who, if identified as homosexual, may be required
to undergo psychological tests to determine their fitness.  The
German Federal Administrative Court declared in November 1990
that the military is justified in not allowing homosexuals to
serve in leadership and educational positions.
<P>
Foreign social experiences have little relevance for America's
military.  The U.S. is a superpower with urgent missions worldwide.
 America also has a radical homosexual community and a liberal
judicial system, a combination that guarantees a steady stream
of legal activism that is disruptive to military morale.
<P>
<B>9. Falsely claims that most societies approve of homosexuality.</B>
 The article states, &quot;Cultural studies....  In the early
1950s Ford and Beach studied 77 modern primitive societies concerning
attitudes toward homosexuality.  They found 28 condemned in which
it was condemned but 49, nearly two-thirds, in which it was approved
in more or less restricted forms.&quot;[40]
<P>
This observation is misleading.  Most modern societies consider
homosexuality a mental illness.  For example, a 1992 survey by
the APA's Office of International Affairs in conjunction with
the APA Committee of Gay, Lesbian, and Bisexual Psychiatrists
surveyed 125 psychiatric associations around the world.  It found
that all but three associations consider homosexuality a mental
illness or a sexual deviation.  U.S. psychiatrists are joined
only by Denmark and South Africa in their efforts to redefine
homosexuality and protect the &quot;right&quot; of homosexual
adults to conduct consensual sexual relations in private.[41]
<P>
<B>10. Misrepresents the pathological implications of
homosexuality.</B> The article cites a 1945 study of 183 former
college students known to be homosexual who served in the military
during World War II.  Sixty-four percent of these people &quot;served
with credible records.&quot;  The review also attributes the military's
decision no longer to view homosexuality as a mental illness to
the APA's 1973 decision to remove homosexuality from the Diagnostic
and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders-II.[42]
<P>
The article states that only 64 percent of homosexuals in their
study had credible service records.  Rather than being an indication
of success, this should be an argument for exclusion.  Better
than 90 percent of the 8.5 million World War II era veterans &quot;served
with credible records.&quot;  
<P>
The implication is that since 64 percent in a single study had
&quot;credible&quot; records, there is no justification for the
exclusion.  This proves nothing.  They were honored for their
&quot;credible&quot; service to their country, not their homosexual
behavior.  After all, the ban was in force, so homosexuals were
forced to curb their behavior. 
<P>
The history of the American Psychiatric Association's decision
to change the DSM-II is worth examining.  Specifically, the military's
World War II experience provided considerable insight into human
behavior.  Specialists in military medicine literally rewrote
the diagnostic codes and nomenclature for psychiatric disorders
which, ultimately, became the format used by the American Psychiatric
Association in the 1980s and 1990s.  In 1952 the APA Council approved
and published a new nomenclature for categorizing mental disorders
similar to those used by the military.  The nomenclature identified
homosexuality as a pathologic behavior, i.e., &quot;sexual deviation,&quot;
under the section on Sociopathic Personality Disturbances.[43]
<P>
The second edition of the DSM for Mental Disorders continued to
identify homosexuality as a &quot;sexual deviation&quot; disorder.
 And since 1945 the Army has consistently held that homosexuality
is a behavioral problem, not a mental disease.[44]
<P>
From 1969 to 1971, homosexual activists stormed the annual meetings
of the APA demanding the normalization of homosexual behavior.
 In 1971 homosexual activists invaded the annual meeting, screaming
and kicking, seizing microphones, and denouncing psychiatry as
&quot;the enemy incarnate.&quot;[45]
<P>
The DSM was challenged at the 1973 meeting of the New England
Psychiatric Society by homosexual activists.  They recommended
that the nomenclature's section on &quot;sexual deviation&quot;
be renamed &quot;sexual dysfunction.&quot;  Later that year APA
Trustees ruled that homosexuality would no longer be listed as
a &quot;mental disorder&quot; in its official nomenclature of
mental disorders and recommended that it be replaced by the term
&quot;sexual orientation disturbance.&quot;[46]
<P>
According to author Ronald Bayer in <I>Homosexuality and American
Psychiatry: The Politics of Diagnosis</I>, homosexual activists
used intimidation to force the APA to remove homosexuality as
a mental illness from the DSM of psychiatric disorders.  &quot;The
result was,&quot; explained Bayer, &quot;not a conclusion based
upon an approximation of the scientific truth as dictated by reason,
but was instead an action demanded by the ideological temper of
the times.&quot;[47]
<P>
Homosexuality was subsequently regarded as a variant of sexual
orientation disturbance.  The &quot;nomenclature revolution&quot;
continued and in 1986 the last remaining term, &quot;ego-dystonic
homosexuality,&quot; was removed from the DSM.  This was done
over the protest of many psychiatrists who preferred to label
it a long standing disturbance originating in the early years
of life.[48]
<P>
The membership of the American Medical Association disagreed with
the APA's decision.  A 1975 AMA membership survey found that 69
percent agreed that homosexuality is &quot;pathological.&quot;[49]
 Additionally, psychotherapists such as Elizabeth Moberly, Gerald
van den Aardweg, Joseph Nicolosi, Charles Socarides, and Masters
and Johnson have reported much success helping homosexuals to
recover, thereby proving the point that it is curable.[50]
<P>
<B>11. Claims military homosexuals would not contribute
to poor morale.</B>  The article proposes three points concerning
military morale.  First, it blames immature recruits for the anti-homosexual
policy but fails to cite supporting data.  &quot;Many recruits,
who may be insecure in their own sexual orientation, may react
with various forms of discomfort to the presence of an identified
homosexual person.&quot;[51] Second, it acknowledges that &quot;subcultures
in a military organization can disrupt functioning of the unit...since
the military copes with many subcultures, it remains for the military
to make a convincing case that this [homosexual] subculture is
substantially and essentially so much more damaging&quot; to justify
&quot;the costs of [the] current policy.&quot;[52] The military's
significant experience with drug and alcohol subcultures provides
ample experience with damaging categories of behavior.  Finally,
the authors state, &quot;We expect that acceptance of homosexuals
in the military will increase, negating the need for a walled-off
subculture and resulting in more respect for the homosexual soldier.&quot;[53]
 The authors provide no reason or basis for this supposition.
<P>
Morale is defined as &quot;a strong sense of enthusiasm and dedication
to a commonly shared goal that unifies a group.&quot;  Heterosexual
soldiers forced to live and work with avowed homosexuals cannot
be expected to do so with &quot;...a strong sense of enthusiasm.&quot;
<P>
Open homosexuals tend to bind their basic identity with their
sexual orientation and practice: &quot;I am a homosexual,&quot;
as opposed to the American soldier's basic identity: &quot;I am
a soldier.&quot;  The homosexual's preoccupation with individual
behavioral characteristics is incongruent with and detracts from
the commonly shared goal -- accomplishment of the mission -- which
unifies heterosexual soldiers and subordinates their individual
goals to that of the group.
<P>
The homosexual subculture is recognized as &quot;liberated&quot;
or, in a manner of speaking, undisciplined.  This is inherently
at odds with the 24-hour discipline system within which soldiers
must live and work.  Homosexuals are distinguished from other
subcultures by their behavior [sodomy].  Another group behavioral
characteristic is a very high rate of promiscuity.  Military records
indicate that homosexuals are statistically more likely to engage
in misconduct than heterosexuals.  They have a higher incidence
of drug and alcohol abuse than heterosexuals.  If these statistics
aren't enough, much-touted books such as Randy Shilts' <I>Conduct
Unbecoming</I> and Mary Ann Humphrey's <I>My Country, My Right
to Serve</I> provide, perhaps unwittingly, ample testimony to
the disruptive nature of homosexuals in military units.
<P>
The voice of experience also indicates that homosexuals jeopardize
military morale.  For example, a survey of active duty officers
conducted for the American Security Council Foundation found that
99.03 percent said homosexuals would undermine the cohesiveness
and readiness of combat units.[54] The Defense Readiness Council
compiled a survey of 2,800 retired flag and general officers.
 Nearly 90 percent said they believe homosexuals undermine morale.[55]
<P>
<B>12. Contends, against the evidence, that homosexuals
aren't a security risk</B>.  The article states that identifying
oneself as a homosexual is no more of a security risk than identifying
oneself as a heterosexual.  The authors call for the government
to show a &quot;nexus&quot; between the presence of homosexuals
and adverse impact on duty performance.[56]
<P>
This is a flawed argument.  Few people identify themselves as
heterosexual; that identity is assumed.  Homosexuals do, indeed,
identify themselves, however.
<P>
The article ignores the landmark research by Alan Bell and Martin
Weinberg, <I>Homosexualities: A Study of Diversity Among Men and
Women</I>, which found that a significant number of homosexuals
report that &quot;someone has threatened [them with] exposure
of homosexuality in order to get something of value.&quot;[57]
<P>
If the threat of blackmail was the only problem with homosexuals
in the military, then lifting the prohibition would be justified.
 However, for the many reasons cited in this analysis, homosexuals
should not serve openly and security investigations are a valid
mechanism for enforcing the ban.
<P>
<B>13. Contends, against overwhelming evidence, that homosexuals
are not a special health risk.</B>  The article virtually ignores
the documented health risks associated with the homosexual lifestyle,
citing only the military's HIV screening program.  &quot;By policy,&quot;
the authors explain, &quot;no one who tests positive for the HIV
virus is allowed to enter active duty.&quot;[58]
<P>
Admitting open homosexuals into the military violates the legal
principle of the assumption of risk.  This principle states that
if you know there is a risk and you assume it, then don't complain
when the risk materializes.  The review's authors denigrate a
very serious risk.
<P>
A recent report from the University of Michigan found that people
with HIV are more capable of spreading the virus during the first
60 days of infection, but that blood tests during this period
do not find the HIV.[59] This means that the military assumes the
risk, even though all personnel are initially tested, that soldiers
will not be infected.  This is why screening out high-risk groups
and not just those who test positive for HIV is smart.  Unfortunately,
the Clinton Administration no longer screens out homosexuals --
the highest-risk group for contracting HIV.
<P>
The Army's Surgeon General, Lieutenant General Alcide Lanoue,
addressed the health risks associated with homosexuals:[60]
<P>
&quot;The military setting provides unique requirements for
safety in executing the Army blood transfusion program and for
preventing the transmission of blood-borne pathogens (especially
HIV and hepatitis B) in the field setting.  Homosexual males would
comprise a pool of ineligible blood donors and as a group are
at high risk of infection by HIV and hepatitis B, both significant
blood-borne pathogens which can infect other soldiers through
exposure to blood in peace and war.&quot; [During Operation Desert
Storm, there were five documented instances where blood was drawn
from soldiers and transfused.  In Somalia, five units of blood
were drawn and directly transfused to Somalis.  The urgency of
such transfusions precludes testing for the AIDS virus.]
<P>
&quot;HIV and other Sexually Transmitted Disease rates will
increase to the extent that the proportion of homosexual males
in the Army increases because homosexual/bisexual men are allowed
to enter and remain in the Army.&quot;  [The CDC reports that
most of the AIDS patients in this country are homosexuals.[61] Homosexuals
account for a disproportionate number of America's most serious
STD's, including syphilis, gonorrhea, genital warts, and hepatitis
A and B.[62] Moreover, the 1994 homosexual sex survey in <I>The Advocate</I>,
a leading homosexual magazine, found that 13 percent of respondents
were HIV-positive and only 18 percent had taken all three shots
in the hepatitis B vaccine series.  <I>The Advocate</I> article
admits &quot;Gay men are one of the top risk groups for being
exposed to hepatitis B.&quot;[63] ]
<P>
&quot;A male homosexual soldier is significantly more likely
than a heterosexual soldier to be nondeployable for medical reasons
related to HIV infection.  If HIV-infected, the soldier will be
permanently nondeployable.  Male homosexuals are more likely to
acquire sexually transmitted diseases which can render them nondeployable,
such as gonorrhea, syphilis, and hepatitis B.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Readiness from a medical standpoint will suffer if the restriction
is lifted.  The impact would be felt at the unit level, when the
homosexual soldier cannot train and deploy for health reasons.
 Likewise, the impact would be felt Army-wide in terms of the
military blood program and of the burden placed on the Army health
care system.&quot;
<P>
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, homosexuals
are especially vulnerable to contracting HIV.  They are a high-risk
group because of co-factors associated with their lifestyle. 
These include recreational drug use, homosexual sex, malnutrition,
prior incidents of sexually transmitted diseases, and, most significantly,
sexual promiscuity.  
<P>
Homosexuals who participate in unsafe sex practices with multiple
partners and without taking precautions are at great risk of contracting
sexually transmitted diseases.  <I>The Advocate</I> survey found
that 72 percent of homosexual respondents engage in insertive
oral intercourse, 46 percent insertive anal intercourse, 45 percent
receptive anal-oral sex, 48 percent in three-way sex, 24 percent
in group sex (4 or more), and 10 percent in sadomasochism.[64] Most
of the homosexuals in the survey admitted to having had more than
30 sex partners over their lifetime, and about a third (35 percent)
report more than 100 partners.  The survey also found that homosexual
men use condoms only 1 time in 4.[65]
<P>
Heterosexuals have fewer sex partners than homosexuals.  A 1988-1990
General Social Survey found that 91 percent of men 25 to 29 years
of age are heterosexually active.  Nineteen percent of these men
have had only one lifetime sex partner, 55 percent have had 2
to 19 lifetime partners, and 25 percent have had 20 or more lifetime
partners.[66]
<P>
The University of Chicago published a national sex survey in October,
1994, which found that 20 percent of men have had only one sex
partner in their lifetime, 21 percent have had 2 to 4 partners,
17 percent had 5 to 10 partners, 16 percent had 11 to 20, and
17 percent report having had 21 or more sex partners.[67] However,
that survey excluded men over 59, who constitute one-sixth of
the population and who typically have more conservative sex lives.
 Thus the real figures probably are even lower for the population
of all men.[68]
<P>
Homosexuality also increases medical costs.  With the ban in place,
openly homosexual inductees are turned away.  However, with the
ban lifted, a homosexual recruit could contract HIV within days
or have early-stage HIV, test negative at first, and be accorded
full medical benefits for the rest of his life.  This is about
$120,000 in direct medical costs per AIDS patient.[69]
<P>
Dr. Edmund Tramont, Associate Director for retroviral research
at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, published a 10-year projection
for HIV costs at $1.7 to $1.9 billion.[70]  However, he warns that
this is in 1989 dollars, is based on the present rate of new cases,
and assumes that only 60 percent of health care beneficiaries
will use the military health care system.  The potential 10-year
cost could rise to $5 billion if these assumptions are incorrect.[71]
 The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services indicates that
the lifetime cost of treating a person with AIDS -- from diagnosis
until death -- is $102,000.[72] The American Medical Association
estimated the per-person AIDS patient cost would rise to $386,000
by the year 2000 and to $639,000 by the year 2008.[73]
<P>
As of April 1993 the military had dealt with 8,832 HIV-positive
service members.  Most have been separated from the service, but,
at that time, 1,580 were still on active duty.  Their status precluded
them from deploying overseas and necessitated special assignments
and special medical care.[74]
<P>
Homosexuals also have a much shorter life expectancy than heterosexuals,
as indicated by a study of more than 6,400 obituaries in 16 homosexual
newspapers.  The average age of homosexuals who died from AIDS
is 39; from all other causes it is 41.[75]
<P>
Substance addiction and abuse are called the second set of key
health problems after AIDS in the homosexual subculture (and violence
is third).[76]
<P>
Screening out homosexuals and discharging those discovered later
makes financial sense.  The 1992 GAO report states that the military
spent $26 million on homosexuals discharged.  The military spent
many times that figure treating homosexuals with AIDS -- people
who lied to enter the military and now receive full health and
pay benefits.  The cost-effective decision would be to minimize
the risk to the federal taxpayer by rejecting homosexuals before
they are recruited and discharging those later discovered.
<P>
<B>14. Cites legal challenges as indication that public
will soon favor homosexual service.</B>  The article briefly reviews
the current judicial climate regarding the military policy.  The
authors believe, &quot;With the increased public attention now
focused on the miliary policy, swift changes could sweep away
previous positions.&quot;[77]
<P>
The article cites two cases won by the government and the case
of Navy Petty Officer Keith Meinhold, who was discharged for saying
he was gay on national television.  Meinhold's case was labeled
&quot;the most recent legal case decided.&quot;[78]
<P>
Meinhold's case is not the most recent case decided.  The case
of former midshipman Joseph C. Steffan from the U.S. Naval Academy
was decided by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the District of Columbia
on November 22, 1994.  The decision from the country's &quot;second
highest court&quot; declared the military's homosexual ban constitutional.[79]
<P>
The 9th U.S. Circuit Court of Appeals in San Francisco ruled August
31, 1994 that a statement of homosexuality alone is insufficient
reason to discharge Meinhold.  That decision was limited only
to sailor Meinhold and struck down the lower court's decision
to extend the ruling to the entire Defense Department.[80]
<P>
Although numerous cases of former service members discharged for
homosexuality are now in the judicial system, there is no indication
that &quot;swift changes&quot; will &quot;sweep away previous
positions.&quot;  On the contrary, it is expected that the 104th
Congress will force the Clinton Administration to enforce the
homosexual law despite rulings that are in conflict with the law.
<P>
The issue of homosexuals in the military was cited as one of the
pivotal issues that collapsed the Democratic Party's majority
in Congress.  The new majority should respond by reinstating the
full homosexual ban, i.e., require the Clinton Administration
to obey the new homosexual law and to reintroduce the questions
for recruits at induction.
<P>
<B>15. Concludes that the ban is based solely on bad attitudes.</B>
 The article states, &quot;The strongest argument for excluding
and separating homosexual persons from military service is 
not mental illness or security risks but the presence of social
strictures and adverse attitudes.&quot;[81]
<P>
The authors ignore a wealth of information that comes from Congress's
oversight hearings in 1993.  Reasons include combat readiness
(cohesion, deployability risk, family and community risks); manpower
(recruitment and retention risks); cost (medical, housing, claims
from soldiers previously discharged for homosexuality, quality
of force sustainment, and lost productivity); and political (military
used as laboratory for social experimentation to satisfy the political
views of a small minority).  The article completely ignores these
concerns.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
&quot;Homosexuality and the Military&quot; is an article that
was rushed to press, was poorly reviewed, and does little for
the academic credibility of the APA -- an organization that should
be promoting sound research, not a moral agenda that abuses and
neglects available research.  The article is evidence that the
APA is playing an ever greater role in the promotion of the homosexual
agenda.

In the welfare debate last year, President Clinton himself stated
that &quot;the real source of [the] problem is the inordinate
number of out-of-wedlock births in this country.&quot;[1]  He also
conceded that &quot;there's no question that [ending welfare for
unwed mothers] would work.  The question is... 'Is it morally
right?'&quot;[2]
<P>
While the President's proposed policies leave much to be desired,
he has formulated precisely the right question to frame the current
debate over welfare reform in general and illegitimacy in particular.
 There can be no more important policy objective than the preservation
-- or more properly in this day and age, the revitalization --
of our nation's moral capital.  As James Q. Wilson wrote in his
oft-cited article, &quot;The Rediscovery of Character: Private
Virtue and Public Policy&quot;:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>The essential first step is to acknowledge that at root, in almost
every area of important public concern, we are seeking to induce
persons to act virtuously....  Not only is such conduct desirable
in its own right, it appears now to be necessary if large improvements
are to be made in those matters we consider problems.[3]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
There exists a striking public consensus that the welfare state's
practice of subsidizing illegitimacy is not only a massive problem,
but a moral problem at root.
<P>
Even so unlikely a source as Bruce Reed, President Clinton's leading
aide on welfare reform, acknowledges that the essential purpose
of reform must be to reverse the alarming rise in out-of-wedlock
births.[4]  If not driven exclusively by AFDC &quot;benefits,&quot;
the increase has at least been sustained and perpetuated by the
expansion of a system that pays recipients to bear illegitimate
children.  Current trends indicate that by the year 2015 -- some
studies project as early as 2000 -- one of every two American
babies will be born to a single mother, and illegitimacy will
surpass divorce as the main cause of fatherlessness.  If a job
program succeeds in putting more unmarried welfare mothers to
work (which is unlikely on a sufficiently grand scale, given budget
constraints), we will still be left with roughly the same number 
of fatherless children.  While
Great Britain has already succeeded in implementing reforms that
make work economically more attractive than welfare, the reforms
of the 1980s have only served to underscore in both Britain and
America the fact that little progress can be made without addressing
the collapse of the family.[5]
<P>
No moral judgment even need be adduced to acknowledge that intact
families bestow upon individuals and communities advantages that
simply come no other way.  Empirical evidence amassed by social
scientists in the last ten years (and chronicled for popular consumption
by Barbara Dafoe Whitehead in her April 1993 <I>Atlantic</I> article,
&quot;Dan Quayle Was Right&quot;) has confirmed in exquisite detail
what those who have lived in broken families already know.  A
single woman with children is not a viable economic unit for the
vast majority, but children need biological fathers for much more
than the extra dollars they add to the family budget.  As social
scientist Charles Murray has written, single parenthood is &quot;damaging
to children in so many ways that to list them individually would
be to trivialize them.&quot;[6]
<P>
Not surprisingly, Dr. Murray also concludes that &quot;illegitimacy
is the single most important social problem of our time...because
it drives everything else.&quot;[7]  More than 70 percent of all
juveniles in state reform institutions, for example, come from
fatherless homes; and the relationship between crime and one-parent
families is so powerful that controlling for family structure
erases the relationship between crime and race and between crime
and low income.  Illegitimacy feeds itself, too.  Young white
women who grow up without a father in the home are more than twice
as likely to bear children out-of-wedlock and to do so during
their teenage years when they are most likely to form long-term
attachments to AFDC.
<P>
If those on the welfare rolls have suffered most conspicuously,
it is also true that the welfare system has corrupted the ideals
and narrowed the vision of many who live well beyond the bounds
of the inner city -- even as it is now threatening our most cherished
civic institutions.  One obvious casualty is the weakening of
our conviction that the so-called &quot;bourgeois virtues&quot;
are available to all, regardless of race or class.  Early American
social workers, like Mary Ellen Richmond, understood the importance
of middle class norm-setting.  &quot;The way to reintegrate the
deviant into society, she argued, is to educate and indeed direct
them toward the shared values of the mainstream culture.&quot;[8]
<P>
The role of the traditional two-parent family is essential in
sustaining the institutions of a free society precisely because
it is the vehicle by which values are transmitted from generation
to generation.  If the family fails to impart virtues that temper
and restrain behavior, broad legal freedoms must give way.  So,
too, human dignity and equality, as the Founders understood them.
 Virtue, historian Gertrude Himmelfarb has said, is the only true
basis of equality and the only requisite for citizenship.[9]  As
Charles Murray made clear in his now famous op-ed &quot;The Coming
White Underclass,&quot; either we act now to reduce illegitimacy
and to reinfuse our public policy with a commitment to higher
and nobler things -- or we run the risk of sabotaging the entire
experiment in democratic self-government.
<P>
Or, as Michael Novak put it:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[T]he project of self-government depends on the capacity of citizens
to govern their own passions, urges, habits, and expectations.
 If they cannot govern their own lives individually, how can they
be successful in self-government as a republic?  The project of
self-government is moral -- or not at all.[10]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
The Founding Fathers and many succeeding generations understood
that only a virtuous people can be free.  Do we?
<P>
Given the consequences for the individual child, the surrounding
community, and the national polity, bringing a baby into this
world without a sense of sacred responsibility cannot long be
regarded as a morally neutral act.  In a report issued in December
1994, the Progressive Policy Institute, policy arm of the Democratic
Leadership Council, joined others in acknowledging that &quot;it
is wrong -- not simply foolish or impractical -- for women and
men to make babies they cannot support emotionally and financially.&quot;[11]
 Donna Shalala made the same concession a year earlier, however
reluctantly, when she said in an interview, &quot;I don't like
to put this in moral terms, but I do believe that having children
out-of-wedlock is wrong.&quot;[12]
<P>
Congress should now recognize that it is also wrong to sanction
such activity by subsidizing it.  Republican strategist Bill Kristol
has said that &quot;neither our politics nor our sociology can
ultimately be neutral as to the content of the _laws of Nature
and Nature's God,_&quot;[13] chief among which is the fact that
we were made to live in families.  Charles Murray asks rhetorically:
 if &quot;a social policy that induces people to believe that
they are not responsible for their lives is one that inhibits
the pursuit of happiness and is to that extent immoral[,] [c]an
then a policy that <I>fails</I> to stigmatize be a moral one?&quot;[14]
<P>
Historical experience, related by Marvin Olasky and others, does
indeed demonstrate that the most effective social services have
been offered by private community groups, without any illusion
of moral neutrality.  In her seminal historical study <I>Poverty
and Compassion</I>, Gertrude Himmelfarb writes that:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[a]fter making the most arduous attempt to objectify the problem
of poverty, to divorce poverty from any moral assumptions and
conditions, we are learning how inseparable the moral and material
dimensions of that problem are.  And after trying to devise social
policies that are scrupulously neutral and _value-free,_ we are
finding these policies fraught with moral implications that have
grave material and social consequences.[15]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
George Liebmann says, more simply, in a recent issue of <I>The
American Enterprise</I>, &quot;Rescuing an underclass is by definition
a highly moralistic undertaking.&quot;[16]  While controlling welfare
spending is a happy byproduct of terminating benefits to teen
mothers, even more promising is the opportunity to begin reversing
the message of the counterculture that has so eroded the character
of our people, in part by assaulting the family.
<P>
Senator Daniel Patrick Moynihan has used the phrase &quot;defining
deviancy down&quot; to describe Americans' tendency to ignore
excess levels of deviancy by normalizing what used to be considered
pathology.  Only by &quot;defining deviancy down&quot; have we
been able to ignore until now all the signs of impending disaster
that attend a burgeoning illegitimacy rate.  Barbara Whitehead's
1993 <I>Atlantic</I> article heralded a real and significant change
in the public mood, however; and the near-mythic ascendancy of
Charles Murray's &quot;Coming White Underclass&quot; piece the
same year seemed to confirm a general convergence of public opinion.
 In a recent Family Research Council survey of 1,000 Americans,
a substantial majority (81 percent) of respondents indicated that
&quot;women having babies out of wedlock that they can't support
financially&quot; is a serious problem.  The mounting public consensus
presents a unique opportunity to implement more than symbolic
change in the 104th Congress and to make sanctions against illegitimacy
the focus of that change.
<P>
In sending his welfare package to Congress more than 30 years
ago, President Kennedy articulated contemporary liberals' fundamental
misunderstanding of the causal role welfare plays in boosting
illegitimacy rates.
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>[W]elfare programs, [he said], must contribute to the attack
on . . . family breakdown [and] illegitimacy. . . .  Unless such
problems are dealt with effectively, they fester, and grow, sapping
the strength of society as a whole and extending their consequences
in troubled families from one generation to the next.[17]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Kennedy's insight about the consequences has proven historically
accurate; but his &quot;service&quot; approach to curbing illegitimacy
worked no better than the current President's will -- a fact which
an unnamed aide on the Clinton welfare task force acknowledged
last year.
<P>
While the President advocates a massive and expensive public relations
campaign against out-of-wedlock births, his aide confided to <I>Newsweek</I>
reporter Joe Klein: &quot;We looked at a hundred different programs
around the country that were trying to deal with this problem,
and not one of them moved the needle.  There just weren't any
results.&quot;[18]  Likewise, a formal study of the Teenage Parent
Demonstration, sponsored by the Department of Health and Human
Services in response to &quot;persistently high rates of teenage
pregnancies and births,&quot; found that &quot;[t]he program had
an unusual and disappointing pattern of impacts on pregnancy and
birth rates . . . despite . . . the substantial efforts of the
programs to empower [the] young mothers to take control of their
fertility.&quot;[19]
<P>
Charles Murray anticipated the problem in his 1988 book <I>In
Pursuit of Happiness and Good Government</I>.  &quot;The task,&quot;
he concludes, &quot;is not to devise a public relations campaign
to discourage single teenage girls from having babies, but to
neutralize whatever is impeding the age-old impulse of human beings
to form families.&quot;[20]  Eliminating grants to unwed teenage
mothers will be necessary, but not sufficient, to restore the
integrity of the family unit.
<P>
Only by historical accident were unwed mothers -- of any age --
ever included in the AFDC program.  Frances Perkins, President
Roosevelt's Secretary of Labor and chief architect of welfare
policy, opposed extending federal entitlements to unmarried mothers
because she foresaw that subsidizing illegitimacy would escalate
family breakdown.  It would be ironic at best if the current majority
in Congress were to find themselves to the left of the most liberal
member of the Roosevelt Administration because they rejected that
intuition, now confirmed by years of sad experience.  It is the
potential to reverse that sad experience that must define &quot;compassion&quot;
in the present debate.  As the one policy option that promises
to effect change in the current system, restrictions on benefits
by definition constitute the compassionate alternative.
<P>
Himmelfarb notes that the word &quot;compassion&quot; once described
&quot;a moral sentiment, not a political principle, a sentiment
evoked by _misery_ or _sorrow,_ not by poverty as such.&quot;[21]
 As political salvationism sought to preempt traditional morals
in the last 30 years, it was only natural that moral sentiments
should be confused with political principles.  Likewise, that
misery and sorrow should be equated with material poverty; for
the redefinition of compassion required a highly artificial view
of man as no more than a material being.
<P>
If compassion is once again properly understood, perhaps then
it will become more obvious that the object of our concern must
be &quot;misery&quot; and &quot;sorrow,&quot; not economic poverty,
and that the &quot;misery&quot; most evident today is the spiritual
and moral deprivation visited upon dependents of the welfare system.
 It is time that we stop suppressing the moral responsibilities
that make life precious for a resident of the inner city just
the same as for a middle-class suburbanite.  It is time, in short,
to secure equal access to the central satisfactions of family,
virtue, and freedom.

<P>
Again, in the course of the welfare debate, the abortion issue
has demonstrated its unique capacity to mobilize and divide.
<P>
Pro-life advocates who resist the so-called family cap, which
would freeze benefits to mothers who bear additional illegitimate
children while on welfare, fear with some justification that the
cap could promote an increase in abortions.  Pro-life advocates
who support the measure share both this concern and the long-term
goal of driving abortions to the point of zero.  Unlike the more
conventional conflict between pro-life and pro-choice groups,
pro-life differences over the family cap represent a dispute over
means, not ends, that is complicated by the absence of any hard
data from actual experimentation.
<P>
Such differences lend themselves to reasoned discussion and, ultimately,
resolution far more easily than the larger debate for and against
abortion rights, which Laurence Tribe has characterized as a &quot;clash
of absolutes.&quot;  While the choice between life and death cannot
be accurately described as a &quot;clash of absolutes,&quot; the
phrase does capture usefully the impossibility of winning adherents
to the pro-life cause without first changing hearts, one at a
time.  In other words, we should forfeit no battles, but neither
can we expect to win the war against abortion on demand without
a comprehensive, long-term strategy to develop and sustain a pro-life
consensus.
<P>
While a pro-life position must be part of the agenda for national
renewal, opposition to abortion must be only one plank of the
pro-life platform.  A crisis as broad and deep as abortion on
demand requires a transformation of the political and moral culture
as well as a reform of law.  Reducing illegitimacy is the <I>sine
qua non</I> of moral reconstruction; and right-to-life activists
should realize that, as one of the few weapons in the anti-illegitimacy
arsenal, the family cap not only serves their cause in the long-term
but deserves their active support in the short-term -- subject
to the critical qualification that there must be no attendant
funding for abortions.
<P>
No hard data are available to demonstrate that the family cap
stimulates the abortion rate.  And there is reason to think that
the family cap will <I>not</I> increase abortions, even in the
short-term.    
<P>
Feminists and welfare rights activists argue that the current
benefits level is already far too low to cover the costs associated
with a new baby.  If so, it is illogical to maintain that a cap
would have a sufficiently significant impact on the &quot;affordability&quot;
of another child to necessitate such a drastic measure as abortion.
<P>
The decision to abort, anyhow, is far more than an economic calculation.
 Twenty years of spiraling illegitimacy rates in the face of liberalized
abortion laws demonstrate that many individuals do not regard
abortion as a viable option.  Policy data collected by the Family
Research Council suggest that abortion is even less acceptable
to poor women;[1] and an article recently published in <I>Family
Planning Perspectives</I> found that abortion rates for teen welfare
mothers are <I>lower</I> than national averages for all teenage
girls.[2]
<P>
Those who are tempted to conclude that it is the availability
of welfare checks that reduces the abortion rate, relative to
the general population, should keep in mind the basis of comparison.
 That hypothesis -- that limited cash benefits suppress the abortion
rate -- would predict a <I>lower</I> rate of abortion in the general
population, relative to welfare mothers, because the average member
of the general population has more economic resources at her disposal.
 The empirical data, however, refute the hypothesis; and Douglas
Besharov of the American Enterprise Institute has commented that,
to the contrary, &quot;[k]ids who have less to lose . . . are
less likely to have an abortion.&quot;[3]       
<P>
The finding that abortion rates for teen welfare mothers are lower
than national averages for all teenage girls is a powerful suggestion
that non-economic factors determine the decision to carry a child
to term.  Other research supports the claim that, whether conception
was intended or not, most illegitimate births to underclass women
today are &quot;wanted.&quot;[4] Certainly, there is ample anecdotal
evidence to suggest that some girls have babies because they want
&quot;something to love&quot; -- or, worse yet, because their
peer group has perversely defined a baby as a status symbol.[5]
<P>
Others, including the young welfare mother who testified before
a recent congressional hearing on illegitimacy, simply believe
that abortion is wrong and choose not to compound their first
mistake by committing another.  While poverty dispirits some lives,
in others it serves to highlight the intangibles that make life
most sacred.  The point of decrying moral deterioration among
the underclass is to assert an easily forgotten truth: every person,
regardless of economic status, is capable of the very moral commitments
that argue most forcefully against abortion.
<P>
Even assuming that our ultimate objective is to save as many lives
as possible, it is by no means clear that the appropriate operational
measure of success in assessing the family cap would be the number
of lives saved in the short-term -- if such a number could be
approximated in the future as it cannot be now.  The question
itself is a red herring because it obscures the larger and more
important issue: &quot;What constitutes progress toward ending
altogether the culture that finds abortion acceptable?&quot;
<P>
Deciding on a rational means to maximize the total number of lives
saved in fact requires two sets of measures for maximizing that
good -- human lives saved in the short-term and human lives saved
over the course of several generations.  Since the policy changes
under consideration affect illegitimacy and the structure of the
welfare system, the number of lives saved in the long-run should
include both children who would have been aborted as well as the
children who would have fallen prey to the violent crime that
results from, as James Q. Wilson put it, &quot;neglecting the
processes by which the underclass reproduces itself.&quot;[6]
<P>
While there is no point at which the short-term perspective loses
relevance, few would dispute that there exists some point at which
the long-term implications demand consideration.  If it is true
that preserving the current benefits package will save lives,
presumably we could save even more lives by increasing the entitlements
tenfold.  Yet, most right-to-life activists intuitively understand
that there is an alternative good to be served by restricting
benefits that will in no way compromise our commitment to life.
<P>
Charles Murray wrote in his 1988 book <I>In Pursuit of Happiness
and Good Government</I>, in a passage that defined the parameters
and the language of the above analysis: &quot;It cannot be . .
. that the objective of a program is to save lives.  It may be
the <I>operational</I> measure of success, but it cannot be the
<I>construct</I> . . . because it has no discriminatory power.
. . .  One can too easily think of measures that will save lives
efficiently but are also totalitarian.&quot;[7]
<P>
The construct we are really interested in is &quot;advancing the
pro-life cause,&quot; which we may attempt to operationalize by
estimating the total number of lives saved now and later as a
result of the proposed policy change -- in this case, the family
cap.  And there is no question that reducing illegitimacy by imposing
restrictions on welfare benefits will serve the over-arching purpose
of the pro-life movement.
<P>
As Chuck Donovan explained in a paper published by the Family
Research Council, it is a basic statistical fact that marital
status and the abortion rate are inextricably linked.  The vast
majority of abortions are performed on unmarried women -- and
the proportion is growing.  To reduce abortions, therefore, we
should reduce the premarital sex and out-of-wedlock pregnancy
that create a perceived &quot;need&quot; for abortion.
<P>
Right-to-life activists who oppose measures to reduce illegitimacy
are helping to sustain the very system that encourages young women
to find themselves in the predicament that makes abortion seem
as attractive as it possibly could.  Opposition to the family
cap is a curiously negative way to affirm life.  Although it should
be noted that many pro-life advocates are the ones on the front
lines offering material assistance to unwed mothers who do decide
to keep their babies, it would be far more compassionate to try
to preclude the need for that help in the first place.
<P>
Glenn Loury and James Q. Wilson argued convincingly at recent
welfare hearings before the Human Resources subcommittee that
the problems of illegitimacy and abortion are moral -- not material
-- problems.  They require spiritual solutions which no government
can provide directly.  Yet, Loury writes, &quot;in every community
there are agencies of moral and cultural development that seek
to shape the ways in which individuals conceive of their duties
to themselves, of their obligations to each other, and of their
responsibilities before God.&quot;[8]
<P>
In many communities, right-to-life organizations are those very
agencies, and they deserve credit and gratitude they don't often
receive.  By gradually eliminating federal benefits, poor women
who are pregnant out of wedlock will be forced to turn to local
organizations, including right-to-life crisis pregnancy groups,
that will counsel against abortion and discourage further irresponsible
behavior.
<P>
Launching the arguments against illegitimacy in the context of
the current debate over those benefits will give new rhetorical
emphasis and more widespread attention to the arguments against
abortion; for, the two ills spring from the same misconception
that life is cheap and motherhood bears no sacred responsibility.
 Indeed, the bipartisan focus on illegitimacy is one of the most
golden opportunities we have had in quite some time to reverse
the message of the counterculture that has made abortion &quot;rights&quot;
seem palatable.
<P>
Yet, to increase the logic and appeal of pro-life arguments to
a significant number of people who do not now see the moral force
in such arguments, we must begin the task of rebuilding other
civic institutions that will nourish human souls and liberate
them to fulfill their full potential.  Such an ambitious project
will require a multifaceted strategy, and eliminating the welfare
benefits that encourage illegitimacy will be a key component of
that strategy.
<P>
The interconnections linking functioning communities with functioning
families are so rife and so apparent that even Democrats now concede
Dan Quayle was right.  Illegitimacy, by definition, is the failure
of families to form in the first place; and by driving a host
of social problems that corrode communities and erode the national
character, illegitimacy promotes the failing of family on a grand
scale.
<P>
Charles Murray writes that affiliation -- including family affiliation
-- is a means whereby people of common values are enabled to enact
those values.  A functioning community that promotes a wide array
of affiliations provides an extremely important venue both for
practicing virtue and for passing down to the next generation
the habit of virtue.[9] The pro-life movement is itself a classic
example of people expressing their interests and values through
affiliations that are sustained by a rich network of institutions
outside of -- and sometimes even in opposition to -- government.
<P>
Arguably, members of the underclass do not now have the same type
of privilege; but they should and could if we begin, in Michael
Joyce's words, &quot;the resuscitation of the civic sphere which
alone makes genuine citizenship possible.&quot;[10] Because civil
institutions are the very institutions that cultivate character,
that &quot;appeal to and sustain spirit and heart as much as mind,&quot;[11]
reconstructing them will engender a far more lasting commitment
to pro-life principles than obstruction of the family cap.  Michael
Joyce has explained eloquently: &quot;Through . . . countless,
subtle, daily interactions, our civil institutions give form and
substance to the everyday qualities and values without which life
itself would be impossible.&quot;[12]
<P>
Paradoxical as it may seem, reforming the culture will be the
most expedient complementary strategy for winning new and permanent
legal victories against abortion.  If any issue position depends
on one's idea of man, it is abortion.  And an individual's idea
of man is not something that gives way to clever arguments in
court or the Congress.  Instead, it is shaped and formed from
childhood by the quiet but pervasive messages of the surrounding
society in which children grow and develop into adults.
<P>
In addition to changing notions of the individual, we must also
change the related conception of government.  If we succeed in
restoring a commitment to limited government, the courts will
be under increasing pressure to reverse the abortion decisions
that have, in George Weigel and Bill Kristol's analysis, &quot;[reduced]
the actors in American society to the coercive state and the radically
autonomous individual, bereft of all social ties and responsibilities.&quot;[13]
 There is no better way to undermine this &quot;America of strangers,&quot;
to use Richard John Neuhaus' phrase, than to restore the civil
institutions that nurture the daily interactions and affiliations
that are anathema to the proponents of centralized government.
<P>
Right-to-life advocates give collective voice to a magnificent
idealism in our political discourse.  To them, it does not matter
that a decrease in abortions will mean a disproportionate increase
in minority babies born to low-income parents.  It does matter
that abortions end innocent lives because life is eminently sacred
and precious.
<P>
Thus, pro-lifers should understand more fully than anyone in the
debate over the family cap that abortion is not an issue that
can be nickel-and-dimed or reduced to a scientific calculation
of anticipated marginal changes in the abortion rate.  The very
attempt threatens, however unintentionally, to promote the same
thoroughly dehumanized and despiritualized view of life in which
pro-abortion forces indulge.
<P>
If our objective is to find a rational means to maximize the number
of lives saved over time, it bears repeating that, for Aristotle,
&quot;conformity with a rational principle&quot; meant something
far more humane than a cold mathematical calculation of odds.
 He distinguished between &quot;theoretical wisdom,&quot; which
is more akin to a scientific process, and &quot;practical wisdom,&quot;
defined as &quot;the capacity of deliberating well about what
is good and advantageous.&quot;  Aristotle knew that in making
decisions the best of statesmen would draw upon this more indefinable
wisdom that is an equal but different part of rationality.  So
should we draw upon the best part of our wisdom in evaluating
the costs and benefits of the proposed family cap.[14]
<P>
We should also bear in mind that what we think about the right
to life has an organic relationship with our vision of the kind
of society we should institute.  In the end, it really is not
possible to think about one in isolation from the other; or else
the arguments lose impetus, grow artificial and -- lifeless.
<P>
Not by coincidence, the Declaration speaks of &quot;life&quot;
in the same breath with &quot;liberty&quot; and &quot;the pursuit
of happiness,&quot; two conditions that speak directly to the
question of how best to organize society.  The Founders instituted
a limited government to secure natural rights, including the right
to life; but as George Will noted in a recent editorial, &quot;Our
creed of limited government . . . [has a] corollary vision of
human capacities and of the life worth living,&quot; captured
by the phrase &quot;pursuit of happiness.&quot;[15]
<P>
The Founders would have scoffed at the notion that the protection
of life and limb alone is an adequate notion of &quot;happiness,&quot;
and right-to-life activists forget that at their peril in the
present debate over the family cap.  By opposing the current system
of welfare benefits, we advocate a transformation of the political
and social culture that will sustain both &quot;happiness&quot;
and a more enduring pro-life consensus than even legal reform
can hope to accomplish.

<title>GOALS 2000: THE CASE FOR REPEAL</title>

<h2>GOALS 2000:<br>
THE CASE FOR REPEAL</h2>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>
To an ailing American education system, Goals 2000 offers further
centralization, added bureaucracy, and federal coercion -- and
calls it a prescription for local freedom.
<p>
But Americans have overwhelmingly objected to the &quot;government
knows best&quot; philosophy of which Goals 2000 is another manifestation.
If the 104th Congress intends to keep its campaign promises of
decentralizing authority, returning power to states and localities,
empowering American families, balancing the budget, and reducing
the deficit, then Goals 2000 must be repealed. It is an impediment
to these goals. Leaving intact the Goals 2000 formula for restructuring
American education will undo any education reform Congress hopes
to accomplish.
<p>
Goals 2000 (P.L. 103-227) is the Clinton Administration's plan
to drastically restructure the American education system. &quot;Goals
2000 establishes overall direction for a new local-state-federal
partnership in education,&quot; writes Gordon M. Ambach, executive
director of the Council of Chief State School Officers.[1] It increases
the federal role by imposing a congressional formula for reform
on any state, school district, or school that wishes to receive
funding under this act.
<p>
The priority of the restructuring agenda can be seen in the appropriations.
Less than half the funding for Goals 2000 will reach local schools
in this first year of its existence. Of the $105 million appropriated
for Goals 2000 in FY 94, $92.4 million (88 percent) is targeted
toward state grants. Stipulations in the law require that only
45 percent of each state's grant be filtered down to individual
schools.[2] That means only $42 million, or 40 percent of the original
appropriation, will ever reach the schools. The other 60 percent
constitutes the bureaucratic skim that is being used at each level
to create the new framework for the educational system.
<p>
The danger of the Goals 2000 restructuring agenda is that all
future federal experimentation with education will be easily inculcated
into the new network. Local schools will be extremely vulnerable
to manipulation and have little, if any, autonomy.
<p>
The bureaucratic waste and ominous restructuring agenda of Goals
2000 are just the beginning of the argument against this legislation
that will radically change American education. Its ten titles
contain dozens of problem areas that warrant the repeal of Goals
2000.
<p>
<center><h3>TITLE I -- NATIONAL EDUCATION GOALS</h3></center>
<p>
This title codifies eight national education goals. Six were agreed
to in 1990 by governors and President Bush following the Charlottesville
education summit. The other two goals, parental participation
and teacher education, were added as bait to sell the Goals 2000
legislation to interest groups, such as teacher unions and the
PTA, which supposedly represent the views of teachers and parents.
<p><ul>
<li>The concept of national education goals is based on faulty
logic. If the federal government is setting goals, that presupposes
that it has the authority and ability to ensure the accomplishment
of the goals. Reaching national education goals will require an
unprecedented federal intrusion in schools.
<p>
<li>Had the goals been popularly developed and had Americans
asked for federal supervision in achieving them, Goals 2000 might
be procedurally, if not philosophically, a legitimate plan. They
did not and it is not. Secretary Riley reveals this as he retells
the history of the Goals 2000 legislation:
<p><ul>
In the first place, educators had not been in on the ground floor
when the National Education Goals were developed in 1989 and 1990.
The goals were viewed by many as a classic example of a top-down
reform imposed on localities.... Nor had parents, citizens, or
the business community been brought into the picture in a meaningful
way.... Finally, neither members of Congress nor state legislators
had a hand in crafting the goals.... The truth was that the reform
movement at the national level had absolutely no statutory basis....
The National Education Goals, three years after their announcement,
had no legal standing of any kind.[3]
</ul><p>
<li>National education goals cannot be reached through a <I>voluntary</I>
program. If the Clinton Education Department intends to reach
these goals, they certainly cannot believe that Goals 2000 is
voluntary, or at least they do not intend that it will be optional
for long. The goals are stated in section 102 using all-inclusive
language: &quot;all students will leave grades 4, 8, and 12 having
demonstrated competency over challenging subject matter...,&quot;
and &quot;every school in the United States will be free of drugs....&quot;
These goals absolutely cannot be accomplished through a voluntary
program. The crafters of this legislation were either deceived
or deceptive when they touted Goals 2000 as voluntary.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE II -- NATIONAL EDUCATION REFORM LEADERSHIP,<br>
STANDARDS AND ASSESSMENTS</h3></center>
<p>
Understanding title II is key to understanding the significance
and danger of the Goals 2000 legislation. This title is the heart
of the restructuring agenda. It creates two new national bureaucracies:
the National Education Goals Panel (NEGP) and the National Education
Standards and Improvement Council (NESIC).
<p>
The driving force of the Goals 2000 reform plan lies in title
II: <I>standards</I>. Three types of national standards are defined:
content standards, performance standards and opportunity-to-learn
standards. In order to apply for a grant under Goals 2000, each
state must develop its own content, performance and opportunity-to-learn
standards, or adopt the national standards in each of the three
areas (see title III).
<p>
Title II is very problematic for anyone who believes in a decentralized
system of education:
<p><ul>
<li>Clearly, adding bureaucracy is contrary to the goals of
this Congress. It will not lead to better education, only waste.
<p>
<li>Goals 2000 called for the creation of the National Education
Standards and Improvement Council (NESIC) within 120 days of the
law's enactment (March 31, 1994) [Sec. 212(e)]. The council was
not named during that time, nor has it been since then, yet in
FY 94 $2 million was appropriated for its use. To what end were these
funds used?
<p>
<li>NESIC was to &quot;identify areas in which voluntary national
content standards need to be developed&quot; [Sec. 213(a)(1)(A)].
Since NESIC has not been formed it obviously has not performed
this function. Which bureaucrat decided what standards projects
would be funded? With such anonymity there is no accountability.
<p>
<li>The content standards are being presented to school personnel
and the general public as though they have been officially and
legally approved. Neither of these can happen because the body
set up by law to certify the standards -- NESIC -- does not exist.
It is misleading to present these as <I>the</I> &quot;national
standards&quot; when they have been neither federally nor popularly
approved.
</ul><p>
The <I>National Standards for United States History,</I> produced
by the Center for History in the Schools, are a case in point.
A politically correct account of American history, these standards
are being presented to history teachers as <I>the national standards</I>.
While Congress may believe it has addressed the issue with the
Senate's 99 to 1 vote to reject the U.S. history standards, this
non-binding resolution was merely symbolic. In Goals 2000, Congress
gave authority over the standards to NESIC. That makes the Senate's
resolution only a good gesture. Congress should follow this vote
to reject the history standards with a vote of much greater significance:
the repeal of the entire Goals 2000 legislation, which calls for
national standards and has the potential to produce more material
like the U.S. history standards.
<p><ul>
<li>The federal government should not be involved in the creation
of standards. Government-endorsed standards are by nature coercive,
not voluntary, and will create a body of &quot;official knowledge.&quot;
This is contrary to the American tradition of freedom of thought.
Furthermore, content standards deal with curriculum, an area which
the federal Department of Education was expressly forbidden to
enter when it was created in 1979. The creation, critique and
usage of standards must remain a community endeavor. No further
federal money should be spent on standards projects, and there
should be no federal certification or endorsement of existing
standards. Political involvement results in politically-charged
standards. Imagine the reaction of those unoffended by the original
history standards if new standards were developed under the leadership
of Sen. Jesse Helms or Speaker Newt Gingrich.
</ul><p>
Opportunity-to-learn (OTL) standards are an especially troublesome
element of title II:
<p><ul>
<li>These standards shift the focus of reform back to increasing
inputs into education, a tried-and-failed method. OTL standards
chosen by states and school districts will require schools to
provide adequate resources -- including such things as gender-equitable
materials, curriculum aligned with national content standards,
and anything else NESIC deems appropriate.
<p>
<li>OTL standards are measuring sticks for schools and teachers,
not for students. They are not a reliable method for improving
student achievement. Indeed, numerous studies linking dramatically
increased spending and declining test scores indicate that spending
does not drive academic success.[4]
<p>
<li>OTL standards invite further federal intrusion in American
education. Diane Ravitch, an assistant secretary of education
in the Bush administration, wrote, &quot;[T]he new standards,
euphemistically called 'opportunity-to-learn' standards, would
permit Federal regulation of curriculum, textbooks, facilities
and instructional methods....The bill describes the Federal 'opportunity-to-learn'
standards as 'voluntary,' but litigation would quickly turn them
into mandates.&quot;[5]
</ul><p>
The idea of lawsuits and mandates is not an alarmist fabrication;
an Alabama state court recently declared the state school system
unconstitutional for not providing adequate education to its students.
The judge's 125-page opinion imposes OTL-type standards on the
state's schools.[6]
<p>
<center><h3>TITLE III -- STATE AND LOCAL EDUCATION<br>
SYSTEMIC IMPROVEMENT</h3></center>
<p>
This title authorizes block grants to states and subgrants to
local school boards [Sec. 309(a)].
<p><ul>
<li>In order to receive a grant under Goals 2000, a state is
obligated to adhere to the federal outline for reform: opportunity-to-learn
standards, content and performance standards, assessments, etc.
State improvement plans must be approved by the Secretary of Education.
Never before have states had to submit such lesson plans to the
federal government for approval. Contrary to the rhetoric of Goals
2000, this is not a formula for local authority over school reform;
it makes the word <I>voluntary</I> moot.
<p>
<li>In its grant application, a state must include &quot;an
assurance that State law provides adequate authority to carry
out each component of the State's improvement plan...&quot; [Sec.
305(a)(2)(B)]. In other words, the state must explain how it will
impose the Goals 2000 agenda on each of its school districts,
voiding the voluntary option for them as well.
<p>
<li>The Goals 2000 prescription for reform encourages states
to include plans to transform schools into &quot;one-stop shopping&quot;
centers which offer a variety of social services, including health
care and child care [Sec. 306(f)(2)]. This coordination of services
tends toward a collectivism which is contrary to our nation's
history as a free society. Concentrating the services in one place
and on one group of people may lead to a sense of dependency.
<p>
<li>Advancing social services, health care and related services
likely includes the promotion of school-based clinics (SBC). The
term &quot;coordinated services&quot; has been used by proponents
to refer to school-based clinics. These clinics commonly distribute
contraceptives and, when these measures fail, the clinics refer
for abortion.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE IV -- PARENTAL ASSISTANCE</h3></center>
<p>
This title provides for parental information and resource centers
and describes parental involvement in education. Laudable as it
sounds, this title is problematic:
<p><ul>
<li>Goal 8 (parental participation) and title IV (Parental
Assistance) assume that schools and parents have equal authority
over and responsibility for children. The legislation denies the
fact that parents' authority over their children is intrinsic
and that schools have only a delegated authority.
<p>
<li>To improve family life and help parents, Goals 2000 suggests
more programming, more meetings, more time at school and with
school personnel, and more home visits from professionals. All
of this leaves less time for parents and children to spend together.
<p>
<li>With their Goals 2000 grants, states must spend money on
&quot;parent education.&quot; Parents as Teachers (PAT), which
advocates home visits by counselors beginning at birth, is one
of the programs specifically endorsed by the law. Not only are
states encouraged to use their &quot;parent education&quot; money
to fund PAT programs, but the objectionable organization was directly
appropriated $10 million under Goals 2000 for FY 1995. The House
Education, Labor, HHS Subcommittee for Appropriations is to be
commended for targeting this program for termination. Its rationale
for proposing cuts to parent education programs is that &quot;these
are the very paternalistic and 'government knows best' programs
that the American people rejected last year.&quot;
<p>
<li>Publicly-funded institutions like PAT are not equipped
to improve families because they cannot speak to the values issues
inherent in the breakdown of families. Private voluntary associations
and individuals must take responsibility in this arena.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE V -- NATIONAL SKILL STANDARDS BOARD</h3></center>
<p>
Title V is devoted to linking education to business and industry.
It authorizes the creation of another national bureaucracy: the
National Skill Standards Board (NSSB). NSSB will establish business-education
partnerships and oversee development of skill standards and assessments.
<p><ul>
<li>The $3 million spent in 1994 to develop skill standards
is another misguided appropriation of funds. It also calls for
the development of national assessments to certify achievement
of the skill standards. These additions, however, will not produce
better candidates for business. According to a <I>Chicago Tribune</I>
article, employers seek critical thinking and creativity, but
when it comes to promoting those skills, &quot;most of the visible
school reform efforts, such as uniform national testing schemes,
head 180 degrees in the wrong direction.&quot;[7]
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE VI -- INTERNATIONAL EDUCATION PROGRAM</h3></center>
<p>
Title VI calls for evaluation of foreign education systems. It
also sets up a program of education personnel exchange with central
and eastern European countries and any country formerly a part
of the Soviet Union.
<p><ul>
<li>The United States does not have the resources to &quot;provide
Department of Education personnel and technical experts to assist
eligible countries to establish and implement a database or other
effective methods to improve educational delivery systems, structure
and organization&quot; [Sec. 601(c)(5)]. Moreover, U.S. envoys
should not be pushing the Goals 2000 agenda, unproven in our own
country, on eastern European countries.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE VII -- SAFE SCHOOLS</h3></center>
<p>
This title provides grants to local school districts to achieve
safe and drug-free schools. Section 705 describes types of programs
to be implemented to prevent violence.
<p><ul>
<li>Conflict resolution, anger management, and peer mediation
are cited as &quot;programs of demonstrated effectiveness in addressing
violence&quot; (Sec. 705). In reality, experts are skeptical of
these soft-approach violence prevention programs.[8]
<p>
<li>We cannot afford to spend millions on a violence prevention
strategy that includes programs of no proven effectiveness. Serious
efforts must be made to curb violence, but conflict resolution
and peer mediation will not get to the real solution: changed
lives and families.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE VIII -- MINORITY-FOCUSED CIVICS EDUCATION</h3></center>
<p>
This title provides grants for teacher seminars on minority-focused
civics and government.
<p><ul>
<li>Minority-focused courses will likely promote versions of
history similar to that produced by the Center for History in
the Schools in its <I>National Standards for United States History.
</I>Such politicization of history will not produce acculturation
but cultural friction and fragmentation.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE IX -- EDUCATIONAL RESEARCH AND IMPROVEMENT</h3></center>
<p>
Title IX makes organizational changes in the Department of Education's
Office of Educational Research and Improvement (OERI); prescribes
OERI's functions in relation to Goals 2000; establishes within
OERI a National Educational Research Policy and Priorities Board,
five National Research Institutes, and a National Education Dissemination
System linking federal and local agencies. It also authorizes
expansion of research grants for comprehensive school health education
(Sec. 971).
<p><ul>
<li>Once again, Goals 2000 aims to improve education by adding
and reshuffling bureaucracy.
<p>
<li>Health education, which includes sex education, has already
been a major source of grief to parents. Advancing these programs
will undoubtedly lead to an increase in challenges to parental
authority.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>TITLE X -- MISCELLANEOUS</h3></center>
<p>
This catch-all title contains a gun-free school act, a non-smoking
policy for children's services in schools, a policy for distribution
of contraceptive devices, and authorization of grants for Midnight
Basketball programs.
<p><ul>
<li>The Goals 2000 policy on contraceptive devices further
marginalizes parents. Section 1018 states that &quot;all federally
funded programs which provide for the distribution of contraceptive
devices to unemancipated minors [shall] develop procedures to
encourage, <B>to the extent practical</B>, family participation
in such programs&quot; (emphasis added). How unlikely is it that
a school administrator will find it impractical to listen to parental
objections to a condom distribution policy?
<p>
<li>Midnight Basketball was originally a private sector plan.
There is no need for government to get involved in these charitable
efforts and regulate them to death.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>
<p>
The Goals 2000 restructuring agenda will continue to spread like
kudzu throughout America as long as states receive Goals 2000
grants requiring them to submit their standards and assessments
for federal approval. Furthermore, zero-funding the Goals 2000
programs individually leaves open the possibility of future funding.
Complete repeal of Goals 2000 is the only solution.
<p>
Education reform calls for a reduction in the role of the federal
government in the system and a return to the traditional role
of school: teaching students basics like reading, writing, and
arithmetic. A decisive first step will be the repeal of Goals
2000, which subverts education reform with more federal regulation
and spending.

<I>by</I>
<P>
<I>Lt. Col. Robert L. Maginnis (U.S.A., Ret.)</I></CENTER>
<P>
The Justice Department appears to be throwing a key military homosexual
case by not calling expert witnesses to rebut the half-truths
presented by pro-homosexual witnesses like former Assistant Secretary
of Defense Lawrence J. Korb.
<P>
Six avowed homosexuals are contesting the military's homosexual
law in a Brooklyn federal district court case, <I>Abel et al.
v. William Perry</I>.  This is the first federal case challenging
the military's new law.  Plaintiffs allege that the military ban
violates equal protection and free speech rights and imposes punitive
rules unrelated to fitness and ability to serve.[1]
<P>
Lambda Legal Defense and Education Fund and the American Civil
Liberties Union are representing the homosexual servicemembers.
 They called six &quot;expert&quot; witnesses to refute the military's
constitutional right to exclude homosexuals.  Not one of those
witnesses was countered by expert defenders of the ban.[2]
<P>
The law is on solid constitutional ground.  Congress has the constitutional
responsibility for writing personnel laws for the military: Article
I, Section 8.  Congress conducted extensive hearings in both the
Senate and the House in 1993.  It then codified the military's
policy banning homosexuals, and President Clinton signed it into
law on November 30, 1993.  The law took effect on February 28,
1994.
<P>
Mr. Korb, who testified on March 16, is an apologist for homosexual
causes who now works for the Brookings Institute.  In the past,
he frequently has relied on a discredited study from the Defense
Personnel Security Research and Education Center (PERSEREC), which
contains much sloppy research and misinformation.
<P>
Some of Korb's statements on the topic deserve closer examination:
<P>
<LI><I>Army Times</I>, February 17, 1992.  Korb states: &quot; [PERSEREC]
 completed two 
studies that concluded: <I>Homosexuals are better prospective
military members than heterosexuals</I>; the Pentagon should engage
in empirical research to see if they can function appropriately
in military units; and the Pentagon should make judgments about
individuals based on conduct, not sexual orientation.&quot;
There is no evidence that &quot;homosexuals are better&quot; soldiers,
and the Pentagon's 1993 studies found conclusively that homosexuals
are a high-risk category of potential recruits. 
<P>
<LI><I>CNN</I>, &quot;Larry King Live,&quot; July 27, 1993.  Korb
said, &quot;[A]ccording to the Pentagon's own studies done out
in Monterey, <I>approximately 200,000 people in the military are
homosexuals.  So you're talking about 10 percent of the force</I>.&quot;
<P>
The cited &quot;studies&quot; relied on the discredited work of
sex researcher Alfred C. Kinsey.  They exaggerate Kinsey's already
overblown findings of sexual deviance in the general population,
including the now-refuted 10 percent myth for homosexuality. 
Even Planned Parenthood, <I>The New Republic</I> and <I>Newsweek</I>
concede as much.  More reliable surveys indicate that the homosexual
population in America is less than two percent.
<P>
<LI> Testimony before the Senate Armed Services Committee, March
31, 1993.  Korb testified, &quot;Professor Theodore Sarbin, co-author
of a 1991 PERSEREC study for the U.S. military, has stated that
<I>there is no data linking gays to lower morale or cohesion</I>.
 Rather he (Sarbin) noted that where there's good leadership,
there's high morale.&quot;
<P>
This statement is without foundation.  PERSEREC omits any reference
to any scientific study of military unit cohesion and discipline
and their effect on combat readiness.  
<P>
The Pentagon's 1993 task force that studied the issue of homosexuals
in the military found hundreds of cases where servicemembers discovered
to be homosexual were very disruptive.  Mr. Korb's anecdotal account
is disputed by these cases.
<P>
A survey by the American Security Council Foundation found that
99 percent of active duty officers said homosexuals would undermine
the cohesiveness and readiness of combat units.[3] The Defense Readiness
Council compiled a survey of 2,800 retired flag and general officers.
 Nearly 90 percent said they believe homosexuals undermine morale.[4]
<P>
<LI>Testimony in the 1994 case of <I>Margarethe Cammermeyer v. Les
Aspin</I>.  Korb told that court: &quot;The policy was never intended
to authorize the military to discharge someone simply based on
his or her status -- absent any evidence of conduct.  To the contrary,
conduct was the real focus of the policy....A servicemember's
own admission of being gay -- absent any indication of her propensity
to engage in homosexual conduct -- is simply not sufficient grounds
for discharging her under the existing policy....The policy I
authorized should not be construed as authorizing such an irrational
outcome.&quot;[5]
<P>
The military's pre-1993 ban was based on the principle that, &quot;Homosexuality is incompatible with military service.&quot;  Decades of court
rulings have affirmed the military's position that declaring oneself
a homosexual implies the person has or will engage in illegal
homosexual behavior.  
<P>
<LI>Testimony in the 1995 case of <I>Abel et al. v. William Perry</I>.
 Korb told the court, &quot;We were losing a lot of very good
people in whom the government had invested a lot of money.&quot;
 He also compared the homosexual exclusion with women in the military.
&quot;I can't over-emphasize the great opposition from military
leaders to ending the draft and bringing women into the services.&quot;
 Korb said he once shared a room with a homosexual without any
problem.
<P>
The military releases three times as many people each year for
drug abuse than it does for homosexuality.  And homosexuals in
the military have a bad record: as a group, they have a high ratio
of discipline problems and account for most of the AIDS cases.
<P>
Homosexual activists often try to compare their agenda with the
integration of blacks into the military.  Former chairman of the
Joint Chiefs of Staff General Colin Powell does not agree:  &quot;Skin
color is a benign, nonbehavioral characteristic.  Sexual orientation
is perhaps the most profound of human behavioral characteristics.
 Comparison of the two is a convenient but invalid argument.&quot;[6]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Justice Department and the Pentagon have many witnesses (active
duty and retired officers and civilians) who would refute the
half-truths presented by the pro-homosexual witnesses.  It is
inexplicable that in a politicized case like <I>Abel v. William
Perry,</I> the Justice Department failed to call experts to challenge
the misinformation promoted by homosexual groups.
<P>
The 104th Congress must demand that the Justice Department represent
the military's interests.  The evidence supports the military
homosexual law, but if the government is silent about the facts,
cases like this will be lost, and the destruction of military
morale will proceed unchecked.

<TITLE>CLINTON ADMINISTRATION SCUTTLES FIRST COURT TEST OF MILITARY'S HOMOSEXUAL LAW</TITLE>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/insight/insight.gif">
<P>
<H2>CLINTON ADMINISTRATION<BR>
SCUTTLES FIRST COURT TEST OF<BR>
MILITARY'S HOMOSEXUAL LAW</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<CENTER><I>by</I>
<P>
<I>Lt. Col. Robert L. Maginnis (U.S.A., Ret.)</I></CENTER>
<P>
In a lackluster performance, the Clinton Administration failed
to use key arguments and called no witnesses in the first court
test of the military's new homosexual law.  
<P>
On March 30, 1995, Judge Eugene Nickerson of the Eastern District
of New York struck down parts of the military's new homosexual
law and the Pentagon's implementing directives in the case of
<I>Lieutenant Colonel Jane Able, et al. v. United States of America</I>.[1]
<P>
Judge Nickerson ruled that six service members' First and Fifth
Amendment rights were violated when the military sought to discharge
them solely based on their admissions of homosexuality.  He enjoined
the Pentagon from discharging the six, and the Justice Department
is expected to appeal the case to the Second Circuit Court of
Appeals.
<P>
This case follows a pattern seen in the Steffan, Meinhold, and
Cammermeyer cases whereby the government ignores key arguments
for prohibiting service by avowed homosexuals.  These cases demonstrate
fundamental differences between the law, which was signed by President
Clinton on November 30, 1993, and the Pentagon's implementing
directions, which took effect February 28, 1994.
<P>
Specifically, the Justice Department failed to:
<P><UL>
<LI>Call witnesses to represent the government's interest.  The
plaintiffs called six &quot;expert&quot; witnesses to dispute
long-held &quot;myths&quot; about homosexuals. 
<P>
<LI>Present well documented arguments for denying homosexual service
based on physical and psychological problems.
<P>
<LI>Demonstrate that the policy is conduct-based rather than status-based
as the plaintiffs argued.
<P>
<LI>Show that homosexual &quot;lifestyles&quot; and &quot;values&quot;
are contrary to the best interests of the armed services and present
serious morale and unit cohesion problems.
<P>
<LI>Refute a flawed study cited by the plaintiffs as evidence that
homosexuals will not damage morale and unit cohesion.
<P>
<LI>Demonstrate that homosexuals present a risk to the military
and therefore the military's ban is justified.  
</UL>
The judge noted key differences between the law and the directives:
<P><UL>
<LI>Although the law permits asking about homosexual acts and orientation
at the point of admission, the Clinton Administration has rejected
the questions.  The judge labeled this as unusual.  On one hand
the Pentagon encourages homosexuals to join (by not making homosexuality
part of a pre-induction litmus test) and then insists that the
homosexual remain secretive about his &quot;status.&quot;
<P>
<LI>The law denies service to homosexuals, but the directives permit
service to admitted homosexuals who can rebut the presumption
that they will engage in homosexual misconduct.  This creates
a status/conduct dichotomy.  The judge labels the rebuttable presumption
as &quot;Orwellian.&quot;
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>FIRST AMENDMENT ARGUMENT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The plaintiffs complain that the government violated their First
Amendment rights when it tried to discharge them for stating that
they are homosexual.  
<P>
The military law [10 U.S.C. 654(b)(2)] permits discharge when
&quot;the member has stated that he or she is a homosexual or
bisexual, or words to that effect, unless there is a further finding,
made and approved in accordance with procedures set forth in the
regulations, that the member has demonstrated that he or she is
not a person who engages in, attempts to engage in, has a propensity
to engage in, or intends to engage in homosexual acts.&quot; 
The Pentagon's directives which implement this law [DoD Directive
1332.14 and 1332.30] have the same litmus test.
<P>
The government argued that this is not a First Amendment issue
because the law and the directives are directed solely at the
prohibition of acts and give members the opportunity to rebut
the presumption of misconduct.  However, the government failed
to show a nexus between a declaration of homosexuality and homosexual
misconduct.  In fact, government lawyers labeled much of the available
evidence as &quot;myths,&quot; thus aiding the plaintiffs.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3> GOVERNMENT FAILED TO EXPLAIN RISKS ASSOCIATED WITH HOMOSEXUALS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The judge noted that the government made no argument to exclude
homosexuals based on &quot;mental illness,&quot; security or infectious
diseases.  In fact, Justice Department lawyers dismissed these
well-founded arguments as &quot;myths.&quot;  Consider the facts.
<P>
<B>Homosexuals as a category present unacceptable risks.</B>
Research shows that homosexuals tend to be extremely promiscuous
and tend to have high incidences of sexually transmitted diseases,
especially the deadly AIDS virus.
<P>
Admitting homosexuals into the military violates the legal principle
of the assumption of risk.  This principle states that if you
know there is a risk and you assume it, then don't complain when
the risk materializes.  
<P>
A recent study from the University of Michigan found that people
with HIV are more capable of spreading the virus during the first
60 days of infection but that blood tests during this period do
not find the HIV antibodies.[2] This means that the military assumes
some risk, even though all personnel are initially tested, that
soldiers are not infected.  This is why screening out high-risk
groups and not just those who test positive for HIV is appropriate.
 Unfortunately, the Clinton Administration no longer screens out
homosexuals -- by far the highest risk group for contracting HIV.
<P>
The Army's Surgeon General, Lieutenant General Alcide Lanoue,
has addressed the health risks associated with homosexuals:[3]
<P><UL>
<LI>&quot;The military setting provides unique requirements for
safety in executing the Army blood transfusion program and for
preventing the transmission of blood-borne pathogens (especially
HIV and hepatitis B) in the field setting.  Homosexual males would
comprise a pool of ineligible blood donors and as a group are
at high risk of infection by HIV and hepatitis B, both significant
blood-borne pathogens which can infect other soldiers through
exposure to blood in peace and war.&quot; [During Operation Desert
Storm, there were five documented instances where blood was drawn
directly from soldiers and transfused.  In Somalia, five units
of blood were drawn from soldiers and directly transfused to Somalis.
 The urgency of such transfusions precludes testing for the AIDS
virus.]
<P>
<LI>&quot;HIV and other Sexually Transmitted Disease rates will
increase to the extent that the proportion of homosexual males
in the Army increases because homosexual/bisexual men are allowed
to enter and remain in the Army.&quot; [The CDC reports that most
of the AIDS patients in this country are homosexuals.[4] Homosexuals
account for a disproportionate number of America's most serious
STD's, including syphilis, gonorrhea, genital warts, and hepatitis
A and B.[5] Moreover, the 1994 homosexual sex survey in <I>The Advocate</I>,
a mainstream homosexual magazine, found that 13 percent of respondents
were HIV-positive and only 18 percent had taken all three shots
in the hepatitis B vaccine series.  <I>The Advocate</I> article
admits that, &quot;Gay men are one of the top risk groups for
being exposed to hepatitis B.[6]
<P>
<LI> &quot;A male homosexual soldier is significantly more likely
than a heterosexual soldier to be nondeployable for medical reasons
related to HIV infection.  If HIV-infected, the soldier will be
permanently nondeployable.  Male homosexuals are more likely to
acquire sexually transmitted diseases which can render them nondeployable,
such as gonorrhea, syphilis, and hepatitis B.
</UL>
&quot;Readiness from a medical standpoint will suffer if the restriction
is lifted.  The impact would be felt at the unit level, when the
homosexual soldier cannot train and deploy for health reasons.
 Likewise, the impact would be felt Army-wide in terms of the
military blood program and of the burden placed on the Army health
care system.&quot;
<P>
According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, homosexuals
are especially vulnerable to contracting HIV.  They are a high-risk
group because of co-factors associated with their lifestyle. 
These include recreational drug use, homosexual sex, malnutrition,
prior incidents of sexually transmitted diseases, and, most significantly,
sexual promiscuity.  
<P>
Homosexuals who participate in unsafe sex practices with multiple
partners and without taking precautions are at great risk of contracting
sexually transmitted diseases.  <I>The Advocate</I> survey found
that 72 percent of homosexual respondents engage in insertive
oral intercourse, 46 percent insertive anal intercourse, 45 percent
receptive anal-oral sex, 48 percent in three-way sex, 24 percent
in group sex (4 or more), and 10 percent in sadomasochism.[7] Most
of the homosexuals in the survey admitted to having had more than
30 sex partners over their lifetime, and more than a third (35%)
report more than 100 partners.  The survey also found that only
one time in four do homosexual men use condoms.[8]
<P>
Heterosexuals have fewer sex partners than homosexuals.  A 1988-1990
General Social Survey found that 91 percent of men 25 to 29 years
of age are heterosexually active.  Nineteen percent of these men
have had only one sex partner, 55 percent have had two to 19 partners,
and 25 percent have had 20 or more partners.[9]
<P>
The University of Chicago published a national sex survey in October,
1994, which found that 20 percent of men have had only one sex
partner in their lifetime, 21 percent have had two to four partners,
17 percent 5 to 10 partners, 16 percent 11 to 20 and 17 percent
report having had 21 or more sex partners.[10] However, that survey
excluded men over 59, who constitute one-sixth of the population
and who typically have had more conservative sex lives.  Thus
the real figures probably are even lower for the population of
all men.[11]
<P>
Homosexuality also increases medical costs.  With the ban in place,
openly homosexual inductees are turned away.  However, with the
ban lifted, a homosexual recruit could contract HIV within days
of induction or have early-stage HIV and not test positive and
be accorded full medical benefits for the rest of his life.  This
is about $120,000 in direct medical costs per AIDS patient.[12]
<P>
Dr. Edmund Tramont, Associate Director for retroviral research
at Walter Reed Army Medical Center, published a 10-year projection
for HIV costs at $1.7 to $1.9 billion.[13] He warns that this is
in 1989 dollars, is based on the present rate of new cases and
assumes that only 60 percent of health care beneficiaries will
use the military health care system.  The potential 10-year cost
could rise to $5 billion if these assumptions are incorrect.[14]
The U.S. Department of Health and Human Services indicates that
the lifetime cost of treating a person with AIDS -- from diagnosis
until death -- is $102,000.[15] The American Medical Association
estimated the per-person AIDS patient cost would rise to $386,000
by the year 2000 and $639,000 by the year 2008.[16]
<P>
As of April 1993 the military had dealt with 8,832 HIV-positive
service members.  Most have been separated, but at that time 1,580
were still on active duty.  Their status precluded them from deploying
overseas and necessitated special assignments and special medical
care.[17]
<P>
Homosexuals also have much shorter life expectancy than heterosexuals
as indicated by a study of more than 6,737 obituaries published
in <I>Omega: Journal of Death and Dying</I>.  The average age
of homosexuals who died from AIDS is 39; from all other causes
it is 42.[18]
<P>
Substance addiction and abuse represent the second key health
problems after AIDS in the homosexual subculture (with violence
the third).[19] A report by the National Lesbian-Gay Health Foundation
found that homosexuals -- men and women -- are about three times
as likely as heterosexuals to have an alcohol or drug abuse problem.[20]
<P>
While the 1992 GAO report states that the military spent $26 million
on homosexuals discharged,  it spent many times that figure treating
homosexuals with AIDS -- people who lied to enter the military
and now receive full health and pay benefits.  The cost-effective
decision would be to minimize the risk to the federal taxpayer
by rejecting homosexuals before they are recruited and discharging
those later discovered.
<P>
The 1992 GAO report also found that women are discharged for homosexuality
four times as often as men.  They are much more likely to be processed
under administrative discharge procedures than men.
<P>
Lesbians are also disruptive to unit morale and cohesion.  Pentagon
records include vignettes[21] such as the case of a female sergeant
who drank too much.  She approached four different women at a
base social club making sexually explicit remarks and grabbing
one woman's buttocks.  She was arrested on charges of indecent
assault.
<P>
A female veteran told her account of another female soldier who
made sexual advances in a barracks.  &quot;I was stuck in the
same barracks with that person for three months.  I had to get
up and look at that person every day.  She [the homosexual] insisted
on trying to find a mate in the barracks, and by the end of the
training, everyone has [sic] lost morale.&quot;
<P>
A female basic training soldier complained to her drill sergeant
that other female trainees were &quot;making out&quot; in a common
area.  The sergeant subsequently found seven female soldiers partially
dressed, embracing each other, holding hands, and kissing.  The
seven admitted they were lesbians and said that they were consenting
adults.  They stated they had not engaged in sexual activities,
and their lifestyle had nothing to do with being a good soldier.
<P>
A female air force veteran was assigned a lesbian roommate.  She
made strong sexual advances to the straight airwoman, so much
so that the airwoman left her room and slept on the floor in a
friend's barracks.
<P>
<B>The Justice Department ignored evidence showing that homosexuality
is a pathology.</B>  
<P>
Rather, contrary to long-established military precedence, the
government embraced the concept that homosexuality is normal or
at least of little consequence.  Labeling homosexuality as other
than a pathology is a serious mistake.
<P>
The military's World War II experience provided considerable insight
into human behavior.  Specialists in military medicine literally
rewrote the diagnostic codes and nomenclature for psychiatric
disorders.  Since 1945, the Army has consistently held that homosexuality
is a behavioral problem, not a mental disease.[22]
<P>
In 1952, the American Psychiatric Association (APA) Council approved
and published a new nomenclature for categorizing mental disorders
similar to those used by the military.[23] In the more than 40 years
since that time, the APA, under pressure from militant homosexual
groups, has progressively changed the nomenclature so as to remove
the negative connotations implicit in the terms &quot;sexual deviation&quot;
or &quot;pathology.&quot;
<P>
During its annual meetings from 1969 through 1971, the APA was
besieged by activists demanding the recognition of homosexual
behavior as normal.  In 1971, homosexual activists invaded the
annual meeting and denounced psychiatry as &quot;the enemy incarnate.&quot;[24]
<P>
In 1973, activists challenged the New England Psychiatric Society
to rename the section on &quot;sexual deviation&quot; to &quot;sexual
dysfunction.&quot;  Later that year, APA trustees ruled that homosexuality
would no longer be listed in its official nomenclature of mental
disorders but, rather, would be referred to as &quot;sexual orientation
disturbance.&quot;[25]
<P>
The revision of nomenclature continued when, in 1986, the last
remaining term, &quot;ego-dystonic homosexuality,&quot; was removed
from the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Psychiatric Disorders.
 This was done over the strong protest of many psychiatrists who
preferred to label homosexuality a long standing disturbance originating
in the early years of life.[26]
<P>
A survey of the American Medical Association membership in 1975
found that 69 percent agreed that homosexuality is &quot;pathological.&quot;[27]
 An argument used by those who promote homosexuality is that this
proclivity is inborn and irreversible.  Numerous psychotherapists,
including Elizabeth Moberly, Gerald van den Aardweg, Joseph Nicolosi,
Charles Socarides, and Masters and Johnson have reported significant
success in helping homosexuals to recover, thereby proving it
is a curable pathology.[28]
<P>
Despite considerable evidence of success in gender reparative
therapy, the APA, under pressure from gay activists, voted to
stop recommending efforts to turn unhappy homosexuals into heterosexuals.
 In December 1994, AMA's governing House of Delegates called for
a &quot;nonjudgmental recognition of sexual orientation by physicians.&quot;[29]
<P>
<B>The government ignored evidence that homosexuals are a security
risk by relying on a debunked government report which suggests
that homosexuals are no more at risk of blackmail than heterosexuals.</B>
<P>
The primary study comes from the Defense Personnel Security Research
and Education Center (PERSEREC), an agency of the Department of
Defense.[30] Although the report contains much sloppy research and
misinformation, it is frequently cited by one of the plaintiffs'
key witnesses in this case, former Assistant Secretary of Defense
Lawrence J. Korb.
<P>
Few people identify themselves as heterosexual; that identity
is assumed.  Homosexuals do, indeed, identify themselves, however.
<P>
Landmark research by Alan Bell and Martin Weinberg, <I>Homosexualities:
A Study of Diversity Among Men and Women</I>, found that a significant
number of homosexuals report that &quot;someone has threatened
[them with] exposure of homosexuality in order to get something
of value.&quot;[31]
<P>
If the threat of blackmail were the only problem with homosexuals
in the military, then lifting the prohibition might be justified.
 However, homosexuals should not serve for many reasons, and security
investigations are a valid mechanism for enforcing the law.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>JUDGE SEES A STATUS V. CONDUCT DICHOTOMY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The legal fiction that an admission of homosexuality is not a
valid presumption of misconduct has long been dismissed by the
courts.  For many years, the military has won homosexual cases
because the courts recognize that people don't label themselves
homosexuals without some experience or intent to engage in the
defining behavior.  The Clinton Administration tried to finesse
this point in court but failed to persuade the judge, who labeled
the government's arguments as &quot;Orwellian.&quot;
<P>
Because the government failed to show a connection between a declaration
of homosexuality and misconduct, the judge understandably concluded
&quot;that the admission of homosexuals did not pose an uncontrollable
risk that they would commit acts inherently dangerous to morale,
good order, and discipline....&quot;
<P>
<CENTER><H3>JUDGE RELIES ON DEBUNKED STUDY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The government argued that homosexuals create sexual tension in
single-gender organizations.  This tension undermines morale and
cohesion which are key to military readiness.
<P>
The plaintiffs dismiss this argument by citing a Rand Corporation
study which concludes &quot;although some disruptions might result
from having acknowledged homosexuals serving in the military....the
experience of analogous [non-military] organizations...suggests
that any increase is likely to be quite small.&quot;
<P>
In 1993, Secretary of Defense Les Aspin commissioned the Rand
Corporation to study lifting the military's homosexual ban.  The
Rand study cost $1.3 million and contains inaccurate or misleading
information and inappropriate parallels.
<P><UL>
<LI>Judge Nickerson cites Rand's report on other countries, &quot;[N]o
serious problems were reported concerning the presence of homosexuals
in the force.&quot;
<P>
Rand ignored the June 1993 GAO report on &quot;Homosexuals in
the Military: Policies and Practices of Foreign Countries.&quot;[32]
 The GAO reviewed 25 countries and selected four countries for
detailed analysis.  The report states that 11 countries have policies
that do not permit homosexuals to serve in the military, 11 have
policies that do.  Three of the latter 11 countries do not have
any laws, regulations, or policies that address this issue.  An
unpublished Pentagon study conducted in December 1992 found that
some of those countries that permit homosexuals to serve do so
with strict limitations. 
<P>
Testimony before the Senate and House Armed Services Committees
(SASC and HASC) in April and May 1993 illustrates the dramatic
differences between foreign militaries and our own.  For example,
the Netherlands started a homosexual military experiment in 1974.
 That nation has 65,000 service members, including 40,000 conscripts
who serve 14 months and who primarily commute from home each day.
 The U.S. has 2.5 million active and reserve service personnel
stationed in the U.S. and around the world at any given time.
 The U.S. routinely participates in combat operations, something
the Dutch have not done for 50 years.      
The German armed forces, which are included among those that do
<I>not</I> have an exclusionary policy, will not induct acknowledged
homosexual volunteers because they would &quot;undermine military
order and discipline.&quot;[33] Of the 476,300 members, 43 percent
are conscripts who, if identified as homosexual, may be required
to undergo psychological tests to determine their fitness.  The
German Federal Administrative Court declared in November 1990
that the military is justified in not allowing homosexuals to
serve in leadership and educational positions.
<P>
Foreign social experiences have little relevance for America's
military.  The U.S. is a superpower with urgent missions worldwide.
 America also has a radical homosexual community and a liberal
judicial system, a combination that guarantees a steady stream
of legal activism that is disruptive to military morale.
<P>
<LI>Judge Nickerson cites the 1992 GAO study on analogous organizations
which &quot;accepted homosexuals into their ranks...[and] have
generally not reported adverse impacts.&quot;
<P>
Rand's &quot;analogous organizations&quot; are fire and police
departments.  Researchers visited six cities and concluded that
homosexuals were integrated through clear and simple policies,
aggressive leadership and adherence to strict standards of conduct.
 The report prescribes the same approach for the military.
<P>
Rand ignores the important lessons from San Francisco Chief of
Police Anthony D. Ribera, who told the HASC on May 7, 1993 that
his department experiences a &quot;significantly higher&quot;
number of AIDS deaths among homosexual officers.  His department
routinely tests for Hepatitis B -- as demanded by the policemen's
union.  And they rely on local hospitals rather than other officers
for emergency blood.
<P>
San Francisco's officers also go home evenings or, as in the Seattle
Fire Department, occupy private cubicles when required to stay
overnight.  Additionally, homosexual officers serve primarily
in homosexual districts and, as in New York City, no one is forced
to pair up with a homosexual.  Chief Ribera concludes, &quot;Our
experience is remotely parallel to the military.&quot;
<P>
Sgt. Edward Striedinger of the Seattle Police Department told
the HASC about female officers who complained about advances from
lesbian officers.  These women refused to file formal complaints,
citing fear of reprisals. 
<P>
The parallels between paramilitary and military organizations
are mostly cosmetic, such as wearing side-arms and uniforms. 
The differences are pronounced but ignored in Rand's briefing.
<P>
<LI>Judge Nickerson cites Rand's study on racial integration of
the services stating, integration &quot;did not 'destroy' unit
cohesion and military effectiveness.&quot;
<P>
Rand equates the evolving &quot;discriminatory&quot; homosexual
policy with the integration of blacks into the military.  General
Colin Powell has rejected the linkage: &quot;Skin color is [a]
benign, nonbehavioral characteristic.  Sexual orientation is perhaps
the most profound of human behavioral characteristics.  Comparison
of the two is a convenient but invalid argument.&quot;[34]
<P>
The Council of 100 (a national organization of African-American
Republicans founded in 1974) points out differences in the moral
and social climate in 1948 (when President Truman directed the
military to integrate), and the fact that blacks had honorably
and openly served since the Revolutionary War.  The Council said
that the homosexual discrimination argument is &quot;a disingenuous
strategy to divert attention from the real issues&quot; of readiness
and cohesion.[35]
<P>
The integration of avowed homosexuals brings into the military
services individuals whose behavior violates federal law.  The
integration of black Americans involved no behavioral assumptions.
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>FIFTH AMENDMENT ARGUMENT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The government argued that heterosexual service members &quot;will
be upset by a co-worker's mere statement of homosexuality&quot;
and as a result refuse to work cooperatively.  The judge labels
this unjustified discrimination.
<P>
The government once again failed to present compelling evidence
that homosexual &quot;lifestyles&quot; and &quot;values&quot;
are incompatible with military service.
<P>
Consider the implications of homosexual service for military morale.
<P>
Morale means &quot;a strong sense of enthusiasm and dedication
to a commonly shared goal that unifies a group.&quot;  Heterosexual
soldiers forced to live and work with avowed homosexuals cannot
be expected to submit to sexual tension with &quot;...a strong
sense of enthusiasm.&quot;  
<P>
Open homosexuals tend to derive their basic identity from their
sexual orientation and practice: &quot;I am a homosexual,&quot;
as opposed to the American soldier's basic identity: &quot;I am
a soldier.&quot;  The homosexual's preoccupation with individual
behavioral characteristics is incongruent with and detracts from
the commonly shared goal -- accomplishment of the mission -- which
unifies heterosexual soldiers and subordinates their individual
goals to that of the group.
<P>
The homosexual subculture is recognized as &quot;liberated,&quot;
or in a manner of speaking, undisciplined.  This is inherently
at odds with the 24-hour discipline system within which soldiers
must live and work.  Homosexuals are distinguished from other
subcultures by their behavior [sodomy].  One group behavioral
characteristic is a very high rate of promiscuity.  Military records
indicate that homosexuals are statistically more likely to engage
in misconduct than heterosexuals.  They have a higher incidence
of drug and alcohol abuse than heterosexuals.  If these aren't
enough, much-touted books such as Randy Shilts' <I>Conduct Unbecoming</I>
and Mary Ann Humphrey's <I>My Country, My Right to Serve</I> provide,
perhaps unwittingly, ample testimony to the disruptive nature
of homosexuals in military units.[36]
<P>
The voice of experience indicates that homosexuals jeopardize
military morale.  For example, a survey of active duty officers
conducted for the American Security Council Foundation found that
99.03 percent said homosexuals would undermine the cohesiveness
and readiness of combat units.[37] The Defense Readiness Council
compiled a survey of 2,800 retired flag and general officers.
 Nearly 90 percent said they believe homosexuals undermine morale.[38]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>JUDGE MAKES NO MORAL DECISION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Judge Nickerson explained that his task &quot;is to determine
the constitutionality of the policy adopted by Congress, not its
morality.&quot;  He argues that everyone is &quot;entitled to
think it demeaning and unworthy of a great nation to base a policy
on pretense rather than on truth.&quot;
<P>
The judge suggests that constitutionality and morality may not
agree in this case, but many soldiers think this is clearly a
morality issue.  And requiring soldiers to &quot;tolerate&quot;
homosexuality will lead to recruitment and retention problems.
 The <I>Los Angeles Times</I> survey found that 46 percent of
soldiers said lifting the ban would enter into their reenlistment
decision and 11 percent would not reenlist because of it.  A February
1993 <I>CNN/Gallup Poll</I> found that, among men who had not
attended college, the prime recruiting population, 74 percent
opposed lifting the ban.  
<P>
The judge's labeling this a &quot;pretense&quot; is based on the
Clinton Administration's decision to stop asking recruits whether
they are homosexual.  Asking the question keeps honest homosexuals
out and sends a clear message that to serve, others must keep
their homosexuality a secret.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
It is expected that the Supreme Court will hear this case by 1997.
 As long as the government permits homosexuals to serve and as
long as the Clinton Administration's implementing directives flout
the law, however, the outcome is in doubt.
<P>
The 104th Congress must take legislative action to stop the evasion
of reality.  The Clinton Administration should be required to
abide by the law and the Justice Department must defend the law
using longstanding and successful arguments.

MANDATES ABORTION TRAINING</H2>

<P>
On February 14, 1995, the 23-member Accreditation Council for
Graduate Medical Education (ACGME) voted unanimously to pass new
regulations mandating that all medical residents specializing
in obstetrics and gynecology be trained to perform elective abortions.
 Individual residents expressing moral or religious objections
would be able to opt out of the abortion training.  However, medical
institutions opposed to abortion, such as Catholic hospitals,
would still be required -- in order to maintain their accredited
status -- to provide their students with abortion training by
arranging for their students to receive such training at another
location.
<P>
The wording of the new requirement is as follows:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>&quot;Experience with induced abortion must be part of residency
education, except for residents with moral or religious objections.
 This education can be provided outside the institution.  Experience
with management of complications of abortion must be provided
to all residents.  If a residency program has a religious, moral
or legal restriction which prohibits the residents from performing
abortions within the institution, the program must ensure that
the residents receive a satisfactory education and experience
managing the complications of abortion.  Furthermore, such residency
programs must have mechanisms which ensure that residents in their
program who do not have a religious or moral objection receive
education and experience in performing abortion at another institution.&quot;[1]
<P></BLOCKQUOTE>
Programs which fail to comply with the new regulations risk losing
their accreditation.  Accreditation status qualifies teaching
hospitals to receive federal reimbursement for services which
medical residents provide to patients.  Moreover, doctors must
ordinarily graduate from accredited training programs to get certified
as competent in their specialties.

<CENTER><H3>DECLINE IN ABORTION PROVIDERS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Over the last twenty years, the number of medical schools offering
elective abortion training to their residents has declined.  In
1976, 92.5 percent of U.S. 
medical schools offered first-trimester abortion training, either
on a routine (26.3 percent) or optional basis (66.2 percent).
 This contrasts with 1991 figures in which 68.8 percent of medical
schools offered first-trimester abortion training -- 12.4 percent
on a routine basis, 56.4 percent on an optional basis.[2] Second-trimester
abortion training is only slightly less common than first-trimester
training programs (65.4 percent vs. 68.8 percent respectively),
but fewer medical schools routinely offer second-trimester abortion
training (6.7 percent); more provide optional training (58.7 percent).[3]
<P>
About one third of medical schools refuse to provide abortion
training due to moral and/or legal reasons.  For example, Catholic-affiliated
hospitals -- which make up about 20 percent of all U.S. hospitals
-- do not perform elective abortions because of religious and
moral beliefs.[4] Other hospitals, such as the publicly financed
Truman Medical Center in Missouri, are legally prohibited from
performing abortions because laws in several states -- including
Missouri -- bar the use of taxpayer money to fund abortions.[5]
<P>
In addition to the declining number of medical schools which provide
abortion training, fewer physicians are willing to perform abortions.
 A Columbia University survey found that nearly half of the ob/gyn
chief residents graduating each year have never performed a first-trimester
abortion.[6]
<P>
Overall, the Alan Guttmacher Institute (AGI) reports that the
number of hospitals, clinics, and physicians' offices that provide
abortions -- 2,380 in 1992 -- has been declining at a rate of
about 65 a year.  Most of the decline can be attributed to hospitals;
the number of hospitals providing abortions decreased by 18 percent
between 1988 and 1992.[7]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>ENSURING THAT WOMEN HAVE A CHOICE?</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Proponents of ACGME's new regulations such as the National Abortion
Federation, the Planned Parenthood Federation of America, the
Feminist Majority Foundation, the Center for Reproductive Law
and Policy, and the current leadership of the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG) point to the decline
in abortion providers as justification for the mandate.  They
emphasize that unless the procedure is required, many ob/gyn students
will choose to opt out of abortion training, thereby decreasing
access to abortion.
<P>
Abortion advocacy groups hope the ACGME mandate will help bring
abortion back into the &quot;mainstream&quot; of ob/gyn practice.
 Currently, the vast majority of abortions are performed in clinics,
isolating abortion from the general practice of medicine.  Abortionists
also say they frequently feel less respected by their colleagues
and society in general.  By including abortion as a necessary
ob/gyn service, abortion proponents hope to remove the taint associated
with abortion and also reduce the targeting of clinics by abortion
protesters.
<P>
Finally, the ACGME cited patient safety as a reason to require
abortion training.  Dr. John C. Gienapp, Ph.D., executive director
of ACGME, said, &quot;Those physicians who choose to develop appropriate
medical skills in the area of abortion must be trained adequately.&quot;[8]
 The American Medical Association agreed, saying in a statement,
&quot;For the safety of patients, it is essential that physicians
providing abortion services are trained and competent.&quot;[9]
<P>
While the new regulations will not go into effect until January
1, 1996, abortion advocacy groups as well as several medical societies
-- including ACOG -- have lobbied the ACGME for over a year to
adopt such a policy change.[10]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>OR REMOVING CHOICE FROM OB/GYN PHYSICIANS?</H3></CENTER>
<P>
ACGME's new abortion mandate has received considerable opposition
-- from pro-life groups to many within the medical establishment.
 &quot;Pro-choice&quot; physician James Schreiber, M.D., chief
of obstetrics and gynecology at Washington University Medical
Center in St. Louis, denounced the new policy as coercive and
&quot;anti-choice,&quot; saying that institutions with moral objections
were &quot;being forced into an untenable position.&quot;[11]
<P>
Richard T. F. Schmidt, M.D., a former ACOG president (1977-1978)
and residency review committee member, also questions the rationale
behind the abortion training mandate.  In a letter to ACGME's
ob/gyn residency review committee, Dr. Schmidt wrote, &quot;Is
there a demonstrated lack of knowledge or technical competence
among program graduates?  Or is the purpose to make more residents
comfortable with the <I>idea</I> of elective abortion and its
performance?&quot;  Commenting on the diminishing number of programs
offering elective abortion training, Dr. Schmidt said that given
a choice, faculty and residents &quot;voted very clearly with
their feet.&quot;[12]
<P>
The Christian Medical and Dental Society (CMDS), the American
Association of Pro-Life Obstetricians and Gynecologists, the National
Conference of Catholic Bishops, and other pro-life and pro-family
groups have also registered their strong opposition to the new
mandate.  These groups argue that requiring residents to undergo
abortion training will have the effect of dissuading many pro-life
medical students from choosing to specialize in ob/gyn.  These
groups also believe that residents will receive intense pressure
from within the medical school to undergo abortion training due
to the accreditation requirement.[13]
<P>
The fears these groups express may well be justified.  An editorial
published in the <I>New England Journal of Medicine</I> indicates
that ob/gyn residents will receive considerable pressure to undergo
elective abortion training.  The author of the editorial, an advocate
of the new ACGME requirements, writes that &quot;[r]esidents who
wish to opt out of abortion training should be required to explain
why in a way that satisfies <I>stringent</I> and <I>explicit</I>
criteria&quot; (emphasis added).[14]  Furthermore, two years ago the
University of North Carolina School of Medicine in Chapel Hill
found that greater numbers of residents were refusing to perform
abortions even though the school provided training.  As a result,
the school sent a letter to all prospective residents in the summer
of 1993 saying that it would accept only candidates who agreed
to perform abortions.  The policy was rescinded after threats
of a class-action lawsuit.[15]
<P>
The North Carolina scenario demonstrates that ACGME's new policies
were not passed in response to ob/gyn residents who wanted to
receive abortion training but were unable to receive it.  Such
a conclusion is also supported by a recently released survey by
the American Association of Obstetricians and Gynecologists, a
recognized special interest group within the American College
of Obstetricians and Gynecologists (ACOG).  With almost 25 percent
of the 36,000 ACOG members responding, the survey found that 59
percent of respondents felt that abortion training should <U>not</U>
be required in residency programs.[16]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>IMPACTS OF THE ABORTION TRAINING MANDATE</H3></CENTER>
<P>
ACGME's new requirements seem to be implicitly directed at teaching
residents to perform second- and third-trimester abortions.  As
Congressman and family physician/obstetrician Tom Coburn (R-OK)
has testified, medical residents already receive training in handling
spontaneous abortions (miscarriages) through dilation and curettage
(D &amp; C), which is the usual technique used for first-trimester
abortions.  Only later-term abortions require additional training
in special techniques to &quot;terminate the pregnancy.&quot;[17]
<P>
The new policy would also require teaching hospitals to provide
or obtain additional facilities, equipment, and faculty (or contract
with other institutions to do so).  Furthermore, hospitals which
have not historically referred patients for abortions because
of moral reasons and which refuse to provide abortion training
on-site would nonetheless be forced to violate their fundamental
beliefs and directly collaborate with abortion providers.  The
mandate also violates laws in roughly half the states that exempt
hospitals from referring for abortion, contraception, or sterilization
when the hospital is conscientiously opposed.
<P>
Because the abortion training mandate does conflict with several
states' laws, it can also be reasonably expected that Planned
Parenthood and other abortion providers will file lawsuits to
change the laws which (1) exempt hospitals from referring for
abortion, and (2) explicitly ban the use of taxpayer monies to
fund abortions in publicly-funded hospitals.

<P>
The forced feminization of the Navy is undermining combat readiness
and Congress must exercise its Constitutional responsibility to
examine these politically motivated changes before more damage
is done.
<P>
Defense Secretary William Perry promised, &quot;Our over-arching
goal is to maintain a high-quality, ready and effective force.
 By increasing the numbers of units and positions to which women
can be assigned, the military services gain greater flexibility
in the development and use of human resources.&quot;[1] 
<P>
Unfortunately, Mr. Perry has set a course to feminize the Navy
without regard for military necessity.  Today, 94 percent of Navy
billets, including previously exempt combat positions, are open
to women.  Secretary Perry promotes these changes as &quot;equal
opportunity.&quot;[2]
<P>
Consider factors that seriously impair Navy readiness.
<P><UL>
<LI>A Navy study found that women are NOT physically equipped to
perform most at-sea emergency tasks.
<P>
<LI>A 1995 Navy policy embraces pregnancy as an acceptable readiness
problem in spite of the fact that almost half of pregnant sailors
never return to their crews after delivery.
<P>
<LI>Fraternization is a growing problem among crew members aboard
mixed-gender ships and this contributes to serious morale and
cohesion problems at sea.  It also has a negative effect on the
well-being of military spouses back home.
<P>
<LI>The Navy has ignored longstanding screening standards in order
to accelerate less qualified women into positions, thus bypassing
more experienced men.
<P>
<LI>Sexual harassment charges are a favorite tool of some women
who manipulate Navy leaders to promote personal agendas.
<P>
<LI>The Defense Department has promised to raise the percentage
of female servicemembers to perhaps 25 percent of the total force.[3]
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>STUDY SAYS WOMEN ARE DIFFERENT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Navy has ignored key findings which demonstrate that women
are less equipped physically to perform assignments aboard combat ships.
 The Navy Personnel Research and Development Center in San Diego,
California, conducted a comprehensive study of 350 men and 195
women to determine what effect training had on their physical
performances.  The study measured performance on five basic damage
control tasks: carrying litters on level surfaces and up and down
ladders, moving and starting emergency pumps, turning engine bolts,
and directing fire hose streams.  Virtually all male recruits
were able to perform all of the tasks before training, while women
could perform only one of the tasks to a satisfactory standard.[4]
<P>
Even after significant training, women showed no appreciable improvement.
 The study found that the differences between the sexes on measures
of lifting strength and aerobic capacity are dramatic.  
<P>
All naval crewmembers must be prepared to perform damage control
assignments.  Lack of physical strength among female sailors can
decrease survivability.  For example, had more women been aboard
the <I>USS Stark</I>, crippled by an Iraqi missile in the Persian
Gulf, the loss of life and property would very likely have been
greater.
<P>
Analogous organization experiences show similar trends.  Civilian
fire departments have reported disproportionate differences between
the sexes in injury rates when women are expected to perform like
men.  They suffer up to three times as many disabling back injuries
as men.[5] Women suffer more injuries because to lift the same load
as men, they must operate near their maximum lifting capacity,
e.g., a male medic carrying a litter uses on the average half
of his lifting power, but a woman uses on average her full lifting
capacity.
<P>
The 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in
the Armed Forces found that women's aerobic capacity is significantly
lower, meaning they cannot carry as much as far as fast as men.
 Despite the existence of an exceedingly small number of Amazonian
women who resemble men in muscular mass, on average, women are
shorter, have less muscle mass and weigh less than men.  This
puts them at a distinct disadvantage when performing tasks requiring
a high level of muscular strength and aerobic capacity.[6]
<P>
The Commission also found that women are at a higher risk for
exercise-induced injuries than men, with 2.13 times greater risk
for lower extremity injuries, and 4.71 times greater risk for
stress fractures.[7]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>PREGNANCY POLICY HURTS READINESS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Navy's 1995 pregnancy policy ignores readiness while favoring
protection of individuals' rights.  As the number of women in
the Navy increases, pregnancy becomes a serious readiness issue.
<P>
At any given time, up to 18 percent of Navy women are pregnant
and a study of two ships showed a pregnancy rate as high as one
in three.[8] That's nearly 8,423 women or enough to crew almost
two aircraft carriers.  During Desert Storm 1,145 women on ships
needed to be reassigned because of pregnancies, at an average
of 95 per month.[9]
<P>
According to the policy, a woman may serve aboard ship until she
is 20 weeks pregnant.  While aboard ship, she must never be more
than six hours from emergency OB/GYN care.  Perhaps this provision
exists because at least five babies have been born on Navy ships,
one of which died shortly after birth.  Obviously, this policy
limits the pregnant sailor's deployability and her job performance
is frequently limited.
<P>
On average, each pregnancy taken to term removes a female sailor
from her ship for at least six months.  Once the child is born,
the sailor receives six weeks of convalescent leave and is not
required to re-deploy for four months.  That period can be extended
by the attending physician.  Many women never return to their
ship after giving birth.  According to Navy records, 35 percent
leave the Navy and eight percent remain on shore.    
<P>
Those who do return are unable to devote full time to their infant,
often creating an unhealthy reliance on child care at an extremely
impressionable age for the child.  Extended care for children
during frequent deployments denies the child the nurturing that
is key to a balanced emotional composition.   
<P>
According to Jay Belsky writing in the <I>Journal of Marriage
and the Family</I>, children left in child care while mothers
work &quot;scored more poorly on a composite measure of adjustment
than did children whose mothers were not employed during their
first three years....[and they] were significantly more noncompliant
than agemates without such early experience.&quot;[10]  These problems
are made worse as the mother-child separations are longer and
more frequent.
<P>
According to the Defense Manpower Data Center, two thirds of all
uniformed female mothers of one child have never married.  There
are never-married servicemembers with as many as nine dependents.
 Today, there are 84,831 never-married female active duty members
from all services with at least one child.[11]
<P>
Unmarried female servicemembers with at-home dependents are eligible
for benefits identical to married members.  For example, they
receive larger government quarters (more children means more bedrooms),
larger allowances driven by family size (such as cost of living
allowances), government-subsidized child care and medical care.
 During each pregnancy the servicemember is provided all pay and
allowances, time off and free medical benefits.
<P>
If a pregnant sailor wants an abortion she must be transported
off the ship to a location near an abortion clinic.  Before this
happens Navy personnel must counsel her about her options.  If
she chooses abortion, she is given, at government expense, a complete
blood count (CBC) to determine whether to administer Rhogam to
prevent an immune reaction.  After the abortion, the Navy provides
medical attention for problems arising from the procedure, like
clinical depression or an incomplete abortion.  The costs for
this treatment are borne by the Navy.
<P>
Navy policy prohibits supervisors from taking action against a
woman who becomes pregnant during a deployment, and there is no
requirement for women to use birth control during deployments.
 One command did, however, send a message to all ship captains
directing them to counsel their female sailors about the advantages
of NORPLANT, the under-the-skin birth control device.[12] 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>SEX TAKES PLACE AFLOAT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Two sailors aboard the <I>USS Eisenhower</I> were recently punished
for having sex, videotaping the event and then showing it to fellow
sailors.  The sailors were charged with adultery, since each of
them was married to someone else.  The incident shows that mixing
men and women in close quarters for extended periods can lead
to misconduct, and it has serious implications for morale.
<P>
The number of pregnancies aboard the USS Eisenhower, the first
combat vessel with female crewmembers, grew from five to 39 in
a couple months.  In all, 13 percent of the female crew became
pregnant.  By comparison, less than four percent of the male crewmembers
left the <I>Eisenhower</I> for medical reasons since April 1994.[13]
<P>
An active duty Naval officer with recent at-sea experience supervising
female sailors claims that every ship has &quot;large numbers
of pregnancies.&quot;  This officer alleges that advancement in
the Navy depends on supporting the &quot;vital program of women
at sea&quot; and he is &quot;not sure the Navy [has] thought through
the pregnancy issue.&quot;[14]
<P>
A seasoned chief petty officer who recently supervised women aboard
ship alleges that many women &quot;get pregnant to avoid deployment.&quot;
 He believes that many &quot;Generation X&quot; women are in the
Navy for financial gain, the education and to find a husband.
 Sex aboard ship is common.  As a supervisor who wouldn't tolerate
sexual liaisons among crewmembers,  he claims that his disapproving
female subordinates were very uncooperative with him due to his
lack of tolerance of their fraternization.
<P>
The chief alleges that many of his female subordinates were untrained
prior to a recent deployment because they had only been recently
reassigned to the crew.  They were replacing other females who
&quot;got pregnant at the last minute.&quot;  It is difficult
to replace women with men, because ships are now configured to
accommodate a specified number of billets for each sex. 
<P>
Apart from the immediate shipboard impact, the policy hurts family
members who stay ashore and worry about the sexual climate to
which their spouses are being subjected.  An officer's wife recently
wrote about sexual tensions in Haiti.  Two men shared a tent with
a female officer who &quot;made it known that she was open to
intimate relationships.&quot;  The male officer indicated the
situation made him &quot;uncomfortable and awkward&quot; and it
&quot;was to him professionally and personally&quot; distressing.
 He had recently married and his wife was pregnant with their
first child.[15] Military wives often worry about the prospects that
their husbands might be sexually preyed upon by women willing
to use sex for personal gain.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>AFFIRMATIVE ACTION COMES ABOARD</H3></CENTER>
<P>
There is growing anecdotal evidence that shows that female sailors
get special treatment.  Consider several incidents.
<P>
A female sailor aboard the <I>USS Eisenhower</I> was disciplined
for &quot;falling in love.&quot;  Her punishment was three days
on bread and water in a Navy brig.  Since the carrier has no female
jail, she was sent ashore to Rota, Spain via an Italian island,
Italy, Germany and finally Spain.  En route to Rota, she and her
two escorts shopped and dined their way for five days, all at
government expense.  She told the <I>Norfolk Virginian-Pilot and
Ledger-Star</I>, &quot;I was free to go.  We went out to eat,
to the shopping malls in Italy and we stayed in hotels.  It had
to be a huge expense.&quot;[16] Some &quot;punishment.&quot;
<P>
The 19-year-old claims she was the only female crewmember disciplined
for breaking the captain's no-dating policy and alleges other
women were found &quot;with their boyfriends kissing in closets
and other hideaways aboard ship.&quot;[17]
<P>
Tragedies which involve Navy women have also been handled in an
unusual fashion.  The fatal crash of an F-14A Tomcat fighter on
October 25, 1994 is revealing.  In an unprecedented move, the
Navy released Lieutenant Kara S. Hultgreen's training records
to the media and her mother, Sally Spears.  It also went to great
lengths to recover the aircraft from the ocean floor.  Finally,
it released a video showing Hultgreen's last carrier approach.
<P>
Although initial reports blamed a failed engine for the crash,
on March 14, 1995, the Mishap Investigation Report (MIR) contained
&quot;...repeated instances of pilot error.  It notes the role
of engine trouble but concludes that Hultgreen's flight-control
mistakes were the most critical factors [in the accident].&quot;[18]
 The MIR, written to exacting standards, is classified as &quot;privileged&quot;
and is used for improving the safety of future flights.
<P>
On March 7, 1995 a female Navy pilot called a live national radio
show from the deck of the <I>USS Abraham Lincoln</I>, the same
carrier to which Hultgreen was assigned.  This F-18 pilot called
to promote women in combat aircraft.  She explained that the &quot;women
in the military&quot; debate is about &quot;equal opportunity&quot;
and as far as she is concerned there is &quot;no problem.&quot;[19]
<P>
In August 1994, a male Navy pilot told his boss that he objected
to women serving in combat, but would follow orders.  He now faces
dismissal for failing to &quot;demonstrate leadership&quot; despite
having received outstanding efficiency reports.[20]
<P>
Another male officer alleges that women are receiving preferential
treatment for command and promotions.  One female officer was
selected to become a ship's executive officer after only three
years of sea duty.  The more seasoned male officer explained that
the standard has long been no less than six to eight years of
sea duty before eligibility for this coveted assignment.  He also
cited the example of a female commander who was excused for hitting
a sea buoy, an act which is normally a career killer.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CHARGES OF SEXUAL HARASSMENT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The 1991 Tailhook convention branded the Navy as a haven of sexual
harassers.  Even though much of the evidence is contradictory,
the Navy has suffered serious public relations damage.
<P>
In the wake of Tailhook, several key senior Navy leaders have
taken direct hits from women alleging sexual harassment.  Admiral
Stanley Arthur decided to drop a female lieutenant with poor flying
skills from helicopter aviation training.  The lieutenant claimed
that she had been eliminated from flight school because of &quot;retaliation&quot;
for filing a successful sexual harassment complaint.  The man
involved in the harassment charge was punished for making inappropriate
comments and has since left the Navy.
<P>
Adm. Arthur reviewed the lieutenant's record and found evidence
of poor aptitude and performance both before and after the harassment
incident.  He wrote: &quot;From this review I do not have sufficient
confidence that [the lieutenant] could safely and successfully
operate an aircraft in a dangerous and unforgiving operational
environment....I do not desire to see her or perhaps others die
because she could not perform at a level consistent with our standards.&quot;[21]
<P>
The admiral had been nominated to become Commander in Chief of
Naval Forces in the Pacific (CINCPAC).  After his decision, his
confirmation was procedurally shelved possibly because of threats
from congresswomen like Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-CO) who fought
the retirement status of outgoing Chief of Naval Operations Frank
B. Kelso II, who oversaw the Tailhook investigation.  The Navy
withdrew the Arthur nomination.
<P>
Tragically, Coast Guard Captain Ernest J. Blanchard IV took his
own life after learning of an investigation into remarks he allegedly
made at a dinner at the Coast Guard Academy on January 10, 1995.
 An officer who attended the dinner said, &quot;I heard the remark
that some of the things the speaker said would have been OK maybe
20 years ago....I guess they were jokes, off-color remarks, not
politically correct.  Some women in the humanities department
apparently complained about the comments.&quot;[22]
<P>
Blanchard, considered a rising star in the Coast Guard, wrote
a formal letter of apology to the &quot;offended&quot; woman,
but it was not accepted.  The female officer pressed her allegations.
 Blanchard offered to retire but permission was denied.  Friends
believe that he felt that his character was being assailed and
that he was being treated as an example by the Coast Guard.
<P>
In other instances, remarks by junior officers have met with charges
of sexual harassment.  For example, when a petty officer reported
that two of his subordinates were having a lesbian relationship,
the women responded by alleging sexual harassment.  The senior
chief was removed from the ship.
<P>
Another officer was removed for being a &quot;gender offender.&quot;
 The first words out of his boss's mouth were: &quot;You're guilty
of sexual harassment,&quot; a clear violation of the long tradition
of being held innocent until proven guilty.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Clinton Administration's decision to scuttle exemptions for
women and to embrace the feminization of the Navy has seriously
damaged readiness.  The 104th Congress should reverse the current
trend before irreparable harm is done to the U.S. Navy and the
defense posture of the nation.

<I>Jennifer E. Marshall</I></CENTER>
<P>
John Cardinal O'Connor of New York has defined two conditions
-- and two conditions only -- that justify opposing the anti-illegitimacy
measures recently adopted by the House.  His opposition hinges,
first, on the &quot;virtual inevitability&quot; that a freeze
on benefits &quot;amounts to a programmed 'short-term' increase
in abortions&quot; and, second, on the lack of &quot;any hard
evidence&quot; to support the contention that reducing illegitimacy
will reduce abortions.[1]
<P>
The Cardinal's principled objections deserve an answer, and all
people of faith should be relieved by the fact that we do have
hard evidence to allay both of his concerns.  Given the weight
of evidence suggesting that abortions will not increase in the
short term and will in fact decrease in the long term, those who
defend the status quo on moral or empirical grounds must now bear
the burden of proof.  And those who have been both puzzled and
troubled by the rift in the pro-life ranks over this issue must
understand that the division springs not from a different understanding
of our moral responsibilities, but from a different degree of
reliance on the actual empirical record.
<P>
While it is far too premature to draw any decisive conclusions
from the welfare experiment in New Jersey, there is absolutely
no statistical indication as of yet that an increase in abortions
has occurred since the state's family cap took effect August 1,
1993.  In fact, the total number of Medicaid-funded abortions
in New Jersey declined from 13,629 in 1993 to 13,424 in 1994.[2]
<P>
Because Medicaid data is collected by date of payment, rather
than procurement, the raw numbers do contain some distortion.
 Yet any Medicaid-funded abortion occurring within approximately
the first year after implementation of the cap is included in
the current data set.  While the 1994 numbers are still subject
to some adjustment to reflect the most recent abortions for which
no claim has yet been filed, the existing margin between the totals
for 1993 and 1994 can accommodate the anticipated inflation without
threatening the indication that abortions have not surged upward
as feared.
<P>
Likewise, the number of privately funded abortions performed on
welfare mothers
 is expected to be too negligible to affect the finding that abortions
have not significantly increased (especially since the average
cost of an abortion in New Jersey in 1993 was equal to eight times
the $64 amount by which the new policy reduces the benefits package
each month).  Although no hard data is available to address the
question, Susan Tew of the Alan Guttmacher Institute commented
that &quot;it logically does not make sense to suggest that women
who are in severe financial straits and are eligible for a publicly
funded abortion would forgo those Medicaid dollars in lieu of
scarce private resources.&quot;  No data is available, she noted,
precisely because the possibility that welfare women forgo available
public funding for the abortions they choose to have is too remote
to merit the expenditure of research dollars.[3] 
<P>
The only other significant objection to the use of Medicaid data
-- the only data we have at present -- is that the population
includes approximately 57,000 women (ages 16-45) who are eligible
for Medicaid, but are not subject to the Family Development Program
(FDP) in New Jersey that included the family cap.  The presence
of such a sizeable group of women who are not subject to the new
welfare policy could conceivably mask an increase in abortions;
but the fact that the non-FDP population remained virtually unchanged
between 1993 and 1994 suggests that there is no hidden increase
lurking in the short-run data.
<P>
Anita Leone, executive director of an association that represents
all the publicly-funded abortion clinics in New Jersey, confirmed
in a recent interview: &quot;We know that abortions in New Jersey
are currently decreasing.  We just don't know why.&quot;  Since
the decline in the birth rate among welfare mothers in New Jersey
has been rather substantial since implementation of the family
cap (estimates range at least as high as 11.4 percent[4]), the fact
that an increase in abortions is not yet indicated is significant.
<P>
The anecdotal evidence collected by those who are on the frontlines
of welfare reform in New Jersey confirms the general pattern that
is beginning to emerge from the data.  Richard Traynor of the
Legal Center for Defense of Life in New Jersey and David Sciarra
of New Jersey Legal Services, who together filed a class-action
suit over the New Jersey family cap, both commented in telephone
interviews that the class was certified to include welfare mothers
who had aborted their babies -- but that neither one could locate
a woman who had actually aborted in the wake of the cap.
<P>
Instead, the only plaintiffs who mention abortion in their affidavits
explain that they consciously decided on moral grounds not to
terminate their pregnancies, despite increased economic pressures.
 One woman testified that she made an appointment at an abortion
clinic but ultimately &quot;became very upset about having an
abortion and decided that [she] could not go through with it.&quot;
 Another woman who already had two children and was carrying triplets
-- three times the pressure -- never even considered abortion.[5]
<P>
The decision to abort, the evidence suggests, is uniquely invulnerable
to rational economic incentives.  And welfare mothers are apparently
more inclined to consider &quot;non-rational&quot; factors than
any other population group.  Public opinion data collected by
the Family Research Council suggest that abortion is even more
morally repugnant to poor women;[6] and the fact that abortion rates
for teen welfare mothers are <I>lower</I> than national averages
for all teenage girls is a powerful indication that non-economic
factors determine the decision to carry a child to term.[7]
<P>
Many who now argue otherwise are precisely the ones who maintain
that the current benefits level is already far too low to cover
the costs associated with a new baby.  If so, it is illogical
to predict that a cap would have a sufficiently significant impact
on the &quot;affordability&quot; of another child to trigger such
a drastic measure as abortion.
<P>
State-by-state data from the 1980s demonstrates that small changes
in welfare payouts do not affect abortion rates in the short term;[8]
and Michael Schwartz of Life Advocacy Alliance has found in analyzing
more recent data that states with the highest average monthly
benefit for a family of three also tend to have the highest ratio
of abortions to live births.[9]
<P>
Not surprisingly, then, the only &quot;evidence&quot; the plaintiffs
could offer in the New Jersey suit was 55 letters from pro-life
activists expressing concern that freezing benefits might increase
abortions.  As of yet, there is nothing more concrete than their
concern itself to corroborate their claims; and pro-lifers who
are unconvinced by the hearsay -- including John Tomicki, past
president of New Jersey Right to Life -- have concluded that welfare
reform itself is a pro-life cause.
<P>
Contrary to Cardinal O'Connor's assertion, we do have compelling
statistical evidence to suggest that reducing illegitimacy will
reduce abortions.  Robert Rector of the Heritage Foundation has
found an astronomically high correlation between abortion and
illegitimacy in a state-by-state analysis.  His study shows that
an increase of 100 in the number of illegitimate births per 10,000
women, in fact, results in an increase of 200 in the number of
abortions per 10,000 women.[10]
<P>
The vast majority of abortions are performed on unmarried women
-- and the proportion is growing.  To reduce abortions, we must
reduce the premarital sex and out-of-wedlock pregnancy that create
a perceived &quot;need&quot; for abortion.  Marriage affords the
best protection -- indeed, the only real hope -- for the children
of the poor.
<P>
In deference to that fact, John Paul II wrote in his most recent
encyclical <I>Evangelium Vitae</I> that &quot;[a] general <I>and
no less serious </I>responsibility [for abortion] lies with those
who have encouraged the spread of an attitude of sexual permissiveness
and a lack of esteem for motherhood, and with those who should
have ensured -- but did not -- effective family and social policies
in support of families.&quot;[11]
<P>
The Pope's teaching leaves ample room for inferring that a program
that undermines families and promotes sexual immorality as effectively
as our current welfare system does is equally responsible for
abortion as permissive abortion laws.  Those who countenance the
status quo in welfare countenance a system rife with abortion.
 And those who fight for welfare reform wage a war against abortion
that is no less morally valid than peaceful sit-ins, prayer vigils,
and reform of law.

<P>
Evelyn Hooker has been among the most influential figures in the
highly successful movement to convince the American people that
homosexuality is a &quot;normal variant&quot; of human sexual
behavior.  Her 1957 study, &quot;The Adjustment of the Male Overt
Homosexual&quot; (<I>Journal of Projective Techniques,</I> 1957,
21, 18-31) is the most frequently cited scientific source for
the argument that homosexuality is not a pathology, that homosexuals
are as free from mental disorder as heterosexuals.  
<P>
Such assertions have not only found their way into standard psychology
textbooks but have also provided a scientific basis for decisions
in major court cases involving the legality of state sodomy laws
and prohibitions against homosexual employment in certain state
and local agencies (e.g., schools, police departments).  Indeed,
when the American Psychiatric Association debated the issue of
homosexuality in 1973, Evelyn Hooker's work was Exhibit A for
those who wanted to remove homosexuality from the group's list
of mental disorders. 
<P>
For many commentators and activists, the Hooker study effectively
ended the debate over whether or not homosexuals were in any way
abnormal in their relationships with each other and with the community
at large.  Today many Americans have accepted the idea that homosexuality
is &quot;normal&quot; and &quot;healthy&quot; without realizing
that such an opinion is derived in large measure from a single
study -- one conducted by a UCLA professor whose previous laboratory
subjects had been rats.  
<P>
In all this extravagant homage to Hooker and her study, several
points have escaped her admirers, to say nothing of the federal
courts: 
<P>
1. In her 1957 report, Evelyn Hooker did not use a random sample
to test the stability of homosexuals, but allowed gay rights activists
to recruit those homosexuals most likely to illustrate her thesis
that homosexuality is not a pathology.  Individuals who proved
unstable were deleted from the final sample.
<P>
2. Hooker's published account of how she recruited heterosexual
subjects is not consistent with a more detailed later account.
<P>
3. Six subjects in her study, three from each group, had engaged
in both homosexual and heterosexual behavior beyond adolescence.
<P>
4. Hooker made several errors in her mathematical calculations
that raise doubts about her care and competence as a researcher.
<P>
5. Hooker did not attempt to prove that homosexuals were normal
in every way, nor does her study support the idea that homosexuals
as a group are just as stable as heterosexuals.
<P>
6. Hooker was relatively inexperienced in administering the Rorschach
test, and this inexperience may have led to mistakes in the administration
and evaluation of the Rorschach.
<P>
7. On the Thematic Apperception Test and the Make-A-Picture-Story
test -- which require subjects to make up fictional narratives
about depicted scenes -- the homosexuals could not refrain from
including homosexual fantasies in their imaginary accounts.  For
that reason, Hooker altered the nature of the study by no longer
asking the judges to use the TAT and MAPS in an attempt to determine
the sexual orientation of each of the 60 subjects, since the differences
were apparent from the narratives.
<P>
In order to understand fully the nature of the controversy over
Hooker's study, it is helpful to review its history.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>THE HISTORY OF THE HOOKER STUDY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Evelyn Hooker did not begin her research on homosexuals as a logical
development in her career as a psychologist or even out of a dispassionate
scientific curiosity. From all indications, she undertook the
study to prove that homosexuals could function as normal human
beings.  As she herself said, &quot;How could my hypothesis have
been anything else?  I'd seen these men and saw nothing psychopathological
in their behavior.&quot;[1]
<P>
&quot;These men&quot; were the many friends she'd made in the
Los Angeles homosexual community -- one of whom, Sam From, persuaded
her to undertake the investigation.  &quot;Now we have let you
see us as we are,&quot; he said to the UCLA professor.  &quot;It
is your scientific duty to do a study of people like us.&quot;[2]
 Despite the fact that she was a &quot;rat runner&quot; -- with
no clinical experience in the area of human behavior, she undertook
her study, which would become, along with the Kinsey report, a
prime weapon in the hands of the gay rights movement.
<P>
It is important to examine carefully the manner in which Hooker
planned and executed her research, which was funded by the federal
government's National Institute of Mental Health.  A number of
commentators have failed to read Hooker's own report carefully
or else have deliberately distorted her methods and findings for
their own purposes.  Here is just how she proceeded and what she
found.         
<P>
<CENTER><H3>SELECTION OF SUBJECTS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
First, to find her homosexual subjects, she enlisted the early
gay rights group Mattachine Society, which, as she put it in her
published report, &quot;has as its stated purpose the development
of a homosexual ethic....&quot;[3] Members of the Mattachine Society
volunteered for the study and also recruited their friends.  Hooker,
herself, created a &quot;control group&quot; of heterosexuals
for the experiment, despite the fact that on the standardized
tests she intended to use, norms had already been established.
<P>
In her 1957 report, Hooker offers this somewhat cryptic explanation
of heterosexual recruitment:
<P>
Because the heterosexuals were, for the most part, obtained from
community organizations which must remain anonymous, I cannot
describe further the way in which they were obtained.[4]
<P>
Years later, a <I>Los Angeles Times</I> reporter elicited from
Hooker a somewhat different explanation, one that is fairly explicit
in detail:
<P>
She canvassed the education secretaries of labor unions, thinking
that they would have liberal attitudes.  &quot;I was wrong,&quot;
she says; as soon as she explained the nature of the study, no
one wanted to participate...So Hooker took to collaring candidates
wherever she could find them, including a fireman who showed up
to inspect her home.  &quot;No man is safe on Saltair Street,&quot;
joked her husband.[5] 
<P>
She did not insist on a random sampling.  In fact, she deliberately
sought out only those subjects who seemed stable and &quot;normal&quot;
-- at least in their ability to adjust to their social environment.
 She defined the criteria for membership in the groups as follows:
<P>
In both groups subjects were eliminated who were in therapy at
the time.  If, in the preliminary screening, evidence of considerable
disturbance appeared, the individual was eliminated (5 heterosexuals;
5 homosexuals).[6]
<P>
As for the sexual proclivities of the participants, Hooker says
the following in her report:
<P>
I attempted to secure homosexuals who would be pure for homosexuality;
that is, without heterosexual experience.  With three exceptions
this is so.  These three subjects had not had more than three
heterosexual experiences, and they identified themselves as homosexual
in their patterns of desire and behavior.  The heterosexual group
is exclusively heterosexual beyond the adolescent period, with
three exceptions; these three had had a single homosexual experience
each.[7]
<P>
Originally, she chose 40 homosexual subjects and matched them
as closely as possible by age, IQ, and education with 40 heterosexual
subjects.  At some point, as noted parenthetically above, she
found five from each group too unbalanced to include in her study,
so apparently she dropped these ten and their matches in the opposite
groups -- for a total of 20 eliminated.  This winnowing process
reduced the size of the total pool from 80 to 60.
<P>
It is instructive to read her summary of these matchings and then
compare that summary to the chart containing the same information.
<P>
The homosexuals, and thus the heterosexuals, ranged in age from
25 to 50, with an average age of 34.5 for the homosexual group
and 36.6 for the heterosexual group.  The IQ range, as measured
by the Otis Self-Administering Tests of Mental Ability, was from
90 to 135, with an average for the homosexual group of 115.4 and
for the heterosexual group of 116.2.  In education the range was
from completion of grammar school to the equivalent of a master's
degree, with an average for the homosexual group of 13.9 years
and for the heterosexual group of 14.3.[8]
<P>
Turning to the table upon which she lists the age, IQ scores,
and education of all 60 subjects, a careful reader finds that
the figures neatly arranged in columns <I>contradict her summary</I>.
 While she says the age range for all subjects is 25-50, the chart
indicates that the youngest subject is 26 and the oldest 57. 
The figures on the table indicate an average age of 35 for the
homosexuals and 37 for the heterosexuals -- different averages
than the ones Hooker gives.
<P>
In her summary, she says the range of IQ scores is 90-135, but
the lowest IQ score on her chart is 91.  Despite this error, however,
her averages for both homosexuals and heterosexuals are consistent
with the chart.
<P>
On average years of education, she gives as a range the completion
of grammar school to the equivalent of a masters degree.  Here
her summary is at best imprecise, since the least amount of education
is 9 years -- past the junior high level and three years beyond
elementary school.  The highest educational level indicated on
the chart is 18 years, which is a year beyond the course requirement
for most master's programs.  Also, her average education for homosexuals,
based on the chart, should be 14.0 rather than 13.9.
<P>
These mathematical discrepancies are minor but disturbing.  If
all the averages had been incorrect, a generous reader might have
concluded that somehow she had printed the wrong chart -- a single
careless error.  But given the accuracy of <I>some</I> of her
calculations, it seems more likely she made several careless errors.
 A footnote on the first page of the Hooker report suggests that
the materials were rushed into print -- that, though she hesitated
to publish her paper, &quot;[i]n view of the importance of her
findings it seemed desirable to the editors that they be made
public....&quot;[9]  (In other words, she was saying something that
well-placed members of the profession wanted to hear.)      
<P>
To be sure, these figures are largely irrelevant to the final
conclusions of her study.  The averages of ages, IQ scores, and
amount of education lend only marginal credibility to the selection
process.  Yet the inaccuracies tell us something important about
Hooker's reliability as a researcher, the degree to which we can
trust her methodology.  As noted below, Hooker scored the Rorschach
test herself, despite the fact that she had had little previous
experience in this area.  Add to this inexperience a lack of mathematical
precision, and the study begins to pose genuine problems. 
<P>
At this point, two observations are in order concerning Hooker's
overall method of selecting her subjects.  First, in choosing
a small sample that is anything but random, Hooker has declined
to test the proposition that homosexuals and heterosexuals in
society are equally likely to be normal, well-adjusted human beings.
 As she, herself, says in the report, she is only interested in
&quot;whether homosexuality is <I>necessarily</I> [emphasis added]
a symptom of pathology.&quot;  To answer that question, she maintains,
&quot;All we need is a single case in which the answer is negative.&quot;[10]
 In other words, in this study she is concerned with finding at
least one homosexual who, after testing, doesn't fall into the
category of &quot;pathological.&quot;  This is why she has focused
on the healthiest possible cohort.    
<P>
But the limited scope of her study cuts two ways.  Knowing the
nature of the sample, no one could reasonably conclude from her
findings that homosexuals as a group are no more likely to be
mentally disturbed than heterosexuals.  Yet this is precisely
what many have concluded.  If one accepts the study as valid and
definitive, one can only conclude that some homosexuals are not
pathological <I>in their dealings with the world at large.</I>
  As Hooker herself observes, there is no evidence to conclude
that homosexuals are not pathological in their sexual activities.
<P>
A second point to note about Hooker's selection process is her
ease in recruiting homosexual subjects and her difficulty in recruiting
heterosexual subjects.  Indeed, her account in the study report
is evasive; and her later recollections suggest that she may have
shaded the truth initially in order to cover up problems she encountered
in recruiting the control group.         
<P>
This question becomes more pressing when one reads that in her
group of 30 heterosexual men, she still must include three who
have had homosexual experiences <I>in their adult lives</I> --
by no means a &quot;pure&quot; sample -- and we don't know how
many more had had homosexual experiences in adolescence.  No one
-- not even Kinsey -- would call this an unambiguously heterosexual
group.
<P>
From Hooker's own report -- and from a follow-up interview in
later years -- we see that homosexuals were not only eager to
participate, but indeed were the instigators of the study.  They
hoped that it would prove they were &quot;normal&quot; human beings;
so they scoured their own community to find just the right volunteers
to prove her limited hypothesis.  When analyzing the results of
the Hooker study, it's very important to remember who instigated
the project and the fact that the subjects were well aware of
its ultimate goal.  (In light of this fact, the performance of
homosexuals on two of the three tests, as discussed below, may
well indicate that homosexuality generates social behavior that
is obsessive, indeed all but uncontrollable -- certainly one indication
of pathology.) 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>THE TESTING OF THE SUBJECTS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
To prove her thesis, Hooker administered three standardized tests
to her 60 subjects -- the Rorschach Test, the Thematic Apperception
Test (TAT), and the Make-A-Picture-Story test (MAPS).  The Rorschach
test, as most people know, consists of a series of ink blots that
subjects are asked to interpret.  The Thematic Apperception Test
requires subjects to describe and make up stories about pictures
of people in various settings.  The MAPS test requires subjects
to arrange cut-out pictures and then make up a story about their
arrangement.   
<P>
Despite her lack of clinical experience in what is called &quot;projective
techniques,&quot; according to Hooker, she administered and scored
the Rorschach test herself.  After scoring the test and constructing
profiles, she placed the results in random order and passed them
along to two experts in Rorschach analysis.  Thus we have Hooker's
scored results analyzed by Drs. Klopfer and Meyer, with two tasks
in mind: first, to rate the subjects on &quot;overall adjustment&quot;
and second, to see if they could determine which were the homosexuals
and which were the heterosexuals.
<P>
On the task of determining overall adjustment (i.e., social stability),
the judges differed sharply in some respects but agreed in others.
 For example, Judge &quot;A&quot; rated 15 of the 60 as &quot;top&quot;
in stability, while Judge &quot;B&quot; rated only 4 as &quot;top.&quot;
 The other ratings revealed greater agreement. However, more homosexuals
than heterosexuals ranked in the two &quot;top&quot; groupings
and more heterosexuals than homosexuals ranked in the two &quot;bottom&quot;
groupings.
<P>
When assigned the task of choosing between the homosexual and
heterosexual subjects, Judge &quot;A&quot; correctly identified
17 of the 30 pairs and Judge &quot;B&quot; 18 of the 30.  An ideal
random selection would have identified 15 out of 30, though Hooker
is technically correct in saying that, in such a small sample,
the results indicate that &quot;neither judge was able to do better
than chance.&quot;[11]
<P>
Critics of Hooker's Rorschach results make at least two points.
 First, they question her ability to administer and score the
test.  As an animal researcher until the time she undertook this
project, she obviously had logged comparatively little experience
in administering Rorschachs, a delicate and highly complicated
task in which the clinician gently and obliquely elicits spontaneous
responses.  Some authorities in the field maintain that, under
ideal circumstances, a more qualified expert would have explored
many avenues Hooker failed to note and would have found out many
things Hooker missed -- including indications of the pathology
of the homosexuals.
<P>
A second criticism of her methodology is the lack of &quot;blindness&quot;
in the administration of the Rorschach.  Ideally, given the nature
of the results sought, the test should have been administered
under circumstances in which both interviewer and subject were
unaware of the purpose of the test.  In the case of the Hooker
study, both she and her subjects knew what she was striving to
prove -- and both she and the homosexuals had a vested interest
in proving the hypothesis that homosexuals were not necessarily
pathological.
<P>
Can Rorschach subjects tailor their answers to desired ends? 
Absolutely, say some Rorschach experts.  One example of such a
phenomenon in &quot;projective techniques&quot; is called the
&quot;Rosenthal Effect,&quot; in which a subject generates the
results he or she believes the researcher wants.  In this particular
case, both the researcher (Hooker) and her homosexual subjects
had a compelling reason to produce these results.
<P>
Perhaps the most significant implications of Hooker's study came
from the MAPS and TAT results, which were analyzed by a single
judge.  Here is Hooker's own account:
<P>
The problem of identifying the homosexual protocol from this
material was essentially a much easier one than that encountered
with the Rorschach, since few homosexuals failed to give open
[sic] homosexual stories on at least one picture.  The second
task given the Rorschach judges, of distinguishing the homosexual
from the heterosexual records when they were presented in matched
pairs, was therefore omitted.[12]
<P>
Note that the identity of the homosexuals was so obvious in these
tests that Hooker did not even ask the judge to distinguish between
homosexual and heterosexual.  Simply put, the homosexuals gave
themselves away on tests less dependent than the Rorschach on
the training and experience of the examiner.  Despite the fact
that they knew the purpose of this test was to prove their own
stability, normalcy, and lack of differentiation from heterosexuals,
they still did not refrain from indulging themselves in homosexual
fantasies, thereby exposing their sexual appetites.  It is difficult
not to conclude that in verbalizing such fantasies, they were
exhibiting the obsessive nature of homosexuality, the difficulty
of homosexuals to control their desire, even when their reputation
in the psychiatric community was at stake.
<P>
As one research analyst puts it:
<P>
So Hooker's study suggests that sexual fantasies among homosexuals
are irrepressible, so much so that such people cannot always see
ordinary situations and relations as devoid of sexual content,
but must, on occasion, interject sexual significance where it
does not exist or, at the very least, need not exist.  Following
the logical conclusions of this experiment, we are compelled to
conclude that there is something substantively different about
the way homosexuals and heterosexuals look at the world.[13]
<P>
In evaluating the MAPS and TAT results for stability, the single
judge assigned &quot;top&quot; scores to no one; 9 homosexuals
and 7 heterosexuals were rated &quot;next to top&quot;; 15 homosexuals
and 19 heterosexuals were ranked &quot;average&quot;; 6 homosexuals
and 3 heterosexuals were rated &quot;next to bottom&quot;; and
no homosexuals and 1 heterosexual were ranked at the &quot;bottom.&quot;
 (Again, critics say that the absence of &quot;blindness&quot;
raises the possibility that the Rosenthal Effect was again operative
in the evaluation process, since the judge knew what Hooker was
seeking.)
<P>
<CENTER><H3>SUMMARY OF RESULTS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The remainder of her study is a highly selective summary of comments
by judges, all of which support her thesis that the two groups
are, in effect, indistinguishable in terms of &quot;overall adjustment.&quot;
 In her own evaluation of the results, Hooker -- aware of the
degree to which she is challenging leading authorities in the
field -- offers a set of &quot;admissions&quot; about the limitations
of her study.  In this section she concedes the possibility that
homosexuals are indeed pathological, a point overlooked by most
of her admirers.
<P><UL>
<LI>She speculates that the psychological defect of homosexuals
may lie &quot;in a weakness of ego-function and control and that
this cannot be adequately diagnosed from projective test protocols.
 As one psychiatrist puts it, the material produced in the Rorschach
is like that produced on the analytic couch.  Two men may produce
very similar material on the couch, but the difference between
them is that one -- the normal -- gets up at the end of the hour
and resumes his normal functioning, while the other does not.&quot;[14]
<P>
<LI>She also admits that the pathology of homosexuality may only
occur &quot;in an erotic situation and that the homosexual can
function well in non-erotic situations such as the Rorschach,
TAT, and MAPS.  Thus, one could defend the hypothesis that homosexuality
is symptomatic of pathology, but that the pathology is confined
to one sector of behavior, namely, the sexual.&quot;[15] (She seems
to have disproved this proposition by her own study, since the
homosexuals were unable to control their sexual fantasies, even
in a &quot;non-erotic situation&quot; such as taking the MAPS
and TAT.)
<P>
<LI>During Hooker's research, she took the life histories of her
subjects; and though she didn't include an analysis of these materials
in her study, she did indicate that when she eventually published
her results, &quot;the life history data from the two groups will
differ:  namely, in the love relationships.  Comparisons between
the number and duration of love relationships, cruising patterns,
and degree of satisfaction with sexual pattern and the love partner
will certainly show clear-cut differences.&quot;[16]
</UL>
Hooker never published the summary of these histories, though
in a fairly recent interview with writer-researcher Edward Eichel,
she said she still hoped to do so after 35 years.  However, she
undoubtedly found in these personal histories what most other
researchers have found:  a substantially greater number of sexual
partners among homosexuals than heterosexuals and a significantly
shorter duration in relationships.  These findings, if published,
could well have cast further doubts on the stability and normalcy
of homosexuals.
<P>
It is significant to note that Hooker's stated reservations seldom,
if ever, find their way into the summaries of her work -- summaries
that are now <I>de rigeur</I> in legal and scholarly discussions
of homosexuality.  Her 1957 report has, like a folk tale, become
simpler and purer in the constant retelling.  Instead of a complicated
account filled with the predictable complexity of life, we now
have only Beauty and the Beast.     
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CITATIONS AND  USES OF THE HOOKER STUDY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Perhaps as important as the Hooker 1957 research itself is the
use that others have made of her findings.  Not only has this
single study with only 60 subjects been cited repeatedly by prominent
psychiatrists, social critics, and gay activists; but such summaries
have also been accepted as part of the expert testimony in high-profile
court cases nationwide.
<P>
Curiously, many of those who cite the study not only incorrectly
summarize its content but do so in remarkably similar fashion.
 It's as if one commentator misread Hooker and all the rest derived
their knowledge from that single erroneous commentary.  Here are
several examples:     
<P><UL>
<LI>In the <I>Comprehensive Textbook of Psychiatry</I>, Dr. Judd
Marmor, a driving force in the American Psychiatric Association's
decision to drop homosexuality from its manual of disorders, has
written this summary of Hooker's research: &quot;Hooker (1957)
conducted a cooperative study of 30 male homosexuals and 30 male
heterosexuals who were matched for age, I.Q., and education. 
The homosexuals were all rated 6 and the heterosexuals 0 on the
Kinsey scale.  None of the subjects was in therapy.  Two judges
independently, without prior knowledge of which subjects were
which, reviewed the Rorschach protocols, Thematic Apperception
Tests, and Make-a-Picture-Story responses, and tried to distinguish
the homosexuals from the heterosexuals, but they were unable to
do so.&quot;[17]
<P><UL>
<LI>Marmor repeated this very passage when he submitted an affidavit
in <I>Morales v. Texas</I>, a case heard before a state court
in Texas.
<P>
<LI>Dr. Gregory Herek supported Marmor's testimony in <I>Morales
v. Texas</I>, saying under oath: &quot;The classic study in this
case was conducted by Hooker (1957).  She administered the Rorschach,
Thematic Apperception Test, and Make-A-Picture-Story Test...When
asked to assess which protocols were obtained from homosexuals,
the experts were unable to distinguish respondents' sexual orientation
at a level better than chance.&quot;[18]
<P>
<LI>In a 1990 article on Hooker, <I>Los Angeles Times</I> reporter
Bruce Shenitz described the experiment in precisely the same way:
 &quot;On all three tests, two-thirds of the heterosexuals and
homosexuals were assigned a rating of 3 (average) or better. 
Next, the judges were presented with pairs of tests and asked
to distinguish between heterosexuals and homosexual.  They were
able to do so no more accurately than if they were flipping a
coin.&quot;[19]
</UL></UL>
This striking agreement among scientific experts and the working
press is remarkable, especially when one realizes that all of
these accounts <I>are untrue</I>.  Marmor's version is particularly
faulty.  Indeed, the brief passage quoted above contains five
demonstrable errors of fact.
<P>
1.  &quot;The homosexuals were all rated 6 and the heterosexuals
0 on the Kinsey scale.&quot;  In the first place, in her report
Hooker makes no reference whatsoever to the Kinsey scale.  In
the second place, she gives evidence in her narrative to contradict
Marmor's generalization.  Three heterosexuals reported homosexual
contact after adolescence and three homosexuals reported heterosexual
behavior.  Kinsey described his &quot;0&quot; rating as &quot;[e]xclusively
heterosexual with no homosexual&quot; and his &quot;6&quot; rating
as &quot;[e]xclusively homosexual.&quot;
<P>
2. There were three judges involved rather than two, as Marmor
reports.
<P>
3. Dr. Marmor reports that the judges reviewed all three tests
when, in fact, two judges reviewed the Rorschach and one judge
reviewed the MAPS and TAT.
<P>
4. Dr. Marmor states that the judges reviewed the MAPS and the
TAT, as well as the Rorschach, in an attempt to distinguish between
heterosexual and homosexual subjects when, in fact, no judge was
asked to make this distinction for the MAPS and TAT because Hooker
knew the homosexuals had &quot;outed&quot; themselves.  
<P>
5. Contrary to what Marmor states, the MAPS and TAT did indeed
reveal the sexual orientation of the homosexuals.  
<P>
Both Herek and Shenitz make some of the same errors Marmor makes.
<P>
1. They suggest that more than one judge reviewed all test results.
<P>
2. They also state that after looking at the results of all three
tests, the &quot;experts&quot; or &quot;judges&quot; were unable
to distinguish between homosexual and heterosexual subjects.
<P>
Shenitz is no more than a newspaper reporter, but in <I>Morales
v. Texas</I>, Marmor and Herek were testifying as expert scientific
witnesses before a judge -- Marmor as former president of the
American Psychiatric Association.  It is ironic that while the
Morales judge accepted the testimony of Marmor and Herek without
question, he ignored the research of Paul Cameron, who gives a
careful and precise summary of the Hooker study in his volume
<I>The Gay Nineties: What the Empirical Evidence Reveals About
Homosexuality</I>.  
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
This unquestioning acceptance of &quot;authorities&quot; on the
basis of professional reputation or political correctness threatens
the integrity of our legal system.  Judges must take greater responsibility
for assessing the soundness and accuracy of testimony by so-called
experts; yet, paradoxically, such a task is manifestly beyond
the competence of the court.  This dilemma is the consequence
of the politicizing of the scientific community over the past
several decades, particularly in questions of sexuality.  The
recent exposure of Kinsey's errors indicates just how long researchers
have been careless or deliberately misleading in approaching sexual
questions.  And the widespread acclamation of recent, flawed studies
&quot;proving&quot; that homosexuality is inherited genetically
is evidence that the problem has only worsened over the years.

<P>
The 1995 federal appropriation bills which were approved by the
last Congress are filled with duplication, political favoritism,
social agendas, and questionable grants.  The alarming misuse
of taxpayer money should encourage citizens to demand more accountability.
<P>
Consider some government spending already approved for 1995:
<P>
<UL><LI> The Corporation for Public Broadcasting may pay a single individual
$438,000 for a once-a-week, 30-minute TV appearance.[1]
<P>
<LI>Federally financed Howard University gets $5.5 million to prepare
practicing attorneys to do pro bono work in Washington, DC.
<P>
<LI>NIH will spend $2.5 million to build playgrounds for monkeys.
<P>
<LI>DOT will spend $400,000 to help Russians build roads.
<P>
<LI>The Pentagon will spend $18 million for new homes at an Army
base that is losing one third of its existing personnel.
<P>
<LI>The State Department will give Russians $15 million for &quot;family
planning.&quot;
<P>
<LI>The State Department will spend $750,000 to study tropical bird
migration.
<P>
<LI>The EPA will spend $250,000 to control zebra mussels in the
City of Chicago.
<P>
<LI>The EPA will spend $70,000 to study a European fish in Lake
Superior.
<P>
<LI>HUD will spend $53 million for a sewage plant in Mexico.
<P>
<LI>The Forest Service will spend $635,000 to build a visitor center
on a remote and inaccessible by road peninsula on Alaska's panhandle.
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>DETAILS FROM 13 APPROPRIATION BILLS</h3></CENTER>
<P>
<B>1. Foreign aid in non-foreign bills</B>:  The appropriations
bill for &quot;The ForeignOperations, Export Financing, and Related Programs for the Fiscal
Year Ending September 30, 1995&quot; includes funding for most
foreign aid programs.  Foreign aid, however, can be found in other
bills.  
<P><UL>
<LI>The Federal Highway Administration was given $400,000 to provide
technical assistance to Russia.[2] 
<P>
<LI>The Department for Housing and Urban Development (HUD) was given
$52.5 million to finance the construction of a waste treatment
plant in Tijuana, Mexico.[3]  HUD is funding a second wastewater
facility near Micicali, Mexico for $47.5 million.[4] (Congress also
appropriated $1 million through the International Boundary and
Water Commission to reimburse the City of San Diego for treatment
of Tijuana sewage.[5]) 
<P>
<LI>Funding for the Smithsonian Institution includes a $50,000 grant
to the Mpala Center, Kenya for facility and equipment purchases.[6]
</UL>
<B>2. Suspect foreign aid</B>.  
<P><UL>
<LI>The State Department will provide $15 million for &quot;family
planning&quot; to Russia in 1995.[7]
<P>
<LI>It will give $50 million to the United Nation Population Fund
(UNPF) with the intention that none of this money will be used
to fund abortions in China.[8] The UNPF is expected to give $7 million
for &quot;voluntary family planning programs&quot; in China.[9]
<P>
<LI>The State Department will grant $750,000 to the Fish and Wildlife
Foundation to study neotropical migratory bird conservation.[10]
</UL>
<B>3. Duplication of programs</B>.  Our government should
look to eliminate redundancy.  Consider:
<P><UL>
<LI>The Treasury Department's plan to build a training facility
near Tuscon, Arizona.  There will be a dormitory, a dining facility
and $2.9 million in firearm ranges.[11] Just outside of Tuscon is
the Army's Fort Huachuca, which has many modern firearm ranges.
 Treasury should arrange with the Army to use existing ranges
rather than building duplicate firing facilities.  After all,
the FBI Academy's entire campus is located on Quantico Marine
Base in Virginia where it has joint use of all ranges.
<P>
<LI>The Department of Housing and Urban Development (HUD) was appropriated
$175,000 for a special purpose grant to be given to Domestic Violence
Prevention, Inc. in Bowie County, Texas.[12] Why is housing money
used for this project when the 1994 crime bill authorizes $324
million for the Family Violence Prevention and Services Act?[13]
The crime bill also has $10 million for nonprofit organizations
to establish projects that coordinate intervention and prevention
of domestic violence, and authorizes $30 million for rural domestic
violence and child abuse enforcement.
<P>
<LI>The Department of Interior received $800,000 to monitor salmon
on Alaska's Yukon and Kuskokwim Rivers.[14] The National Oceanic
and Atmospheric Administration (NOAA) will spend another $700,000
to collect information on salmon in the Yukon River as well.[15]
NOAA collects information on salmon at other locations as well.
<P>
<LI>The Small Business Administration is directed to grant $3.25
million for three incubator facilities.[16]
<P>
<LI>The Justice Department is appropriated $29 million for &quot;Drug
Courts&quot; which is a program that provides drug treatment during
and after incarceration for non-violent offenders.[17] This replicates
ongoing programs both inside prisons and in many communities.
<P>
<LI>The National Science Foundation was appropriated $2 million
to establish in 1995 an interdisciplinary center to support research
on violence.[18] The 1994 crime bill authorizes many programs to
research violence:[19]
<P><UL>
<LI>Title IV-Violence Against Women Act of 1994 requires the Attorney
General to study campus sexual assaults, the &quot;battered women's
syndrome,&quot; the abusive spouse, and domestic violence.[20]
<P>
<LI>Title III-Crime Prevention includes research grants to investigate
juvenile violence, drug use, and gang violence.[21]
<P>
<LI>Virtually every section of the crime bill requires at least
one federal agency to either study or research special aspects
of violence.[22]
</UL><P>
<LI>HUD will award housing money for six substance abuse programs
and eight crime prevention programs.[23] The 1994 crime bill includes
duplicate grant programs.
<P>
<LI>Congress has already appropriated $20.4 million for federal
support of the 1995 Special Olympics in New Haven, Connecticut
and both the XXVI Olympiad and the X Paralympiad in Atlanta in
1996.[24] The GSA and HUD will contribute $3 million to the X Paralympiad.
 (The Paralympiad was established in 1960 to create awareness
of athletes with physical disabilities.)  The X Paralympiad will
take place in Atlanta August 16-17, just after the Olympic Games.
 Some 4,000 athletes representing 110 countries are expected to
participate.  HUD's contribution goes to assist disabled veterans
to participate.
<P>
<LI>Congress appropriated $5.6 million for the taxpayer funded District
of Columbia School of Law ignoring Mayor Sharon Pratt Kelly's
recommendation to close the school.  Two of the best law schools
in the nation are in Washington, D.C. - Georgetown University
and American University and another is in nearby Baltimore.  Additionally,
the appropriation bill lists the other reasons to close the school:
it must dramatically expand its library before it can earn full
accreditation; it must increase faculty salaries and other staff
and student services; and the school needs a permanent facility
of at least 125,000 square feet.[25]
</UL>
<B>4. Spending to remember former Congressional Leaders.</B>
<P><UL>
<LI>The National Historical Publications and Records Commission
is giving $2 million to the Thomas P. &quot;Tip&quot; O'Neill,
Jr. Library at Boston College.[26] The money will be used to organize
Mr. O'Neill's personal papers.  
<P>
<LI>Two million dollars was also granted to the Robert H. and Corinne
W. Michel Congressional Education Fund.[27]  Michel was for many years
the House minority leader.  
<P>
<LI>The Merit Systems Protection Board granted $10 million to the
Morris K. Udall Scholarship and Excellence in National Environmental
Policy Foundation.[28] Udall was a liberal congressman and environmentalist
from Arizona.
</UL>
<B>5. Other questionable expenditures.</B>  
<P><UL>
<LI>The Army recently announced that the 1st Infantry Division headquartered
at Fort Riley, Kansas will be removed from the force.  This means
approximately 5,600 soldiers or a third of the post's population
will leave.  Meanwhile, Congress has appropriated $12.6 million
to build 126 new homes at Fort Riley.[29]
<P>
<LI>The 6th Infantry Division headquartered at Fort Wainwright,
Alaska was deactivated in July, 1994.  Cuts in the Army's presence
in Alaska will be felt at both Fort Wainwright and Fort Richardson
which is near Anchorage.  Yet, Congress appropriated $5 million
to build 72 new homes at Fort Richardson and $66 million to replace
the nearby and jointly used Elmendorf Air Force Base hospital.[30]
<P>
<LI>The Department of Agriculture's Forest Service will spend $635,000
to build a visitor center at Ketchikan, Alaska.  Ketchikan is
located on a remote peninsula reachable only by boat and small
plane.  Ketchikan county has a population of 14,000 inhabitants
scattered among numerous small villages.  The Department also
gave $500,000 to Alaska because &quot;many timber mills have closed.&quot;[31]
<P>
<LI>The National Institutes of Health, National Center for Research
Resources, was directed by the conference committee to reserve
$2.5 million for playgrounds for monkeys used in research.[32]
<P>
<LI>The federal government helps to fund Washington, D.C.'s Howard
University.  Part of the University's 1995 appropriations ($5.5
million) are for the creation of a Law School Clinical Center
to provide legal assistance to supplement the Legal Services Corporation
and to conduct training for practicing attorneys to perform pro
bono (free) services.[33]
</UL>
<B>6. Did you know?</B>  Here are some of the various
and sundry federal spending programs.
<P><UL>
<LI>$46 million to build and operate military child development
centers, including one in Germany and one in Great Britain.[34] These
federally subsidized centers are part of a growing network of
child care facilities that include every military activity worldwide.
<P>
<LI>$45 million will be spent by the Library of Congress for books
for blind and physically handicapped people.[35]
<P>
<LI>The Department of Transportation will give $26 million for employee
bonuses and cash awards.[36]
<P>
<LI>$2.7 million to the Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation.[37]
 This 34 person organization oversees construction projects along
Washington's Pennsylvania Avenue.
<P>
<LI>$27 million annual operating expenses for the U.S. Holocaust
Memorial Council, which is a private organization that oversees
the Holocaust Museum.[38] This relatively small but popular museum
was first opened to the public two years ago.  It was built with
$168 million in private donations raised in just four years.[39]
The Council continues to receive donations from many national
and local organizations.
<P>
<LI>Child Nutrition Programs include $500,000 in state grants for
special dietary needs of children with disabilities.[40]
<P>
<LI>$7 million for the private organization American Printing House
for the Blind.[41]
<P>
<LI>The State Department oversees a $533 million United Nations
peacekeeping appropriation.  This money can be spent with one
stipulation: that American manufacturers and suppliers are given
an &quot;equal&quot; opportunity to provide equipment, services,
and materials to the United Nations peacekeepers.[42] The Senate
amended this appropriation to transfer $350 million to unspecified
&quot;International Organizations&quot; for peacekeeping activities.[43]
<P>
<LI>HUD will grant the City of Chicago $250,000 to control zebra
mussels which originally came from the Black Sea area of Europe.[44]
 The Department of Interior will continue to study zebra mussels
at St. Croix, Virgin Islands.[45] The National Oceanic and Atmospheric
Administration was appropriated $3.7 million to research zebra
mussels.[46] If the zebra mussel is truly endangering our oceans
and lakes, then a more focused effort should be undertaken.
</UL>
<B>7. Legislating inside appropriation bills.</B>  Five
appropriation bills contain social legislation.  
<P><UL>
<LI>The Architect of the Capitol is directed to hire a &quot;diverse
labor force.&quot;[47] This means hiring quotas.
<P>
<LI>The National Science Foundation is directed to award at least
20 percent of all grants to small colleges and universities that
consist of &quot;predominantly underrepresented groups&quot; in
science and technology.[48]
<P>
<LI>When hiring investigators the John F. Kennedy Assassination
Records Review Board is directed to give preferential treatment
to former Office of Personnel Management employees.[49]
<P>
<LI>The Office of Personnel Management is encouraged to promote
&quot;diversity.&quot;  OPM's definition of &quot;diversity&quot;
includes people of different sexual orientation.[50]
<P>
<LI>The appropriation bill for the Department of Agriculture deletes
Senate language aimed at ending the use of taxpayer funds to promote
homosexuality.[51]
<P>
<LI>Health and Human Services is directed to increase quotas for
black nurses nationally.[52]
<P>
<LI>The Federal Bureau of Investigation was appropriated funds to
restore special agents &quot;eliminated in prior years associated
with background investigations.&quot;[53] A former marker for elimination
based on a background investigation was identifying the candidate
as a homosexual.  The FBI Academy has started training for homosexuals
previously rejected.
</UL>
<B>8. Please explain these appropriations.</B>  Many programs
are funded without adequate explanation.  
<P><UL>
<LI>The Department of Education is awarding $4 million to the Mary
McLeod Bethune Memorial Fine Arts Center on the campus of Bethune
Cookman College in Daytona Beach, Florida.[54] The facility will
allow students to be trained for the fields of entertainment and
hotel management.[55]
<P>
<LI>The U.S. Institute of Peace gets $11.5 million.[56] The ten year
old institute has received $76 million in federal grants.  In
1991 it shifted from discussing peace to teaching conflict resolution
in America's classrooms.  There are more than 300 violence-prevention
programs and 100 conflict resolution curricula available to America's
28,000 high schools and 78,000 grade schools.[57] The 1994 crime
bill contains many grants for anti-violence programs.  
<P>
<LI>The Bureau of Mines is directed to do &quot;essential Arctic
research&quot; in Anchorage, Alaska.[58]  Anchorage is 400 miles south
of the Arctic Circle and has no arctic characteristics like permafrost.
 Why not conduct the research nearer the Arctic Circle, perhaps
at the University of Alaska, Fairbanks?
<P>
<LI>The National Telecommunications and Information Administration
is appropriated $1.5 million for the Pan-Pacific Educational and
Cultural Experiments by Satellite Program.[59]
<P>
<LI>Washington, D.C. received $720 million from the federal government
for public education.  The appropriation bill states, &quot;the
Board of Education has overspent its appropriation for personal
services by millions of dollars while underspending its appropriation
for other-than-personal-services by an equal amount.  The chronic
recurrence of such an imbalance suggests that the Board of Education
habitually submits budgets to the Congress that the Board knows
to be unrealistic and that the Board intends to disregard.&quot;[60]
<P>
<LI>The Department of Housing and Urban Development will award 261
special purpose grants worth $291 million.[61] These include:
<P><UL>
<LI>$450,000 to construct the Center for Political Participation
at the University of Maryland.[62] The Center &quot;is the first
academically-sanctioned program in the country to support young
leaders seeking elective office.&quot;[63] The advisory board includes
actress Morgan Fairchild, Congressman Steny Hoyer, Congresswoman
Connie Morella, <I>ABC News'</I> Sheila Kast, and the wife of
Maryland governor Parris Glendening.[64]
<P>
<LI>$500,000 to the Maine College of Art for renovations to a Portland
building.[65]
<P>
<LI>$1 million to develop the Center for Pacific Rim Studies in
San Francisco.[66] The Center will do research on competition and
offer training for professionals.  It is focused on trade development,
including foreign language and culture, legal systems, commercial
practices and data links.[67]
<P>
<LI>$6.5 million for the Points of Light Foundation.[68] The <I>Los
Angeles Times</I> found that the Foundation in its first four
years spent $22 million on administrative expenses and $4 million
on grants to service organizations.  Expenses included $1.4 million
for a kickoff celebration and more than $108,000 paid to the Hill
and Knowlton public relations firm to promote the party, as well
as a $160,000 salary for its top executive.  In the first four
years, it received $26 million from the government.[69]
<P>
<LI>$500,000 for the National Invention Resource Center in the
City of Akron, Ohio.[70] The Center is part of the nonprofit Inventure
Place which opens July, 1995.
<P>
<LI>$70,000 to study the European Ruffe in Lake Superior.[71] The
Ruffe was introduced in 1986 to Duluth Harbor which is on Lake
Superior.  The Ruffe now makes up 65 percent of the harbor's fish
population.  Why is federal housing money being used to study
the spread of this fish?  Possibly some of the $450,000 appropriated
for the Great Lakes Fishery Commission could be used to study
the Ruffe.[72]
<P>
<LI>$750,000 for a center to coordinate academic training for physical
therapists at the Veterans' Administration hospitals in Brooklyn,
NY.[73]
<P>
<LI>$2.5 million for Project Social Care MB, Inc. to serve elderly
Holocaust survivors in Brooklyn, NY.[74] There are about 2,000 Holocaust
survivors in the greater New York metro area.  Another organization,
Selfhelp Community Services, has a $51 million annual budget and
has the prime focus on helping survivors.[75]
<P>
<LI>$250,000 for port modernization at Davisville, Rhode Island.[76]
<P>
<LI>$300,000 to expand the science and mathematics complex at the
University of South Carolina.[77]
<P>
<LI>$1.2 million for the Fire Safe Cigarette Act.[78] These funds
go to the Consumer Product Safety Commission and the National
Institute of Standards and Technology to measure the cigarette's
ignition propensity.[79]
<P>
<LI>HUD special purpose grants also fund: 5 child care centers,
the restoration of 5 theaters/museums, restoring or building 5
libraries, running a summer camp program, and building a bicentennial
and media activities center for a city.[80]
</UL></UL>
<B>9. AIDS money scattered among bills.</B>  Most AIDS
money is found in the appropriations for HHS, but AIDS money is
in other bills as well.
<P><UL>
<LI>The Department of Agriculture will grant Indiana $250,000 to
study HIV/STD prevention in rural areas.[81]
<P>
<LI>The Pentagon is being given $33 million to study AIDS.[82]
<P>
<LI>HUD is appropriated $186 million for housing people with AIDS.[83]
 HUD also is awarding special purpose grants worth $4.3 million
for other HIV housing facilities.[84]
</UL>
<B>10. Politics and agriculture appropriations.</B>  The
1995 agriculture appropriations appear to be based more on politics
than merit.  The top three states to receive agriculture grants
earmarked by state were Arkansas, Iowa and Mississippi.[85] Arkansas
received $17.7 million, Iowa received $11.9 million, and Mississippi
received $10.45 million.
<P>
Senators from these states were on the conference committee for
appropriations.  Additionally, President Clinton is from Arkansas
and former Secretary of Agriculture Mike Epsy is from Mississippi.
<P>
The U.S. Department of Commerce reports that the highest net farm
income for 1991 came from California which ranked seventh in discretionary
agriculture grants.  Mississippi ranked 21 in net income and Arkansas
was ninth.[86] But Arkansas received almost 300 percent more discretionary
grant money than California, the highest farm income state.  Arkansas
grants included:
<P><UL>
<LI>$462,000 for a National Center for Agricultural Law Research
and Information at the Leflar School of Law in Fayetteville, Arkansas.[87]
<P>
<LI>$1.2 million for a new agriculture building and $946,000 for
an Alternative Pest Control Center at the University of Arkansas.[88]
<P>
<LI>$4.8 million for the Rice Germplasm Center, Stuttgard, Arkansas.[89]
<P>
<LI>$1.1 million for the Arkansas Children's Hospital.[90]
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Taxpayers should demand that the 104th Congress review and rescind
appropriations that waste money or promote a political agenda.

<P>
Thirty years ago this March, Daniel Patrick Moynihan issued his
famous warning about the breakdown of the black family.  At the
time, liberal intellectuals and civil rights activists excoriated
him for &quot;defending middle-class values.&quot;  &quot;What
may seem to be a disease to the white middle class may be a healthy
adaptation to the Negro lower class,&quot;[1] Bayard Rustin intoned.
<P>
Today, however, overwhelming empirical evidence demonstrates that
there is nothing at all &quot;healthy&quot; about the decay of
families and that not all personal choices are equal in terms
of their impact on children, families, and communities.  The evidence
itself has propelled illegitimacy to the forefront of the current
national debate over welfare reform.
<P>
While a burgeoning white illegitimacy rate has helped strip the
debate of racial overtones, a black Democrat named Wayne Bryant
has pioneered in the state of New Jersey one of the key anti-illegitimacy
provisions recently adopted by the U.S. House.  The so-called
&quot;family cap&quot; would deny benefit increases to mothers
who bear additional illegitimate children while on welfare.
<P>
The essential purpose of the reform, according to Bryant, is to
restore healthy families.  &quot;Until the needs and the problems
of the family are confronted in a comprehensive way, welfare will
continue its course of entrapping one generation after the next
in a modern form of slavery,&quot;[2] he wrote in a paper describing
his proposal.
<P>
By incorporating the family cap, Senator Bryant intended, not
to constrict reproductive choices or to reduce births per se,
but to promote a sense of responsibility by insisting that families
on welfare live by the same values and confront exactly the same
choices as the general population.  He explained the rationale
for the cap in a series of newspaper interviews:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>
These welfare reform measures are not so much about capping family
size as they are about giving recipients a chance to make choices.
 Under our conventional welfare system, 
welfare mothers are effectively shielded from confronting the
difficult questions that other American parents face when considering
additional children.... I never pretended or intended to have
the law bring about a dramatic increase in births.  It was a responsibility
issue.... Why should people on welfare be guaranteed a 'raise'
when they have additional children?  If a person wants to enlarge
their family while on welfare, they should go to work to support
the additional children like any other working family....No one
is saying welfare mothers can't have families.  We're just saying
the state won't pay for it....If the kids are suffering because
parents are irresponsible in having children they cannot afford,
they'll still suffer if we give them the money because the parents
will still be irresponsible....The battle is dissolving the wall
that separates welfare families from the mainstream population
-- and the cap is an important part of that effort.[3]
</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
Echoing Senator Bryant's most popular argument, California's welfare
commissioner Eloise Anderson is even more blunt: &quot;Working
women do not get automatic raises when they have children.  Why
should our expectations of a woman on AFDC be any different than
any other woman?  Do we think they're stupider or less capable
of being rational?&quot;[4] New Jersey's human services commissioner,
William Waldman, agrees: &quot;A lot of what we do [in the name
of welfare] is very patronizing.&quot;[5]
<P>
Since the family cap took effect in New Jersey in August of 1993,
the birth rate among welfare mothers in the state has dropped
substantially -- powerful proof that women on welfare are indeed
capable of governing their own decisions.  Robert Rector of the
Heritage Foundation estimates a decrease greater than 20 percent;[6]
but like Wayne Bryant, he too emphasizes that even if the birthrate
had not fallen the policy would be justified.  &quot;I support
the family cap simply because it's morally correct,&quot;[7] Rector
says.
<P>
Even the more conservative estimate of the birthrate decrease
reported by the New Jersey Department of Human Services (11.4
percent)[8] vindicates the two fundamental principles underlying
the current national debate: that economic incentives do influence
out-of-wedlock childbearing and that subsidizing irresponsible
sexual behavior has accelerated the moral and cultural decline
beyond what even Moynihan envisioned.
<P>
While Charles Murray notes that much of the force of noneconomic
social stigma was underwritten by economics in the past, he argues
that contemporary &quot;[w]elfare will not be abolished [despite
the potential economic savings to communities] until the moral
sanctions against illegitimacy have also gained great strength.&quot;[9]
 The seeming paradox highlights the difficulty of defining precisely
how government can promote character formation.
<P>
James Q. Wilson answers that &quot;[t]he essential first step
is to acknowledge that at root, in almost every area of important
public concern, we are seeking to induce persons to act virtuously&quot;[10]
-- a statement that has grown less controversial in the 30 years
since the Moynihan Report met with violent protest from moral
relativists who denied the existence of an absolute standard of
virtue.  Today, there is a mounting public consensus that bearing
children out of wedlock is wrong and that the perverse incentives
of the welfare system share much of the blame.
<P>
In a continuation of the same passage, Professor Wilson explains
the moral implications of economic incentives: &quot;Virtue is
not learned by precept...; it is learned by the regular repetition
of right actions.... Seen this way, there is no conflict between
economic thought and moral philosophy: The latter simply supplies
a fuller statement of the uses to which the former can and should
be put.  We...induce habits of right conduct...by arranging the
incentives confronting youngsters in the ordinary aspects of their
daily lives so that right action routinely occurs.&quot;[11]
<P>
Yet, morality is not merely a product of rational choices in response
to economic incentives.  If man is more than a material being,
then it is not unreasonable to expect some individual moral decisions
to override the economic incentives that run against the grain
of virtue.  Nor is it implausible to suggest that, of all the
choices an individual mother must make, the decision to abort
her child -- the most galvanizing moral issue of our day -- is
the one least likely to respond to policy variables.  
<P>
Precisely because human behavior is governed by a unique complex
of moral instinct and rational choice, the elimination of additional
cash benefits in New Jersey has decreased the birthrate without
causing an upsurge in the abortion rate.  While it is far too
premature to draw any decisive conclusions, there is absolutely
no statistical confirmation as of yet that an increase in abortions
has occurred since the New Jersey family cap took effect August
1, 1993.In fact, the total number of Medicaid-funded abortions in New Jersey
declined from 13,629 in 1993 to 13,424 in 1994.[12]
<P>
In fact, Anita Leone, executive director of an association that
represents all the publicly-funded abortion clinics in New Jersey,
asserted in a recent interview: &quot;We know that abortions in
New Jersey are currently <I>decreasing</I>.  We just don't know
why.&quot;[13] Because the decline in the birth rate among welfare
mothers in New Jersey has been rather substantial since the implementation
of the family cap, the fact that an increase in abortions is not
evident is particularly significant.
<P>
The anecdotal evidence collected by those who are on the front-lines
of welfare reform in New Jersey confirms the general pattern that
is beginning to emerge from the data.  Richard Traynor of the
Legal Center for Defense of Life in New Jersey and David Sciarra
of New Jersey Legal Services, who together filed a class-action
suit over the New Jersey family cap, both commented in telephone
interviews that the class was certified to include welfare mothers
who had aborted their babies -- but that neither one could locate
a woman who had actually aborted in the wake of the cap.
<P>
Instead, the only plaintiffs who mention abortion in their affidavits
explain that they consciously decided on moral grounds <I>not</I>
to terminate their pregnancies, despite increased economic pressures.
One woman testified that she made an appointment at an abortion
clinic but ultimately &quot;became very upset about having an
abortion and decided that [she] could not go through with it.&quot;
 Another woman who already had two children and was carrying triplets
-- three times the pressure -- never even considered abortion.[14]
<P>
Women interviewed at Chelton Terrace in New Jersey said &quot;they
didn't see the cap forcing women into abortion clinics.  'It's
not going to make them get any more abortions than what they've
been getting,' one woman said.  'If you want to have that baby,
you will.'&quot;[15] Another woman in Camden, New Jersey said that
she knew about the cap but decided to have her baby anyway.  &quot;Abortion
is against my faith,&quot;[16] she explained.
<P>
A church pastor in the same town related a telling story.  A young
welfare mother had come to the church grieving over a miscarriage.
 Another pastor gently reminded her that she really had no way
of providing for a second child and that the state would not increase
her grant.  &quot;But it just didn't make sense to her,&quot;[17]
the pastor concluded, because mothers do not tend to subject their
relationships with their children to a strict cost-benefit analysis.
 Only the most callous of mothers places a price tag on her baby's
head.
<P>
One welfare mother recently quoted in <i>The New York Times</i>
said it perhaps most eloquently: &quot;[My fourth child] wasn't
planned, but I wasn't going to abort her.  Sixty-four dollars
is not going to change my love for my child, and if I would have
aborted her, it wouldn't have comforted my soul.... You just learn
that a pound of ground beef is overrated.&quot;[18]
<P>
Michelle Scholz of the Northwest Pregnancy Center in Washington,
D.C. explains that in her experience a mother decides first whether
or not to keep her baby and, then, how to pay for the child's
care.[19] Sister Connie Driscoll, founder of St. Martin de Porres
House of Hope in Chicago, testifies that over 9,000 destitute
women have passed through her shelter in the last 12 years.  Not
one of those women has opted for an abortion.[20]
<P>
The decision to abort, the evidence suggests, is uniquely invulnerable
to rational economic incentives.  And welfare mothers are apparently
more inclined to consider &quot;non-rational&quot; factors than
any other population group.  Public opinion data collected by
the Family Research Council suggest that abortion is even more
morally repugnant to poor women;[21] and the fact that abortion rates
for teen welfare mothers are <i>lower</i> than national averages
for all teenage girls is a powerful indication that non-economic
factors determine the decision to carry a child to term.[22]
<P>
Many who now argue otherwise are precisely the ones who maintain
that the current benefits level is already far too low to cover
the costs associated with a new baby.  If so, it is illogical
to predict that a cap would have a sufficiently significant impact
on the &quot;affordability&quot; of another child to trigger such
a drastic measure as abortion.
<P>
State-by-state data from the 1980s demonstrate that small changes
in welfare payouts do not affect abortion rates in the short term;
and Michael Schwartz of Life Advocacy Alliance has found in analyzing
more recent data that states with the highest average monthly
benefit for a family of three also tend to have the highest ratio
of abortions to live births.[23]
<P>
Not surprisingly, then, the only &quot;evidence&quot; the plaintiffs
could offer in the New Jersey suit was 55 letters from pro-life
activists expressing concern that freezing benefits might increase
abortions.  As of yet, there is nothing more concrete than their
concern itself to corroborate their claims; and pro-lifers who
are unconvinced by the hearsay -- including John Tomicki, past
president of New Jersey Right to Life -- have concluded that welfare
reform itself is a pro-life cause.
<P>
The findings in New Jersey are striking evidence of the latent
moral potential in welfare mothers that is begging to be cultivated,
rather than frustrated by the perpetuation of policies that subsidize
immorality.  Remedial policies should reconcile the current tension
between moral knowledge and the economic incentives of the welfare
system -- before moral knowledge is altogether gone from the inner
city.
<P>
Charles Murray explains that, when illegitimacy reaches a critical
mass, the neighborhood effects create problems that extend far
beyond the recipients of welfare.  Community values and the norms
for male behavior are changed, and with them the behavior of young
men and women who never touch an AFDC check.  Thus, the effect
of those checks springs not only from discrete changes in economic
incentives but from a larger, more pervasive effect on the formation
of character among poor young people.[24]
<P>
Yet, conservatives must acknowledge that government cannot be
an effective moral teacher.  Public policy can undermine, but
never instill, virtue.
<P>
Rather than attempting to devise the perfect bundle of carrots
and sticks, we must eliminate altogether the government subsidies
that skew welfare recipients' decisions by shielding them from
the natural economic consequences.  Michael Tanner of the Cato
Institute writes: &quot;We could reasonably expect that people,
faced with the consequences of their actions, would change their
behavior.  Such an approach would avoid coercion and the conceit
that government knows best.&quot;[25]
<P>
Getting government out of the way, of course, is the theme that
unites social conservatives and economic libertarians.  In <i>The
Road to Serfdom</i>, F. A. Hayek emphasized the symbiotic relationship
between morality and freedom from government intervention:
<P>
<BLOCKQUOTE>Freedom to order our own conduct in the sphere where material
circumstances force a choice upon us, and responsibility for the
arrangement of our own life according to our own conscience, is
the air in which alone moral sense grows and in which moral values
are daily re-created in the free decision of the individual.[26]</BLOCKQUOTE>
<P>
It is the intrinsic truth of Hayek's observation that motivated
Wayne Bryant to institute the family cap in New Jersey -- a cap
he himself describes as a mechanism to reduce government constriction
of personal choices.[27]
<P>
Government must instead cede ground to the character-forming institutions
that are found in every community -- families, churches, schools,
charities, and other traditional arrangements that have been supplanted
by public authorities.  Rather than merely ending government programs,
conservatives intend to <I>replace</I> government welfare by advancing
proposals like a tax credit for charitable contributions that
will help to strengthen civil institutions.
<P>
Unless those institutions are reinvigorated and social functions
are restored to neighborhoods and communities, the behavioral
problems Daniel Patrick Moynihan described 30 years ago will only
continue to grow more acute, jeopardizing personal freedoms and
ultimately the survival of the republic itself.  If it is true
that moral values do not have concrete meaning in the absence
of freedom, it is also true that the preservation of political
liberty depends upon the cultivation 
of virtue in the people.

<P>
American families must balance expenses with income.  When this
fails, they delay clothing purchases or visits to the dentist.
  Such decisions are difficult,  but the alternative of  mounting
debt is too risky.  These hard-working taxpayers likewise expect
the federal government to keep its fiscal house in order by balancing
expenses with income.
<P>
The U.S. House of Representatives Budget Committee is beginning
the process of balancing  the national budget.  The Committee
proposes a balanced budget by the year 2002, but to get there
will require a lot of  belt tightening.   
<P>
Their proposed budget includes many needed cuts.  They propose
to terminate, privatize, or convert to block grants three Cabinet
departments, 284 programs, 69 commissions, 13 agencies, and three
commercial activities.[1]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>DEPARTMENTS TO BE ELIMINATED (3)</CENTER></H3>
<P>
The Department of Energy was created in 1977 by President Jimmy
Carter in response to the energy crisis of the early 1970s.  
The 20,213-employee agency promotes energy conservation, controls
federal supplies of power, and develops alternative sources of
energy.   However, 85 percent of DoE's budget is spent on activities
that are not energy related.[2]
<P>
The Department of Education was established in 1979 by President
Carter to expand the federal role in education.  The Department's
budget has doubled while student performance has declined.   According
to former Secretary of Education William Bennett, more than 90
percent of the students entering U.S. colleges today would not
be admitted to post-secondary education anywhere else in the world.[3]
 In fact, only a small part of federal education spending reaches
American classrooms.  Most of the Department's current functions
of technical assistance and information can be transferred to
the states or other federal agencies.
<P>
The Department of Commerce was created in 1903 and spends $3.6
billion per year on more than 100 programs of which three-fourths
are duplicated by other federal agencies.  More than half of the
Department's budget and a third of its employees staff the National
Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration.[4] This organization would
become an independent agency.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>AGENCIES TO BE ELIMINATED (3)</CENTER></H3>
<P>
Just as America's taxpayers can do without the three cabinet-level
departments targeted for elimination in the House GOP Budget,
they can surely get along without the 13 agencies the House GOP
Budget would eliminate.  For example:
<UL>
<LI>The U.S. Travel and Tourism Administration was created in
1981 and spends $17 million per year promoting tourism and recreation
activities by conducting surveys, distributing promotional material,
and running regional marketing shows.  There is no reason for
the federal government to be involved in an activity that is already
handled by a prosperous private industry.[5]
<P>
<LI>The Minority Business Development Agency was created in 1971
to promote the development of minority-owned businesses and to
steer these businesses toward government contracts.  It was appropriated
$44 million in fiscal 1996 even though it duplicates a  loan program
run by the Small Business Administration.[6] 
<P>
<LI>The Maritime Administration was created in 1950 to tap the
domestic maritime fleet in case of national emergency.  Unfortunately,
the government-owned &quot;Ready Reserve Force&quot; was not seaworthy
during the Persian Gulf call-up.   The Maritime Administration
is part of the Department of Transportation and primarily acts
as a custodian of federal subsidies used to shield U.S. vessels
from foreign competition.[7]  But most (96 percent) of all waterborne
cargo entering or leaving the U.S. is on American vessels.
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>PROGRAMS ELIMINATED (284)</CENTER></H3>
<P>
Likewise, most taxpayers aren't likely to miss the 284 programs
eliminated by the House GOP Budget.  These programs include:
<UL>
<LI>The Federal Helium Reserve and Processing Facility will cost
$26 million over the next five years.  It was established in 1925
to insure a constant supply of helium for military blimps and
observation balloons which are no longer used.  The United States
produces most of the world's helium, exporting 5.5 times as much
helium as is produced worldwide.  But the government stays in
the helium business because of a federal ban prohibiting NASA
and the Pentagon from purchasing privately produced helium.[8]
<P>
<LI>The Pennsylvania Avenue Development Corporation, which will
spend $2.7 million in 1995, was established in 1972 to oversee
the &quot;Avenue's revitalization.&quot;  The corporation is governed
by a 23-member board which oversees joint ventures with the private
sector, sponsors festivals, cultural performances, and athletic
events on Washington's Pennsylvania Avenue.[9]
<P>
<LI>The Points of Light Foundation in its first four years spent
$22 million on administrative expenses and $4 million on grants
to service organizations.  Expenses included $1.4 million for
a kickoff celebration and more than $108,000 paid to a public
relations firm to promote the party, as well as a $160,000 salary
for its top executive.[10]
<P>
<LI>The National Rail Passenger Corporation (AMTRAK) was created
in 1970 to take over the nation's ailing private passenger rail
service.  It has cost the taxpayer $17 billion but carries less
than one-half of one percent of America's inter-city passengers
or about 22 million passengers a year, a quarter of the entire
rail passenger service.[11]
<P>
<LI>The Corporation for Public Broadcasting (CPB) was established
in 1968 and now sponsors more than 600 National Public Radio (NPR)
stations and 340 Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) television
stations.  PBS and NPR are primarily (80 percent) funded through
private and non-federal public donations, but the federal share
provided by CPB for fiscal year 1996  is $286 million.[12]
<P>
<LI>The Legal Services Corporation (LSC) was created in 1974 to
provide low-income individuals with legal representation. LSC
will spend part of this year's $415 million budget to fund lobbying
or campaigning for local political initiatives.  The agency, a
piggybank for left-wing causes, has fought reforms designed to
reduce out-of-wedlock births; filed suit against a nonprofit homeless
shelter; and tried to create a &quot;constitutional right&quot;
to federal welfare.[13]
<P>
<LI>The AmeriCorps program, created by President Clinton, funds
community-based organizations &quot;to address problems they identify
by using the skills of individuals serving in National Service
positions.&quot;  Participants are given a stipend, an educational
award or credit toward student loan repayment, medical benefits,
and free child care for volunteer work.  The taxpayer cost for
each &quot;volunteer&quot; exceeds $30,000 or more than $3 billion
over the next five years.[14]
<P>
<LI>The National Endowment for the Arts has been a platform for
attacks on religion, traditional art forms, traditional families
and traditional values, and a forum for the promotion of homosexuality.
 NEA grants greatly influence what is presented in museums and
theaters and what private donors feel is worthy of support.  As
former NEA Chairman John Frohnmayer noted: &quot;Our grantees
state unequivocally that fund-raising is substantially easier
because of an Endowment grant.  It is an endorsement-a mark of
quality and achievement.&quot;[15] In 1994, the private sector donated
more than $9.6 billion to the arts.
<P>
<LI>The Mary McLeod Bethune Memorial Fine Arts Center located
on the Campus of Bethune Cookman College in Daytona Beach, Florida
received a grant of $4 million from the Department of Education.
 The facility will allow students to be trained for the fields
of entertainment and hotel management, fields adequately covered
by the private sector.[16]
<P>
<LI>The Essential Air Service Program (EASP) was created in 1978
to continue air service to small communities.  EASP will spend
$28 million in 1996 subsidizing commuter service to 80 communities.
 It was initially authorized for a ten-year period.  The subsidies
that these airlines receive from taxpayers range from $5 to $320
per passenger.[17]
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>BOARDS, COMMISSIONS, AUTHORITIES TO BE ELIMINATED (269)</CENTER></H3>
<P>
Similarly, it is difficult to justify deficit spending to support
many federal boards, commissions, and authorities.  Among those
the House GOP wants to delete are:
<UL>
<LI>The Interstate Commerce Commission was created in 1887 to
oversee the rail industry.  It now oversees rail traffic, trucking,
barges, buses, freight forwarders and express companies.   Legislation
that deregulated transportation has increased competition and
made the ICC largely obsolete.[18]
<P>
<LI>The Appalachian Regional Commission (ARC) was created in 1965
to fight poverty.  It is one of 62 federal economic development
programs under 18 federal departments and agencies.  ARC is currently
funded at $200 million.[19]
<P>
<LI>The Tennessee Valley Authority (TVA) was created in 1933 to
generate and distribute electric power for the Tennessee Valley.
 Today, TVA manages locks, dams and recreation areas, operates
a research center, and funds economic development.
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>COMMERCIAL ACTIVITIES TO BE PRIVATIZED (3)</CENTER></H3>
<P>
Rather than believing worthwhile public functions must be performed
by government, the House GOP Budget plan recognizes that commercial
activities ought to be privatized.  Specifically:
<UL>
<LI>The Department of Energy operates five Power Marketing Administrations
which sell electricity from 131 dams.  In 1994, the PMA's sold
$3 billion worth of electric power.  The Budget Committee recommends
selling four of the PMA's, which are not a profitable investment
for the taxpayer.[20] 
<P>
<LI>The Naval Petroleum Reserves were established in 1912 by Presidents
William Howard Taft and Woodwork Wilson to assure fuel for the
Navy.  The project oversees two commercial oil fields and an oil-shale
reserve.  Studies show that these facilities operate far less
efficiently than comparable privately-owned fields.[21]
<P>
<LI>The United States Enrichment Corporation (USEC)  produces
and markets uranium enrichment services to private utilities in
the U.S. and abroad.  USEC advertises that it serves &quot;approximately
90 percent of the domestic market and about 40 percent of the
world market.&quot;[22] This taxpayer- financed commercial enterprise
could be sold for profit and operated more efficiently through
privatization.
</UL>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Individually, these programmatic cuts may not amount to much;
 but collectively these changes translate into hundreds of billions
of taxpayer savings and a balanced federal budget by 2002.

<P>
<FONT SIZE=-1>The rates in columns 2 and 3 are defined as abortions per
1,000 females on AFDC.  The twelve months prior to implementation
of the cap are August 1992 through July 1993.  The cap took effect
August of 1993, and the most recent monthly data available are
March 1994 because of a time lag in reporting.</FONT>
<P>
<HR><P>
Together with all who decry abortion, the Family Research Council
reacted with concern to press reports Tuesday that New Jersey
experienced a &quot;slight increase in the abortion rate among
women on welfare during the first eight months since implementation
of the family cap.&quot;[1]
<P>
We were relieved to discover for ourselves and are now eager
to reassure fellow pro-life advocates that the data released do
not support the conclusion that the family cap has increased abortions.
<P>
Of course, no one can ascribe causality to the family cap, no
matter how the abortion rate appears to have changed.  Officials
from the New Jersey Department of Human Services themselves stress
emphatically that &quot;additional data and analysis are required
before any link can be made between the family cap and the abortion
rate.&quot;[2]
<P>
The much more immediate problem, however, is that the numbers
just released do not describe a consistent upward trend in abortions
as the accompanying press release suggested -- and the newspapers
then hastened to report.  Instead, the raw numbers indicate that
there is no real change in the rates, other than the normal month-to-month
fluctuation that would be expected regardless of the cap.   
<P>
Jacqueline Tencza, spokeswoman for the New Jersey Department of
Human Services, herself cautioned that &quot;the department does
not believe that the [perceived] increase is statistically significant
[i.e., other than a normal distribution of values] because it
is based on a short period of time and compared with only one
previous year.&quot;[3]
<P>
Upon closer scrutiny, the alleged &quot;increase in the abortion
rate&quot; is strictly a function of the particular eight-month
time period isolated for analysis.
<P>
The abortion rate for the month of March 1994 (or March 1993)
is noticeably and significantly greater than any other rate included
in the chart, in part because the month of March contains 23 weekdays
as opposed to the average 21.7 days.  Excluding that one anomalous
rate yields a total monthly average of 9.44 for the period following
implementation of the cap -- which is virtually equal to the pre-cap
average monthly abortion rate of 9.43.
<P>
Examining the pre-cap and post-cap numbers month by month helps
underscore the fact that a straightforward comparison of the two
8-month averages listed in the chart is meaningless.  Three of
the eight months before implementation of the cap in fact posted
a higher abortion rate than the corresponding months in the year
after the cap took effect.
<P>
The waters grow considerably murkier, moreover, when calculations
of average monthly abortion rates include the rates for the four
pre-implementation months in 1993 not included in the chart released
Tuesday.  When the rates for these months (10.96 in April 1993;
9.33 in May 1993; 10.9 in June 1993; and 10.34 in July 1993)[4] are
included, the average monthly abortion rate for the entire year
before implementation of the cap is 9.75 -- again, virtually equal
to the average rate for the eight months since the cap (the only
post-cap months for which data are currently available).  It is
possible, in fact, to isolate a different eight-month period prior
to the cap for which the average monthly abortion rate is higher
than the average calculated for the eight months post-cap.[5]
<P>
It would, of course, be foolish to jump to the conclusion that
abortions must have declined in New Jersey since implementation
of the cap -- but no more foolish than it is to conclude that
abortions have definitely increased in New Jersey, based on the
comparison of two 8-month averages.  It is worthwhile to note
in passing that to date the numbers do not exclude the possibility
that abortions have declined slightly since the cap took effect.
<P>
Given what limited data we have, however, it appears most probable
that the New Jersey family cap is essentially abortion-neutral.
 And we can assert with a large measure of confidence that the
fears of a large upsurge in the short-term abortion rate are unfounded.
<P>
But we repeat again, as we have carefully stated in all previous
comments on the family cap:  It is far too premature to draw any
decisive conclusions from the welfare reform experiment in New
Jersey.  Indeed, it would be a travesty for the national debate
over an issue as critical as welfare reform to rise or fall on
the basis of preliminary returns from one state.
<P>
New Jersey, of course, is a worst-case scenario for the family
cap because it is one of the few states that provides public funding
for abortion.  Failure to demonstrate a consistent, upward trend
in the abortion rate in New Jersey in particular confirms that
it is perfectly appropriate for the debate over the family cap
to go forward.  Given the pathologies of our current welfare system,
the debate <I>must</I> go forward.
<P>
Even with the release of the most recent data, there is still
every reason to theorize that the family cap may be functioning
as a new safeguard for the lives of the unborn.  To know whether
the net effect of the family cap is an increase or a decrease
in the abortion rate, we must know the number of abortions performed
on women who have left the state's welfare rolls.  If the cap
encouraged them to become self-sufficient or to seek alternative
means of support for their babies -- as the framers of the policy
intended -- the abortion rate for former welfare mothers may very
well have decreased.  And the total number of abortions in New
Jersey may have declined.  If that proves to be the case, in a
state that provides public funding for abortions, we will have
powerful evidence to predict that the family cap will be actively
anti-abortion in a state that does not fund or otherwise encourage
abortion.    
<P>
Family Research Council, however,  has never maintained that the
legitimacy of the family cap depends on its capacity to reduce
abortions over the short-term.  The current welfare system is
indelibly anti-marital and anti-natal -- peacefully coexisting
with the world's highest abortion rates outside the Eastern Bloc.
 Long-term change may entail some risk of short-term harm, but
the cost of reform must be weighed against the moral cost of perpetuating
a system that destroys the lives of both the born and yet unborn.
<P>
The family cap is the only welfare reform initiative in the Senate
debate that will directly reduce out-of-wedlock pregnancy, which
is strongly correlated with abortion.  Ardent support for the
family cap <I>is</I> the pro-life position because marriage is
the best protection for children both before and after birth.
 Paying women not to have abortions, by contrast, is morally corrupt.

<P>
A study of fruit flies by National Institutes of Health scientists
has rekindled the debate over whether homosexuality has a genetic
component. 
<P>
A set of male fruit flies, the study reports, formed mating chains
with each other after their body chemistry was altered.  But a
close look at the study reveals that the most reasonable conclusions
from the evidence are that male and female sex drives are quite
different, and that frenzied males, under certain conditions,
will mate with anything, even other males. 
<P>
Writing in the June 1995 <I>Proceedings of the National Academy
of Sciences</I>, Shang-Ding Zhang and Ward F. Odenwald of the
National Institute of Neurological Disorders and Stroke division
of the National Institutes of Health report a heightening of the
sexual activities of fruit flies that had been heat-treated to
reduce levels of the chemical serotonin.[1] Reduction of serotonin
has been linked in other studies to an increase in sexual activity
and same-sex coupling among some animals (rats, cats, and rabbits).[2]

<P>
Media reports, predictably, have exaggerated the actual findings
of the research.  <I>Time,</I> for instance, reported that the
new study &quot;adds to the mounting evidence that homosexuality
has genetic origins....&quot;[3]
<P>
The <I>Time</I> article and other media reports ignore or underreport
key elements of the study that work against the claim that homosexuality
may be hereditary or even partly hereditary.  One finding was
that altered females, the study notes, were not affected in any
discernible way.  
<P>
Another finding -- that normal males resisted sexual advances
by the altered males for up to two hours and then succumbed to
same-sex activity -- indicates strongly that homosexual behavior
is environmentally induced. 
<P>
From the study:
<P>
&quot;At the beginning of chaining periods, in bottles containing
[more than] 80 percent transformants [treated flies], nontransformant
males were observed only at 
the head of fast moving chains where they repeatedly displayed
repelling signals to advancing suitors -- i.e. wing-flicking,
face-kicking, and/or running away....After a 2-hr. exposure to
vigorous transformant courtship, many, if not all, of the nontransformants
were observed courting and inducing courtship.&quot;[4]
<P>
In bottles in which females were present, the females formed defensive
clusters, impeding males' efforts to mate with them.  In one jar
pictured in the article, the females were huddled at the very
bottom while the males formed long lines of sexual activity in
the rest of the jar.  Some of the males did mate with the females,
but the females offered resistance.  
<P>
As the study explains: 
<P>
&quot;Lead males would typically break off their heterosexual
advances after experiencing one or more of her repelling signals...such
as kicking his face and/or running or flying away.  During vigorous
chaining periods, females predominantly grouped together in tight
clusters; however, no female-female courtship was observed in
or outside of these dense packs.&quot;[5]
<P>
The male &quot;homosexual&quot; activity might have had little
to do with preference and merely involve frenzied mating with
the nearest available partner.
<P>
But listen to how <I>Time</I> magazine summarizes the participation
by the &quot;straight&quot; males:
<P>
&quot;While the gays formed their conga lines, the straights stayed
to the side -- but only temporarily.  After a few hours, the straights
joined in and, for the time being, acted gay.&quot;[6]
<P>
No mention is made by <I>Time</I> of the struggle by the &quot;straight&quot;
flies to ward off the hypersexual males.  And the use of the word
&quot;gay&quot; to describe the flies gives them anthropomorphic
overtones; that is, the writer attributes human characteristics
to a non-human rather than vice-versa.  But the notion of being
&quot;gay&quot; is a calculated construct of self-identification
for political purposes.  Many people struggling with homosexuality
reject the idea that their defining characteristic is to be &quot;gay.&quot;[7]
 The <I>Time</I> article does concede that &quot;[t]he type of
gene they've been studying in fruit flies could not begin to account
for the complex variations in human homosexual behavior.  For
one thing, the gene does not cause flies to renounce heterosexuality
altogether.  If a 'gay' fly is surrounded by females instead of
males, he'll fertilize the lady flies.&quot;[8]
<P>
Another culturally significant fact from the study is that when
non-treated male flies constituted 50 percent or more of the population
in a bottle, the researchers found that &quot;little or no chaining
was detected and nontransformant participation was rarely observed.&quot;[9]
<P>
In other words, when the bottle's &quot;culture&quot; was at least
half normal, the male-to-male sex occurred not at all or rarely.
 But when the normal flies were surrounded by &quot;homosexual&quot;
flies and attacked repeatedly, they finally gave in to the behavior.
 Again, it is perilous to extrapolate insect studies to humans,
but this sounds much like experiences reported among convicts.
 Otherwise sexually normal prison inmates sometimes indulge in
homosexual behavior, not because of genetics but because of the
immediate environment (coercion, lack of opposite-sex partners,
peer acceptance of the behavior).  According to psychiatrist and
author Jeffrey B. Satinover, &quot;It is common knowledge that
when some heterosexual men are placed in isolation for long periods
of time with each other that they will engage in homosexual behavior.
 But, once released, they will resume their heterosexual behavior.&quot;[10]
<P>
The social sciences are increasingly looking to animals or insects
for clues to human behavior, even though human sexuality is quite
different.  But if any lessons are to be drawn for human purposes,
they might be these:
<P>
<LI>  The sexes are quite different in their sexual needs, drives
and reactions to particular stimulants.
<P>
<LI>  A culture that hopes to maintain its sexual norms is at risk
when a critical mass of deviant behavior occurs.
<P>
 <LI> Homosexual behavior is learned, and occurs among those who are
vulnerable to the environmental factors that tend to produce homosexual
behavior. 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
As with other studies purporting to show a genetic link to homosexuality,
the NIH study is being hailed by homosexual activists, who are
trying to equate homosexuality with an immutable characteristic
such as skin color or ethnic origin in their drive to create support
for an entirely new category of behavior-based special civil rights.
<P>
The actual research often reveals something entirely different
from what is claimed.  Researchers Zhang and Odenwald summarize
that &quot;both genetic and environmental factors play a role
in male sexual behavior[11]....elements of the basic machinery controlling
male sexual behavior may be highly conserved between taxonomically
distinct organisms.&quot;[12] They call for more research on the
topic to &quot;enhance our knowledge of the underlying mechanisms
controlling sexual behavior.&quot;[13]
<P>
The study is interesting.  But it gives no hard evidence of anything
other than the fact that male fruit flies subjected to a sexual
stimulant may mate with anything in sight.  In March 1993, two
Columbia University psychiatrists examined the various studies
purporting to find a homosexual biologic component.   They concluded
that &quot;there is no evidence at present to substantiate a biologic
theory...the appeal of current biologic explanations for sexual
orientation may derive more from dissatisfaction with the present
status of psychosocial explanations than from a substantiating
body of experimental data.&quot;[14]
<P>
In other words, politics, not science, is driving the debate.
 An honest look at the evidence of 70 years of psychology, therapeutic
research, the history of the entire human race, and the moral
codes of all the great civilizations tells us that homosexuality
is not only universally discouraged as learned behavior but can
also be temporary, controlled, or even changed.
<P>
Given the well-documented, socially and medically destructive
effects of homosexual behavior on individuals, families and communities,
compassion and prudence should lead us to discourage any cultural
promotion of homosexuality as a moral and normal activity.  Media
reports indicate that homosexual experimentation among high schoolers
has increased considerably in recent years as schools have presented
homosexual activity as normal, desirable and even &quot;cool.&quot;[15]
 Sexually vulnerable young people are being steered onto a behavioral
path that they and their families will sorely regret and which
will even cost some of them their lives at an early age.
<P>
Homosexual behavior, like other destructive vices, can be learned
-- and unlearned.  Under no circumstances should it be promoted,
particularly through misrepresentation of scientific studies.

<P>
Federal arts funding, much like the welfare system, has created
a class of beneficiaries who are hostile to conservative, pro-family
causes.  Recipients of federal aid all too often become cheerleaders
for big government, the family's natural enemy.  Big government
strips families of their incomes through confiscatory taxation
and diminishes their autonomy through intrusive social welfare
and educational programs designed to wean children from their
parents (and parental values) at earlier and earlier ages. 
<P>
The same taxpayers who suffer the indignity of seeing their own
earnings used by bureaucrats to undermine their families also
pay for a federally-subsidized artistic and media elite to cheer
on their tormentors: the Corporation for Public Broadcasting,
the National Endowment for the Arts and the National Endowment
for the Humanities.
<P>
It is long past time that the federal arts and humanities endowments
be de-authorized and de-funded.  Spawned during the 1960s' Great
Society years, these agencies, despite whatever good they have
done, have damaged American culture, ripped off the taxpayer,
waged war on the family and religion, and politicized the academy
and the arts.   
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CURRENT PROPOSALS TO TRIM THE ENDOWMENTS ARE ILL-ADVISED AND
COUNTER-PRODUCTIVE.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Merely cutting the budgets and stretching out the life of the
agencies will cause more mischief.  When Proposition 13 was enacted
into law in California, hostile government officials began cutting
back on essentials, such as police and fire departments, leaving
the waste and fat untouched.  The object lesson to the voters
was that challenging government growth meant the onset of anarchy.
 Similarly, if the federal budgets for public broadcasting and
the arts and humanities are merely reduced, the truly offensive
offerings will be the last to be de-funded.  Vengeful bureaucrats
will trim where it will cause the most pain and where patrons
would complain most loudly.  A couple of years ago, when Congress
stalled in passing an appropriations bill for the federal government,
the Smithsonian closed its 
doors, as did some national parklands, enraging taxpaying visitors.
 But the long-obsolete federal Helium Reserve suffered no loss
of gas.  Again, the message to the voters was:  we will punish
you if you don't lobby your elected representatives to reinstate
our funding -- with increases. 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>SOME POLITICIANS THINK THEY CAN BUY PEACE BY APPEASING THEIR
OPPONENT. INSTEAD, THEY CREATE A HARDENED ENEMY.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
In terms of the federal endowments, the political price is actually
higher for merely cutting instead of eliminating them.  Recipients
of federal aid are the natural foes of budget cutters and will
continue to use their taxpayer-provided subsidies to wage political
war on them.  Hundreds of arts organizations are being lobbied
to bring pressure on individual members of Congress to preserve
art pork in their own districts.
<P>
A case in point is a letter from Independent Television Service
Executive Director James Yee to public broadcasting advocates.
 The taxpayer-supported (and, therefore, in no way independent)
ITVS was created in 1988 to provide new programming for public
broadcasting.  Yee urges his &quot;independent colleagues&quot;
to &quot;become involved in future efforts to drum up support
for public broadcasting, especially with your local and national
elected officials....&quot;  Yee warns that &quot;an extensive
informational outreach campaign will have to be waged.&quot; 
Such campaigns cost money, but are easier to mount when federal
subsidies pour in to handle other costs.  
<P>
The current House plan to phase out the endowments serves only
to give welfare artists some time to restore their subsidies.
 Indeed, subsidy supporters have acknowledged, through their accord,
that the phase-out plan is their best hope for saving the agencies
and returning to business as usual.[1] 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CUTTING BACK THE ENDOWMENTS WILL NOT LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT REFORM.</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Congress repeatedly has slapped NEA on the wrist, and still the
NEA sends money to The Kitchen, Franklin Furnace and other centers
of blatantly offensive &quot;performance&quot; art that denigrates
religion, families and traditional morality.  Indeed, a <I>Washington
Post</I> critic observed recently that the 1993 Biennial Exhibition
at the NEA-funded Whitney Museum was &quot;one long whinging [sic]
whine of political correctness, suggesting as it did that the
only art that counts is art produced by lesbians, inhabitants
of barrios, sufferers of AIDS and others on the margin.&quot;
 Two years later, at the 1995 Biennial, &quot;[h]omosexuality's
still hot, especially the kinds involving punctures of the flesh,
accessories of leather, bondage and cross-dressing, but so too
are the subtlest of painterly abstraction.  Nuances and nipple-rings
are both themes of this exhibit, if it can be said to have any
themes at all.&quot;[2]
<P>
NEA chairwoman Jane Alexander has boasted of using the endowment
to promote homosexual themes[3] and has even defended a public bloodletting
by an HIV-infected  performer at an NEA-subsidized venue.[4]  Despite
many assurances by past and present NEA officials that excellence
and artistic merit are the criteria for grant allocation, this
is clearly not the case.  More than $9 billion in private giving
sustains arts in communities all over America.[5] The NEA's $175
million is important more for its symbolism than for the actual
dollars involved.  An NEA grant validates an artist, and the government
should not be putting its imprimatur on much of the anti-family,
anti-religious propaganda that counter-culture activists brazenly
categorize as art.  The entertainment industry has revenues in
the tens of billions of dollars  each year.  Time-Warner alone
took in $15.9 billion during 1994.  Clearly, Hollywood is in a
better position to subsidize the endowments for arts and humanities
than US taxpayers who struggling to get out from under $200 billion
in annual deficits.
<P>
<CENTER><H3> CORPORATION FOR PUBLIC BROADCASTING</H3></CENTER>
<P>
In 1967, President Lyndon Johnson signed the Public Broadcasting
Act creating CPB.  The agency oversees the Public Broadcasting
Service, which was formed in 1969, a year before the creation
of National Public Radio.  CPB's total appropriation in fiscal
1969 was $5 million.  In 1992, Congress re-authorized CPB with
a three-year, $1.1 billion appropriation.  By 1993, CPB's annual
federal appropriation was $318.6 million, which rose to $386 million
for fiscal 1995.  There are 349 public TV stations and 200 TV
grantees receiving CPB funding.[6]  PBS claims to reach 1.8 million
teachers and 29.5 million students through educational programming
and services, and 97 million Americans overall each week with
some PBS programming.[7] National Public Radio is carried on 595
stations, and CPB awards money to 391 public radio grantees. 
<P>
The basis for CPB's existence has always been an anti-free market
philosophy.   Proponents have said that the market is incapable
of providing good programming, so the government must step in
and do it, to the tune of hundreds of millions of dollars annually.[8]
 Yet the shows that register high ratings on PBS turn out to be
the very programs that the public perceives to be excellent: <I>Sesame
Street</I>, <I>Barney and Friends</I>, <I>The MacNeil-Lehrer NewsHour</I>,
and <I>Masterpiece Theatre</I>, for example.  All of these shows
are generating more than sufficient revenue from sponsors, donors,
grants and product marketing.  They do not need taxpayer subsidies.
<P>
But there is other CPB programming that probably would fail to
attract a sufficient viewing/listening audience or donor support.
 These programs are so bad that their creators must dig into the
public purse.  Subsidizing bad art is a donor's prerogative, of
course -- unless the &quot;donor&quot; is the taxpayer, who has
no choice.  (For detailed examples, see FRC's Policy paper entitled
&quot;Public Broadcasting?  Let's Free Big Bird.&quot;)
<P>
<CENTER><H3> NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE ARTS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
NEA was established in 1965 when President Johnson signed the
National Foundation on the Arts and Humanities Act, which also
created the National Endowment for the Humanities.  NEA's initial
budget was $2.5 million, but grew over the years to about $175
million annually (fiscal 1995 appropriation is $167.7 million).
 A fiscal 1995 rescission bill, HR 1158, would reduce 1995 funding
to $162.5 million.[9] All told, NEA has spent more than $3 billion
of tax money in its 30-year history.   
<P>
The plan approved by the House Economic and Educational Opportunities
Committee on May 10, 1995 would reauthorize NEA through fiscal
1998 but eliminate funding in fiscal 1999.  Funding would be reduced
by 40 percent in fiscal 1996, another 40 percent in fiscal 1997
and by 20 percent in fiscal 1998. The NEA would get no money in
fiscal 1999.[10]
<P>
NEA would also face a $5 million cap on administrative expenses,
which would entail an 80 percent reduction in budget for staff.
 Currently, NEA spends $24 million annually on administration.[11]
<P>
Beginning in 1996, grants to individuals would be eliminated,
with all grants going to institutions.  Eighty percent of annual
appropriations to the state art councils would be in the form
of block grants.[12]
<P>
A Senate bill (S 856) introduced by James Jeffords (R-VT) and
co-sponsored by Nancy Kassebaum (R-KS), Alan Simpson (R-WY), Edward
Kennedy (D-MA) and Claiborne Pell (D-RI) would reauthorize NEA
for five years (FY 1996-2000) at gradually reduced funding levels.
 Forty percent of the NEA's program budget would go to &quot;partnership&quot;
grants with the states, local and regional groups; 40% more would
go toward organizations of &quot;national significance;&quot;
a final 20% would go to direct grants to organizations, such as
theaters or museums, and to individual artists. 
<P>
Most significantly, the bill keeps intact much of the current
peer review system, in which panelists award federal tax dollars
to their friends and associates.  It also locks in place the conditions
under which the NEA would reject a grant over &quot;obscenity.&quot;
 An artwork would have to be found legally obscene in a court
of law before the NEA could move to recover funds.  Given that
a grant from the NEA automatically gives an artwork &quot;artistic&quot;
significance no matter how offensive, the provision is meaningless
in terms of curbing abuses of taxpayer funding.  
<P>
The bill also directs the current NEA director to give &quot;Distinguished
Lifetime Service for the Arts&quot; awards to &quot;each of the
former Chairpersons of the Endowment.&quot;  This means that federal
taxpayers would honor, among others, John Frohnmayer, the NEA
chief whose tenure ended when he was forced by President Bush
to resign over NEA's continued funding of anti-Christian and pornographic
works. 
<P>
Finally, the bill creates an entirely new federal agency to nationalize
standards for all public libraries and museums.  The &quot;Institute
for Museum and Library Services&quot; would be authorized for
five years, beginning with a budget of $75 million in fiscal 1996
&quot;and such sums as may be necessary for each of the 4 succeeding
fiscal years,&quot; and would have grant-making authority.  This
is a potentially lucrative source to be abused by well-connected
left-wing groups like the American Library Association, would
give the federal government potential control over the nation's
local public libraries, and would do to libraries and museums
what the NEA has done to art -- redefine it using federal tax
dollars to further a radical cultural and political agenda. 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>NATIONAL ENDOWMENT FOR THE HUMANITIES</H3></CENTER>
<P>
NEH was established at the same time NEA was born, in 1965.  The
fiscal year 1966 budget was $5.9 million, and the agency had a
staff of 13.[13] The agency expanded over the years until it reached
a budget of $177 million in fiscal 1995.  
<P>
Officials at the NEH are hardly contrite for sponsoring a widely-denounced
set of national history standards that, among other things, emphasize
the role of the Ku Klux Klan (17 references) and exalt Soviet
advances in space while ignoring Albert Einstein, the Wright Brothers,
Paul Revere, Robert E. Lee and the American moon landing.[14] The
NEH also specializes in promoting cultural relativism, feminist
studies and other Marxist and neo-Marxist theoretical quagmires
on the nation's campuses.[15]
<P>
The current plan approved by the House Economic and Educational
Opportunities Committee would reauthorize NEH with an annual 20
percent funding reduction through fiscal 1998 starting with the
1995 appropriation of $172 million (which includes a recent House-approved
$5 million rescission).  No funding would be allocated to NEH
in 1999.  The 5 percent cap for administrative expenses would
also apply to NEH, as well as the termination of direct federal
grants to individuals (scholars would continue to receive grants
through recipient organizations such as universities).  Eighty
percent of appropriations would go to state humanities councils
in the form of block grants.  Senate bill S 856 would reauthorize
NEH for five years at gradually reduced funding levels, beginning
with $168.6 million in fiscal year 1996.  Each state would get
a minimum of $200,000 in funding each fiscal year.  Grants would
continue to be made to &quot;groups, individuals, and State agencies
or entities.&quot;  
<P>
<CENTER><H3>SUMMARY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Attempts to curry favor with the welfare broadcast media and arts
groups are useless and only embolden the political enemies of
budget cutters.  So, we must ask budget-cutting Members of Congress:
why give the very people who will never love you enough subsidies
to stay in business so they can continue taking shots at you?
 The federal arts subsidies must end once and for all.

What follows is a commentary on the &quot;Draft Declaration and
Draft Programme of Action&quot; prepared by United Nations staff
for the &quot;World Summit for Social Development&quot; scheduled to
occur in Copenhagen March 6-12, 1995.  This commentary is indicative
of problems found in the document, which runs some 55 pages in
typescript, and which addresses, in generally broad language,
a wide range of social issues and concerns in member countries
of the United Nations.  This commentary will be updated after
Copenhagen to discuss the final language of the Declaration and
Programme of Action.    
<P>
<center><h3>INTRODUCTION</h3></center>
<P>
Following the United Nations and its swamp of commissions, declarations,
and conferences can be a debilitating experience.  The situation
is compounded by the rapidly growing basket of UN documents and
observances devoted to such topics as the family (International
Year of the Family, 1994), population and development (International
Conference on Population and Development, 1994), social development
(World Summit for Social Development, 1995), and women (Fourth
World Conference on Women, 1995).    
<P>
Thematically and administratively separate, these observances
and conferences tend to overlap in subject matter.  This is due
in part to the ambiguity of mission in many UN agencies and documents,
and the tendency of recent UN meetings to produce &quot;smorgasbord&quot;
documents that say in 1,000 words what more succinct documents
(like those of the American founding) say in 10.  Thus, for example,
the bitter dispute over abortion at the ICPD in Cairo in 1994
is likely to be reprised at the Beijing women's conference and
its preliminary meetings.              
<P>
An additional factor promoting these disputes is the continued
presence and agitation within the UN structure of international
lobbies (some with economic ties to the UN, and others privately
funded) devoted to particular agendas.  The United Nations Charter
(for example, Chapter X, Article 71, relating to the Economic
and  Social Council) makes specific provision for consultation
by the UN and its constituent councils and agencies &quot;with
nongovernmental organizations [NGOs] which are concerned with
matters within its competence.&quot;  
<P>
The Economic and Social Council (ECOSOC) is responsible for conducting
all events in connection with the World Summit for Social Development.
<P>
NGOs vary in the amount and type of energy they devote to UN activities.
 Essentially, they  are private, charitable (i.e., tax exempt)
or advocacy organizations that are accredited by the UN  to lobby
at particular conferences and the preparatory meetings leading
up to them.  In the context of Cairo and Beijing, NGOs such as
the International Planned Parenthood Federation (IPPF)  and the
Women's Environmental and Developmental Organization (WEDO) have
exerted continuous pressure, with considerable internal UN support,
for the drafting of documents that  strongly endorse abortion,
the redefinition of the family, and other radical causes.    
<P>
Preparatory meetings leading up to designated international conferences
are called, in UN lingo, &quot;prepcoms.&quot;  Major prepcoms
for both the Cairo population conference and the Beijing women's
summit have been held months in advance at the United Nations
headquarters in New York.  The prepcoms are run by &quot;Preparatory
Committees,&quot; composed of representatives of member nations
of the UN.  In between sessions of the prepcom, the Committee
chairman, with  the assistance of the UN Secretariat, may be tasked
with such responsibilities as the drafting of  declarations and
programmes of action.  The periods between prepcoms are invaluable,
especially to New Yorkbased NGOs, as opportunities to lobby UN
officials and to influence the development of conference documents.
<P>
With respect to the World Summit for Social Development, a second
session of the prepcom  was held in New York from August 22 to
September 2, 1994.  At that session, the committee  tasked its
chairman to prepare a declaration for consideration in Copenhagen.
 The UN Secretariat was charged by the committee to prepare a
programme of action for Copenhagen.  The analysis that follows
discusses the draft declaration and programme of action of November
22, 1994, as prepared by the chairman and the Secretariat.  As
of this writing, a final draft is in the process of  being completed
for submission to the summit in Copenhagen.    
<P>
That the United Nations is an incessant document mill has become
increasingly obvious.  The  November 22 draft, as discussed below,
incorporates a wealth of vague and contradictory ideas,  not the
least of which is the situational irony of a massive United Nations
bureaucracy proclaiming itself the savior of decentralized government.
 But, the question may be asked, are not most UN documents merely
recommendations, without the force of law?  Indeed, the design
of the  Economic and Social Council announced in the UN Charter
is precisely that of a body constituted to hold meetings and make
recommendations.  Article 62 defines the powers of ECOSOC as 
follows:                 
<P>
1.  The Economic and Social Council may make or initiate studies
and reports with respect to international economic, social, cultural,
educational, health, and related matters and may make recommendations
with respect to any such matters to the General Assembly, to the
Members of the United Nations, and to the specialized (UN) agencies
concerned.                  
<P>
2.  [ECOSOC] may make recommendations for the purpose of promoting
respect for, and observance of, human rights and fundamental freedoms
for all.                  
<P>
3.  [ECOSOC] may prepare draft conventions for submission to the
General Assembly ...      
<P>
4.  [ECOSOC] may call, in accordance with rules prescribed by
the United Nations, international conferences on matters falling
within its competence.  This brief Article summarizes the activity
of the ECOSOC with respect to the World Summit  for Social Development
 with one exception.  That is, none of the documents of the Summit
 amount to a convention, a legal instrument that requires the
approval of the General Assembly  and the submission to members
states for ratification.  Examples of such conventions are the
Convention on the Rights of the Child and the Convention for the
Elimination of All Forms of Discrimination against Women.  It
is important to realize that the language developed at Copenhagen
for its nonbinding declaration and programme of action will thereby
acquire momentum within the UN system, and perhaps form the basis
for future conventions with potentially legally binding force.
<P>
<center><h3>WEDO AND THE GLEN COVE CONCLAVE</h3></center>
<P>
It is this possibility that motivates the activities of the most
intensely involved NGOs, such as  the Women's Environmental and
Development Organization (WEDO).  Former Democratic Congresswoman
Bella Abzug, a privatecitizen member of the US delegation to the
Cairo population conference, is the leader of WEDO.  An uncompromising
feminist and abortion advocate, Abzug  represented WEDO at a November
29 to December 2, 1994 planning meeting for the Beijing women's
conference.  This global strategy meeting was held in Glen Cove,
New York.  While  focused primarily on Beijing, the meeting included
working groups focused on devising strategies and language for
the whole basket of UN conferences and documents in progress.
 In that context, many of its recommendations are instructive.
<P>
The Glen Cove working group on the Copenhagen document criticized
it for its focus &quot;on the  family as the basic unit&quot;
of society, and for overlooking &quot;the changing configuration
of the  family.&quot;  The working group called for women's housework
to be remunerated, for a &quot;universal  adequate annual guaranteed
income,&quot; and &quot;payment for childcare.&quot;  It also
called for the adoption of a tax on &quot;international financial
transactions&quot; and &quot;taxation of transnational corporations&quot;
to  finance social development, presumably under UN auspices.
 (In this regard, the November 22 Copenhagen draft recommends
that the General Assembly task the ECOSOC to study such  proposals.)
<P>
The working group proposed a number of changes to the Copenhagen
draft (See full text of  the November 22 draft in the Appendix).
 The changes include a subtle call for changes in electoral systems
to establish a &quot;mechanism for women's ... equitable representation
at all levels of  the political process.&quot;  Other language
developed at Glen Cove suggests this &quot;mechanism&quot; would
 include gender quotas for public office.  In addition, the working
group proposed that the  Copenhagen document ensure &quot;that
effective laws and agencies exist to prevent and eliminate  discrimination
on the basis of gender [and] sexual orientation ...&quot;; &quot;that
women and adolescents  have access to good quality, comprehensive
health care, including the full range of reproductive  and sexual
health care services, including access to safe abortion ...&quot;;
and that the draft's  language regarding &quot;family as the basic
unit of society&quot; be replaced with references to &quot;households
and families&quot; as &quot;important economic units.&quot;  
<P>
The Glen Cove working group recommendations for Beijing are also
revealing.  The group  called for the &quot;recognition of sexual
orientation as a fundamental human right within the context  of
the expanding definition of the family.&quot;  It also called
for &quot;sexual and reproductive education to [sic] boys and
girls&quot;; affirmative action to assure that &quot;governments
... achieve 50% representation in elected and appointed office
by women by the year 2005,&quot; to be achieved by &quot;setting
 targets or quota systems&quot;; and encouraging &quot;activities
aimed at changing traditional decisionmaking roles in the family.&quot;
 One specific action recommended by the working group is that
the UN Secretariat prepare a &quot;gender balance rating card&quot;
to be published at the beginning of each session of the General
Assembly &quot;rating and ranking Member States on the basis of
numbers, positions, titles, race and ethnicity of women participating
in their Missions to [the] UN ...&quot;      
<P>
Other working groups dealt with the aftermath of the Cairo population
conference and discussed ways to expand the advances made in promoting
the notion of &quot;reproductive health and  decisionmaking&quot;
as aspects of fundamental human rights, including possibly adolescents
and  single people.  The goal remains to assure that abortion
is included in future UN documents &quot;as a  basic method of
fertility regulation and as an essential part of reproductive
health services and  rights.&quot;    
<P>
Finally, Working Group 2 at Glen Cove developed a program of lobbying
and other activities  to be undertaken between the Copenhagen
and Beijing meetings.  The program is entitled the  &quot;Women's
Global Campaign, 180 Days, 180 Ways.&quot;  The campaign's goal
is to extend the statements of belief and programs of action of
the Glen Cove coalition to a wider network of women,  NGOs and
&quot;disenfranchised people.&quot;  Expanded usage of online
computer networks is  envisioned.  All of this is in keeping with
a recognition that the topdown organization of social  movements
by such bodies as the United Nations are doomed to failure if
it cannot enlist the  support of a grassroots movement in member
nations.                                      
<P>
The Glen Cove conclave amounted to a gathering of radical feminists
rebuffed politically in the  United States but rewarded in the
closed environment of New York and the United Nations,  funded
and supported by a variety of such populist funding sources as
the Ford, and Rockefeller  Foundations, and abetted by the swelling
throng of UN and Clinton Administration bureaucrats  dedicated
to adopting the sexual revolution on a global scale.  With each
new UN conference and  document, they have another opportunity
to move the international clock in the direction of their  Brave
New World.    
<P>
<center><h3>ANALYSIS OF NOVEMBER 22 COPENHAGEN DRAFT</h3></center>
<P>
All page numbers refer to the November 22, 1994 draft declaration
and &quot;programme of  action.&quot;  The actual text of the
draft declaration reviewed begins on page 3 and concludes at page
 55.  Most paragraphs in the declaration are identifiable by numbers
or letter designations in the  text, and these designations are
used in this commentary.  Language that is objectionable is  indicated
by brackets [ ].  Language to be added or substituted for objectionable
language is indicated in bold.    
<P>
Suggested modifications follow.    
<P>
Page 3, paragraph 2.  Modify line two to read &quot;profound social
problems specially poverty,  unemployment, family breakup and
social exclusion.&quot;  The phenomenon of family dissolution
is  a virtually universal concomitant of development; indeed,
it is especially pronounced in the most highly developed nations
as individuals tend to supplant family (agrarian) units as the
primary  sources of production.  Asserting the problem of family
breakup at the outset of the document  will serve to buttress
family preservation as an essential component of development throughout
 the declaration.    
<P>
Page 3, paragraph 4.  &quot;Peace and security&quot; are insufficient
descriptors of national aspirations.   This paragraph should be
modified to read &quot;the achievement and maintenance of conditions
of  freedom, peace and security with and between ... cannot be
attained in the absence of conditions of freedom, peace and security.&quot;
 This language is needed to express the basic condition  of political
freedom as the key to economic and human progress.  Conditions
of &quot;peace and  security,&quot; at least in the military sense,
prevailed in Soviet Russia and numerous authoritarian  regimes
of East Asia, Africa, and the Americas.  Peace and security alone
are insufficient conditions for human wellbeing and development.
<P>
Page 4, paragraph 11, line 2.  The word &quot;contradiction&quot;
should be modified to read &quot;contrast.&quot;  This distinction
may not carry over well in other languages besides English, but
it is important that the document not be read to assert that in
every case the expansion of prosperity occurs for some at the
expense of the poverty of others.   All wealth is not the product
of exploitation.  Were it so, development by definition would
be a zero sum game in which no real improvement in overall global
living standards is possible.  The declaration must reject this
notion in principle. &quot;Contrast&quot; better suggests the
morally troubling existence of stark inequities in the distribution
of the world's basic resources.    
<P>
Page 4, paragraph 12, line 3,  The word &quot;people&quot; or
&quot;peoples&quot; appears to be missing after  &quot;Globalization
also permits.&quot;    
<P>
Page 4, paragraph 14, subparagraph a, line 2, add the following
language:  &quot;the gap between rich and poor, aggravated by
cultural factors and social mores, has increased.&quot;  This
addition recognizes that the economic gap between rich and poor
is not purely an economic phenomenon. In the United States, for
example, families headed by a single parent are five times more
likely to be poor than are families headed by two parents.  Casual
attitudes regarding divorce and sexual activity outside of marriage
have fueled these inequities.    
<P>
Page 6, paragraph (h).  Language is needed here to suggest, as
economically as possible, that &quot;family,&quot; while expressed
in different cultural and legal terms in many countries, nonetheless
has an archetypal and crosscultural meaning.  If we can speak
of &quot;equity and equality&quot; between men and women at various
points in the document, we can also make clear that the family
is an archetypal arrangement of man and woman, and their offspring,
and others related to them by  blood, marriage and adoption. 
<P>
Page 7, paragraph 21.  This paragraph needs to be strengthened
to include recognition of due  principles of subsidiarity and
of the possibility that government, even when wellmeaning, may
 overreach and become the principal obstacle to the attainment
of development.  Thus, language  should be added which states:
 We acknowledge the [primary] special responsibility of  governments,
particularly those units of government closest to and most accountable
to the  people, to attain these goals.  We also acknowledge that
they cannot be achieved by government  alone, and that, indeed,
governments may hinder development by overinvolvement in and 
disruption of healthy social and economic activity.    
<P>
Page 8, commitment 2, subparagraph b.  Modify to read:  &quot;the
provision of primary health care  and the promotion of reproductive
health and voluntary and informed family planning for  married
couples, reinforcement of the social and legal significance of
the archetypal family unit, safe drinking water ...&quot;  Addition
of &quot;voluntary&quot; is necessary to affirm the right of couples
to reject the &quot;provision&quot; of family planning; reference
to the marital couple is a natural correlative  of the term &quot;family&quot;
in family planning.  The role of the dissolution of the family
in fostering  intractable poverty is described above.    
<P>
Page 8, commitment 2, subparagraph c.  &quot;access to land, credit&quot;
should be modified to read  &quot;opportunity to acquire land,
credit ...&quot;  The emphasis must be on expanded opportunities,
and  the United Nations should make clear that it is not endorsing
policies of expropriation and confiscation of lawfully acquired
and owned resources.                                        
<P>
Page 9, commitment 4, subparagraph a.  &quot;Promote basic values
of respect for pluralism and  diversity, tolerance and responsibility,
political and personal freedom, nonviolence and solidarity ...&quot;
<P>
Page 10, commitment 4, subparagraph e:  &quot;central role of
the archetypal family.&quot; 
<P>
Page 10, commitment 5, subparagraph b:  &quot;Establish policies
[objectives and measurable goals] to  enhance gender balance.&quot;
 This language clearly stipulates the formulation of quotas for
political representation of women, presumably created and enforced
by the United Nations and its instrumentalities.  As such, this
language is at war with the declaration's expressed commitment
to respect for national sovereignty and decentralization of developmental
initiatives.  Moreover, it is  false in principle.  The key to
equity and equality is opportunity.  Government policies should
 indeed guarantee such opportunities, and those governments that
do so will reap the richest rewards in diverse and freely chosen
representation.  Republican forms of government are incompatible
with quotas, and republican forms are precisely those that have
proven most resilient in  expanding political participation by
all citizens.    
<P>
Page 10, commitment 5, subparagraph c.  In this context, there
is no reason to exclude men from protections against &quot;exploitation,
abuse and violence.&quot;  Violence against entrepreneurs in the
 United States, for example, frequently takes the form of attacks
upon disfavored ethnic groups  engaged in lawful business activity
in the cities.  Prejudice and violence against citizens of foreign
extraction is also common in many countries.  Both of these types
of phenomena are severe hindrances to the development of small
enterprises in economically depressed communities.  The selective
nature of much of this violence against men certifies it as an
issue of equity and equality.  Therefore, the subparagraph should
read:  &quot;Take effective measures to eliminate all kinds of
 exploitation, abuse and violence against men and women, with
particular attention to  immigrants, [women] refugees, and [women]
noncombatants in situations of armed conflict.&quot;    
<P>
Page 10, commitment 5, subparagraph d.  &quot;Encourage the ratification,
[removal of reservations,]  and implementation of all provisions
...&quot;  The United Nations is to be expected to encourage the
 ratification of international instruments approved by the General
Assembly.  Reservations, however, are a critical mechanism by
which sovereign nations adduce understandings that protect  important
cultural and legal values and policies.  In this particular regard,
reservations in many  nations preserve understandings regarding
special protections for women and mothers, and for  their offspring,
born and unborn.  The language as written is once again at war
with the declaration's commitment to respect national sovereignty.
 It is intrusive and should be modified as noted.    
<P>
Page 11, subparagraph d.  &quot;Increase official development
assistance, both in total and for social  programs, without coercion
or reducing the resources allocated to other sectors.&quot;  This
language is needed to address the continuing problem of assistance
linkage:  the withholding or threatened withholding of assistance
funds from nations which do not conform national policies to donor
nation's preferences in such areas as population control.  Addition
of coercion or reinforces the declaration's commitment to national
sovereignty.    
<P>
Page 11, commitment 7, subparagraph a.  &quot;Protect basic social
programs and expenditures, in  particular, those affecting the
weakest and most vulnerable segments of society, from acrosstheboard
budget reductions, while eliminating inefficient spending and
perverse incentives against work and family formation, and increasing
the quality of social expenditures.&quot;    
<P>
Page 12, commitment 8, subparagraph d.  &quot;Ensure that taxation
systems are fair, [and] economically efficient, and nonpunitive,&quot;
<P>
Page 16, paragraph 4.  &quot;Social development is also clearly
linked to the development of peace, freedom, stability and security
...  to promote social development requires a reorientation of
values, objectives, and priorities, in order to strengthen or
reform existing institutions and  policies.  Human dignity, [equity]
equal opportunity, freedom  and social justice must be ...&quot;
 The rationale for each of these suggested changes is outlined
in similar contexts above.  Note that the strengthening of all
existing institutions should clearly not be the objective of the
United  Nations in this declaration.  Many national institutions,
both private and public are, in fact,  destructive of human wellbeing.
 The declaration itself calls for reform of multilateral lending
 policies to the most debtridden nations.  No one, for example,
should support strengthening of  the UNFPA, which has exhibited
warm relations with national governments employing population
policies deeply destructive of human life and human freedom. 
<P>
Page 16, paragraph 5.  &quot;This same global community is threatened
by environmental degradation, epidemics, various forms of intolerance,
attacks and stresses upon the archetypal family unit, sexual exploitation
and the drug trade, violence and criminality . . . &quot;    
<P>
Page 16, paragraph 7.  &quot;Gender equity and equality of opportunity
[and the full participation of  women] in all economic, social
and political activities is essential.&quot;  Besides being redundant
as  written, this phrase could be abused to discourage governmental
policies that protect full or parttime homemakers and that permit
them to freely choose the terms of their participation in  economic
and other activities.  The right of families to establish their
own patterns of workfamily  involvement must be affirmed.  Another
alternative here is to change the word &quot;full&quot; to &quot;open.&quot;
  Ask yourself this question:  which nation of the world has the
fullest participation of women in  economic activities?  Clearly,
it is the People's Republic of China, with its cadres and worker
 brigades.  Free nations typically exhibit much more diverse and
complex arrangements, with equality of opportunity guaranteed
and norms of participation left to individual and family choice
and capability.  This is the more socially just and free condition.
<P>
Page 17, bulleted items:  Add &quot;a strengthened role for the
archetypal family, churches and  private associations for selfbetterment;&quot;
and &quot;public policies that discourage illegal and/or  selfdestructive
behaviors that shorten lifespan and/or reduce productivity.&quot;
 The latter  language should be unexceptionable; it is aimed at
such practices as smoking, drug abuse, and  activities that transmit
HIV and other diseases.  The impact of these factors on human
lifespan, productivity, and development is clearly massive.  
 
<P>
Page 18, paragraph 11, add a subparagraph e:  Promoting the expansion
of political freedom in the context of transitions to market economies,
and directing development assistance to smallscale and private
ventures that maximize individual creativity and initiative. 
<P>
Page 19, paragraph 13, subparagraph e:  &quot;... and ensuring
that subsidy systems benefit people in  poverty, avoid incentives
to nonproductive lifestyles and family breakup, and reduce disparities.&quot;
As noted above, family breakup is a key determinant and perpetuator
of poverty; subsidy  (welfare) programs should avoid designs that
punish intact families and reward illegitimacy.    
<P>
Page 19, paragraph 13, subparagraph g:  &quot;Assisting developing
canters and countries in transition to establish efficient, nonpunitive
and fair tax collection systems.&quot;    
<P>
Page 20, paragraph 14, subparagraph a:  &quot;Ensuring that institutions
 public, private, and  natural, including the family unit  and
agencies responsible for the design and implementation ...&quot;
 This language eliminates any possible bias toward governmental
institutions as  opposed to private and natural institutions engaged
in critical social development, primarily the family, business,
and religious denominations.    
<P>
Page 20, paragraph 14, subparagraph b:  The phrase &quot;full
transparency ... for all ... private  institutions&quot; raises
important questions for private associations, including churches,
which are  generally accorded far more freedom of action than
governmental and quasigovernmental  institutions that operate
with public funds.  This subparagraph should be amended to include
 language respecting the privacy rights of voluntary and religious
institutions except insofar as  necessary to meet generally accepted
standards of accountability under the laws of each nation.   Without
such language, private institutions are vulnerable to treatment
as publicly owned entities.  Therefore, add &quot;Nothing in this
subparagraph shall be construed to diminish the right of  voluntary
and religious institutions to appropriate privacy protections
consistent with generally accepted standards of accountability
under the law.&quot;    
<P>
Page 20, paragraph 14, subparagraph c:  Throughout the document,
no attempt is made to define  &quot;discrimination&quot; or to
limit in any way its application to only those characteristics
of persons  rightly regarded as &quot;neutral&quot;   ethnicity,
national origin, creed, gender, disability, etc.  It may be  better
to leave this term undefined, on the presumption that prevailing
national policies, which  generally protect only neutral characteristics,
are what is meant.  Nonetheless, the recent action in the European
Parliament to protect homosexual partnerships, and US initiatives
to expand &quot;domestic partnership&quot; legislation offer some
argument for defining &quot;discrimination&quot; here to mean
only the protection of neutral characteristics.  Possible language:
 &quot;Eliminating de jure  discrimination, while [ developing]
encouraging educational programmes and media campaigns  aimed
at eliminating de facto discrimination against persons based on
race, sex, national  origin, religion, political affiliation,
disability, or other characteristics unrelated to character or
performance.    
<P>
Page 20, paragraph 14, subparagraph d:  [reflect better]  better
reflects    
<P>
Page 20, paragraph 14, subparagraph f:  &quot;Making political
and social processes inclusive of all  lawabiding members of society
...&quot;  Many nationstates exclude criminals from access to
certain political and social processes.  The phrase as written,
like much of the declaration, is  susceptible of widely varying
interpretation, but as written it appears open to abuse.  The
best course of action may be to delete the phrase &quot;inclusive
of all members of society and&quot;, since &quot;respecting political
pluralism and cultural diversity&quot; sufficiently describes
an open political  system.    
<P>
Page 20, paragraph 15, subparagraph c:  &quot;ensuring that all
obstacles to full equity and equality  between women and men are
removed in all private and public institutions of society.&quot;
 The  dangers in this language are obvious.  The United Nations
is hereby committing itself to eliminating anything it regards
as inequities between men and women in private institutions. 
If  churches and parachurch organizations are excepted from this
proscription, that fact is not  mentioned.  These issues have
created tremendous friction and debate in the United States and
 elsewhere in the developed world.  Most US &quot;equal rights&quot;
statutes have been limited in their  application to &quot;public
accommodations,&quot; a term which embraces many private institutions
that  hold themselves forward as open to the public, but excludes
those, such as churches and other  religiously affiliated institutions,
which impose membership requirements based on creed.  Most US
statutes, with one or two exceptions, also exempt private, nonpublicly
supported clubs and  associations (e.g., the Boy Scouts, the YMCA).
 This principle should be protected here.  &quot;Public accommodations&quot;
is not a term common to UN documents.  I recommend revision to
read &quot;all  [private and] public and publicly accessible institutions
of society&quot;.    
<P>
Page 21, paragraph 16, subparagraph a:  The language as written
suggests governmental  interference with the media to ensure socially
constructive attitudes.  The goal is laudable, but its implementation
by government is violative of free speech standards and guarantees.
 The purposes  of government in this regard are better served
by policies that encourage the development of a diverse body of
mass media.  Increasing the body of media voices, not stifling
an errant few, is a proper sphere for government action.  It is
akin to averting the growth of monopolies in the economic sphere.
 If language stating this objective cannot be obtained, change
&quot;Ensuring&quot; to  &quot;Encouraging&quot; to leave this
objective in the realm of the bully pulpit.    
<P>
Page 21, paragraph 16, subparagraph c:  &quot;including on gender,
family and cultural issues ...&quot;  The paragraph as written
is narrow and excludes needed improvements in data collection
on  issues of family structure and culture.  For example, international
data preliminarily examined by scholars at the American Enterprise
Institute suggests a close linkage between infant mortality and
 family structure.  Gender analysis is one of only many relevant
possible areas for improvement.    
<P>
Page 21, paragraph 17, subparagraph d:  &quot;... policies to
combat terrorism, organized crime,  sexual exploitation and drug
trafficking.&quot;  This additional language gives higher visibility
and  priority to efforts to combat the exploitation of minors
in South Asia and elsewhere around the  world where the international
sex and pornography trade are officially ignored or inadequately
 resisted.    
<P>
Page 22, paragraph 20:  The personal dimension of poverty is excluded
from this analysis of the  origins of poverty.  It is most easily
addressed by modifying the first sentence of the paragraph to
read &quot;and cultural and personal values.&quot;  Without more,
however, this entire section focuses too  heavily on &quot;political
and economic structures&quot; and too lightly on personality structures
such as  selfdiscipline, deferral of gratification, honesty and
hard work.  To address this problem, add  after &quot;those who
cannot support themselves&quot; the following: &quot;to foster
personal qualities of selfdiscipline, honesty, hard work, and
the deferral of gratification;&quot;    
<P>
Page 24, paragraph 26, subparagraph a:  The most important indicator
of poverty is family  structure.  This indicator must be added
to the litany of poverty and vulnerability indicators.    
<P>
Page 26, paragraph 29, subparagraph a:  Language should be added
to the phrase &quot;redistributing  land&quot; to bar expropriation
and confiscation of lawfully owned and managed property.  The
US  Constitution includes a &quot;takings clause,&quot; which
obliges government to compensate owners for  lawfully expropriated
or attached property.  Even in developed countries, this principle
is  irregularly and inadequately followed.  This paragraph should
read:  &quot;encouraging the  redistribution of [redistributing]
land where necessary to foster a return to productive use  and
where full compensation and other due process of law is guaranteed
to lawful owners.&quot;    
<P>
Page 26, paragraph 30, subparagraph a:  &quot;access of people
living in poverty to responsible levels  of credit ...&quot; 
The United Nations should not require any lending institution
to make irresponsible  loans.  In fact, the declaration's clear
and repeated call for debt restructuring and forgiveness for 
developing nations dramatizes the fact that irresponsible lending
that ignores economic viability damages both the lending institution
and the dependent party.  This experience must be applied to micro
as well as macroeconomics.    
<P>
Page 26, paragraph 30, subparagraph c:  &quot;Providing incentives
for [, earmarking percentages of  the lending base].  In line
with the criticism noted above, lending institutions must retain,
for the sake of their depositors as well as the wellbeing of borrowers,
reasonable standards of viability and repayability for all loans
in their portfolio.  Encouraging lenders to provide responsible
levels  of credit to impoverished persons for socially valuable
purposes is a laudable aim, but setasides  and quotas can only
encourage distortions in the loan market and the placement of
irresponsible  loans.  This will not alleviate poverty and may,
in fact, hinder normal patterns of development.    
<P>
Page 27, paragraph 32, subparagraph b:  The phrase &quot;full
and equal access&quot; to health services  suggests that the same
standards of service that apply to women should apply to girls.
 The  implication is that services to be provided are identical
irrespective of maturity, marital status, or other factors.  Add
at the end of this sentence, &quot;with due regard for the responsibility
of  government to protect the vulnerability of the immature and
the sanctuary of the family.&quot;    
<P>
Page 28, paragraph 33, add a new subparagraph i, and adjust the
following subparagraph accordangle:  &quot;Encouraging the formation
and retention of stable family units, as a shield against poverty,
the appropriate locus for sexual expression, childbearing and
childrearing, and the essential factor in successful education
and the creation of productive and responsible  citizens.&quot;
<P>
Page 28, paragraph 34, subparagraph c:  The antagonism, in some
nations, between formal and  nonformal education for preschoolers
should be acknowledged.  To some extent, these objectives can
be mutually exclusive.  Numerous education experts believe that
nonformal education  within the family is significantly healthier
and more effective than early formal education before a child
is emotionally or psychologically ready to learn.  The best way
to address this concern is to add the word voluntary before &quot;preschool
education&quot; to assure that mandates do not drive out parental
education of young children in the home. 
<P>
Page 29, paragraph 34, subparagraph d:  Same changes as recommended
for Page 8, commitment 2, subparagraph b.    
<P>
Page 29, paragraph 34, subparagraph e:  Removing objectionable
language in this context may  prove impossible.  I recommend instead
that language be added to encourage the provision of  health care
to expectant mothers and the children they carry that will enable
them to carry those  children successfully to term.  &quot;Safe
motherhood&quot; must be made to be synonymous with safety for
 both mother and child  this is logical because, without the child,
it is not motherhood at all. The strategy of proabortion organizations
at Cairo was to move away from an individual conception  of maternal
health that focuses on the health of every motherandchild in utero
toward a collective, public healthoriented concept that denies
the need to protect the health of mother and child in all circumstances.
 This is one occasion where the faulty language in the declaration
can be improved by making it truly universal, i.e., protective
of all mothers and children.  Amend this language to read &quot;full
access to such services, including voluntary and informed reproductive
health/family planning care for married couples [and], education
on safe motherhood, and  supportive services for all expectant
mothers and the children they carry, [and prenatal and postnatal
care] both prenatally and postnatally.    
<P>
Page 29, paragraph 35, subparagraph e.  &quot;Expanding and strengthening
social insurance   programmes and tax policies to protect working
people ...&quot;  Burdensome taxation can subject  working families
to poverty.  Recently the United States reformed a program called
the Earned  Income Tax Credit to provide additional income to
lift working families above the poverty line.   Broadly considered,
this is a &quot;social insurance&quot; programme, but the key
is that it is based on an  alleviation of taxation on the working
family, not the direct imposition of a tax on families or  other
entities.   
<P>
Page 30, paragraph 36, subparagraph d:  &quot;Improving the status
of the single parent in society&quot; is  opposed to policies
that responsibly discourage the deliberate choice of single parenthood
or  sexual irresponsibility.  Assisting single parents to care
for their child is generally sound policy,  but even here society
gains nothing by refusing to recognize that promotion of adoption
is the  better alternative for many single mothers.  To avoid
these notional difficulties, amend this  subparagraph to read:
[&quot;Improving the status of the single parent in society and]
Ensuring that  singleparent families receive the social support
they need, include support for adequate housing and the child
care of their choice, with special emphasis on incentives for
marriage and  strengthening extended family networks.&quot;  
<P>
Page 32, paragraph 43, bullet one:  The &quot;full participation
of employers and trade unions&quot;  excludes the vast majority
of the world's workers.  Add &quot;nonunionized workers&quot;
to this phrase.    
<P>
Page 34, paragraph 46, add a subparagraph g:  &quot;Establishing
policies to encourage invention and entrepreneurship, to protect
the products of invention and entrepreneurship from  misappropriation,
and to provide inventors and entrepreneurs with access to capital
and  economic rewards sufficient to encourage the development
and introduction of new technologies and methods.&quot;  Much
technological development takes place outside &quot;national and
local technology institutions; indeed, the home computer revolution
was largely sparked by the  technical wizardry of two Americans
working out of a garage.  Assurance of economic rewards,  protection
of copyrights and patents, and access to capital are as or more
critical than support for technology institutions as a means to
promote employmentintensive growth.  Experience demonstrates that
governments cannot always predict, produce, or judge which technologies
will have the most profound impact in promoting economic growth
and human betterment.    
<P>
Page 34, paragraph 47, subparagraph d:  Revise to read &quot;increasing
family benefits and social  support such as equitable and substantial
financial support for all forms of child care, including care
at home.       
<P>
Page 38, paragraph 55, subparagraph d.  This paragraph is a glaring
demonstration of the  irreconcilability of the declaration's claimed
dedication to sovereignty and its clear commitment to utilize
United Nations instrumentalities to change attitudes toward the
division of paid labor and housework!  Many families around the
world obviously do not wish their attitudes to be changed.  They
believe explicitly in the social and childrearing advantages of
a single wageearner  structure.  They have no wish to impose those
structure on all peoples and families around the globe.  They
adopt such patterns as sequencing in which a primary caregiver,
usually the mother, leaves the paid labor force to devote herself
fulltime to the care of her family, only to return to paid labor
as the children enter formal schooling or are fully grown.  That
the United Nations would seek to use its resources to foster the
destruction of such patterns is reprehensible, but it will also
ultimately be futile.  This language is a retreaded version of
the most doctrinaire  feminism that is losing popularity even
in the most advanced nations.  If language of any kind is  needed,
it should state only &quot;Devising public policies that support
maximum family choice and empowerment over questions of parental
division of labor.&quot;  The reference to &quot;child care  facilities&quot;
appears to favor the least popular form of child care in the United
States, i.e.,  institutional child care.  This phrase should be
modified to read, as above, support for all forms  of child care,
including home care and family care.  The phrase profamily tax
relief should  also be added to this litany of workfamily policies,
as this issue transcends all the others in  promoting family freedom.
 Other objections could be raised to this paragraph, but these
are the  major ones.    
<P>
Page 38, paragraph 55, subparagraph e.  On the scale of public
values, encouraging fathers and  mothers to stay together is far
more important than using atomic scales to measure gender  equality
in diaperchanging and other domestic duties.  Nearly all studies
of child care issues point out that most parents would prefer
to have one or both working parents spend more time with their
children, if loss of income were not an issue.  The point is that
all of these subparagraphs ignore parental choice and parental
preferences and subordinate them to the goal of encouraging women
to take paid employment.  Other than ideology, it is not clear
why this should be so.  This  paragraph should be replaced with
one that reads:  Encouraging governments to recognize the unique
contributions of families with children and to adopt policies
that maximize parental time spent in childrearing activities and
minimize the need for families to spend inordinate time in paid
labor activities at the expense of overall family wellbeing. 
The goal here is to encourage at least some form of a family wage
system that leaves each parent's role as the parents mutually
agree.  Parttime, flexible, and home working schedules promote
this result, as well.    
<P>
Page 41, paragraph 64, add to the last bullet item listed:  &quot;violence,
crime, drug abuse and  trafficking, sexual exploitation, and other
behaviors that diminish productivity, shorten lifespan and spread
disease.  This language is needed to assure that &quot;respect
for diversity&quot; does not  include respect for actions that
involve a dimension of personal immorality.  &quot;Diversity&quot;
properly means neutral differences, not moral disputes about issues
of character.    
<P>
Page 41, paragraph 66, subparagraph c:  Revise to read &quot;Giving
community organizations,  private associations and natural institutions
like the family greater control . . .&quot;                  
<P>
Page 42, paragraph 67, subparagraph a:  The phrase &quot;as appropriate&quot;
may suffice to address  concern about the overextension of prohibitions
on discrimination to distinctly moral categories. Marriage laws
currently &quot;discriminate&quot; against samegender pairs. 
Enacting legislation to  reverse this situation would be inappropriate,
but it may be wiser to nail this down with some  effort to define
unacceptable discrimination.  Note the language at page 40, paragraph
59 that  comes close to defining the scope of acceptable prohibitions
on discrimination:  &quot;different groups which are defined by
language, ethnicity, religion, geography or class.&quot;  This
internal definition  may offer a route to an acceptably limited
definition of discrimination, with the addition of gender and
disability.    
<P>
Page 42, paragraph 67, subparagraph b:  [removal of reservations],
for the reasons noted above.    
<P>
Page 45, paragraph 71, subparagraph a:  In many places in the
declaration, the emphasis on the  elimination of violence against
certain groups in society (armed conflict, for example) is culturally
true and entirely appropriate.  Here it is mystifying.  Young
males are disproportionately the victims of homicide (at the hands
of other young males, in most cases) in developed countries, including
the United States.  On the general issue of social violence, thereis
absolutely no need for gender oneupmanship.  The United Nations
should never jettison concern for violence against young men,
who are among the most pathetic victims of family breakup in advanced
societies.  I recommend ending the first sentence of this paragraph
as follows, &quot;with particular attention to vulnerable persons
who are the most frequent victims of violent acts.&quot;  Crime
and violence are pervasive enough that they should never be turned
into mere group politics.    
<P>
Page 47.  Nearly every word on this page illustrates the tension
in this document between its  repeated pledges to respect and
promote &quot;decentralization,&quot; government &quot;closest
to the people,&quot;  &quot;national sovereignty,&quot; &quot;small
business entrepreneurs&quot; and &quot;grassroots/community organizations.&quot;
   As national strategies are here designed, &quot;priorities
and time frames&quot; are the responsibility of national governments.
 &quot;Massive political will to invest in people&quot; is required
to achieve these goals.  All of this is &quot;primarily the responsibility
of national Governments.&quot;  The declaration does not strive
to reconcile these contradictory themes and objectives.  In small
nationstates, national Governments may in fact be close to the
people.  In large nations, they are remote, and the general direction
of policy reform is running counter to central government solutions.
 The declaration's only attempt to resolve this problem is to
include language at various points that expresses all points of
view.  The irony of the United nations amassing resources and
summoning political will to promote local solutions ought not
to miss anyone's attention.  There are far too many problems with
this page to fix it, but it is probably the clearest expression
yet of the authors' actual intent in devising the programme of
action.    
<P>
Page 48, paragraph 75, prologue:  Include family counseling and
assistance among the spheres  of work done by NGOs.          
<P>
Page 49, paragraph 76, subparagraph f:  This paragraph includes
the first reference in the  document to &quot;debate&quot; about
the direction of social policy.  The rest of the declaration could
be  improved by correcting this omission and recognizing that
the most progressive nations are those that have the most debate
about all of the issues covered by the document.    
<P>
Page 50, paragraph 77, subparagraph a:  add nonpunitive before
&quot;taxes&quot;; add at the end or that  provide incentives
for selfdefeating and selfdestructive behaviors.    
<P>
Page 52, paragraph 82.  This paragraph broaches the possibility
of vesting the United Nations  with taxing authority.  This idea
is only surfaced here, but its philosophical implications are
 profound.  It raises the possibility that the United Nations
Economic and Social Council will take on the characteristics of
an extralateral, rather than multilateral institution.  Such a
mechanism  would inevitably diminish individual nations' role
in managing and overseeing the development of  United Nations
policy.  This paragraph deserves wide publicity and debate now.
 Similar concerns are raised by the references to international
taxation and involuntary financing of the United  Nations at paragraphs
85 b and 86 g.

<title>WOMEN IN COMBAT: CREATING SEXUAL TENSION</title>

CREATING SEXUAL TENSION</h2>

<p>
The Clinton Administration's women-in-combat policy has created
an atmosphere which may make it difficult for officers to comply
with combat-related military service.  The recent case of Navy
helicopter pilot Lieutenant Commander Ken Carkhuff illustrates
the unfortunate turn that the pursuit of a gender-blind military
may be taking for the US Navy and for those who object to the
policy. 
<P>
On August 24, 1994, Carkhuff told his executive officer, &quot;I
cannot take this detachment to sea.&quot;  The detachment included
two female pilots, and Carkhuff later explained, &quot;I could
not appear to endorse a policy [the women-in-combat policy] that
I didn't agree with.&quot; Carkhuff's statement disqualified him
from leading his detachment. His commander relieved him of his
duties and two officer boards have concluded that Carkhuff should
be honorably discharged from the service.[1]
<P>
Carkhuff told the &quot;show cause&quot; board on May 18, 1995,
&quot;I think that we should not be subjecting... women to violence,
and there is no more extreme violence that a human can be involved
in than in combat.&quot;[2]  He said that he was not anxious to confront
the policy and stated that he had no objection to women serving
in the Navy.[3]
<P>
Carkhuff had, in fact, just completed a year at the Naval War
College where the issue of women in combat was debated extensively.
 He had strong and religiously-based views on this issue.  The
day he privately stated his view to his boss corresponded to the
birth of his fifth child, a daughter.  Carkhuff feared that leading
women into a possible combat situation [the US invasion of Haiti
was weeks away] would incrementally lead to expanded combat roles
for women and perhaps his own daughter's forced combat role in
the future.
<P>
Commander Carkhuff did state at the hearing that &quot;if ordered
to execute that policy, I will do it.&quot;[4]  Nevertheless, the
Navy stood by its decision to discharge him honorably.
<P>
This case raises questions about a double standard at work in
the Navy on the issue of voicing personal opinions about women
in combat.  In 1992, uniformed female Navy officers gathered on
Capitol Hill to lobby against the female combat 
ban, labeling it an &quot;equal opportunity issue.&quot;  The
Navy ignored regulations which restrict uniformed sailors from
personal lobbying and did not discipline these officers.  However,
Carkhuff's private protest resulted in an honorable discharge.
 This would demonstrate that violations committed while protesting
in support of women in combat are ignored, while those protests
against the policy of women in combat are punished.
<P>
More importantly, this case raises questions about whether the
Navy is in danger of losing good men due to its women-in-combat
policy.  Carkhuff was a proven officer with consistently high
performance ratings.  Assuming there are other exemplary men who,
because of such policies, will cut short their military careers,
the military does not profit.  Nor does it profit from the fact
that this policy may discourage some would-be &quot;top guns&quot;
from responding to recruitment appeals to pursue a military career.
<P>
The Clinton Administration has erased more than 250,000 combat
exemptions for women.  Today, women can be assigned to 95 percent
of all Navy billets.  Feminists say this is progress, but combat
veterans and our combat-hardened allies know this portends disaster.
 In fact, the Navy's policy of women in combat is contrary to
the findings of the 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment
of Women in the Armed Forces.
<P>
The board reviewing Carkhuff did not find that Carkhuff lacked
the ability to perform.  According to Navy documents, he is being
honorably separated for disagreeing with a politically sensitive
policy, and for refusing to perform a duty.
<P>
When officers so strongly protest, it is time for the Pentagon
and Congress to reconsider the wisdom of policies that increase
the combat role of women.  Men like Carkhuff deserve the opportunity
to honorably serve, rather than have their careers cut short by
an unfortunate and dangerous policy.

<title>MARRIAGE PROTECTS WOMEN FROM VIOLENCE</title>
<body>

<p>
<h2>MARRIAGE PROTECTS WOMEN<br>
FROM VIOLENCE</h2>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>

<p>
<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>
<p>
Studies and pronouncements about violence against women continue
to make headlines.  Recently, the Justice Department announced
that a redesigned national survey found that violence against
women is much higher than previously reported.  The survey also
reveals that marriage often shields women from violence.  
<P>
Any violence against women should be strongly condemned, and offenders
should be punished to the full extent of the law.   But some feminists
exaggerate the real scope of this tragic problem using unvetted
advocacy research.   Consider some advocacy reporting:
<UL>
<LI>&quot;There are three to four million women beaten by husbands
or lovers every year; that's one every 15 seconds.&quot;  (<I>Chicago
Tribune</I>, February 10, 1992)
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>&quot;Four million to six million women are beaten [each year].
 That means once every five seconds...a woman is punched or kicked...or
held down and pummeled.&quot;  (Associated Press)[1]
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>Miami talk-show host Pat Stevens told a <I>Crossfire</I> audience
that 60 million women are abused every year.[2]
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><I>Ms</I>. magazine's &quot;Campus Project on Sexual Assault&quot;
claims that 15.4 percent of college women are raped and 12.1 percent
experience an attempted rape each year.[3]
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI>When President Clinton named Bonnie Campbell to head the &quot;Violence
Against Women&quot; office at the Justice Department, he said
there are 700,000 rapes or attempted rapes every year.[4]
</UL>
<P>
<P>
The bases for these &quot;facts&quot; are seldom given and they
should be suspect.  After all, there are 31,536,000 seconds in
a year.  If an American woman is victimized every 15 seconds,
then there are in reality 2,124,000 incidents.  Five million violent
female victimizations would be one every 6.3 seconds.
<P>
The August, 1995 Bureau of Justice Statistics study, &quot;Violence
Against Women: Estimates from the Redesigned Survey,&quot; provides
a different, although, sobering picture.[5]
Men are far more likely to be victims of crime (64.9 v. 43.7 per
1,000 persons) than women.[6]   But women are nine times more likely
than men to become rape/sexual assault victims.[7]   That figure
is higher than previously reported.
<P>
The new survey estimates there are 500,200 female victimizations
each year which includes 172,400 completed rapes and 141,200 attempted
rapes.[8]  In comparison, the FBI previously reported 109,062 forcible
rapes for 1992, which was a 38.2 percent rise in the total number
of reported rapes and a 27 percent rate increase since 1973.[9]
<P>
The study is based on the redesigned National Crime Victimization
Survey (NCVS) which is a continuous nationally representative
sample of 50,000 households.  The latest report includes the years
1992-1993 and with revised questions it found that the average
annual rate of violent victimization per 1,000 women rose from
5.4 in 1987-91 to 9.4.[10]
<P>
The woman's relationship to the offender is a key variable.  The
1995 study found that a woman is three times more likely to be
raped or sexually assaulted by a boyfriend and 10 times more likely
to be raped or sexually assaulted by an acquaintance thanby a
spouse.  Single women are just as likely to be raped or sexually
assaulted by a stranger as they are by a boyfriend.[11]
<P>
When all acts of violence against women are considered, married
or widowed women are 30 times less likely than separated women
to become violence victims.  Married women are at least four times
less likely than never-married women to be crime victims.[12]
<P>
The study also found that women aged 19-29 are the most likely
violence victims.  They are twice as likely to become victims
as 30 to 45 year old women and 12 to 18 year old girls.[13]  Although
the Justice Department report does not explain the difference,
U.S. Census Bureau statistics show that the older female cohort
tends to be married and the younger cohort is more likely to live
in homes where there is a protecting father.[14]
<P>
Family income also makes a big difference.  Women from middle
income families tend to be four times safer than those from families
with incomes under $10,000.  Education, ethnicity and race are
not major violence discriminators.[15]
<P>
<center><h3>CONCLUSIONS ABOUT VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN</h3></center>
<P>
Incidents of rape and sexual assault are officially higher than
previously reported but do not come close to the figures offered
by some advocacy researchers.  Based on the new survey it's too
early to determine whether violence against women is rising. 
But it's clear that the offender/victim relationship is key and
deserves more attention.
<P>
Young women (19-29 years old), who have never married (or are
separated) and have low incomes are most vulnerable to violence.
 Their offenders are more likely to be known to them, and crime
by non-strangers usually occurs at or near the woman's home. 
<P>
The survey shows that marriage protects all female cohorts from
every type of violence.  Married women are safer than single,
separated, divorced and never-married women.    
<P>
Marriage also reduces violent crime incidents among men.  It helps
to channel male aggression toward positive goals.  Never-married
men are more likely to commit assault and they suffer most (58.9
percent) assaults.[16]  They are also five times more likely to rape
and commit other violent crime than married men.[17]
<P>
The Justice Department's latest report should encourage government
to harness marriage as a shield against violence.  The report
also tells American women and girls that the safest place today
is living in homes with their husbands and fathers.

<h2>THE STRAIGHT STORY<br>

BIRTHS, ABORTIONS, AND THE FAMILY CAP</h2>

<p>
In August of 1993, the first &quot;family cap&quot; in the nation
took effect in the state of New Jersey as part of a larger package
of reforms known as the Family Development Program.  The family
cap provision stipulates that a mother who has already received
welfare benefits for at least 10 months and who bears an additional
child will receive no increase in her basic monthly AFDC benefit.
 The provision affects only the monthly <I>cash</I> benefit, however.
 Health benefits and food stamps continue to increase with family
size.
<P>
The raw numbers of births and abortions in New Jersey since the
cap took effect strongly suggest that the policy has reduced the
number of births to AFDC mothers without affecting the abortion
rate.
<P>
Raw data for the 20-month period from August 1992 to March 1994
appears in Table 1:

<P>
The total number of abortions in the year before the policy took
effect was 11,817, yielding a monthly average of 984.75.  In the
eight months after the policy took effect (including March 1994,
which had a far higher total of abortions than any other month
on record), the total number of abortions was 7,932, yielding
a monthly average of 991.5.  The difference (0.7%) is trivial
and well within the expected range of random fluctuation.  If
the anomalous month of March were excluded from the analysis,
the average would be just 953 abortions per month after the introduction
of the family cap -- a 3% decline from the previous year's average,
but also trivial enough to be within the range of random fluctuation.
<P>
A more comprehensive look at the data reduces the significance
of the difference even further.  The average monthly caseload
in the year before the family cap was enacted was 121,479.  In
the eight months post-cap, the average monthly caseload was 122,679
-- a difference of less than 1%.  But the monthly abortion rate
(number of abortions per 1,000 AFDC cases) was 8.11 in the year
prior to enactment of the family cap and only 8.08 in the eight
months post-enactment.  The difference is too small to be statistically
significant, but it is worth noting that the total number of abortions
in the period after implementation of the cap was three <I>fewer</I>
than predicted by the rate before enactment of the policy.
<P>
Using the entire preceding year as the baseline, however, tends
to distort the real effect of the family cap because the abortion
rate was very low in the period ranging from August to November
1992.  During the eight months immediately preceding the introduction
of the cap (December 1992 to July 1993), New Jersey welfare mothers
underwent 8,144 abortions -- 212 <I>more</I> than in the eight
months after the cap took effect.  If the post-cap data did not
include the month of March 1994, moreover, the post-cap abortion
average would have been 8% less than the average for the previous
seven months.
<P>
No responsible statistician would therefore conclude that the
family cap must reduce abortions.  But an honest evaluation of
the available data strongly argues that, contrary to the fears
expressed by many in the pro-life community, the family cap has
had no impact on the number or rate of abortions among New Jersey's
AFDC recipients.  The monthly abortion totals fluctuated with
no apparent pattern, but were always within the expected range.
 The total number of abortions in the eight months post-cap was
almost exactly what would have been projected if there had been
no change in the state's welfare policy.
<P>
The birth rate among AFDC recipients, on the other hand, was significantly
lower after introduction of the family cap.  In the year prior
to the cap, the total number of births to welfare mothers in New
Jersey was 15,972, yielding a monthly average of 1,331 births
and a monthly rate of 10.96 births per thousand AFDC recipients.
 In the eight months post-cap, there were 9,519 births, yielding
a monthly average of 1,190 births and a monthly rate of 9.70 births
per thousand AFDC recipients.  The difference is consistent, substantial,
and statistically significant.
<P>
In all eight months after the introduction of the cap, the birth
totals were below the previous year's average and lower than the
total for the corresponding month in the previous year.  The monthly
abortion totals after implementation of the cap show a more random
pattern.  In six of the eight months, there were fewer abortions
than the previous year's average, but in only three of those months
was the abortion total lower than the total for the corresponding
month the year before.
<P>
When the entire 20-month period is divided into 4-month increments
(see Table 2), the change in the average number of births is obvious.
 The family cap has produced a significant reduction in the number
of births and pregnancies, but has had no discernible impact on
the number of abortions.

<P>
<P>
The only way to calculate a higher abortion rate for the post-cap
period is to suppress the data from April to July 1993 -- the
period immediately prior to implementation of the new policy --
and compare the abortion totals from the post-cap period with
the totals from the corresponding months of the previous year.
 <I>Unless the April to July 1993 data is suppressed, </I>the
abortion rate after implementation of the family cap appears to
be either the same as or lower than the abortion rate before the
cap.
<P>
There are only two hypotheses that could justify suppressing the
April to July 1993 data and preserve the finding that the abortion
rate has increased since implementation of the cap.
<P>
First, it is possible that the abortion rate follows an annual
cyclical pattern and that the monthly abortion totals from April
to July 1994 will show the same inflation as in 1993.  But a close
examination of the month-by-month totals suggests that the high
months and low months in the two years do not correspond with
enough consistency to indicate a seasonal cycle.  In 1992-1993,
the months with high abortion totals were October, January, and
March, while August, November, and December registered low totals.
 In 1993-1994, August and March were the months with a high number
of abortions, and the September total was relatively low.
<P>
The second hypothesis is that welfare mothers may have staged
an &quot;abortion rush&quot; prior to implementation of the family
cap, thereby generating unusually high abortion totals in the
months immediately preceding the change in policy.  But the single
month in which an &quot;abortion rush&quot; would have been most
visible, July 1993, had a lower abortion total than either June
1993 or August 1993.  The number of abortions declined between
June and July and increased between July and August.  The time
period with the highest number of abortions spanned six months,
from March to August -- straddling the enactment date -- and then
was followed by six months of low abortion totals after implementation
of the family cap.
<P>
While it is still premature to draw any decisive conclusions from
the welfare reform experiment in New Jersey, it is becoming increasingly
fantastic to claim that the state has experienced an upsurge in
abortions since the family cap took effect.  The reported &quot;increase&quot;
in abortions rests on a statistical illusion created by suppressing
data from the four-month period immediately preceding the policy
change -- which includes the highest abortion totals recorded
in the data under study.
<P>
Those who would hold welfare reform hostage in the name of saving
lives bear a significant burden of proof in maintaining that more
lives will be saved by preserving the current welfare system.
 The consistent, strong correlation between increased welfare
spending and increased abortions should be far more troublesome
data to pro-lifers than the most recent numbers from New Jersey.

<title>RENEWING THE AMERICAN DREAM FOR EDUCATION</title>

<h2>RENEWING THE AMERICAN DREAM<br>
FOR EDUCATION</h2>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<i>Jennifer A. Marshall</i></center>
<p>
High-profile advocates of public education lack an inspiring vision
for the educational renewal of America.  President Bill Clinton,
Secretary of Education Richard Riley, Congress, teacher union
bosses -- all alternately cheerlead and criticize, but their discussions
usually degenerate into bickering over funding, equity, and the
competitiveness of the American economy.  Ultimately, they are
concerned about the educational <I>system</I> and its place in
the larger context of American society and the national economy.
Little of what they have to say deals with the real stuff of
education.
<p>
Dorothy Sayers, an author and a contemporary of C.S. Lewis, articulated
half a century ago the foolishness of focusing on the system and
thereby missing the whole aim of education:
<p><blockquote>
What use is it to pile task on task and prolong the days of labor,
if at the close the chief object is left unattained?  It is not
the fault of the teachers -- they work only too hard already.
 The combined folly of a civilization that has forgotten its own
roots is forcing them to shore up the tottering weight of an educational
structure that is built upon sand....  For the sole true end of
education is simply this:  to teach men how to learn for themselves;
and whatever instruction fails to do this is effort spent in vain.[1]
</blockquote><p>
Sayers clearly had a vision of what education ought to be.
<p>
Today, once again, those with the academic zeal that rallies others
to renew education have a vision that goes beyond the realities
of the public school system.  Their common sense, optimistic ideas
are not constrained by the inadequacies of a federally run education
bureaucracy.  As Frenchman Alexis de Tocqueville remarked in 1835,
such freedom from bureaucracy is -- or at least once was -- distinctively
American:  &quot;Uniformity or permanence of design, the minute
arrangement of details, and the perfection of administrative system
must not be sought for in the United States; what we find there
is the presence of a power which, if it is somewhat wild, is at
least robust....&quot;[2] Homeschooling and classical education
exemplify this genius and vibrancy of the American people.
<p>
<center><h3>SCHOOLING BY THE TRUE DEPARTMENT OF EDUCATION</h3></center>
<p>
We have long known that the &quot;true department of education,&quot;
as author Douglas Wilson refers to the family, is the institution
behind the success of the homeschool movement.[3] Recent scholarship,
however, shows the role of the family in the academic success
of children in all settings. Because parents are vested with the
authority and responsibility to oversee their children's upbringing,
especially their education, homeschooling ought not to be considered
the method of last resort, but a first option.  Recent scholarship
demonstrates that, no matter what the school setting, family is
the key factor in the academic success of children.[4]
<p>
Critics may view homeschoolers as somewhat reclusive, but the
flourishing movement contributes to society much more than they
recognize.  Increased interaction within the family counters the
individualism and the &quot;generation gaps&quot; created by the
secular culture.  With some 400,000 families currently homeschooling,
the movement has also become a gathering point for inter-family
relations.  Networks and support groups abound (see the addendum
for a sample listing).  Though the homeschooling movement takes
a back-to-basics approach to academics, it is thoroughly progressive
when it comes to using the latest technology.  CompuServe and
America Online forums provide helpful hints on raising kids, curriculum
tips, homework help, and an ongoing discussion of a new ideal
for education.
<p>
Homeschoolers are some of the most politically involved private
citizens in America.  Politicians have learned not to trifle with
the &quot;stay-at-home mom&quot; with a phone tree, a fax machine,
and a firm devotion to raising well-grounded children.  Initially
a measure for self-defense, homeschoolers' lobbying efforts have
strengthened the platform for all families in America.   Nationwide
homeschool networks have proven to be very effective avenues of
communication.  The Home School Legal Defense Association, located
outside of Washington, D.C., disseminates regular alerts calling
homeschoolers to action when threats to their -- and everyone's
-- freedom arise.
<p>
Bill and Mary Pride and their nine children are the epitome of
a fully engaged homeschooling family.  Ranging from toddlers to
teens, the kids are all taught at home and always have been. 
The Pride children's educational package takes advantage of everything
from traditional material to on-line computer classes.  To share
their good news in education, the Prides publish a quarterly magazine
called <i>Practical Homeschooling</i> with 96 pages of suggestions
for networking, critiques of curriculum and software, discussions
of educational theories and lighthearted openness about the joys
and trials of the homeschooling life.  Mary does much of the writing
herself and also gathers articles from some of the most staunchly
conservative education thinkers in the nation, including Samuel
Blumenfeld and Doug Wilson.  <I>Practical Homeschooling</I> now
has an on-line site of its own which includes forums for Q &amp;
A on homeschooling pragmatics and on-line chats with contributing
authors.
<p>
<center><h3>THE RETURN OF CLASSICAL EDUCATION</h3></center>
<p>
Truly a timeless educational philosophy, classical education has
now hit cyberspace and become the subject of much chatting in
homeschool online forums.  The resurgence of this medieval model
of education is due in large part to Douglas Wilson, author of
<I>Recovering the Lost Tools of Learning.</I>  His title refers
to the essay which inspired his efforts, entitled, &quot;The Lost
Tools of Learning,&quot; by Dorothy Sayers.  Miss Sayers' 1947
critique of education stall efforts in an apt commentary on America's
system of public education in the '90s:
<p><blockquote>
We dole out lip-service to the importance of education -- lip-service
and, just occasionally, a little grant of money; we postpone the
school-leaving age, and plan to build bigger and better schools;
the teachers slave conscientiously in and out of school hours;
and yet, as I believe, all this devoted effort is largely frustrated,
because we have lost the tools of learning, and in their absence
can only make a botched and piecemeal job of it.[5]
</blockquote><p>
What she goes on to describe as &quot;the lost tools of learning&quot;
are the disciplines of Grammar, Logic, and Rhetoric.  These are
the tools with which students must be equipped, she argues, in
order to tackle the content of any subject.  Sayers considers
Latin an important learning tool as well.  As the key to so many
languages, to the vocabulary of science, and to historical documents,
she estimates that in most subject areas, a knowledge of Latin
would cut learning time by half.  The study of Latin, and not
the &quot;dumbing down&quot; of the test, may prove to be the
surest way to recoup lost ground on the verbal section of the
SAT.
<p>
The contemporary relevance of Miss Sayers' insights is astonishing.
 While federal bureaucrats set a National Education Goal that
all our children will start school ready to learn, Sayers points
out that children are by nature sponges ready to absorb information.
 For those who disparage memorization and the accumulation of
factual knowledge, she points out that young children love litanies
of information.  She gives a whole new meaning to age appropriateness,
a topic of great discussion in the teaching colleges, by tying
Grammar, Logic, and Rhetoric to a child's stages of mental development.
 And how about Latin, as Sayers suggests, for early childhood
education?  &quot;The Lost Tools of Learning&quot; ought to be
required reading in every teacher education class; it cuts through
the confusion and inconsistencies of modern educational theory.
 Sayers' vision is idealistic yet practical; it has the power
to inspire and the wisdom to work.
<p>
Doug Wilson has demonstrated that effectiveness.  Fourteen years
ago he founded Logos School, a distinctively Christian school
based on the Sayers' model of classical education.  Today there
are some thirty member schools in his Association of Classical
and Christian Schools (ACCS).   &quot;These schools are engaged
in what might be one of the most important educational reforms
of our time,&quot; writes Dr. Gene Veith, Dean of Arts and Sciences
at Concordia University.[6] Dr. Veith is in the midst of a year-long
study of classical education.  While modern education disintegrates,
notes Dr. Veith, these classical schools are &quot;recovering
the very approach to education that gave birth to Western civilization
and has continually brought that civilization to renewal.&quot;
 The re-popularization of classical education is timely indeed.
<p>
<center><h3>THE GREAT BOOKS</h3></center>
<p>
While equipping students with grammar, logic, and rhetoric, classical
education focuses on the great literary works of Western civilization,
something modern schools do less and less as contemporary books
replace the old.  The neglect of great books in the schools is
a symptom of a wider cultural trend, as evidenced by the disappearance
of classics from many libraries across the nation.  The Family
Research Council study, &quot;Discarded Images:  Selected Classics
and American Libraries,&quot; by Charles Donovan and William Spont,
documents this phenomenon.
<p>
Large tomes of collected works with ancient bindings may intimidate
the modern reader, but C.S. Lewis argues that old books are not
merely for the expert, but especially for the ordinary reader:
<p><blockquote>
[I]f the average student wants to find out something about Platonism,
the very last thing he thinks of doing is to take a translation
of Plato off the library shelf and read the <I>Symposium</I>.
 He would rather read some dreary modern book ten times as long,
all about 'isms' and influences and only once in twelve pages
telling him what Plato actually said....  But if he only knew,
the great man, just because of his greatness, is much more intelligible
than this modern commentator....  It has always therefore been
one of my main endeavours as a teacher to persuade the young that
first-hand knowledge is not only more worth acquiring than second-hand
knowledge, but is usually much easier and more delightful to acquire.[7]
</blockquote><p>
In contrast, Lewis advises the ordinary reader to take up the
old books &quot;precisely because he is an amateur and therefore
much less protected than the expert against the dangers of an
exclusive contemporary diet.  A new book is still on its trial
and the amateur is not in a position to judge it.&quot;[8] Classical
education has taken the precaution of going back to the revered
classics.
<p>
<center><h3>NEW CONCLUSIONS FROM OLD PRINCIPLES</h3></center>
<p>
While homeschool and classical education may be perceived as eccentric,
esoteric, and even impractical because of their intense pursuit
of &quot;intellectualism,&quot; they are actually thoroughly pragmatic.
 Both models guide students through the learning process efficiently
and deliberately.  The educational sequence is logical and meaningful.
 Meanwhile, we continue to fund a modern public school system
that measures hours spent in school (&quot;seat time&quot;), where
the curriculum is so disjointed that classroom teachers are hard
pressed to answer students' question, &quot;Why do we have to
learn this?&quot;  Convoluted attempts to standardize and individualize
simultaneously have resulted in a dysfunctional system.
<p>
The traditional methods espoused by homeschooling and classical
education strike just the balance the public school system lacks.
 They hold a universally high standard of excellence, and an inherent
standardization which comes from keeping educationally on-task.
 Yet the homeschool and classical models are also much more individualized
than the public school classroom, not only on the basis of size,
but also in personal attention to the development of each child's
mind.  While in the modern system the outcome is paramount, in
classical education and homeschooling the process is just as important
as the end.
<p>
Classical education and homeschooling recognize that different
students have varying strengths, and that each student should
be strengthened in all domains.  Where public education has gradually
excluded certain subjects (art, music, logic, etc.) from the core
curriculum and advised teachers to cater to all learning styles
in the remaining subjects, homeschool and classical education
have embraced the classical liberal arts which train students
in the whole spectrum of knowledge.  A student may excel in one
area and struggle in another, but he will grow in all.
<p>
Leaders of public education would do well to take cues from their
competitors.  Commitment to the system, however, continues to
prevent many from recognizing potentials for renewal. Consequently,
significant overhaul of the public school system may be the only
remedy.  As Doug Wilson notes, this is exactly what William Bennett,
former Secretary of Education, suggested after the Governors'
education summit in 1989, which initiated the America 2000/Goals
2000 agenda:
<p><blockquote>
I'd give the education reform movement another five years.  If
we're not able to get our schools back to where they were in 1963,
after spending 40 percent more, then maybe we should just declare
bankruptcy, give the people back their money, and let them start
their own schools.  That would be a radical way to have accountability.[9]
</blockquote><p>
Time's up.   The people have started their own schools and they
have already outdone the public school system.   We want our money
back.

<h2>MEDICAL SAVINGS ACCOUNTS:<br>
GOOD FOR HEALTH CARE REFORM,<br>
GOOD FOR FAMILIES</h2>
<hr size=3 width=50%>

<p>
<center><h3>CURRENT HEALTH CARE SITUATION</h3></center>
<p>
Last year's historic health care debate proved -- to the surprise
of no one but the Clinton Administration -- that American families
will not tolerate federal bureaucrats or &quot;gatekeepers&quot;
in Washington dictating their medical services and choice of doctors.
  A government-run, &quot;one size <I>must </I>fit all&quot; health
policy violates Americans' fundamental principles of freedom.
<p>
An overwhelming majority (roughly 85 percent) of small businesses
provide health insurance for their employees but they should not
be <I>forced</I> to pay for them through a federal mandate, as
Clinton's plan would have required.  A government mandate costs
wages and jobs in the long run and is not the way to reform health
care or help the uninsured population. 
<p>
While employer-provided health benefits may address the problem
of health care &quot;access,&quot;  they do not address the problem
of rising health care costs, which everyone agrees needs to be
addressed.  The national debate on health care reform debunked
the &quot;Washington knows best&quot; philosophy in favor of innovative
state and free-market health care initiatives.  At the forefront
of free-market reform is the concept of medical savings accounts
(also known as MSAs, Medisave accounts, or Medical IRAs).  They
are the centerpiece of the Republicans' health care plan and have
proved popular with the 2,000 private companies that now have
them.  The basic premise is that MSAs empower consumers to make
their own decisions about spending on routine health care, choose
their own doctors, and save unspent account funds from year to
year to pay for future health or retirement needs.  By contrast,
the present &quot;third-party payer&quot; system offers no incentive
to spend wisely because someone else -- the government or private
insurance --  is paying the bill. 
<p>
This year, a bipartisan Congressional proposal to make MSAs tax
free (like traditional health insurance) has 130 cosponsors and
prospects for passage are good.  Congressional Republicans have
advocated MSAs as a potential cost-saving measure for Medicare
recipients as well.
<p>
<I>This year $1 trillion was spent on health care, accounting
for one-seventh of the nation's entire economy</I>.  As costs
rise, consumers pay higher premiums for their health insurance.
 For the most part, consumers are spending the money of a third
party -- the insurance company or government.  When this is the
case, common sense shows that consumers will not spend frugally
or wisely.  Why should they?   Former Surgeon General C. Everett
Koop likened the present third-party payer system to this:  The
government invites people to pick out a new car, charge it to
a card they issue, and then pays the bill.  The problem with this
system is that no one buys a Hyundai.  They all buy Cadillacs
and BMWs.
<p>
Our present health care system discourages competition and cost-consciousness
because, unlike car insurance, the consumer does not see the bill
or, for the most part, use his own money to pay for services.
 Therefore, there is no incentive to shop for lower-cost medical
care.  The administrative costs of processing insurance claims
for the majority of employers account for up to 35 percent of
total premium costs, and average 25 percent of premium costs for
the majority of employers.
<p>
This is the case because traditional indemnity/health insurance
plans tend to stipulate a low-deductible (out-of-pocket) amount
of $100-$250.  In other words, once the consumer has paid the
first $250 out of pocket for his family's medical care, the insurance
begins to pay.  That seems like a good deal but it is very expensive
in the long run because of high administrative costs and the lack
of cost-consciousness that the third-party payment system instills.
<p>
It would make better economic sense for businesses or individuals
to purchase a &quot;high-deductible&quot; health insurance plan
(which costs less in monthly premiums), combined with an MSA for
health care expenses below the deductible level.  (This type of
arrangement, however, does not enjoy equitable tax treatment under
current law.)  The Business Coalition for Affordable Health Care
estimates that approximately 10 percent of Americans spend <I>more
than</I> $2,000 per year on medical expenses.  A March/April 1994
<I>Journal of American Health Policy</I> study (using 1994 dollars)
of one million Americans showed that one-third of the population
filed no claims in 1989; 73 percent filed $500 or less in claims;
82 percent filed  $1,000 or less; and 89 percent filed $2,000
or less.  &quot;In other words, if this group had a $2,000 deductible
MSA, only 11 percent would have reached the deductible,&quot;
the editors noted.  An MSA empowers consumers to pay for routine
medical expenses from their account and to keep the unspent funds
for future health care needs, thus creating incentives for shopping
around and wise spending.  Medical expenditures from the MSAs
are applied against the deductible until the deductible (out-of-pocket
expense) is met, at which point the insurance coverage begins.
<p>
<center><h3>PRIVATE COMPANIES UTILIZE MSAs</h3></center>
<p>
Because of these positive features, more than 2,000 large and
small companies have begun offering MSAs to their employees, with
great success, even though current federal law does not exempt
contributions to such accounts.   Interestingly, seven states
have achieved tax fairness in their state income tax codes by
exempting contributions to MSAs.
<p>
A March 1995 Cato Institute study analyzed several companies and
states that provide MSAs, noting dramatic cost-savings and improvement
in customer satisfaction.  Consider these two examples:
<p><blockquote>
Dramatic savings from using MSAs have also been achieved at Windham
Hospital in Willimantic, Conn., with 1,000 employees.  In 1993
the hospital switched from a pure first-dollar coverage plan with
no deductible or co-payments to a plan with a $500 deductible.
 It also contributes $10 per week, or $520 per year, to an MSA
for each worker.  In addition, the hospital negotiated discounts
for its employees when they pay for health services with MSA funds.
 The hospital itself offers discounts of 30 percent, area doctors
offer price reductions of 20 percent, and drugstores cut prices
by 10 percent.
<p>
Under the old plan, the hospital's employees used medical services
35 percent more than the community average.  After one year under
the new plan, however, the entire 35 percent excess was eliminated.
 Moreover, projected health costs for the hospital employees were
reduced by about 50 percent.
<p></blockquote>
The study even cites the case of The United Mine Workers Union
that successfully negotiated for MSAs in their contract. 
<p><blockquote>
Under an agreement with the Bituminous Coal Operators Association,
covering about 15,000 employees, coal mine operators now provide
workers insurance with a $1,000 deductible replacing a zero deductible
under the old health plan.  The employees are each provided a
$1,000 cash bonus at the beginning of the year that they can use
for health care expenses below the deductible.  At the end of
the year, workers can keep for any use whatsoever any portion
of the bonus they do not use for health care.
<p></blockquote>
<center><h3>HELP FOR LOWER-INCOME FAMILIES</h3></center>
<p>
Companies that have MSAs have found they are most popular among
lower-income employees.  Under conventional insurance plans, low-income
employees would have to meet their $250 or $500 deductible with
after-tax dollars before they could access their insurance.  A
single mother earning $14,000 or $15,000 a year may find it difficult
to meet the deductible when rent, transportation, taxes, grocery
bills and other needs for her children are pressing.  An MSA allows
these low-income earners first dollar coverage, permitting them
to get medical care when they or their children need it.  This
feature alone could significantly reduce the level of emergency
room utilization for non-emergency care.  Low-income wage earners
would have, in effect, first-dollar coverage for medical care
up to the amount in their MSA.
<p>
<center><h3>LEGISLATIVE PROPOSALS IN CONGRESS</h3></center>
<p>
Congress has proposed several variations of MSA legislation, but
generally this legislation has been designed to end the current
tax discrimination against MSAs.  MSAs are flexible and would
operate as a <I>tax-free</I>, portable account which can be used
to pay medical bills (including those for eyeglasses and dental
care), in conjunction with a high-deductible (or &quot;catastrophic&quot;)
health insurance plan.  Contributions made by employers, the self-employed
or individuals would be tax-free.  If one needs to withdraw money
for non-medical expenses, the funds are taxed and a 10 percent
penalty applies.
<p>
MSA proposals have gained bipartisan support but have never passed
in Congress.  Now, the 104th Congress has the chance to pass an
MSA bill, such as the Family Medical Savings and Investment Act
of 1995, H.R. 1818, introduced by Reps. Bill Archer (R-Texas)
and Andrew Jacobs (D-Ind.).  This bill allows contributions made
to MSAs by employers, the self-employed, and individuals to be
tax-deductible.  Through tax fairness, the bill also helps the
uninsured, future senior citizens, and employed mothers, who will
no longer be forced to accept full-time employment to receive
tax-deductible health coverage.  The estimated cost of H.R. 1818
is $1.77 billion over seven years, according to the Joint Committee
on Taxation.  Sen. Charles Grassley (R-Iowa) recently introduced
a virtually  identical MSA proposal in the Senate, S. 1247. 
<p>
Under H.R. 1818 and S. 1247, there are annual limits on the amount
of money that can be placed in such accounts ($2,500 for an individual
or $5,000 for a family).  A 10 percent penalty is levied if the
money is withdrawn for non-medical expenses.  In addition, money
for non-medical expenses is also taxed as income, since the money
was deposited tax free.  As in the case of IRAs, a 10 percent
penalty would encourage savings and discourage frivolous non-medical
spending. 
<p>
The MSA is essentially a trust created exclusively for the purpose
of paying qualified medical expenses (QME) of the account holder
and his or her family.   Distributions for QMEs are excluded from
gross income.  QMEs are defined by section 213 (d) of the IRS
code, except that MSA expenses for insurance premiums other than
catastrophic plans or long-term care insurance premiums would
not be included.
<p>
H.R. 1818 has passed the House Ways and Means Committee and will
be included in the budget reconciliation package for consideration
under &quot;closed rules&quot; on the House floor.  That means
no amendments may be offered.  The reconciliation bill is an omnibus
&quot;must-pass&quot; budget package slated for a vote in October.

MSA account.
<p>
<li>People laid-off or unemployed can use MSA funds to continue
to purchase high-deductible private health insurance.
</ul><p>
Let's say an employer, for example, will spend $4,000 per year
on health insurance for an individual.  The employer decides to
use that $4,000 for an MSA for his employee.  The employer purchases
a high-deductible insurance policy which costs $2,000 per year.
 The policy has a deductible of $2,500.  The employer then deposits
$2,000 into the MSA, from which the employee draws to meet routine
medical expenses.  Therefore, as an equation, the example above
would look like this: 
<p>
<center>
$4,000  =  $2,000 in premium costs for a health insurance policy<br>
with a $2,500 deductible  +  $2,000 deposited in the MSA
</center><p>
Next year, the employer deposits another $2,000 (usually in monthly
allotments) in the employee's MSA.  If the employee only spent
$1,000 the first year, then the employee would have $1,000 left
in the MSA at the beginning of the second year, when that year's
$2,000 would be deposited.  Therefore, the employee would have
$3,000 in the MSA at the beginning of the second year.  
<p>
Once initially set up, an MSA is useful in times of temporary
unemployment or in-between jobs.  The same <I>Journal of American
Health Policy</I> (cited above) reports that &quot;41 percent
of persons losing private health insurance have an uninsured spell
that ends within one to three months, and 71 percent have a dry
spell that ends within four months.&quot;   The &quot;portable&quot;
feature of  MSAs can prevent &quot;job lock&quot; - that is, a
situation in which someone feels &quot;forced&quot; to remain
in a job because of fear of losing good health benefits.   Those
unfortunate families who are chronically unemployed or earning
wages below the poverty level, will still be eligible for public
health programs, such as Medicaid and SSI, which will continue
to provide aid to the working poor.
<p>
<center><h3>TYPICAL FEATURES OF  H.R. 1818/S. 1247:</h3></center>
<p><ul>
<I>* tax free account, similar to IRA, for medical expenses</I><br>
<I>* employer or individual makes contribution (limit $)</I><br>
<I>* choose own doctor</I><br>
<I>* portable </I><br>
<I>* money in account rolls over year to year </I><br>
<I>* no claims, no new government bureaucracy or administrative
costs</I><br>
<I>* can withdraw savings for retirement at 59 1/2 years old</I><br>
<I>* 10 percent penalty for withdrawal for non-medical use</I><br>
<p></ul>
<center><h3>MEDICARE</h3></center>
<p>
As one possible alternative to Medicare, both House and Senate
committees have proposed  tax-free &quot;Medisave&quot; accounts,
similar to those proposed for working families, as a potential
option for seniors.  In the future, these Medisave accounts have
the potential to save seniors and the health care system money
by allowing personal account funds to be used to pay for expenses
not covered by the traditional health insurance plan, such as
prescription drugs or long-term care insurance premiums.   If
the money is spent wisely, there will be money left in the account
for next year's health expenses or for non-medical expenses (with
a small penalty).  This will help give the elderly and their families
an opportunity to best use the money.  It takes decisions away
from the Washington bureaucrats.  The House Ways and Means and
Senate Finance Committees have approved a medical savings account
option that combines a high-deductible insurance policy with a
Medicare MSA.   
<p>
<center><h3>SUMMARY</h3></center>
<p>
FRC believes Medical Savings Accounts are family-friendly health
care reform.  Ultimately, all health care reform legislation should
be judged within the following family-based guidelines:  
<p><ul>
<li>Fosters Genuine Compassion
<li>Makes Prudence Pay
<li>Promotes Family Autonomy
<li>Recognizes the Family's Contribution to Good Health
<li>Empowers Families to Act
<p></ul>

<h2>YOUTH GANGS: OUT OF<br>
CONTROL AND GETTING<br>
WORSE</h2>

<p>
A recent decline in violent crime appears to be more a result
of fewer teenagers than better law enforcement.  When the current
bumper crop of elementary-age children become adolescents, the
violent crime rate is likely to explode.
<p>
A growing chorus of experts warn of the impending youth crime
crisis.  Reggie Walton, a Washington, D.C. Superior Court judge
who handles juvenile cases, blames it on the disappearance of
fathers.  Walton says fathers leave children to be raised by young
mothers who themselves are often struggling with mental or emotional
problems, limited education, poverty and addiction.  Walton labels
these children &quot;walking time bombs.&quot;[1]
<p>
This time bomb has been in the making for some time.  Youth violent
crime has been rising dramatically for more than a decade.  Today,
and historically, young males commit far more crimes than other
age groups.
<p>
The volatile mix of more chronic juvenile delinquents and an upward
surge in youthful perpetrators of violence is complemented by
an unprecedented growth in youth living with little or no adult
supervision.  Consider some recent examples.
<p><ul>
<li>A Los Angeles family takes a wrong turn into gang territory
and is fired upon.  A 3-year-old is killed and her 2-year-old
brother wounded.
<p><li>A Chinese immigrant in Brooklyn is kidnapped by a Chinatown
gang which demands ransom payments from her family.  She is murdered
when the family fails to pay.
<p><li>Two FBI agents and a police sergeant are murdered inside the
Washington, D.C. police headquarters by a gang member.
<p><li>A Pittsburgh police sergeant walking home with his daughter
is killed with his own gun after he stops and confronts a gang
spraying graffiti on a street.
</ul><p>
<center><h3>WALKING TIME BOMBS</h3></center>
<p>
Vice President Albert Gore recently told the White House press
corps, &quot;Gangs have been a major cause of the growth in violent
crime in the past decade.&quot;[2] He cited a Treasury Department
report that found the presence of rival gangs, the Bloods and
the Crips, in 35 states and 58 cities across the country.
<p>
At the same press conference, Attorney General Janet Reno cited
the impact of disabling one gang in New Haven, Connecticut.  Eighteen
members of the &quot;Jungleboy&quot; street gang were put in jail,
and, according to Reno, New Haven's murder rate fell by one-third
in 1993.[3]
<p>
Given that youth gangs account for a disproportionate share of
youth violence, their potential for contributing to a future crime
wave is enormous.
<p>
At the current growth rate, there will be nearly half-a-million
more adolescent boys in the year 2010 than today.  That means
if current trends continue, we will have perhaps 30,000 more chronic
juvenile delinquents by the year 2010 than today.  Chronic youth
offenders comprise 7 percent of all male teenagers and they commit
70 percent of all serious crime for their age group.[4]
<p>
If history is any predictor, these adolescents will be more violent
than the current delinquents.  According to the Department of
Justice, today's youth are extremely violent.  Firearms are now
used by three-fourths of all juvenile homicide offenders and 
one-third of all reported violent crime offenders are less than
21 years old.  Juvenile arrests for all violent crime have increased
from 1983 to 1992 in spite of the decline in the overall number
of teenagers in the U.S. population.  The government estimates
that the juvenile arrest rate for major violent crime will more
than double by the year 2010.[5]
<p>
This ticking youth time bomb is evident everywhere.  California
authorities report that incarcerations of violent youth increased
from 44 percent of the prison population in 1987 to 61 percent
in 1992[6]. There is no sign of a turnaround.  Officials in the
upscale Washington, D.C. suburb of Fairfax, Virginia, report that
the number of juveniles arrested for violent crimes has climbed
61 percent since 1991.  The number of youth arrested with weapons
has risen 118 percent since 1989.[7]
<p>
A 1993 report by the Washington State Department of Community
Development states, &quot;Our state and nation are awash in a
tidal wave of violence, violence that has reached epidemic proportions
especially among our youngest generation.&quot;[8]
<p>
Professor Dean Rojek, a sociologist at the University of Georgia,
says, &quot;For decades violent crime was driven mostly by adults,
with kids involved mostly in property crime....What's been changing is 
that you have juveniles becoming much more involved in violent offenses, 
with the use of weapons. If we add to this more babies, you could have a 
multiplier effect...a mini explosion [in violent crime by youth].&quot;[9]
<p>
Attorney General Janet Reno agrees.  &quot;Unless we act now,&quot;
says Reno, &quot;to stop young people from choosing a life of
violence and crime, the beginning of the 21st century could bring
levels of violent crime to our community that far exceed what
we have experienced.&quot;[10]
<p>
<center><h3>GANGS EXACERBATE THE PROBLEM</h3></center>
<p>
The bomb's fuse is shortened by the youth gang phenomenon.  California
authorities describe the youth gang as a &quot;violent and insidious
new form of organized crime.  Heavily armed with sophisticated
weapons, (gangs) are involved in drug trafficking, witness intimidation,
extortion, and bloody territorial wars.  In some cases they are
traveling out of state to spread their violence and crime.&quot;[11]
<p>
According to the FBI,  &quot;The fastest growing murder circumstance
is juvenile gang killings.&quot;[12] Almost one-third of Los Angeles'
homicides are gang related.[13] Nationwide, the rate of violent offenses
by gang members is three times as high as for non-gang delinquents.[14]
<p>
There's something about young males belonging to a gang that makes
them more violent.
<p><ul>
<li>Orange County, California probation statistics indicate that
gang-related youth had significantly higher law-violation rates (55.1 percent) 
than non-gang affiliated youth (26.4 percent).[15] A study of 20 years of 
data collected by Philadelphia's police gang unit shows that &quot;gangs
engage in more violent behavior than do delinquent non-gang groups.&quot;[16]
<p>
<li>Metropolitan Life surveyed schools about gang violence.  It
found that more than half (59 percent) of law enforcement and one-third (34 
percent) of students and teachers say gang or group membership is a major
cause of violence in schools.[17]
<p>
<li>A study in Wisconsin found that most violent crimes by youths
were committed by groups of three or more.  This &quot;pack&quot; behavior, 
not surprisingly, seems to be at the core of much of the rise in youth
crime.[18]
<p>
<li>A study of New York City teenage gunshot victims found that
40 percent were shot during school hours.  Another study found that of 
children and teenagers wounded in drive-by shootings in Los Angeles, 71 
percent were &quot;documented members of street gangs.&quot;[19]
<p></ul>
Not only do gang members tend to be more violent than non-gang
members, but gang membership appears to prolong one's criminal
career.  One study found that a &quot;large portion of persistent
and dangerous juvenile gang offenders become even more serious
adult offenders.&quot;[20] Another study in California found that
previously-incarcerated gang members continued their lives of
crime after being released.[21]
<p>
<center><h3>GANGS - AN AMERICAN PHENOMENON?</h3></center>
<p>
As early as the 1600s, London was &quot;terrorized by a series
of organized gangs...[who] fought pitched battles among themselves
dressed with colored ribbons to distinguish the different factions.&quot;[22]
 Gang problems have been reported in most of Europe, the former
Soviet Union, Africa, South America, Mexico, New Zealand and Japan.
<p>
One of the first reports of youth gangs in America comes from
Philadelphia.  In 1791, that city's leaders convened a conference
to decide how to deal with bands of disruptive youth.[23]
<p>
New York City had a similar problem in the 19th century.  New
York's gangs tended to be political agents for the Know Nothing
or Native American Party.  During the early Civil War years there
were draft riots which may have been started by Irish street gangs.[24]
<p>
The classic movie, <I>West Side Story</I>, is stereotypical of
20th century gang life.  The Sharks and the Jets are territorial
gangs protecting their neighborhoods.  Until recently, however,
gangs like these were not considered a threat to the general population.
<p>
Neither a 1967 presidential commission on law enforcement nor
the 1976 National Advisory Committee on Criminal Standards and
Goals foresaw today's gang problem. They concluded, &quot;Youth
gangs are not now or [sic] should not become a major object of
concern....Youth gang violence is not a major problem in the United
States....What gang violence does exist can fairly readily be
diverted into 'constructive' channels, especially through the
provision of services by community agencies.&quot;[25]
<p>
<center><h3>WHY ARE GANGS SPREADING?</h3></center>
<p>
Gangs are spreading across the country and are not just limited
to major cities.  Bernard Friedlander, a University of Hartford psychology 
professor and a violence expert, says, &quot;This is an American problem, 
not an inner-city problem....It's spreading slowly....On one level it's 
simple fad imitation...but on another level the
isolation of youth is just as profound in some of the more stable
areas as in the inner city.&quot;[26]
<p>
Ed Edelman, a Los Angeles supervisor, said, &quot;Gangs are very
mobile today.  They don't just stay in one area.  They are not just limited 
to poor areas of the country.  They are all over the place.&quot;[27]
<p>
The spread of gangs can be attributed to at least three factors.
 First, parents, desiring to protect their gang-culture-saturated
children from the hometown gang's influence, send them to relatives
across the country.  Sometimes this strategy works.  But many
times it merely helps transplant the gang culture into a new community.
<p>
The drug trade has created entrepreneurial gangs which fan out
across the country to ply their trade and expand their markets.
 Franchises of the Bloods and the Crips are now in most metropolitan
centers.  With their expansion, they have introduced collateral,
gang-like violence.
<p>
Finally, the entertainment industry contributes to the spread
of gangs.  The gang culture, value system and mentality are sprinkled
across the country through movies, &quot;gangsta&quot; rap music
and now comic books.  These cultural amplifiers educate young
audiences to gang values and attitudes.  They denigrate women,
promote exaggerated manhood or  &quot;machismo,&quot; and glorify
violence.  They also pass on gang language, symbols, activities,
and traditions.[28]
<p>
<center><h3>GANG NUMBERS, LOCATION AND TYPES</h3></center>
<p>
According to Justice Department estimates, the United States has
some 1,436 gangs and 120,636 gang members.  They exist in large,
mid-sized and small communities and in suburban areas.[29]
<p>
The Justice Department figures are disputed by the National School
Safety Center, which in 1993 estimated that the Los Angeles area
alone has at least 959 gangs with approximately 125,000 gang members.[30]
 Another report states that more than 350,000 gang members reside
along the West Coast.[31] To further confuse the issue, a 1975 study
found a total of 760 to 2,700 gangs in the nation's eight largest
cities.[32]
<p>
There are many types of gangs.  Some are black, white, Asian,
Hispanic or other ethnic-centered gangs.  Others are structured
around territory, commercial activities, corporate businesses,
political agendas, religion, music and special types of crime.
<p><ul>
<li><B>Race/ethnic-based gangs</B>:  Larry Rawles, deputy director
of Philadelphia's Crisis Intervention Network, says, &quot;When any ethnic 
group was at the bottom, they formed gangs -- the Jews, the Irish, the 
Italians.&quot;[33] Gangs offered status, a sense of self-worth, 
and protection.  Today, most gangs are racially segregated (54.6
percent are African American and 32.6 percent are Hispanic).  Blacks and 
Hispanics constitute the largest numbers of youths arrested for gang 
offenses today.[34]
<p>
The all-black rival gangs, the Crips and the Bloods, have an estimated
70,000 members in Los Angeles County alone.[35] They have franchises
in most states and metropolitan communities where they tend to
dominate the crack cocaine trade.
<p>
Darlyne Pettinicchio, a probation officer in Orange County, California,
says, &quot;(White gangs are) punk rockers and heavy metalers
(who) come from all socio-economic classes.  They're of average
intelligence and they're capable youngsters.  They have very little
parental authority.  They're usually angry.  Their dance is violent.
 Their music is violent.  Their behavior is violent.  They're
into anarchy.&quot;[36]
<p>
There are numerous Hispanic, Satanic cult, Asian, and Stoner (punk
rock and heavy metal) gangs.  Each has a subculture and each tends
to be very violent and involved in the use and or distribution
of illicit drugs.
<p>
<li><B>Economic-based gangs</B>:  Some gangs are organized around
a commercial activity. Members may be all from a single race or the same 
neighborhood or they may be very diverse.  The glue that holds them together
is making money.
<p>
They often see themselves as Robin Hoods or Bonnie-and-Clyde types
who practice their own version of free enterprise.  A close cousin
is the corporate gang, which selects a type of industry or business
and dominates the field through intimidation and violence.   For
example, there was a Miami-based gang called the &quot;Mazda boys&quot;
who specialized in stealing Mazda cars.
<p>
<li><B>Territorial gangs</B>:  Territorial gangs can be from any
race or ethnic background. They lay claim to a particular territory. They 
typically &quot;tag&quot; their territory with gang graffiti and are 
willing to defend their turf to the death. When their territory is invaded 
the gang provides &quot;warriors.&quot;
<p></ul>
<center><h3>WHO JOINS A GANG?</h3></center>
<p>
No matter the type of gang, most gang members are male.  A Chicago
study of four police districts found that only 2 to 5 percent
of gang arrestees were female.[37] These females are typically auxiliary
gang members.
<p>
Gang members range in age from 8 to 22 years old, but there are
exceptions where tenure is often well beyond 22 to perhaps more
than 40 years old.[38] A counselor in a juvenile detention facility
in California said: &quot;(If) you find a gang member who comes
from a complete nuclear family, a kid who has never been exposed
to any kind of abuse, I'd like to meet him....a real 'gangbanger'
who comes from a happy, balanced home, who's got a good opinion
of himself.  I don't think that kid exists.&quot;[39]
<p>
Sydney Harris, a nationally syndicated columnist, said, &quot;Gang
members tend to be chronic losers, who can accomplish nothing
individually, or who live in so depressed an environment that
only by banding together can they exercise any influence over
their lives.  In both cases, they are as much to be pitied as
condemned.&quot;[40]
<p>
Allen Frazier, superintendent of schools for Plymouth, Connecticut,
blames economic problems.  &quot;As people have more economic
problems in the adult world,&quot; says Frazier, &quot;it transfers
to the young people as well....[The children] don't seem to have
a place where they are comfortable.  In order to seek that, sometimes
they end up with the security of a gang....It becomes an extended
family which they may not have.&quot;[41]
<p>
A gang researcher says, &quot;These gang kids have nothing to
do that they perceive as useful.  They are the disconnected, alienated
ones.  They identify with whatever is trendy in terms of music,
clothes, and in terms of behavior.  They are living entirely on
the surface of life.&quot;[42]
<p>
Prisons are often referred to as gang training schools.  Often
gangs are formed in prison and then emigrate to the streets. 
The cohesion associated with jail time amplifies gang loyalty.
<p>
Fred Williams, the executive director for Common Ground Foundation,
a Watts [Los Angeles, California] nonprofit organization that
works with gang youth, says, &quot;Prison doesn't scare them.
 It's a home away from home.&quot;[43]
<p>
<center><h3>GANG CULTURE</h3></center>
<p>
Professor Cornel West, a Princeton University social scholar,
says in his book <I>Race Matters</I> that the nihilistic thinking
of the inner city black community sets the stage for gang formation.
 West says, &quot;The frightening result is a numbing detachment
from others and a self-destructive disposition toward the world.
 Life without meaning, hope, and love breeds a cold-hearted, mean-spirited
outlook that destroys both the individual and others.&quot;[44]
<p>
The youth gang satisfies a void.  It provides the child a sense
of identity, belonging, power, and protection.  The gang satisfies
the child's desire to feel secure.  Living in a high-risk environment
without paternal protection, the young gangster satisfies his
insecurities by aligning himself with a gang, his surrogate family.
 The gang provides a protective barrier against the outside forces.
<p>
One gang member says, &quot;Being in a gang means if I didn't
have no family, I think that's where I'll be.  If I didn't have
no job that's where I'd be.  To me it's community help without
all the community.  They'll understand better than my mother and
father.&quot;[45]
<p>
His new &quot;family&quot; has a distinct set of values that affect
every aspect of his life.  According to the Los Angeles District
Attorney, the gang culture is radically different from the mainline
culture.  &quot;It confronts and confounds adult authority on
every level -- sex, work, power, love, education, language, dress,
music, drugs, alcohol, violence.  As icons of popular culture,
gangs not only represent a powerful group identity utterly inaccessible
to adults, they are surrounded with an appealing aura of outlaw
danger.&quot;[46]
<p>
Visible manifestations of the gang culture include colors, signs,
symbols, graffiti, and tattoos.  Gang colors, different types
of clothing and head covering help distinguish one gang from another.
 Even some National Football League players who are connected
to gangs wear gang-colored bandanas.
<p>
Gangs often have their peculiar vocabulary.  Many black street
gangs address each other as &quot;cuz&quot; for cousin.  They
often have code words and many speak like &quot;rappers.&quot;
<p>
&quot;Tagging&quot; their territory with gang graffiti is common.
 It proclaims the presence of the gang and offers a challenge
to rivals.  It may claim credit for a crime.  The denser the graffiti,
the closer one is to the gang's core territory.  The Crips often
mark &quot;B/K&quot; for &quot;Bloods killers.&quot;
<p>
Gang behavior is characterized by extreme loyalty.  Members never
inform on &quot;homeboys,&quot; even if faced with death.  Once
in a gang, the member faces long odds of ever leaving alive.
<p>
Captain Russell Holyfield of the Hartford Police Department describes
gang protocol.  &quot;You give someone a dirty look,&quot; says
Holyfield, &quot;or say something about their girlfriend and later
on that day, you're a target.&quot;[47]
<p>
A Los Angeles District Attorney gang study describes the macho-psychology
of the gang culture.  &quot;The gang's ideal man is virtually
identical to the romantic myth of the gunfighter of the Old West
-- a two-fisted, hard-drinking, dangerous man who is quick to
avenge any insult; he lives and dies by violence, with his exploits
rousing fear and respect in the hearts of men, and in the hearts
of women, fear and desire.&quot;[48]
<p>
&quot;Gangsta&quot; rap is filled with messages that glorify violence,
extreme abuse of women and disrespect for authority.  The rapper's
lyrics paint a realistic picture of daily gangster activity.
<p>
Despite this, some gangs have an odd sense of civility.  A Los
Angeles Hispanic gang member says, &quot;When I'm out on the streets,
I know I'm safe if I'm with my mom.  You don't disrespect anybody
if they are with their mom.&quot;[49]
<p>
Partying and fighting, the core activities of a gang, are what
draw many young males.  According to the Los Angeles District
Attorney's report, &quot;These are the things that build and define
group loyalties.  Even criminality, which is probably the public's
main perception of what gangs are about, is less a core value
of the gang than a byproduct of the emphasis on partying and fighting.&quot;[50]
<p>
Sergeant Joe Guzman with the Los Angeles Sheriff's Department
explains prison's influence on the gang culture:  &quot;One prison
gang member might see that another gang member had something he
wanted.  If he was larger, more powerful or had more back-up from
his 'homeboys' than the other inmate, he literally just took the
item he wanted.  If he was angered in one fashion or another he
retaliated with deadly vengeance and commanded the presence of
his entire gang to back him up.&quot;[51]
<p>
<center><h3>GANG ORGANIZATION</h3></center>
<p>
Gangs are loosely organized.  Some are part of larger structures
known as &quot;nations,&quot; which are networked nationwide.
 But most are loosely knit groups with several leaders.
<p>
The 1960 New York City Youth Board proposed a theory of gang structure,
stating gangs are structured both vertically and horizontally.
 The vertical gang is structured along age lines and draws members
from local neighborhoods.  The horizontal gang has older members
who are drawn from a larger area.[52] This type of gang tends to
evolve into coalitions, supergangs and nations.  The term &quot;supergang&quot;
was coined in Chicago in the late 1960s to describe a gang with
thousands of members.[53]
<p>
Virtually every gang is built from groups called &quot;cliques.&quot;
 One gang researcher called the clique a &quot;spontaneous interest
group usually of the conflict type which forms itself within some
larger social structure such as a gang.&quot;[54] Members of cliques
tend to be similar in age.
<p>
Gang leaders are chosen by natural selection based on the person's
age, physical stature, arrest record and behavior.  Like any organization,
according to one researcher, the &quot;ability to get along with
people is one of the basic skills associated with gang leadership.&quot;[55]
<p>
Some gangs have formal leaders known as king, prince, prime minister,
general, don, or chief .  Others are informal, known as &quot;shot
callers&quot; or &quot;shooters.&quot;   Leadership responsibilities
may be shared and based upon a &quot;collection of functions that
may be undertaken at various times by a number of members.&quot;[56]

<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>
<p>
&quot;We've got so many kids out there who've lost hope, who believe
in only living for today,&quot; says John Turner, chief of police
for the city of Mountlake Terrace, Washington. &quot;They join
a gang and get involved in criminal activity because there aren't
any people taking them by the hand in simple terms and pointing
them in the right direction, giving them self-esteem and positive
feedback.&quot;[57]
<p>
Perhaps gangs exist because modern society has failed to harness
the male hunter/predator instinct and converted those energies
to familial provider/protector efforts.  Delinquent young people
lacking values, conscience or a sense of remorse can easily find
themselves drawn to the gang lifestyle.
<p>
Noted author James Q. Wilson writes in <I>The Moral Sense</I>
that modern society with its &quot;rapid technological change,
intense division of labor, and ambiguous allocation of social
roles, frequently leaves some men out, with their aggressive predispositions
either uncontrolled or undirected.  Gangs are one result.&quot;[58]
<p>
Wilson says the profits from illegal drug sales provide gang members
economic opportunities which combine with their uncontrolled aggression
to develop a &quot;warrior culture that underinvests in family
life.&quot;
<p>
Converting male energy to familial provider/protector efforts
has always been the task of the intact family.  But the nuclear
family is declining, especially in predominantly black inner cities
where gangs dominate life and rain violent crime.  Many of these
children join gangs to find purpose, security, and self-esteem.
 The gang culture gives them a sense of belonging and remakes
their value system.  Partying, fighting, and vicious gang loyalty
become their primary values, thus pushing aside virtues that favor
family life.  This is a vicious cycle and it must be broken.
<p>
Defusing the youth crime bomb must include a strategy to dismantle
the growing youth gang movement.  Gangs are the powder magazine
-- they must be dealt with before the bomb goes off.

<title>CONGRESS MAY FORM A COMMISSION TO STUDY LEGALIZED GAMBLING</title>

<p>
<h2>CONGRESS MAY FORM A<br>
COMMISSION TO STUDY<br>
LEGALIZED GAMBLING</h2>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>

<p>
<i>Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>
<p>
America is experiencing a wave of legalized gambling. Some consider
government-sponsored betting a financial godsend, but for others
it is a social and economic disaster that will stop only when
the public says enough is enough.
<p>
Gambling has grown in an ad hoc manner with states and cities
emulating others that appear to be successful. Officials look
with envy as citizens go to other states and cities to wager.
But as one politician who led the battle to legalize gambling
in Atlantic City warned, &quot;Casino gambling is not a 'try it
and see' experiment. Once the casino opens and the dice begin
to roll, gambling creates an instant constituency. People depend
on it for jobs. Governments depend on it for revenues.&quot;[1]
<p>
Rep. Frank Wolf (R-Va.) has introduced legislation intended to
discover the true nature of gambling. Wolf's bill, the National
Gambling Impact and Policy Commission Act, calls for the creation
of a two-year commission to study gambling. The Act was approved
by voice vote November 8, 1995, by the House Judiciary Committee
and is expected to see House floor debate in 1996.[2]
<p>
A similar bill has been introduced in the Senate by Paul Simon
(D-Ill.) and Richard Lugar (R-Ind.).[3] The proposed commission will
examine policies and practices with respect to legalization or
prohibition of gambling and make recommendations for legislation
and administrative action.
<p>
This legislation is considered necessary because of the gradual
creation of 37 state lotteries and the expansion of casino gambling
to 23 states (prompted in part by the Indian Gaming Regulatory
Act of 1988) as well as an avalanche of gaming promoters selling
government officials on the economic benefits of legalization.
These sponsors sell legalization as an economic boon and a harmless
recreational pastime, but there is considerable evidence that
this rush to easy money actually costs the taxpayer more than
it harvests.
<p>
Columnist William Safire speaks for many when he labels gambling
&quot;a $40-billion-a-year industry that is inherently immoral,
corrupting public officials, enriching criminals, addicting and
impoverishing the young and the vulnerable.&quot;[4] He supports
the legislation now pending in the 104th Congress.
<p>
According to Congressman Wolf's bill, the proposed federal commission
would consider 11 broad areas. The following summarizes what is
already known about some of these areas.
<p>
<center><h3>ECONOMIC IMPACT</h3></center>
<p>
Tunica County, Mississippi was known as the poorest county in
the country. In January 1992, it had an unemployment rate of 26.2
percent and a per capita income of $11,865. More than half of
its citizens were on food stamps.[5]
<p>
Since legalized gambling came to Tunica County, land values have
skyrocketed from $250 to $25,000 per acre. Over a billion dollars
in building permits have been granted. The nine area casinos each
average 1,000 employees, bringing unemployment down to 4.9 percent.
Child support collections have doubled, welfare benefits have
been nearly halved, food stamp recipients have decreased and property
taxes have been cut one-third.[6]
<p>
Webster Franklin, executive director of the Tunica County chamber
of commerce, is a gambling fan. He told a House committee in September
1995 that gambling is the best thing to happen to his county.
<p>
Such reports cause officials of money-strapped government agencies
to salivate. Detroit, for example, equates casinos with economic
salvation. For years, gambling citizens have crossed the Detroit
River to make wagers in Canada.
<p>
John Kelly, a lawyer and former Michigan state senator who opposed
gambling when he was in the legislature, now works for a local
investment group. He said the presence of Canadian casinos across
the river has been persuasive to him. He wants Detroit to reap
some of the profit from gambling rather than watch locals cross
the border to wager. Michigan Governor John Engler has appointed
an 11-member commission to study whether an Indian-run casino
would benefit the city.[7]
<p>
The story in Mobile, Alabama, is quite different. Mayor Mike Dow
believed that $63 million was spent by Alabama residents at nearby
Gulfport, Mississippi gambling casinos. When Mayor Dow investigated
bringing casinos to his city, he found the price was too high.
<p>
Forty-one of Mobile's social service agency CEO's were tasked
to determine the probable effects of introducing casinos. The
five-month study found that introducing casinos would cost the
city $15 million more each year in increased social service costs.
<p>
Charles White, CEO, Franklin Memorial Health Care Center of Mobile,
said, &quot;Our social service staff is already seeing an impact
from casinos in Mississippi....We see families selling their food
stamps and WIC vouchers for gambling money, and we are aware of
one family who lost its home.&quot;[8]
<p>
Joyce Collier, executive director of Mobile's Family Counseling
Center, states: &quot;[in the Biloxi/Gulfport area] families have
lost everything that they have worked for in terms of physical
holdings....Some clients have pawned car titles and lost transportation....Our
family counselors report increased alcohol and drug abuse and
spouse abuse.&quot;[9]
<p>
In 1994, Florida governor Lawton Chiles sponsored an economic
impact study of gambling. He found that Florida could anticipate
gambling revenues ranging from $324 to $469 million each year,
but that collateral costs outstripped the gain. Sales tax revenues
would drop $84.7 million, and crime and social costs attributable
to casinos were estimated to reach between $2.16 and $3.8 billion
annually.[10]
<p>
University of Nevada professor of public administration William
Thompson explained Florida's dilemma. Casinos generate significant
new tax revenues &quot;only if they can export their product.
The local economy doesn't benefit if only local people are gambling.&quot;[11]
Florida's geography is unlike Atlantic City and Las Vegas, which
draw gamblers from other states and send them packing with the
residue of gambling pathologies. That tab is absorbed by the gamblers'
home states. But Florida believes most of its potential gamblers
would be residents and not out-of-state tourists.
<p>
National gambling expert Robert Goodman studied the industry's
claims of economic benefits for the Ford Foundation and the Aspen
Institute. He says there is a critical lack of objective knowledge
and research about the real economic and social costs and benefits
of legalizing gambling. He warns that the research often used
by public officials tends to be unbalanced because it has been
provided by the gambling industry.[12]
<p>
Goodman's 1994 study analyzed 14 gambling industry studies concluding
that &quot;hiding the costs&quot; of gambling was widespread and
gambling acted as &quot;economic cannibalism&quot; on pre-existing
economies and other businesses.[13]
<p>
John Kindt, a professor of commerce at the University of Illinois,
has estimated that for every dollar that states take in from gambling
they pay three dollars to social agencies and crime fighting.
A problem gambler costs the state an average of $13,000 a year
in social impact.[14]
<p>
<center><h3>IMPACT ON BUSINESS</h3></center>
<p>
Louisiana gambled and is now paying the price. That state legalized
riverboat gambling and a few land-based casinos several years
ago. Recent events show the error of that decision.
<p>
Mike Foster, a Republican who ran on an anti-gambling platform,
was recently elected governor. He promises a state referendum
on gambling's future within a year.[15]
<p>
Additionally, on November 22, 1995 Harrah's Jazz Company, a consortium
that was building a 200,000-square-foot casino on New Orleans's
Canal Street, filed for protection under chapter 11 of the federal
bankruptcy law. This action caused the layoff of 3,500 workers
and a net loss of $23.6 million each year for the city. Why? Because
the temporary casino was doing poorly. Gambling investors miscalculated
the appeal of gambling.[16]
<p>
Gambling is leading many communities into economic distress. Atlantic
City has created 43,000 jobs over 10 years, but now the city has
only one business -- gambling. When casinos first came to Atlantic
City, there were 2,100 thriving small businesses. Today the number
is near 1,100 and falling. According to a New Jersey commission
report, &quot;It is clear that retail business and retail employment
in Atlantic City have continued to decline despite the presence
of gambling, and that rampant speculation has rendered the development
of vast parts of Atlantic City difficult if not impossible.&quot;[17]
<p>
In Illinois it was hoped that an economic facelift would result
when riverboats were introduced. But Earl L. Grinols, a University
of Illinois economist, examined the economic data in April 1994.
He found that &quot;riverboat gambling did not create the jobs
that were promised and had very little effect on reducing unemployment.&quot;[18]
He concluded, &quot;Economically speaking, it appears that riverboat
casinos shift jobs as opposed to creating jobs. For example, the
number of independent restaurants drops when a casino opens up.
Car sales have been known to go down with the onset of gambling.&quot;[19]
<p>
A survey by Chicago's Better Government Association (BGA) of 324
business owners in Illinois' riverboat towns found that a majority
said the floating casinos had no effect or a negative effect on
their businesses. BGA director J. Terrence Brunner said, &quot;Clearly,
riverboat gambling has not met the criteria set forth by Illinois
legislators when they sold this to the citizens of Illinois. The
economic development we found was marginal at best. It has not
spurred economic development. It has not created jobs. It has
not boosted tourism, and it certainly has not brought new life
to Illinois rivers or beautified their banks.&quot;[20]
<p>
Jeffrey Bloomberg, state's attorney, Lawrence County, South Dakota,
told the House Committee on Small Business on September 21, 1995,
that since 1988 when casino gambling was legalized for Deadwood,
South Dakota, life has been a nightmare. Real estate values have
skyrocketed, taxes have risen and gaming revenues have been eaten
up by increased administrative, law enforcement and infrastructure
costs.[21]
<p>
When casino gambling swept into three Colorado towns, it radically
changed life for the worse. According to a 1992 <I>Wall Street
Journal</I> article, &quot;[I]nstead of a few slot machines, full-blown
casinos owned by Las Vegas veterans and real-estate developers
have swept in, swallowing many mom-and-pop businesses along the
way. Water, sewer and traffic systems have been overwhelmed, crime
has increased, non-casino businesses face huge tax increases and
the relative calm of local politics has been shattered.&quot;[22]
<p>
Many communities with gambling experience are discovering the
hollow promises of the sponsors of this get-rich-quick industry.
Gambling creates many low paying jobs, diverts consumer dollars
into gambling, cannibalizes small businesses, and saddles those
that remain with burdensome tax liabilities. Gambling has a cumulative
negative economic impact.[23]
<p>
<center><h3>POLITICS AND PUBLIC POLICY IMPACT</h3></center>
<p>
The gambling industry is sophisticated when it comes to getting
what it wants. Consider the Mashantucket Pequot Indians' gambling
operations in Connecticut.
<p>
Today, the 370-member Pequot tribe operates a 17-story, 1,229-room
hotel and casino facility that draws 50,000 visitors a day. The
facility is managed by Gerald Michael Brown, a former New Jersey
deputy attorney general. Brown recently failed to win state support
to expand Pequot gambling to Bridgeport, a New York City suburb,
but it wasn't for lack of trying.[24]
<p>
Brown hired a law firm for $100,000 a month to prowl the halls
of Connecticut's capitol to sway lawmakers. The Pequot tribe ran
television commercials and sent out direct mail appeals touting
the financial benefits for the taxpayer. The cumulative effort
cost the tribe $13 million over four years. The fact is that the
Pequots contribute more to the state coffers than any single organization.[25]
But in November 1995, the state senate, by a majority of 24-10,
shot down the proposal. Count on a comeback.
<p>
The Pequots are generous on the national scene as well. In 1994,
the tribe contributed $215,000 in soft money to the Democratic
party and $465,000 to the Republicans. The industry's total public
contributions for 1993-1994 were $1,642,229.[26] But that doesn't
account for all contributions.
<p>
In June 1995, Steve Wynn, chairman of Mirage Resorts Inc., hosted
a fund-raiser for Senator Robert Dole (R-Kan.) that took in $477,450.
GOP chairman Haley Barbour isn't embarrassed by gambling money.
He said, &quot;It's not my place to be judgmental about issues
when it comes to allowing people to support us...you don't have
to agree with the Republican party on every issue to support us.&quot;[27]
<p>
Wynn is the genius behind the gaming industry's growth explosion,
according to John L. Smith, who writes in<I> Running Scared</I>
that Wynn has &quot;been accused of shadow-waltzing precariously
close to the wise-guy world.&quot; He dealt with a front man for
the Genovese crime family, and one of his associates was a point
man for Chicago mob lieutenant Johnny Rosselli, according to Smith,
who says Wynn was also associated with convicted junk bond felon
Michael Milken.[28]
<p>
The gambling industry understands the importance of politics.
That's why it hired Frank Fahrenkopf, a Nevada lawyer and former
Republican National Committee chairman. He now heads a $4 million
trade group, the American Gambling Association. This group, financed
by the gambling industry, promotes on Capitol Hill the positive
economic benefits of gambling.[29]
<p>
Gambling money and its agents have often been associated with
political corruption. Federal agents are investigating possible
political corruption in Louisiana. In 1995, senior state legislators
allegedly were caught discussing taking bribes from video-poker
lobbyists. Louisiana State Senator Jay Darnemme states, &quot;Greed,
arrogance, money and power -- it's all there....we went into this
very recklessly. Any states considering gambling ought not use
our formula as a model.&quot;[30]
<p>
The speaker of Missouri's House of Representatives resigned under
a cloud of gambling-related political corruption. In August 1991, FBI agents
in Columbia, South Carolina, wrapped up &quot;Operation Lost Trust,&quot;
which resulted in the bribery-related conviction of numerous legislators
and lobbyists.[31]
<p>
Six Arizona legislators pleaded guilty in 1990 to accepting gambling
bribes and that same year seven Kentucky officials were found
guilty of accepting bribes and making false statements. In 1994,
the West Virginia lottery director was sentenced to federal prison
for rigging a video lottery contract.[32]
<p>
The Clinton Administration has been cozy with the Seminole Tribe
of Florida. Clinton's Solicitor General, Drew Days, filed a last
minute, friend-of-the-court brief in the U.S. Supreme Court siding
with the Seminole Indians' case against the state of Florida.
The Seminoles want casino gambling and say Florida has not been
faithful to the 1988 Indian Gaming Regulatory Act.
<p>
President Clinton's outsider support of the Seminoles waves a
red flag in the face of anti-gambling forces. A check of Florida-based
gaming contributors to the 1996 Clinton/Gore Primary Committee
Inc. found only $6,000, however.[33]
<p>
With annual wagers nationwide now topping half-a-trillion dollars
and gambling profits over $40 billion, there is great opportunity
for corruption.
<p>
<center><h3>GAMBLING AND CRIME</h3></center>
<p>
On October 16, 1995, Joseph Curran, Jr., Maryland's attorney general,
published that state's analysis of the link between gambling and
crime. Curran said, &quot;Casinos would bring a substantial increase
in crime to our state.&quot;[34]
<p>
The Maryland report reflects what virtually every government that
has experienced gambling has found. Jeffrey Bloomberg said, when
casinos came to remote Deadwood, &quot;We have seen individuals
who, prior to their exposure to gambling, had no criminal history,
who were not junkies or alcoholics, many of whom had good jobs,
who became hooked on slot machines and, after losing all their
assets and running all credit resources to their maximum, began
committing some type of crime to support their addiction.&quot;[35]
<p>
Crime on Mississippi's gulf coast increased in every category
after legalization of gambling. Gulfport's chief of police found
overall crime increased more than 100 percent, juvenile crime
shot up 65 percent and alcohol-related accidents increased 101
percent.[36]
<p>
In the first three years after casinos came to Atlantic City,
it went from 50th to first in the nation in per capita crime.
In the first 15 years Atlantic City had casinos, violent crime
skyrocketed almost 500 percent. This was in spite of a 20 percent
population decrease.[37]
<p>
Crime rose 262 percent in Deadwood and police calls in Black Hawk,
Colorado increased from 25 per year before gaming, to as many
as 20,000 today.[38]
<p>
Congressman Wolf testified on September 29, 1995, &quot;Evidence
shows that pathological gamblers engage in forgery, theft, embezzlement,
drug dealing and property crimes to pay off gambling debts. Various
studies indicate that the mean gambling-related debt of people
in compulsive gambling therapy ranged from about $53,000 to $92,000.&quot;[39]
<p>
Durand F. Jacobs, a professor of psychiatry at California's Loma
Linda University and a gambling industry consultant, says that
most people who commit crimes to support their gambling had no
prior criminal records.[40]
<p>
Florida's Department of Law Enforcement studied the probable crime
impact of legalizing gambling and concluded it would cause an
increase in many crime categories. They include: robberies, rape,
theft, drug abuse, aggravated assault, counterfeiting, profit-skimming,
prostitution, credit card scams, loan sharking, and card cheats.[41]
<p>
Given the huge number of dollars involved, gambling legalization
attracts organized crime. Jim Moody, chief of the FBI'S Organized
Crime Section, told <I>60 Minutes</I>, &quot;Gambling itself --
is probably the biggest producer of money for the American La
Cosa Nostra [that] there is.&quot;[42] A former Chicago mobster told
a congressional committee, the introduction of legalized gaming
into Illinois &quot;created a brand new market for us.&quot;[43]
<p>
In 1995, 18 men linked to the Genovese and Gambino crime families
in New York and the Marcello crime family in New Orleans were
convicted of secretly trying to operate a video-poker company
in New Orleans.[44]
<p>
For these reasons Maryland's attorney general Curran warned, &quot;Whatever
dubious financial benefits might flow from casino gaming are outweighed
by the tremendous social costs. Casinos would forever damage the
quality of Maryland life. I urge the task force and the people
of this state to resist the temptation of money that would benefit
too few at the cost of too many.&quot;[45]
<p>
<center><h3>SOCIAL IMPACT</h3></center>
<p>
Americans make more trips to casinos than to major league ballparks,
making gambling the new national pastime. This is evidenced by
the creation of casinos in 23 states and a projection that, by
the year 2000, most Americans will be within a four-hour drive
of a casino.[46]
<p>
This phenomenon is not without social consequences. The American
Psychiatric Association says that gambling addiction parallels
the devastation of alcohol and drug addictions.[47] Although less
than 1 percent of the population have been identified as gambling
addicts, the legalization of gambling could cause that number
to grow to 5 percent, and that includes teenagers.[48]
<p>
Tom Fennelly, a counselor with Gamblers Anonymous, says people
with gambling problems wait to get help until they do something
that bothers their conscience. He told of one woman who became
a prostitute to pay for gambling.[49]
<p>
Robert Goodman reports in the United States Gambling Study that
there are 9.3 million adults and 1.3 million adolescents with
a gambling problem. These are often lower-income residents, and
problem behaviors are worst among the poor and minorities.[50]
<p>
Gambling has caused increased family breakup, suicide, crime,
and massive personal debt. Jason Berg, a 19-year-old from a small
Iowa town, committed suicide after running up gambling debts.
He left a note: &quot;I'm out of control.&quot; Howard Russell,
a 41-year-old salesman, shot himself outside an Illinois casino
after losing more than $50,000.[51] <I>The Kansas City Star</I> reported
the tragic story of a mother who killed herself because she gambled
away the family savings at a casino riverboat.[52]
<p>
The social costs from pathological gambling are high. Peter Reuter,
executive director of the Maryland Task Force on Casino Gambling,
states, there is &quot;no convincing estimate of the average social
costs of an individual becoming a pathological gambler,&quot;
but the &quot;annual costs of $100 million or more in Maryland&quot;
is reasonable.[53]
<p>
Professor Kindt told the House Committee on the Judiciary on September
29, 1995, that the &quot;average socio-economic cost per compulsive
gambler per year has been calculated at $53,000.&quot;[54]
<p>
<center><h3>THE GAMBLER</h3></center>
<p>
Where do gamblers come from? Many gaming supporters count on diverting
funds from other states. They were surprised when a survey by
the Wisconsin Policy Institute of automobile license tags and
the patrons at a Wisconsin-based Indian tribe casino revealed
that nearly 80 percent were local people.[55]
<p>
Paul Dworn, the former editor of a leading gambling trade journal,
argued that most people go to casinos to be entertained: &quot;They
do not go because they have or want to win money.&quot;[56] But gaming
is not like going to Disneyworld or a ball game. It attracts people
who often can't afford the consequences, and it has proven to
be addictive.
<p>
The Wisconsin Policy Institute found that the typical casino gambler
is between 50 and 70 years old and has either retired or has a
blue-collar job. He or she wagers about $101 and loses about half
that amount during each visit.[57]
<p>
A 1995 survey done for the Iowa Department of Human Services found
that the availability of legalized gambling leads to increases
in the prevalence of gambling-related difficulties. Problem gamblers
are increasingly likely to be male, under the age of 30, non-Caucasian
and unmarried. The survey found that 3.5 percent are lifetime
problem gamblers and 1.9 percent are lifetime probable pathological
gamblers.[58]
<p>
Recent studies found lifetime gambling participation rates range
from a low of 74 percent to a high of 92 percent.[59] Iowa's survey
found that respondents spent an average of $40 per month gambling.
Men spend twice as much on gambling as women. People under age
30 spend twice what older gamblers spend. Singles spend more on
gambling ($51 per month) than marrieds ($31 per month).[60]
<p>
The economic strain on gamblers is often crippling. Kansas City's
Family Policy Council found that lower-income households spend
five to 10 times as much per capita on lottery tickets as do middle-income
homes. Since casinos came to Missouri, there has been a dramatic
increase in the number of pawn shops. Today, Kansas City has 38
shops, compared to four in 1979. Twelve shops opened within 18
months of the establishment of riverboat gambling.[61]
<p>
A Kansas City pawn shop owner said, &quot;You see people come
in here who can't afford to buy groceries, but they pawn their
VCR and go to the boat, where they lose $500.&quot; St. Louis'
Gamblers Anonymous reports that gamblers get money from their
life insurance and more than a third actually cancel their policies.
Nearly $1.3 billion of insurance fraud is committed each year
by pathological gamblers.[62]
<p>
The legalization of gambling and the number of pathological gamblers
appear to be linked, and some researchers believe gambling is
the fastest-growing addiction among teenagers. Henry Lesieur, Chair of 
the Criminal Justice Department at Illinois State University, headed a 1991 
panel that studied gambling among college students. The panel surveyed six 
schools in five states and concluded that almost one-quarter of students 
gamble at least once a week.[63]
<p>
Arnie Wexler, executive director of the Council on Compulsive
Gambling of New Jersey, estimates that the number of problem gamblers
will grow as the industry expands. He graphically portrays gambling's
temptation for some. &quot;If you put a guy who wouldn't cheat
on his wife in a room with a gorgeous nude woman, some guys would
fall by the wayside.&quot;[64] While this scenario would not excuse
a man from cheating, Wexler argues that, in the same way, state
approved gambling encourages many people to bet and a certain
percentage will become pathological.
<p>
<center><h3>GAMBLING REGULATION</h3></center>
<p>
Today, there are six major sectors of legal gambling: lotteries,
casino-style gambling, pari-mutuel racing, non-profits (including
bingo and Las Vegas nights), Indian high-stakes bingo and mini-casinos.
Regulating this rapidly expanding industry is expensive and complicated.
<p>
The state of Florida estimated it would cost nearly $50 million
to regulate 34 casinos, and that figure isn't unrealistic.[65] After
all, the 1991 annual budget for New Jersey's Casino Control Commission
was nearly $26 million, and that state's casinos are concentrated
in one city, not spread across a large state.[66]
<p>
But gaming regulation costs don't stop there. The New Jersey Division
of Gaming Enforcement spends another $36 million annually, a portion
of which provides police personnel for patrol and investigative
functions.[67]
<p>
The Indian Gaming Regulatory Act of 1988 created a federal commission
to set gaming rules and oversee regulation of Indian bingo games.
The federal regulation effort is scanty, however. There are less
than 30 staff persons to regulate hundreds of Indian casinos across
the nation.[68]
<p>
Bob Renneisen, president and CEO, Claridge's Casino, Atlantic
City said, &quot;Our goal is not to get more out of a customer
in three hours but to get him to stay for four hours.&quot;[69] He
figures that the gambler will lose more with time since all casino
games give the house a mathematical edge.
<p>
The industry has studied gambling psychology. The casinos don't
want the gambler to realize he is losing. Jack Binion, owner of
Horseshoe Casino, Las Vegas, said, &quot;What is gambling? It's
really just a hype on emotion.&quot; Bill Zneder, operations chief,
Aladdin Casino, Las Vegas, said, &quot;If you give a guy a $100
bill he looks at it like a round of golf, a golf cart, two beers
and a hot dog. But if you give him chips, it's just betting units
and it loses its value.&quot;[70]
<p>
<center><h3>ADVERTISING GAMBLING</h3></center>
<p>
As governments have become more dependent on gambling, their regulation
efforts have shifted somewhat to promotion. According to gambling
expert Robert Goodman, legislators are tending to legalize-higher-revenue
producing games just as the market is becoming saturated.[71] This
is why public subsidies have been used to help competing private
gambling operations survive.
<p>
Since 1934, the federal government has had a long-standing policy
of prohibiting gambling-related advertising. Current federal criminal
law generally prohibits anyone from broadcasting &quot;[a]ny advertisement
of or information concerning any lottery, gift enterprise, or
similar scheme, [or] offering prizes dependent in whole or in
part upon lot or chance.&quot;[72]
<p>
The law does permit not-for-profit organizations to advertise
if the activity is &quot;clearly occasional and ancillary to the
primary business of that organization.&quot; But that might soon
change.
<p>
Pro-gambling forces in the Senate tried to amend the Telecommunications
Competition and Deregulation Act of 1995 to &quot;allow commercial
gambling enterprises to advertise on radio and television, thereby
reversing a long-standing federal policy against commercial gambling
advertising.&quot;[73]
<p>
State governments already spend more than $300 million a year
in lottery advertisements.[74] Taxpayer funded pro-gambling ads mixed
with industry-paid ads could fill the airways with messages that
promote gambling, thus drawing in more gullible victims.
<p>
<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>
<p>
Despite its popularity, legalized gambling is taking the country
in the wrong direction. Gambling is not an economic savior but
a disease that claims millions of victims.
<p>
President Clinton supports Congressman Wolf's proposal. In a letter
to Senator Simon, Clinton said, &quot;Too often, public officials
view gambling as a quick and easy way to raise revenues, without
focusing on gambling's hidden social, economic and political costs.&quot;
<p>
A national gambling commission could examine and publicize the
devastating consequences of legalized gambling. After the commission,
public policymakers should consider legislation to re-criminalize
or severely limit all forms of gambling.

<p>
The Federal Communications Commission is considering a set of
rules that would greatly increase federal oversight of children's
television programming.
<p>
In order to further implement the Children's Television Act of
1990, the FCC is considering:
<p><ul>
<li>Issuing a &quot;more particularized&quot; definition of &quot;educational
and informational&quot; content.
<p><li>Requiring commercial broadcasters to carry a quota of 
&quot;educational&quot; programming, or pay another (probably a Public 
Broadcasting Service affiliate) to carry an equivalent amount of such 
programming.
<p><li>Adopting licensing renewal &quot;processing guidelines&quot;
which would allow the FCC to refuse license renewal to broadcasters
if program quotas are not met.
<p><li>Restricting credit for &quot;educational&quot; fare to designated
&quot;core&quot; programming (which would eliminate consideration
of specials and public service spots that might otherwise be deemed
&quot;educational&quot;).
<p><li>Requiring on-air designations of programs as &quot;educational.&quot;
<p><li>Defining as &quot;educational&quot; those programs for which
educational content is a &quot;significant purpose&quot; of the
show.
<p><li>Excluding for credit any programs that air before 7 a.m. and
after 10 p.m.
<p><li>Monitoring the total amount of educational and informational
programming over a specific time period.
</ul><p>
Given that the worth of specifically &quot;educational&quot; programming
for children is debatable, that public television already provides
many hours of such programming, and that the networks have steadily
increased their &quot;educational&quot; fare in recent years,
it does not appear that an expansion of federal power over television
is warranted.
<p>
More importantly, there are serious First Amendment problems with
any attempt by government to mandate specific programming content.
<p>
<center><h3>BACKGROUND</h3></center>
<p>
In 1989, a U.S. Senate report found that there was &quot;disturbingly
little&quot; programming &quot;that serves the special needs of
children&quot; and that time periods in which children were most
likely to be watching were filled with &quot;reruns of adult or
family comedy, variety, or dramatic programs.&quot;[1] Several cartoon
shows, whose main characters were heavily marketed as toys (such
as G.I. Joe) were criticized by public interest groups as being
little more than show-length toy commercials. Pressure groups
such as Action for Children's Television lobbied hard for some
federal oversight. They found a sympathetic ear in Sen. Daniel
Inouye (D-Hawaii), who sponsored the Senate version of the Children's
Television Act (CTA).
<p>
In 1990, Congress passed the CTA &quot;to increase the amount
of educational and informational broadcast television programming
available to children and to protect children from over-commercialization
of programming.&quot;[2] It was signed into law by President George
Bush.
<p>
The Act limits advertising spots to 10.5 minutes per hour during
weekends and 12 minutes per hour during weekdays.[3] It also prohibits
the advertising of program-based products on the same shows. For
instance, the <I>Mighty Morphin Power Rangers</I> show cannot
include ads for Power Ranger dolls. The Act also directs the FCC
to review, at license renewal time, whether broadcasters have
served the &quot;educational and informational needs of children.&quot;
<p>
In 1991, the FCC issued rules and policies implementing the Children's
Television Act. Television station licensees were required to
respond to the &quot;educational and informational needs of children
16 years of age and under.&quot; No program quotas were established,
and the FCC said it would take into consideration any programming
that served children's &quot;positive development in any way,
including serving their cognitive/intellectual or social/emotional
needs.&quot;[4]
<p>
Irked by some broadcasters' insistence that shows like <I>The
Flintstones, Leave it to Beaver,</I> and <I>The Jetsons</I> meet
the definition of &quot;educational and informational,&quot; the
FCC concluded in a 1993 report that, &quot;We do not believe that
the level of performance is, in the long term, consistent with
the objectives underlying the CTA.&quot;[5]
<p>
Pressure from a coalition of interest groups including the Center
for Media Education, the National Education Association, the National
PTA and others resulted in a renewed effort by the FCC to further
refine the implementation rules for CTA. The coalition proposes
that broadcast licensees be required to provide at least one hour
a day of &quot;educational&quot; children's programming, to be
determined with tougher FCC standards.
<p>
In June 1995, a hearing was held before the full Commission, attended
by broadcasters, interest groups and media. The FCC also asked
for public comment to be submitted in writing, with final comments
and replies being closed on November 20, 1995. More than 600 entries
were filed, from the Corporation for Public Broadcasting, private
citizens, TV networks, program providers such as Walt Disney Company,
and many religious and interest groups such as the United Church
of Christ, U.S. Catholic Conference, and the Children's Defense
Fund.[6] Most commentators backed some sort of tightening of the
rules, but the networks and several others argued hard against
program quotas, citing the First Amendment.
<p>
In October 1995, Professor Dale Kunkel of the University of California,
Santa Barbara, released a survey that says some TV stations are
meeting the &quot;kidvid&quot; requirement by airing programs
such as <I>Biker Mice from Mars, America's Funniest Home Videos</I>,
and <I>Yogi Bear</I>.&quot;[7]
<p>
In an Oct. 18, 1995 speech before the National Press Club, FCC
Chairman Reed Hundt cited the Kunkel study, and took particular
aim at NBC's claim that <I>NBA Inside Stuff</I> was educational. 
NBC lawyer Rick Cotton responded that the show
&quot;uses sports to attract teenagers to a program, and then
we provide educational and informational material. This highlights
the problem of government trying to set itself up as the arbiter
of what is educational.&quot;[8]
<p>
<center><h3>THE CASE FOR STATE INTERVENTION ON BEHALF OF CHILDREN</h3></center>
<p>
As noted in the FCC brief filed by the United States Catholic
Conference, &quot;The Supreme Court has not required scientific
exactitude when legislative and administrative bodies take actions
helpful to children and their parents. The Court has deferred
to the judgments of legislators and administrators when harm to
children is at issue.&quot;
<p>
The USCC cites a number of cases in which the court has upheld
state action &quot;aimed at protecting the physical and emotional
well-being of youth.&quot;[9]
<p>
True enough. If public officials depended only on scientific research,
then there would be a pressing need for studies to show that placing
a small child in heavy traffic is dangerous. Some truths are self-evident,
and the general concept of protecting children has been an accepted
societal value in the United States since before its founding.
The only question is how to balance the legitimate public interest
in protecting children with other rights, such as the freedom
of speech, and parental authority. Over the years, the courts
have approved government abridgments of the freedom of speech
when it was determined that children would be unduly harmed without
benefit of such law. Most recently, a federal appeals court in
Washington, D.C. upheld the FCC's right to prohibit indecent programming
between the hours of 6 a.m. and 10 p.m., citing the government's
&quot;compelling interest&quot; in protecting children.[10]
<p>
But shielding children from pornography, excessive violence and
coarse language is different from legislating prescriptive programming.
It is one thing to put a health warning label on a pack of cigarettes,
for instance, and another to require all citizens to take vitamins.
Similarly, it is one thing to shield children from smut and another
to require specific broadcasting content determined by government.
<p>
In tackling this thorny issue, the FCC has been lobbied to tighten
the requirements on broadcasters to air &quot;educational&quot;
programs. Here is a closer look at what is proposed.
<p>
<center><h3>DEFINING A MORE &quot;PARTICULARIZED&quot; EDUCATIONAL
AND INFORMATIONAL CONTENT</h3></center>
<p>
Currently, the FCC has broad discretion in defining what is good
TV fare for children. Stations can cite anything aired as part
of their repertoire of child-friendly programming. In 1990, Sen. Daniel 
Inouye provided this definition to convey the intent of Congress:
<p>
&quot;Educational and informational needs encompass not only intellectual
development, but also the child's emotional and social development.
Pro-social programming which assists children to discover more
about themselves, their families, and the world would qualify.&quot;[11]
<p>
The danger in adopting a more refined definition is that it may
lead to a one-size-fits-all, government-designated type of children's
programming. Given the ability of ideologues of various stripes
to commandeer government power to their advantage, expanding the
FCC's power in this way may lead to politically correct programming.
Religious programs might be considered either unimportant or even
detrimental, depending on who is doing the assessment and whose
agenda is being served. As government power grows, religion is
pushed out of the public square by those who expansively interpret
the &quot;wall of separation&quot; between church and state. Also,
concern for &quot;diversity&quot; of lifestyle might weigh more
heavily with the FCC than imagination and dramatic content.
<p>
For example, the Public Broadcasting Service outlet in Akron,
Ohio, aired the one-hour homosexual propaganda show <I>What If
I'm Gay?</I> between <I>Kidsongs TV</I> and <I>Sesame Street</I>,
from 10 a.m. to 11 a.m. one Thursday in July 1994.[12] Someone thought
this was suitable educational fare for a preschool audience.
<p>
Appointing an academic panel to come up with suitable definitions,
which some FCC observers have proposed, is also fraught with peril,
since academia has proved to be at least as susceptible as government
bureaucrats to the virus of political correctness. And the networks are not 
immune to the same cultural forces. Turner Broadcasting's <I>Captain Planet</I> 
is often cited as an example of responsible privately-generated programming 
for children, but the show also has been severely criticized by some observers 
for its allegedly radical environmentalist themes.
<p>
<center><h3>QUOTAS FOR EDUCATIONAL TELEVISION</h3></center>
<p>
Any government regulation that forces privately owned broadcasters
to air specified content risks violating the First Amendment guarantee
against forced speech of any kind.
<p>
Courts consistently have allowed only the narrowest exceptions
to this rule. In 1984, the U.S. Supreme Court ruled that any government
content rules must be &quot;narrowly tailored to further a substantial
government interest.&quot;[13]
<p>
The U.S. Supreme Court in 1973 upheld the FCC's refusal to force
broadcasters to carry editorial advertisements, saying that such
a move runs &quot;the risk of an enlargement of Government control
over the content of broadcast discussion of public issues.&quot;[14]
In 1974, the Supreme Court upheld the right of a newspaper not
to have to publish government-dictated copy.[15] And in 1986, the
Supreme Court reiterated that &quot;what to say and what to leave
unsaid&quot;[16] were both protected by the First Amendment's prohibition
against &quot;abridging the freedom of speech.&quot;
<p>
In Turner Broadcasting Systems v. FCC (1994), which concerned
whether cable systems could be compelled to carry broadcast signals,
the U.S. Supreme Court said of the FCC that &quot;oversight responsibilities
do not grant it power to ordain any particular type of programming
that must be offered by broadcast stations.&quot;[17]
<p>
The FCC itself has never adopted specific prescriptions of programming,
and has formally rejected such proposals on two occasions.
<p>
Apart from the constitutional question, the FCC would have to
justify such a major government intrusion by proving that 1) there
is an indisputable need for such programming; 2) such programming
does not exist already or 3) children do not have reasonable access
to such programming if it does exist.
<p>
There is very little independent data to indicate that children
are better off watching television -- even &quot;educational&quot;
TV -- than playing, reading or engaging in other activities. In
fact, the drumbeat for &quot;educational&quot; television is part
of a larger lobbying effort in behalf of the concept of early
childhood education. The current, number-one education goal of
the Clinton Administration is that every child &quot;come to school
ready to learn.&quot;
<p>
Declining literacy rates and school test scores have persuaded
some educators to target preschoolers for education, despite the
fact that the presumed benefits of early introduction to formal
learning lack a solid base of research. Just as the supporters
of Head Start have justified its efficacy repeatedly over the
years by reference to a single, nonrepresentative study of 52
preschoolers in a private day-care setting,[18] the educational TV
lobby has based its case for early formal learning on studies
that raise questions of bias.
<p>
In its FCC brief, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting cites
a &quot;1995 report released by Children's Television Workshop&quot;
revealing that &quot;viewing educational television, including
Sesame Street, helps preschoolers in three ways: they are better
prepared to enter school; they perform better on verbal and math
tests as late as age 7; and they spend more time reading.&quot;
Children's Television Workshop produces <I>Sesame Street</I> and
other public TV children's programs. Other data cited by CPB (from
a study commissioned by CPB) indicates that &quot;88 percent of
all preschoolers and 80 percent of all kindergartners watch at
least one of four public broadcasting programs each week -- <I>Sesame
Street, Reading Rainbow, Mister Rogers' Neighborhood</I> and <I>Barney
and Friends</I>.&quot;[19]
<p>
If this is so, then the question must be asked: If PBS educational
television has made such a difference, why have test scores continued
to decline? According to <I>Ready to Learn</I>, a 1991 report
by the Carnegie Foundation for the Advancement of Teaching, increasing
numbers of pupils are deficient in language skills. Why do children
seem less prepared? Could it be that children have become so addicted
to television that they have difficulty concentrating on real
school work? Could it be that a steady diet of television reduces
a child's attention span more than it educates?
<p>
PBS defenders often cite studies by the Educational Testing Service,
sponsored by Children's Television Workshop, that report significant
gains among young viewers in a number of basic skills such as
counting and naming letters and numbers. A later Russell Sage
Foundation review of the data concluded that the gains were more
modest and that they could be attributed to other factors inherent
in the research method. Also, the Sage study found that the show
increased the intellectual gap between middle-class and poor children,
the opposite of ETA's findings.[20]
<p>
Something of a national sacred cow, <I>Sesame Street</I> is loved
by children and adults alike. Its production values have always
been high, and the content is witty and funny. Big Bird, Bert
and Ernie and other characters have become national icons.
<p>
Touted since its inception as an educational device, the show
is high-quality enter-tainment that parents often will watch with
their children. However, the &quot;educational&quot; effects,
some critics argue, may have been exaggerated to garner public
funding and to alleviate the guilt of parents who let <I>Sesame
Street</I> baby-sit their toddlers for hours on end.
<p>
One <I>Sesame Street</I> critic, Kay S. Hymowitz, even questions
the show's central premise -- that it is good for children. Writing
in the public policy periodical <I>City Journal</I>, Hymowitz
notes that for all its touted &quot;diversity,&quot; <I>Sesame
Street</I> &quot;couldn't be more monocultural and conformist
in its unwavering endorsement of American anti-intellectualism
and [the] cult of the cool.&quot;[21] Hymowitz explains that the skits
trivialize great literature and great events by making them conform
to whatever is current in popular culture, particularly television
shows. She also detects a drumbeat that kids must be &quot;cool&quot;
about everything. Encouraging children to adopt a skeptical approach
to life teaches the &quot;folly&quot; of being passionate about
anything. This can have the side effect of encouraging children
to detach from the beliefs of their parents.
<p>
Hymowitz also notes that <I>Sesame Street</I> &quot;focuses on
mere technical skills, the tools of mental cultivation, rather
than mental cultivation itself; the building blocks of thought
rather than thought....Worse, the show's anti-intellectualism
and its glorification of television culture over print send the
implicit message that the skills of literacy have no meaningful
purpose.&quot;
<p>
Aware that she may come off as something of an Oscar the Grouch,
Hymowitz acknowledges the show's appeal (&quot;who can resist
the clever witticisms of sophisticated television?&quot;) but
stresses that her main concern is the impression that <I>Sesame
Street</I> is an unalloyed educational bonanza.
<p>
No matter how educational <I>Sesame Street</I> appears to be,
if its net effect has been to make school seem dull by comparison,
and to help shorten youngsters' attention spans, then it may not
be such a good idea to promote television viewing of any type
for children. The most powerful argument, outside CTW's own studies,
is that children &quot;are going to watch TV anyway,&quot; which
has some resonance, given the overwhelming evidence that children
do spend many hours in front of the tube.
<p>
Finally, considering the enormous amount of &quot;educational&quot;
programming provided by public television[22] (PBS regularly airs
such popular shows as <I>Sesame Street, Mr. Rogers' Neighborhood,
Barney and Friends, Where in the World Is Carmen San Diego?, Ghostwriter,
Puzzleplace, Shining Time Station</I> and <I>Reading Rainbow)</I>
and the fact that most American children are already tuning into
these shows in large numbers, and the fact that the networks have
increased their &quot;educational&quot; output significantly in
recent years,[23] proponents would be hard pressed to prove that children
have so little access to &quot;educational&quot; television that
an unprecedented government intrusion into content is warranted.
<p>
CTA sponsor Sen. Daniel Inouye noted during debate over passage
of the bill in 1990 that the total programming mix should be &quot;left
to the discretion of the broadcaster, taking into account what
other stations, including non-commercial ones, are doing in this
important area.&quot;[24]
<p>
<center><h3>PROGRAM SPONSORSHIP OPTION</h3></center>
<p>
Public television has nearly monopolized weekly children's programming.
The FCC is considering allowing commercial stations to subsidize
such programming on other channels (such as PBS) as a way to satisfy
their overall duty to serve children's needs. This proposal has
support primarily from the public broadcasting community. In its
FCC brief, the Corporation for Public Broadcasting notes that:
&quot;With CPB at the helm, public television has embraced the
education of America's youth as its core mission for over 25 years.&quot;[25]
CPB promotes the concept of the &quot;program sponsorship&quot;
option in which broadcast licensees would meet a prescribed quota
of children's programming by airing it or by providing &quot;financial
or in-kind support&quot; to &quot;host&quot; stations in the same
market.
<p>
CPB notes that this would result in &quot;shifting programming
dollars to the broadcasters with the greatest expertise in and
commitment to children's educational programming -- the noncommercial
educational broadcasters.&quot;[26]
<p>
CPB also suggests that stations should not be allowed to satisfy
all of the requirement this way, and should provide at least some
educational broadcasts of their own, citing Sen. Inouye's wish
that the FCC &quot;would, of course, expect that each station
will itself broadcast some programming specifically designed for
children to serve their educational and informational needs.&quot;[27]
<p>
Several critics have charged that the formula amounts to a guaranteed
subsidy to Children's Television Workshop, among others. Dr. Laurence
Jarvik of the Center for the Study of Popular Culture calls the
idea &quot;a shakedown by PBS, pure and simple. You might as well
have Big Bird put a gun to their head.&quot;[28]
<p>
Peggy Charren, founder of Action for Children's Television, also
opposes the sponsorship option: &quot;PBS serves the needs of
children now. Allowing stations to simply pay another station
to do programming does not fulfill stations' obligations to serve
the needs of children.&quot;[29]
<p>
Jeff Chester, executive director of the Center for Media Education,
which lobbies for the new FCC requirements, nonetheless also opposes
the sponsorship option: &quot;The intent of the law was for every
station to air a significant amount of programming for children.&quot;[30]
<p>
Rep. Ed Markey (D-Mass.), who, as chairman of the House telecommunications
subcommittee played an important role in passing the CTA, said
in an interview that &quot;the intent of the Act was not to have
stations pay PBS to do their programming for them.&quot;[31]
<p>
<center><h3>ADOPTING LICENSING RENEWAL &quot;PROCESSING GUIDELINES&quot;
</h3></center>
<p>
Processing guidelines would designate how much &quot;educational
or informational&quot; material had to be included for a licensee
to qualify under any new definitions. They would be the &quot;teeth&quot;
for the FCC to withhold license renewal based on compliance. As
such, they would constitute the equivalent of program quotas,
which would be an infringement of broadcasters' First Amendment
rights.
<p>
<center><h3>RESTRICTING CREDIT FOR &quot;EDUCATIONAL&quot; FARE
TO &quot;CORE,&quot; STANDARD-LENGTH PROGRAMMING ONLY</h3></center>
<p>
In an attempt to ensure regularity of wholesome content, proponents
suggest that broadcast licensees not be able to include specials
and short subjects when they make their case to the FCC that they
have served the &quot;educational and informational&quot; needs
of children. They recommend that only regularly scheduled, 
&quot;standard-length&quot; programs (at least a half-hour in length) be 
counted.
<p>
While the intent seems reasonable, the formula would discourage
imaginative public service announcements generated by the ad industry
and by interest groups. It may also discourage sponsorship of
TV specials.
<p>
The Walt Disney Company, which produces all manner of children's
programming, argued in its FCC brief for the value of non-regular
programming:
<p>
&quot;Certain lessons, for example, can be conveyed best in a
short segment, but might become overbearing or pedantic if relegated
to a 15- or 30-minute format. Anyone who can recall the impact
of the anti-drug commercial depicting a man breaking an egg into
a frying pan and watching it sizzle with the voice-over, 'This
is your brain. This is your brain on drugs. Any questions?,' knows
the unique educational value that such programming can have.&quot;[32]
<p>
<I>Cartoon All-Stars to the Rescue</I>, described by NBC as &quot;a
history-making animated anti-substance abuse television special
for children,&quot; was broadcast on all major TV networks and
&quot;hundreds of independent stations and cable outlets throughout
the U.S.&quot;[33] ABC airs the Schoolhouse Rock series during its Saturday 
morning lineup. The animated, three-minute segments are set to music and
have featured such topics as multiplication tables (<I>Zero Is
My Hero</I>), grammar (<I>Conjunction Junction</I>), history (<I>Preamble
to the Constitution</I>), and science (<I>Electricity</I>).[34]
<p>
The Senate Report on the Children's Television Act of 1990 emphasizes
an &quot;overall&quot; assessment of programming to children,
and specifies that the requirement &quot;does not exclude any
programming that does in fact serve the informational and educational
needs of children.&quot;[35]
<p>
An alternative to a ban on counting other than &quot;core&quot;
programs might be for the FCC merely to state that it encourages
more regularly scheduled programming for children as part of a
good-faith effort by broadcasters. Licensees could then score
points by offering more &quot;core&quot; shows, but be able to
present significant short-subject spots as additional proof of
commitment to children's needs. Again, this is contingent upon
acceptance of an increase in the FCC's power over children's programming.
<p>
<center><h3>REQUIRING ON-AIR DESIGNATIONS OF PROGRAMS AS 
&quot;EDUCATIONAL&quot;</h3></center>
<p>
Children are drawn to particular television shows for their entertainment
value. Parents may be far more interested in a show's educational
content. An on-air designation might seem to be a valuable tool
for parents, but it risks the same problems as posed by specific
content regulation. Educational designations could be granted
or withheld arbitrarily or for ideological reasons. The designations
could also have the unintended effect of &quot;warning&quot; children
that &quot;somebody thinks this is good for you, so prepare to
be bored.&quot; Good, entertaining educational fare could wind
up being stigmatized.
<p>
The idea has other problems. As Disney points out, &quot;requiring
an on-air identification attached to a particular program will
serve no such benefit unless the parent is not only watching television
but also watching the particular channel at the moment the identification
is aired.&quot;[36]
<p>
A system to determine such designations would artificially divide
the world of programming into the &quot;educational&quot; and
the &quot;uneducational.&quot; Since the definition of &quot;educational&quot;
is so subjective, and programming does not lend itself to such
draconian division, the system would be unworkable. It is a simple
task to affix warning labels because of specific content, such
as sex, violence or vulgar language, which can be quantified.
But it is another to determine an entire program's subjective
worth as an educational device.
<p>
A reasonable alternative might be to encourage the provision of
published guides on TV content and program guides for parents.
But again, this should not be required.
<p>
<center><h3>DEFINING AS &quot;EDUCATIONAL&quot; THOSE PROGRAMS
FOR WHICH EDUCATIONAL CONTENT IS A &quot;SIGNIFICANT&quot;
PART OF THE SHOW</h3></center>
<p>
When the FCC first proposed new rules for children's TV, the agency
suggested that education must be the &quot;primary&quot; purpose
of educational programs. Now, it has shifted to the stance that
education be a &quot;significant&quot; purpose. This was a reasonable
accommodation, given the power of entertainment to attract viewers.
<p>
<I>Bill Nye the Science Guy</I> is a Disney-produced weekly program
that teaches children about scientific wonders using graphics,
special effects, music video-type sound and comedy.
<p>
&quot;Someone recently asked me to break down into percentages
the entertainment and educational components of our show,&quot;
Nye told an interviewer. &quot;Quite honestly, I couldn't do it.
But I am 100 percent certain that the program is more than 50
percent entertainment -- or kids wouldn't watch.&quot;[37]
<p>
The jury is out as to what exactly is educational fare. Jarvik
notes that even shows such as the Fox cartoon comedy <I>The Simpsons</I>
should not be dismissed as lacking educational content. &quot;While
I don't approve of a foul-mouthed brat, at the least, children
see a family with a father and mother. I suspect that some of
those who disapprove of <I>The Simpsons</I> dislike the idea of
kids seeing an intact, traditional family, and would rather replace
it with something like a cartoon television version of <I>Heather
Has Two Mommies</I>.&quot;[38]
<p>
Moreover, much of the television that children watch is not geared
specifically for them but may, in fact, be educational. What do
children derive from seeing re-runs of <I>The Waltons</I>, for
instance? The hour-long show, in syndication, features a wholesome
Virginia family working out its problems during the Depression.
While not being specifically &quot;educational,&quot; the show
conceivably conveys more valuable information about life to children
than a designated &quot;educational&quot; program.
<p>
<center><h3>EXCLUDING FOR CREDIT ANY PROGRAMS THAT AIR BEFORE 7 A.M. AND
AFTER 10 P.M.</h3></center>
<p>
Proponents of this provision charge that TV stations are airing
some &quot;educational&quot; programs when no one is watching,
in the early hours of the morning, for instance. They want a 7
a.m. standard so that more children would be exposed to educational
content.
<p>
In many markets, public television provides <I>Sesame Street</I>
and other children's shows beginning at 6 a.m. and running throughout
the morning. TV ratings data, as noted in a July 1995 opinion
of the federal D.C. Court of Appeals, show that many children
are viewing television between 6 a.m. and 10 p.m., and even later
into the evening.[39] The Nielsen Company has found that an estimated
1.5 million children aged two to 11, or five percent of all children,
watch TV Monday through Friday at 6 a.m and that an estimated
2.4 million children aged two to 11 (6.3 percent) tune in by 6:30
a.m.[40] Rule proponents contend that this is too small a proportion
of child viewers to make enough difference.
<p>
The networks contend that most educational programming takes place
after 7 a.m. anyway. A study by the National Association of Broadcasters
says that during fall 1994, some 81.4 percent of programs identified
by licensees as &quot;educational and informational&quot; were
broadcast after 7 a.m, with 15.8 percent being aired before 7
a.m.[41] NBC, in its FCC brief, suggests that the FCC give credit
with no time limit, but &quot;if the Commission nonetheless feels
compelled to take some action to allay its concerns in this regard,
we believe it should simply state that licensees must broadcast
some qualifying standard-length programming after 7 a.m. and that
licensees meeting this standard will receive full credit for all
their qualifying programming broadcast during the hours of 6 a.m.
to 11 p.m.&quot;
<p>
Limiting credit to educational fare after 7 a.m. might eliminate
some licensees' obvious dodges, such as scheduling a teen educational
program at 6 a.m. on Sunday morning, when most teens are still
asleep. But it might have an unintended effect of discouraging
<I>any</I> educational programming between 6 a.m .and 7 a.m.,
when up to two million children are watching. Perhaps the FCC
should consider counting as educational fare during those hours
only those programs that appeal to the prime audience during that
time -- small children.
<p>
<center><h3>MONITORING THE TOTAL AMOUNT OF EDUCATIONAL PROGRAMMING OVER
A SPECIFIC TIME PERIOD</h3></center>
<p>
One of the more arguably valuable functions of government is data
collecting, since this can shed light on a problem. It can also
create issues, and data can be (and frequently is) manipulated
for partisan ends. But at least the government must give everybody
access to the data.
<p>
Outside of the census, there is no constitutional provision for
federal agencies to collect data. The best argument that can be
made is that data collection helps bureaucrats and lawmakers do
their job better, so it adds to the &quot;general welfare.&quot;
<p>
Should the FCC decide to do anything with regard to children's
television, the agency is on the safest grounds in collecting
data on programming. But the enterprise is open to abuse, such
as widely-varying definitions of what constitutes &quot;educational
and informative&quot; programming for children. This brings us
back to the central problem: Is the federal government legally
and practically suited to the task of fine-tuning children's television?
The honest answer is no.
<p>
<center><h3>CONCLUSION</h3></center>
<p>
More federal control of children's television programming is not
in the best interests of children and their parents and would
constitute an unwarranted violation of the First Amendment rights
of broadcasters. Children learn in many ways, and government-dictated
designation of some material as &quot;educational&quot; may lead
to politically-correct programming and more government control
of the dissemination of information. The FCC should reject the
proposed rules.

provisions of telecommunications law, this does not imply support

<TITLE> NEW LAW REDEFINES THE FAMILY</TITLE>
<BODY>

<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<p>
<H2>NEW LAW REDEFINES THE FAMILY</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<P>A new law pushed by the Clinton Administration redefines "family"
to include unmarried partners, including gays and lesbians.  This
promotes homosexuality as the moral equivalent of heterosexuality.
<P>
<CENTER> <H3>THE DEVIL IS IN THE DETAILS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Federal Employees Family Friendly Leave Act was signed into
law by President Clinton on October 22, 1994.  The Act permits
a federal employee to use sick leave to attend to the medical
needs of a family member.  The Act requires the Office of Personnel
Management to use the definition of "family member"
as found in the pre-existing leave transfer program.[1]
<P>
The leave transfer program defines "family member"; based
on the term "immediate relative" as it is used for funeral
leave purposes.  OPM clarifies the definition in the <I>Federal
Register:</I> "We recognize that there may be cases in which
the traditional concept of a family relationship is not applicable,
yet a close relationship to the leave recipient exists that is
the equivalent of a family relationship.  Examples include foster
children and step children."[2]
<P>
In December 1994, the Clinton Administration twisted the definition
of "family member" as outlined in the leave transfer
program to mean something entirely different when applied to the
new leave law.  OPM Director of Communications Janice Lachance
confirms that "family member" now includes "domestic
partners" of either sex.  "It's a recognition of how
family relationships have evolved," Lachance said.  "It's
an effort to respond to the realities that federal employees face
each and every day....The key thing to remember is the government
is getting out of the business of defining relationships."[3]
<P>
OPM's new definition for "family member" includes: "spouse,
and parents thereof; children, including adopted children and
spouses thereof; parents; brothers and sisters, and spouses thereof;
<I>and any individual related by blood or affinity whose close
association with the employee is the equivalent of a family relationship</I>."[4]
<P>
Representative Constance Morella (R-MD), a co-sponsor of the bill,
said the definition of family is "reasonable" because
it "covers everybody without getting into the particulars.
 It is accommodating different lifestyles without favoring one
over another."
<P>
<CENTER>
 <H3>WHAT TO DO?</H3></CENTER>
<P>
OPM has liberalized the definition of "family" in the
Federal Employees Family Friendly Leave Act to mean something
not allowed by the law.  The definition should be changed to mean
unambiguously only the natural family.  This could be accomplished
by striking the word "affinity" from OPM's new regulation.
 Alternatively, the Clinton Administration can grant this benefit
to other-than-family members by amending the regulation to allow
for "non-family members."  The 104th Congress has oversight
of any change.  
<P>
The Federal Employees Family Friendly Leave Act was not designed
to expand the official definition of "family" to include
domestic partners, whether homosexual or heterosexual.  Rather,
it was intended to help federal employees in crisis and should
not be manipulated by the Clinton Administration to advance a
political agenda.

<TITLE>AMERICA NEEDS WEDFARE, NOT WELFARE</TITLE>
<BODY>
<P>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>AMERICA NEEDS WEDFARE,<BR>
NOT WELFARE</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
The new Congress is planning to pass a major welfare reform initiative
that will encourage states to test some creative ideas for reducing
the number of people on the welfare rolls.  To date, much of the
debate has focused on ways to help welfare recipients become self
sufficient by requiring them to work for their benefits.
<P>
While "workfare" is a worthy idea, welfare reformers
need to do more than just get people off welfare.  They need to
devote serious attention to developing "preventative"
strategies for reducing the number of people who ever need welfare
in the first place.
<P>
A "preventative" strategy should focus squarely on the
primary cause of welfare dependency:  illegitimacy.  Three out
of ten births in the U.S. today are out-of-wedlock.  And few of
these never-married mothers bear any resemblance to the affluent,
upwardly-mobile Murphy Brown.  Instead, unmarried women who bear
children are five times more likely to live below the poverty
line than are married mothers.  And their children are much more
likely to suffer from abuse and neglect, and to drop out of school,
abuse drugs, commit crimes, and get pregnant out of wedlock.
<P>
To curb illegitimacy, Congressional reformers should step up efforts
to teach abstinence in schools, streamline adoption for out-of-wedlock
births, and reverse welfare policies that penalize marriage. 
The House GOP Contract With America takes some important first
steps in these areas.  It makes adoption expenses tax deductible,
eliminates welfare payments for all future cases involving unmarried
teen mothers, and sets aside money for developing a pro-marriage
tax credit for the poor.  
<P>
Moreover, some states have already taken modest steps to address
the welfare system's bias against marriage.  For example, under
the leadership of Governor Tommy Thompson, Wisconsin adopted a
"bridefare" policy in 1991 which provides higher benefits
for low-income married couples who marry or remain married.  More
recently, California has passed a "wedfare" law which
allows poor moms who marry an opportunity to retain health coverage
rather than being cut off from continued benefits.
<P>
Congress would do well to encourage states to adopt more pro-marriage
reforms of this kind.  Doing so would acknowledge that the primary
escape route from poverty 30 years after the adoption of liberal
Great Society programs is not welfare or workfare.  It is marriage.

<TITLE>VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN ACT OF 1994</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>VIOLENCE AGAINST WOMEN<BR>
ACT OF 1994</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
The "Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act"
passed by Congress and signed by President Clinton on September
13, 1994 authorizes $1.6 billion to combat and study violence
against women, stiffens laws against sex offenders, and creates
prevention and treatment programs.[1]  The comprehensive statute
has seven subtitles, outlined below.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>"SAFE STREETS FOR WOMEN"</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<LI> Federal Penalties for Sex Crimes.  The law doubles prison sentences
for repeat sex offenders and mandates restitution for sex crimes.
 Sex offenders will pay the full amount of the victim's loss to
include medical services, transportation, temporary housing, child
care expenses, lost income, and attorney's fees.  Court decisions
to award restitution to victims will not consider the economic
circumstances of the offender nor the fact that the victim received
compensation from other sources.  The provision also authorizes
the appropriation of $1.5 million over three years to appoint
victim/witness counselors.
<P>
<LI> Law Enforcement and Prosecution Grants.  This provision amends
the 1968 Safe Streets Act to authorize grants to combat violent
crimes against women.  It is designed to develop and strengthen
law enforcement and prosecution strategies to combat violent crimes
against women.  It authorizes $800 million over six years.
<P>
<LI> Safety for Women in Public Transit and Public Parks.  This appropriates
$20 million to increase the safety of public transportation and
public parks by enhancing lighting systems, camera surveillance
and emergency telephone lines to contact law enforcement personnel.
<P>
<LI> New Evidentiary Rules.  This amends the federal rules of evidence
for sex offense cases.  It prohibits the admission of evidence
offered to prove that a victim engaged in other sexual behavior
or establish a victim's "sexual predisposition."  Exceptions
are permitted in cases where the evidence proves that "a
person other than the accused committed the crime" or to
prove that the victim consented to the act.
<P>
<LI> Assistance to Victims of Sexual Assault.  This section of the
law has six provisions.
<P>
<UL><LI> It amends Title XIX of the Public Health and Human Services
Act to create education and prevention grants to reduce sexual
assault against women.  It authorizes $205 million over five years
for rape prevention seminars, hotlines, training programs for
professionals, and the production of information materials.
<P>
<LI> It provides $2 million over two years to train probation and
parole officers who work with released sex offenders.
<P>
<LI> It requires that a study be conducted to develop model legislation
that provides the maximum protection for the confidentiality of
communication between sexual assault or domestic violence victims
and their counselors.
<P>
<LI> It requires the Attorney General to ensure that all incarcerated
sex offenders are apprised of available sex offender treatment
programs.
<P>
<LI> It authorizes $30 million over three years for the Runaway
and Homeless Act.  Grants may be made under this provision to
agencies that provide a street-based outreach, including treatment,
counseling, and referral for runaway, homeless, and street youth
who have been subjected to or are at risk of being subjected to
sexual abuse.
<P>
<LI> It authorizes $38 million over five years for the Victims of
Child Abuse Act of 1990.</UL>
<P>
<CENTER><H3>"SAFE HOMES FOR WOMEN ACT OF 1994"</H3></CENTER>
<P>
<LI> National Domestic Violence Hotlines.  This provision creates
a national domestic violence hotline for $3 million over six years.
 It will be run by a private agency and will be toll-free, operate
24-hours-per-day and offer information relating to services for
victims of domestic violence to which callers may be referred
throughout the U.S., to include the availability of shelters that
serve battered women.
<P>
<LI> Interstate Enforcement.  The law was changed to increase punishments
for persons who cross state lines with the intent of harming a
spouse or to violate protection orders.  This provision also authorizes
$120 million over three years to encourage states to treat domestic
violence as a serious criminal act.
<P>
<LI> Family Violence Prevention and Services Act.  This Act is amended
to authorize $324 million over five years.
<P>
<LI> Youth Education.  It creates four youth education and domestic
violence model programs for young people.  It authorizes $400,000
for one year.
<P>
<LI> Community Programs on Domestic Violence.  It grants $10 million
over two years for nonprofit organizations to establish projects
that coordinate intervention and prevention of domestic violence.
 The nonprofit organizations may include religious community personnel.
<P>
<LI> Confidentiality for Abused Persons.  The Act requires the U.S.
Postal Service to write regulations that protect the confidentiality
of domestic violence shelters and abused persons' addresses.
<P>
<LI> Data and Research.  It requires the National Academy of Sciences
to study violence against women, including rape and domestic violence.
 The one-year study will report on how states may collect centralized
data on the incidence of sexual and domestic violence offenses.

<TITLE>HEARINGS NEEDED ON END TO COMBAT EXEMPTIONS FOR

<P>
<H2>HEARINGS NEEDED ON END<BR>
TO COMBAT EXEMPTIONS<BR>
FOR WOMEN</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
The Clinton Administration has rescinded combat exclusions for
women without justification and contrary to the recommendations
of the 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women
in the Armed Forces.  These changes have stripped women of more
than one-quarter million combat-related exemptions.  Consider
the changes in the last two years:

<P>
<LI> <B>Combat aircraft.</B>  On April 28, 1993 Former
Secretary of Defense Les Aspin announced that women could be assigned to combat aircraft.
<P>
<LI> <B>Combatant vessels.</B>  On November 30, 1993
Congress rescinded, at the Administration's request, the law exempting women from permanent
assignment aboard combatant vessels.
<P>
<LI> <B>Military's risk rule.</B>  On January 13, 1994
Aspin rescinded the military's risk rule, which resulted in the end of more near-combat and
combat exemptions for women.
<P>
<LI><B>Combat and near-combat positions.</B>  On July 29, 1994 Secretary
of Defense William Perry ended 80,000 more exemptions for women. Women can now be
assigned to more than 80 percent of all military positions and virtually all Air Force (99.7
percent) and Navy positions (94.0 percent).  The Army (67.2 percent) and Marine Corps (62.0
percent) are more restrictive.[1]
<P>
 <CENTER><H3>LITTLE CONGRESSIONAL OVERSIGHT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The 1992 Presidential Commission on the Assignment of Women in the Armed Forces
recommended that "military readiness
should be the driving concern regarding assignment policies."
 The Pentagon, however, has yet to cite the military readiness justification for the recent changes.
Additionally, Congress has not publicly heard from the commission.  
<P>
On October 6, 1994 former chairman of the House Armed Service Committee's Subcommittee
on Military Forces and Personnel Rep. Ike Skelton (D-MO) hosted the sole Congressional
hearing considering the latest changes.  He limited the hearing to one three-member panel which
supported the Administration's changes.  Rep. Jon Kyl (R-AZ) had asked to hear dissenting
views from a panel consisting of commissioners from the 1992 Commission.  His request was
denied.

<P>
Article 1, Section 8 of the Constitution gives Congress the responsibility to "raise and support
armies" and to "provide and maintain a navy."  Congress also must make the rules and
regulations that govern the military, and that includes the number of women in the military and
their assignments.

<P>
The 103rd Congress virtually ignored the Clinton Administration's radical assignment policies. 
These changes do not improve readiness and threaten to leave women vulnerable to a future
draft.  The 104th Congress should conduct a thorough review of Pentagon policies and seek to
reverse the Clinton Administration's current course.

<TITLE>AT&T SUPPORTS HOMOSEXUALITY</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>AT&T SUPPORTS HOMOSEXUALITY</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
Homosexual activists often use the power of the government and
media to try to force society to accept their behavior.  But the
homosexual lobby is also active in corporate America.
<P>
Some companies are actively promoting the homosexual agenda through
direct financial support, advertising campaigns and corporate
policies such as extending domestic partner benefits to homosexuals.
<P>
One of the companies most actively pushing the homosexual agenda
is AT&T.  AT&T's pro-homosexual activities include:
<P>
<LI><B> Support of "Homosexual Marriage."</B>  According
to <I>Diversity Digest</I>, a publication of AT&T's Information
Research Center, the Lesbian, Bisexual and Gay United Employees
at AT&T (LEAGUE) held a conference in which members were encouraged
to "help devise a legal definition of marriage, so the company
can work on extending domestic partner benefits to employees in
states that do not recognize marriages between same-gender partners"
(<I>Diversity Digest</I> August 1994, p. 10).
<P>
<LI><B> Homosexual Direct Mail Advertising.</B>  Last year AT&T
sent about 70,000 direct mail packages targeted at homosexuals.
 The package included brochures featuring smiling homosexual couples
and a flier about AT&T's homosexual employee group.  The materials
were sent in envelopes decorated with a rainbow-colored telephone
cord and the phrase, "It's time for a change..." (<I>The
Washington Blade</I> June 10, 1994, p. 23).
<P>
<LI><B> Indoctrination of Employees.</B>  AT&T has held workshops
and "diversity training" sessions in an effort to force
employees to accept homosexuality.  The company has used Brian
McNaught's video, <I>On Being Gay,</I> in these workshops.  The
video is filled with misleading claims and presents homosexuality as a normal, healthy lifestyle. 
<P>
McNaught, who has done several workshops for AT&T, shows his
bias against those who hold traditional religious values in his
book, <I>Gay Issues in the Workplace</I>.  McNaught links religious
conviction with hate and bigotry.  He suggests that people who
hold strong religious convictions need "counseling"
(p. 100).  He shows contempt for those who hold traditional family
values by suggesting that these values fuel "anti-gay bias."
<P>
The following endorsement by an AT&T official appears on the
back of McNaught's book:  "Every manager and employee who
takes our course on 'Homophobia in the Workplace' will receive
a copy of this book.  Brian McNaught has an incredible skill in helping people understand
and respond to gay issues in a nonthreatening way" (Sheila
Landers, Personnel Services Manager at AT&T Network Systems).
<P>
AT&T has also urged employees to observe Gay and Lesbian Awareness
Week and to place posters and pink triangles on walls to show
that the office is "gay friendly." 
<P>
<LI><B> Support of "The Gay Games."</B>  According to <I>Businessweek</I>
magazine, AT&T helped sponsor a series of sporting events
featuring 11,000 athletes and a budget of $6.5 million.  <I>Businessweek</I>
described the "Gay Games" as "less a series of
sporting events than a nine-day celebration of culture, complete
with parades, plays, music, art shows and food feasts" (<I>Businessweek</I>
July 4, 1994 p. 38).  
<P>
<LI><B> Donations to the Gay Men's Health Crisis.</B>  According
to Brenda Leake of AT&T, the company gave $25,000 to the Gay
Men's Health Crisis in 1992.  Among other things, GMHC distributes
graphic, sexually explicit material to young people in an attempt
to "educate" them about the dangers of AIDS.  The brochures
encourage young people to engage in dangerous and perverse sexual
practices.   
<P>
 <CENTER><B>CONCLUSION</B></CENTER>
<P>
Proponents of pro-homosexual policies cite the need to be "tolerant"
of other people.  But the question is not one of civil rights
or ending "bigotry."  Homosexuals have the same rights
as any other Americans, but are seeking special privileges. 
<P>
Christians and other believers in traditional morality are coming
under enormous pressure in AT&T and other corporations to
ignore their most deeply held beliefs.  "Diversity"
sessions that attack or distort scripture and church teachings
constitute religious harassment.
<P>
The real issue is whether or not people will be forced to accept
homosexual behavior, something that no successful culture has
ever done.  Homosexual behavior is not normal or healthy.  Opposition
to the homosexual agenda is not bigotry; it is common sense.
<P>
If you are concerned about AT&T's promotion of the homosexual
agenda, contact them to express your concern.  Tell AT&T that
it is irresponsible to promote an immoral and unhealthy lifestyle.
 AT&T should incorporate policies that strengthen the family,
not undermine it.

<TITLE>CONSISTENT AND CORRECT CONDOM USE?</TITLE>

<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>CONSISTENT AND CORRECT
<BR>CONDOM USE?</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention (CDC) states that
condoms, in order to be effective, must be put on prior to genital
contact, must remain intact and, most importantly, must be used
<I>consistently and correctly</I>.  But while millions of dollars
are spent each year on public education campaigns to promote &quot;consistent
and correct&quot; condom usage -- from pamphlets in public health
clinics to AIDS education classes in schools to the recent CDC
public service announcements on both radio and television -- many
Americans still do not use condoms consistently or correctly.
<P><UL>
  <LI> A 1990 study published in the <I>American Journal of Public
Health</I> found that most adults in the United States who have
multiple sexual partners do not use condoms consistently.  Among
currently sexually active adults studied, 13 percent had had sex
with more than one partner in the year preceding the study, but
only 8 percent of this group had used condoms consistently.  Moreover,
of the 13 percent of adults who had more than one partner, two-thirds
provided data on primary versus secondary partners, but only 23
percent of these respondents reported using a condom every time
with their nonprimary partners.  (B.C. Leigh, M.T. Temple, and
K.F. Trocki, &quot;The Sexual Behavior of U.S. Adults:  Results
from a National Survey,&quot; <I>American Journal of Public Health</I>,
83:1400-1408, 1993.)
<P>
  <LI> The 1988 National Survey of Family Growth found that only
13 percent of the 1,887 never-married, sexually active women aged
15-49 used condoms &quot;consistently.&quot;  It is significant
to note, however, that this survey's definition of &quot;consistent&quot;
use did <I>not</I> mean using a condom for each <I>act</I> of
intercourse, but rather that the woman had used condoms in every
<I>month</I> throughout the reference period.  In addition, only
41 percent of the entire sample of never-married, sexually active
women had <I>ever</I> used a condom.  (L.B. Potter and J.E. Anderson,
&quot;Patterns of Condom Use and Sexual Behavior Among Never-Married
Women,&quot; <I>Sexually Transmitted Diseases</I>, 20:201-218,
1993.)
<P>
  <LI> A 1989 study of patients at a public sexually transmitted
disease (STD) clinic found that consistent condom use is rare,
even among populations at high risk.  Of the 300 patients who
participated in the survey, 51 percent of the men and 64 percent
of the women reported having had an STD in the past, and 47 percent
of all subjects were diagnosed with an STD on the day they were
interviewed.  Forty percent also agreed that their sexual behavior put them at risk of HIV
infection.  However,
only 25 percent of respondents had used a condom at the most recent
intercourse, and only 16 percent of black respondents and 13 percent
of Hispanics reported having used a condom at their last sexual
encounter.  The participants appeared to understand the benefits
of using condoms regularly; however, only 60 percent said they
had used a condom at least once in the previous two months.  (H.S.
Weinstock, et al., &quot;Factors Associated with Condom Use in
a High-Risk Heterosexual Population,&quot; <I>Sexually Transmitted
Diseases</I>, 20:14-20, 1993.)
<P>
  <LI> A 1991 study published in <I>Family Planning Perspectives</I>
found that more than half of all unmarried male participants (60
percent of Hispanics and 54 percent of non-Hispanics) had had
two or more heterosexual partners in the year preceding the survey.
 Among married men, 18 percent of Hispanics and 9 percent of non-Hispanic
whites had had two or more sexual partners.  However, while 51
percent of Hispanic men and 49 percent of non-Hispanic men did
<I>not</I> always use condoms with their secondary partners, theoretically
putting both themselves and their primary partners at risk, only
20 percent of Hispanic men and 9 percent of non-Hispanic men used
condoms with their primary partners.  (B. Van Oss Martin, C.A.
Gomez, and N. Hearst, &quot;Multiple Heterosexual Partners and
Condom Use Among Hispanics and Non-Hispanic Whites,&quot; <I>Family
Planning Perspectives</I>, 25:170-174, 1993.)</UL>

<TITLE>IMMIGRATION AND THE AMERICAN FAMILY</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>IMMIGRATION
<BR>AND THE AMERICAN FAMILY</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
In recent years, the debate over immigration has broadened and
intensified.  A growing segment of the population would like to
reduce or stop the flow of foreigners entering the United States,
while many others want to adhere to America's historic policy
of welcoming newcomers to our shores.
<P>
Ignored in this increasingly bitter debate is the question of
whether or not our immigration policies are friendly to the preservation
and nurture of family life.
<P>
The American family is in trouble.  Over the past three decades,
the rise of divorce, an increase in nonmarital cohabitation, soaring
rates of teenage pregnancy and sexually transmitted diseases,
widespread drug abuse, an epidemic of juvenile crime and the alarming
proportion of out-of-wedlock births provide hard statistical evidence
that this basic social institution is under siege.
<P>
Clearly, many people interested in immigrating to the United States
have an old-world sense of familial loyalty and an unshakable
belief in the sanctity of marriage.  To such people -- and to
existing U.S. citizens -- we owe a commitment to craft immigration
law in a manner that respects and undergirds the marital institution.
<P>
To that end, we have two concerns that we would like to see the
Commission address:
<P>
1)  Current law allows adult children and siblings to apply for
permanent citizenship on the basis of family relationships.  This
essentially well-meaning policy should be reexamined and modified.
<P>
On the surface, the law here seems to work on behalf of families,
allowing adult children to be reunited with parents, and brothers
and sisters to join those siblings who have already immigrated
to this country.  In fact, it imposes hardships on family members
who are in greater need of reunion.  Here's how:
<P>
Since immigration is limited by quotas, the adult children of
U.S. citizens are often admitted to this country while the spouses
and children of green card holders are kept waiting on a distant
shore.
<P>
Because existing preferences for nuclear family relatives of U.S.
citizens are not extended to green card holders, a husband and
wife in one family might be separated for years while an adult brother in another family comes
to the U.S. under a law intended to reunite families.
<P>
To address this problem, the Family Research Council recommends
that current law be modified so that all backlogs in nuclear family
categories be cleared before adult children and siblings are granted
entry under family reunification status.  (It may even be well
to consider eliminating the preference for adult children and
siblings altogether, since backlogs in those categories are already
so large.)  Giving preference to all nuclear family relationships
would allow more spouses and minor children to enter as family
members -- and American family life would be strengthened correspondingly.
<P>
2)  Current law has been implemented inappropriately as cohabiting
couples and same-sex couples have been admitted on temporary visas
under the rubric of &quot;family.&quot;
<P>
While current law does not recognize such couples as &quot;family,&quot;
the federal government reportedly has allowed this interpretation
in cases of temporary visas.  The continuation of this practice
would mean that:
<P>
<LI> The number of cohabiting couples in the United States would
increase, albeit temporarily, as the result of official immigration
action;
<P>
<LI> The number of homosexual couples would also increase with the
official sanction of the INS;
<P>
<LI> The precedent set by such a practice might well be used in the
future to justify similar action in the case of permanent immigration.
<P>
In order to eliminate this practice -- which undermines the sanctity
of marriage and the stability of family life in America -- the
U.S. Commission on Immigration Reform should call upon the appropriate
federal agencies and congressional oversight committees to take
whatever steps necessary to ensure that non-marital couples are
not granted visas as a &quot;family.&quot;
<P>
 <CENTER><H3>SUMMARY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The current larger debate over immigration might well be tempered
if immigration policy were more deliberately crafted to encourage
the immigration of families and those most likely to support traditional
family values.
<P>
Many of the problems we face as a nation can be attributed, either
directly or indirectly, to the breakdown of family life.
<P>
To be successful, immigration policy should support family values
rather than contribute to their further erosion.  An overtly pro-family
stance on the part of the INS and other government agencies would
ease the fears of those who believe that our borders should be
closed completely to avoid the further collapse of American society.
<P>
The importance of stable marriages and families to the health
of a nation cannot be underestimated.  The late Pitirim Sorokin,
chairman of Harvard's Sociology Department and President of the
International Institute of Sociology, warned Americans nearly
40 years ago that the decline in family life must be reversed
or America would go the way of other nations that suffered cultural
breakdown.  In 1956, he wrote in <I>The American Sex Revolution</I>
(Boston: Porter Sargent Publisher): 
<P>
<UL><I>...marriage has been regarded by all societies as the culminating
point of human existence, and as the most decisive factor in the
survival and well-being of the societies themselves....the candle
of the American marriage and family is being burned at both ends
-- both as a union of husband and wife, and as a union of parents
and children.  And with their disintegration, marriage and the
family progressively fail in the performance of tasks of maintaining
the well-being of the individual and ensuring the survival of
the nation itself.</I></UL>
<P>
Immigrants like Sorokin (a refugee from the Soviet Union) have
contributed immeasurably to the moral health of the United States.
 We should make certain that, regardless of how the current debate
over influx is resolved, our nation's immigration policies are
always structured to ensure the survival and continuing strength
of America's families.

<TITLE>DR. KINSEY AND THE CHILDREN OF TABLE 34</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>DR. KINSEY AND THE CHILDREN<BR>OF TABLE 34</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
In 1948, zoologist Alfred C. Kinsey shocked the world with his
study <I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</I>.  In 1953 a companion
volume, <I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Female</I>, was published.
 Although many scientists were critical of Kinsey's methods, the
media popularized Kinsey's findings. But serious questions have
been raised about Kinsey's research:
<P>
<LI><B> Allegations of fraudulent data and child sexual abuse.</B>
The book <I>Kinsey, Sex and Fraud</I> (Reisman, Eichel, Court,
Muir; Huntington House, 1990) shows that either the Kinsey data
on child sexuality were manufactured or that children were sexually
abused in the name of science.  Table 34 in Kinsey's study contains
detailed data about molestation of young boys.  According to a
review in the British medical journal, <I>The Lancet,</I> the
authors of <I>Kinsey, Sex and Fraud</I> &quot;demolish&quot; Kinsey's
credibility.
<P>
<LI><B> Allegations of improper sampling. </B> Kinsey relied heavily
on data gleaned from prison inmates, including sex offenders,
and extrapolated those findings to the general population.  Although
criminals made up less than one percent of the population, inmates
made up a sizable portion of Kinsey's male sample. 
<P>
<LI><B> Issue of &quot;volunteer&quot; error raised -- and ignored.
</B> Esteemed colleagues of Kinsey such as psychologist Abraham
Maslow warned Kinsey that his survey suffered greatly from &quot;volunteer
bias.&quot;  Maslow told Kinsey that such surveys tend to be skewed
toward the sexually promiscuous and unconventional.  Kinsey ignored
the advice and terminated their collegial relationship.
<P>
Kinsey's work remains an underpinning for many ongoing federally-sponsored
programs.  His conclusions have permeated America's educational
institutions and are the major behavioral model on which sex education
programs are designed.  The Kinsey ideology has affected everything
from sex offender laws to the sexual portrayal of children in
pornographic publications.
<P>
The reliance on reports of sexual abuse of children under the
auspices of federally-supported research demands investigation.
 FRC's new video, &quot;The Children of Table 34,&quot; asks such
important questions as:   
<P>
<LI><B> How were the children procured for the experiments?</B>
<BR>
<LI><B> Where are the children now?</B>
<BR>
<LI><B> Did the parents of the children give consent to the experiments?</B>
<P>
It is essential that these and other questions be answered by
the Kinsey Institute and the surviving associates of Dr. Kinsey.

<title>FAMILY CAP TALKING POINTS</title>
<body>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<h2>FAMILY CAP TALKING POINTS</h2></center>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
*  Two wrongs don't make a right.  It is foolish to fight abortion
by embracing welfare subsidies.  There are no data to support
the contention that the current welfare system suppresses the
abortion rate -- in the short-term or the long-term.  In fact,
the welfare state peacefully coexists with the world's highest
abortion rates outside the Eastern Bloc.
<P>
*  All the data demonstrate that subsidizing illegitimacy will
actually increase the number of abortions because it increases
promiscuity and discourages marriage.  Illegitimacy and abortion
spring from the same misconception that life is cheap and motherhood
bears no sacred responsibility.                         
<P><UL>
The correlation between abortion and illegitimacy in a state-by-state
analysis is astronomically high (between .67 and .72, with 1.0
designating a perfect correlation).  Likewise, abortion and illegitimacy
trends track together over time.
<P>
 States that have more generous welfare benefits also have higher
abortion rates.  When the 50 states are organized into quintiles,
for example, the rank order correlation between abortions per
1,000 live births and average monthly AFDC benefits is perfect.
<P>
 Welfare promotes family disintegration, and girls who are born
out-of-wedlock are much more likely to engage in premarital sex.
 Premarital sex is 9 times more likely to engender abortion, and
women who have never married are more than 5 times as likely to
have abortions as their married counterparts. 
<P></UL>
*  State by state analysis demonstrates that small changes in
welfare payouts do not appear to correlate closely with short-run
changes in the abortion rate.  Texas, for example, experienced
a 27% drop in abortions in the 1980s, while welfare payouts remained
consistently low relative to the national average.
<P>
*  The termination of benefits may in fact reduce the number of
abortions in the short-term because many pregnant young women
will turn to pro-life crisis pregnancy centers.  Teenagers will
be more likely to remain at home with parents, and parental notification
laws have proven effective in reducing the number of abortions.
<P>
*  Abortions are less likely to increase in the short-term because
many low-income girls deliberately choose to have a baby.  Abortion
would deny them an important status symbol.  Surveys also demonstrate
that moral opposition to abortion is strongest among the poor.
<P>
*  The logic of pro-life opposition to welfare reform is that
we should increase entitlements tenfold in order to save even
more lives and that we should forgo any crackdown on deadbeat
dads, since more men might pressure more women into abortions.
 Pro-lifers should support marriage and adoption, instead of opposing
welfare reform.
<P>
*  A crisis as broad and deep as abortion on demand requires more
than legal reform.  The question we should be asking is &quot;What
constitutes progress toward ending altogether the culture that
finds abortion acceptable?&quot;  The answer certainly includes
welfare reform that reduces illegitimacy.

<TITLE>A FEW FACTS ABOUT ILLEGITIMACY</TITLE>

<P>
<H2>A FEW FACTS ABOUT ILLEGITIMACY</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<LI>  Today, nearly one out of three children is born out of wedlock,
as opposed to one in ten in 1970.  If current trends continue,
by the year 2015 half of all American children will be born to
a single mother.
<P>
<LI>  In 1991, 1.2 million births were illegitimate -- the highest
number ever reported in the U.S.  In 1993, 6.3 million children
were living with a single parent who had never married.  In 1960,
the number was 243,000.
<P>
<LI>  The illegitimacy rate among black Americans was 26% in 1965.
 Today the rate is 68% and climbing.  In inner cities, the figure
is typically in excess of 80%.  Only 6% of black children born
in 1980 will live with both parents through age 18, according
to some projections.
<P>
<LI>  The illegitimacy rate among white Americans has risen tenfold,
from 2.29% in 1960 to 22% today -- almost the same as the black
illegitimacy rate in the early 1960s that motivated Daniel Patrick
Moynihan to write his famous report on the breakdown of the black
family.  The figure in low-income, working-class white communities
may already be twice that.  According to the latest Census Bureau
runs, the illegitimate birth rate in many white communities now
exceeds 40%, and out-of-wedlock births are increasing more rapidly
among whites than minorities.
<P>
<LI>  Women with college degrees contribute only 4% of white illegitimate
babies, while women  with a high school education or less contribute
82%.  Women with family incomes of $75,000  or more contribute
1% of white illegitimate babies, while women with family incomes
under $20,000 contribute 69%.  For white women below the poverty
line in the year prior to giving birth, 44% of births have been
illegitimate, as opposed to only 6% for women above the poverty
line.
<P>
<LI>  In 1992, 30% of all non-marital births were to females under
the age of 20.  The federal government has a particular interest
in preventing unwed teenage childbearing because teen mothers
who enter the welfare system are far more likely than older mothers
to rely on government to support their children and to form long-term
attachments to AFDC.
<P>
<LI>  By 1992, 71% of teen mothers were unmarried -- a more than
doubling of the rate in just one generation.  In 1970, the proportion
of teen mothers who were unmarried was 30%.  In 1950, 14% of births
to teenagers were to unmarried mothers.
<P>
<LI>  Almost half of unwed teen mothers go on welfare within one
year after the birth of a first child.  By the time the baby is
age 5, 72% of white teens and 84% of black teens have received
AFDC. 
<P>
<LI>  Nearly one out of five teens who have a premarital pregnancy
will become pregnant again within one year.  More than 31% experience
a second pregnancy within two years.

<H2>ILLEGITIMACY'S DISASTROUS EFFECTS</H2>

<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<LI>  Out of wedlock pregnancy is a near certain predictor of poverty.
 The one-parent family is six times more likely to be poor than
the two-parent family.
<P>
 
<LI>  Women who bear illegitimate children (especially before finishing
high school) are far more likely to rely on government to support
their children and to spend more years on welfare once enrolled.
<P>
<LI>  Children born outside of marriage are three times more likely
to depend on welfare themselves when they reach adulthood.
<P>
<LI>  Illegitimacy feeds itself.  Young white women who grow up without
a father in the home are more than twice as likely to bear children
out of wedlock.  And boys living in a single-parent family are
twice as likely to father a child out of wedlock as boys from
intact homes.
<P>
<LI>  More than 70% of all juveniles in state reform institutions
come from fatherless homes.  The relationship between crime and
one-parent families is so powerful that controlling for family
structure erases the relationship between crime and race or poverty.
<P>
<LI>  The likelihood that a young male will engage in criminal activities
doubles if he is raised without a father and triples if he lives
in a neighborhood with a high concentration of single-parent families.
<P>
<LI>  The greater the incidence of single-parent families in a neighborhood,
the higher the incidence of violent crime and burglary.
<P>
<LI>  Teenage single-parent mothering is the single greatest contributor
to low birth weight babies.  Studies show that the high rate of
out-of-wedlock births to young mothers is the primary explanation
for America's low international standing on measures of infant
mortality.
<P>
<LI>  Children born out of wedlock are much more likely to experience
abuse or neglect.
<P>
<LI>  Children born out of wedlock are more likely to experience
impaired physical development and low cognitive/verbal development.
 Among children aged 3-5 in one study, those with teen mothers
were twice as likely to have few children's books in the home.
<P>
<LI>  Children from single-parent families are two to three times
more likely to have emotional or behavioral problems than children
from intact families.  They also exhibit weaker peer adjustment
and a weaker sense of right and wrong.
<P>
<LI>  Children from fatherless homes have lower educational aspirations
and a low level of educational achievement.  Studies also show
that illegitimacy reduces job performance, professional attainment,
individual income, and the overall health of the economy.

</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<LI>  The essential purpose of welfare reform must be to reduce illegitimacy.
 A system that subsidizes illegitimacy perpetuates illegitimacy
-- and poverty.  
<P>
<LI>  Welfare is bondage:  women bear illegitimate children in exchange
for benefits that can never compare with the benefits of an intact
family.
<P>
<LI>  The elimination of grants to unwed teenage mothers is necessary
to restore the integrity of the family unit for future generations.
 Even Frances Perkins, the most liberal member of the Roosevelt
Administration, opposed extending federal entitlements to unmarried
mothers because she foresaw that subsidizing illegitimacy would
escalate family breakdown.
<P>
<LI>  As the one policy option that promises to effect change in
the current system, restrictions on benefits by definition constitute
the compassionate alternative.
<P>
<LI>  We are combatting not material poverty, but a poverty of the
spirit.  Every individual, regardless of income level, is capable
of moral autonomy.  Welfare is demeaning because it denies that
truth.
<P>
<LI>  Even Democrats now concede Dan Quayle was right.  Families
bestow advantages that simply come no other way.
<P>
<LI>  Every individual deserves equal access to the privilege of
family, and welfare denies its recipients that privilege.  In
communities where illegitimacy has reached a critical mass, many
children don't even have the opportunity to see what a family
looks like, much less live in one.
<P>
<LI>  By eroding our nation's moral capital, illegitimacy jeopardizes
the entire experiment in democratic self-government.  If citizens
cannot govern their own lives, how can they govern the republic?
<P>
<LI>  The role of the two-parent family is essential in sustaining
a free society because it is the vehicle by which values are transmitted
from generation to generation.  Only a virtuous people can be
free.  Welfare erodes first the freedom of dependents and then
freedom at large. 
<P>
<LI>  If we succeed in putting more unmarried welfare mothers to
work, we will still be left with roughly the same number of fatherless
children.  If current trends continue, one of every two babies
will be born to a single mother within the next 20 years.
<P>
<LI>  Illegitimacy is not a race issue.  Out-of-wedlock births are
increasing more rapidly among whites, and the illegitimacy rate
in many white communities now exceeds 40%.

<TITLE>SERIOUS FLAWS IN THE KINSEY RESEARCH</TITLE>
<BODY>

<P>
<H2>SERIOUS FLAWS IN THE
<BR>KINSEY RESEARCH</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
Since the publication of <I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Male</I>
(1948) and <I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Female</I> (1953) there
has been much criticism of the findings and methods of Dr. Alfred
Kinsey. 
<P>
The 1990 book <I>Kinsey, Sex and Fraud</I> (Reisman, Eichel, Court
and Muir; Lochinvar-Huntington House) examined the work of Dr.
Kinsey.  The book revealed a number of serious flaws in his research,
including shocking evidence that Kinsey used data from the sexual
abuse of children.
<P>
According to scientific fraud specialist Dr. Walter Stewart of
the National Research Council, evidence of problems in Kinsey's
research is "compelling.... disturbing...and requires investigation."[1]
 Problems include:
<P>
<LI> <B>Sexual Experiments on Children --</B> The Kinsey male report
contains data on sexual activity of 317 children aged 2 months
to 15 years.  These data were either manufactured or these children
were sexually molested by adults in the name of science.  The
data are contained in graph tables which chronicle attempts to
bring children to "orgasm."
<P>
<LI> <B>Sampling Errors --</B> Kinsey's sample was entirely voluntary
and not representative of the U.S. population.  White people were
overrepresented while Blacks and Latinos were underrepresented.
 In addition, college students, college graduates, and white-collar
workers were overrepresented.  Prison inmates comprised 25 percent
of Kinsey's male sample, even though they made up less than one
percent of the total U.S. population at the time.  Among women,
58 percent of Kinsey's sample were unmarried, three times the
actual number at the time.  Religious people were not adequately
represented and since only 10 states were included, the survey
was regionally skewed.
<P>
<LI> <B>Volunteer Error --</B> Psychologist Abraham Maslow raised
this issue by pointing out that sex surveys are skewed toward
the sexually promiscuous and unconventional.  Many people, especially
in the late 1940s and early 1950s, were not willing to talk openly
about their most intimate lives.  Those who did often exaggerated.
 Maslow proved the volunteer error in a test he conducted at Brooklyn
College and concluded that "the whole basis for Kinsey's
statistics was proven to be shaky."[2] 
<P>
Further evidence of Maslow's contention that sex surveys are inherently
slanted is found in a book written by Wardell Pomeroy, one of
Kinsey's co-authors.  Pomeroy writes:

<P>
"As types, those who took the most romantic view of sex were,
understandably, people who were the most religious -- clergymen
and their wives especially.  Those who were bubbling over to tell
us everything they could were usually homosexuals, particularly
when they discovered by our use of homosexual argot that we knew
about the kind of lives they led.  They would almost visibly expand
with relief and eagerness to talk."[3]
<P>
<LI> <B>Intimidation/Coaching of Respondents --</B> Kinsey instructed
his interviewers to goad their subjects into revelations of their
sexual behavior, especially if the results didn't match the interviewer's
assumptions. Wardell Pomeroy admitted that such coaching was quite
common in the Kinsey team's data collection.[4]  These tactics were
particularly effective with prison inmates.  If the inmates did
not provide answers they would have to return to their cells,
thus losing access to the free candy, soft drinks and cigarettes
provided by the Kinsey interviewers.
<P>
When some interviewees said that they did not do a particular
sex act, the interviewer would say: "Yes, I know you have
never done that, but how old were you the <I>first</I> time that
you did it?"[5] 
<P>
Kinsey's team intimidated subjects when they suspected that the
subject was being dishonest.  According to Kinsey, the interviewers
"...should denounce the subject with considerable severity..."[6]
Kinsey admitted that these tactics were highly unusual: "Such
an attack on a dishonest subject is quite contrary to the usual
rules for interviewing, and a procedure which we at first hesitated
to employ in the present study.  We have, however, decided that
it is a necessary technique in dealing with some individuals."[7]
  
<P>
<LI> <B>Ideological Bias --</B> According to Kinsey biographer Paul
Robinson, Kinsey consistently favored nontraditional forms of
sexuality in the way he constructed his books.  Marital intercourse
was "rudely confined to a single chapter in the back of the
book, where it received about one-third the attention devoted
to homosexual relations... a remarkable feat of sexual leveling...the
fundamental categories of his analysis clearly worked to undermine
the traditional sexual order."[8] A 1989 National Academy of
Sciences report explained that Kinsey "attempted to counter
the traditional religious view that sexual virtue was entirely
composed of heterosexual activity...inside the bonds of marriage..."[9]
Kinsey himself summarized the Old Testament's and the Talmud's
injunctions against sexual relations with animals by saying: "The
student of human folkways is inclined to see a considerable body
of superstition in the origins of all such taboos..."[10]
<P>
In addition to Dr. Walter Stewart and Dr. Abraham Maslow, critics
of the Kinsey reports include a committee appointed by the Commission
on Statistical Standards of the American Statistical Association.
 In 1954 the committee reported several statistical flaws and
concluded that "Kinsey should have been more cautious in
boldly drawing highly precise conclusions from their limited sample."[11]
<P>
The 1989 National Academy of Sciences report warned that the sampling
flaws limited "the comparability and appropriateness of the
Kinsey data as a basis for calculating the prevalence of any form
of sexual conduct."[12]
<P>
The Kinsey data are flawed and have been contradicted by subsequent
research.  However, Kinsey's work continues to be widely used
by policy makers and the culture at large in dealing with sexuality.
 The Kinsey data must be discarded.

<TITLE>USES OF KINSEY'S FLAWED RESEARCH</TITLE>

<H2>USES OF KINSEY'S FLAWED<BR>
RESEARCH</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P><CENTER>
<I>by</I>
<P>
<I>Robert H. Knight</I></CENTER>
<P>
Forty-two years after its release, <I>Sexual Behavior in the Human
Male</I> by Alfred C. Kinsey remains a highly influential document
in government funding of sex education and health programs despite
a general understanding that its research methods were unscientific.
 The Kinsey ideology has altered the nation's legal codes for
sex crimes and has been used as a touchstone for numerous federal
policies, particularly the funding of sex education, research,
and prevention programs for AIDS, drug abuse, and youth suicide.
 
<P>
<LI>  Based on the Kinsey ideology that premarital sexuality is superior
to marriage-based sex, federally-funded sex and health education
curricula have been geared almost entirely toward sexually active
teens, implying that abstinence before marriage is abnormal. 
The federal government began funding adolescent pregnancy prevention
programs during the 1970's under Title X of the Public Health
Service Act.  Curricula funded through Title X often include ideas
and "facts" derived from the Kinsey studies.  After
$3 billion in taxpayer-funded programs, America's teenage pregnancy
rate is far higher than when the programs began.  And there is
growing evidence that such programs actually increase sexual activity
among teens.[1] Yet the programs, which emphasize how teens should
engage in sex rather than why they shouldn't, continue to receive
heavy subsidies from taxpayers.  In fiscal 1995, the federal government
will spend $190.4 million on Title X projects.  By contrast, the
Adolescent Family Life Act, or Title XX of the Public Health Service
Act, whose abstinence-based programs reduce teen pregnancies,[2]
is slated to receive only $6.7 million in federal funds in fiscal
1995.
<P>
Planned Parenthood receives about $50 million annually from Title
X grants.  This money is used to design and implement sex education
and health programs for thousands of schools across America and
to operate clinics.  Giving lip service to the idea of abstinence
before marriage, Planned Parenthood-designed programs openly support
sexual experimentation.  For instance:
<P>
1)  An adolescent curriculum prepared for the Alameda-San Francisco
branch of Planned Parenthood tells young people that it is a "myth"
that "[y]oung women who have more than one sexual partner
are easy.  Some people, both men and women, prefer to relate sexually
to more than one person at a time.  This is an individual preference."[3]
 

<P>
2)  The Planned Parenthood Center of Syracuse, New York, issued
a pamphlet for teens that says:  "Many people believe that sex relations
are right only when they are married.  Others decide to have sex outside of marriage. 
This is a personal choice."[4]
<P>
3)  In a family planning magazine published under a federal grant,
a Planned Parenthood affiliated physician gives this advice to
teens:  "If we have sex for our own reasons, then there is
nothing wrong with sexual activities."[5]
<P>
4)  In 1991, Planned Parenthood of Maryland joined several government
agencies to sponsor the Affirming Diversity Conference.  Conference
coordinator John Hannay told an interviewer:  "We use the
Kinsey studies as a starting point to determine how many youth
would fall into this [child homosexuality] category.  As the cross
section of society goes, you would probably expect to see a good
10% will have predominantly or exclusively homosexual tendencies...
There haven't been any studies done on sexual orientation among
adolescents, so we're just going on estimates on adults and the
10 percent figure.  The thing is that many students will be aware
that they are different, but they would probably not describe
their difference as being a homosexual."[6]
<P>
<LI>  AIDS prevention programs are funded through grants from the
U.S. Centers for Disease Control (CDC).  In fiscal 1989, the CDC
spent $266.6 million on AIDS education.[7]  In fiscal 1995, the
CDC is spending $589 million on HIV/AIDS projects, plus another
$105 million on sexually transmitted diseases.  This amounts to
about a third of CDC's total $2.1 billion budget.[8]
<P>
<LI>  The Sex Information and Education Council of the United States
(SIECUS) is supported by the U.S. Department of Health and Human
Services, which gave SIECUS two grants totalling $360,397 in fiscal
1994.[9] One of the founding board members of SIECUS was Wardell
B. Pomeroy, a co-author of the 1948 Kinsey male sexuality study.
 In 1980, another SIECUS co-founder, Mary Calderone, told a group
of doctors that the primary goal of SIECUS was to educate society
"very broadly and deeply with the awareness of the vital
importance of infant and childhood sexuality."[10]
<P>
A 1985 SIECUS report says:  "...homosexuality is an essential
quality of humanness, and that its expression is the right of
every human being."  In March 1991, SIECUS published a report,
"Winning the Battle:  Developing Support for Sexuality and
HIV/AIDS Education."  The report suggests that one way to
deal with opponents of some types of sex education is to determine
their religious affiliation and publicize it in order to stigmatize
them.[11] SIECUS also advocates the teaching of "alternative
lifestyles" and the use of "values clarification"
to help youth "question, explore, and assess sexual attitudes
and feelings in order to develop their own values..."[12]
<P>
Debra Haffner, executive director of SIECUS, in a 1988 SIECUS
report says:  "Colleagues and I have fantasized about a national
'petting project' for teenagers... to help them learn courting
behaviors and to, once again, give teens time to learn slowly
about their sexuality... Today's teens also need to have that
opportunity for unpressured discovery of sexual feelings and responses...
A partial list of safe sex practices for teens could include...
massaging, caressing, undressing each other, masturbation alone,
masturbation in front of a partner, and mutual masturbation."[13]
<P>
In a 1990 SIECUS report, Haffner asked readers to "Imagine
a world where:  School sexuality education is compulsory.  Contraceptives
are readily available.  Abortion is free until the 18th week of
pregnancy.  There is a law that states that, 'Cohabitation between
people of the same sex is entirely acceptable from society's point
of view.'... I was most impressed by the sense that in Sweden
sexuality is truly accepted as a natural and healthy part of living.
 Young people have a right to their sexual feelings and to sexual
education."[14]  
<P>
<P>
<LI>  In 1950, Alfred Kinsey testified before the California Assembly's
Subcommittee on Sex Crimes on behalf of liberalizing state laws
regarding sex offenders.  Kinsey argued specifically for granting
immediate paroles to child molesters and also counseled that parents
should not warn children about strangers because it might frighten
them.  In his testimony, he included little or no information
about sex crime victims, and noted that societal disapproval of
the acts posed more harm that the acts themselves.[15]  Kinsey also
worked with other state legislatures to liberalize sex crime laws
and openly called for changes in molestation laws in his second
study, <I>Sexual Behavior in the Human Female</I>:  "It is
difficult to understand why a child, except for its cultural conditioning,
should be disturbed at having its genitalia touched, or disturbed
at seeing the genitalia of other persons, or disturbed at even
more specific sexual contacts."[16]  
<P>
<LI>  Following the advice of such a prominent scientist, federal
and state officials began altering the penalties for molestation
and other sex crimes, as noted in a paper by Dr. Judith Reisman.
 In 1977 and 1985, the U.S. Department of Justice's National Survey
of Crime Severity, a perennial list of more than 200 crimes that
is used by the legal community to establish sentencing guidelines,
omitted child rape, child pornography, and child prostitution
as serious crimes.[17]
<P>
Writing in <I>Scientific Monthly</I> in 1955, law enforcement
scholar Morris L. Ernst explains Kinsey's importance:  "The
Kinsey report is the single greatest contribution of science to
the rule-making part of the law in my lifetime."[18]  
<P>
<LI>  The Kinsey influence also extends into federally-funded projects
at sex research institutes, including the Kinsey Institute for
Research in Sex, Gender, and Reproduction, which was founded by
Kinsey at Indiana University in Bloomington, Indiana in 1947.
 Indiana University provides support to the Kinsey Institute,[19]
and the Institute also provides support to federally-funded researchers.

<P>
Former Kinsey Institute Director June Machover Reinisch was awarded
three grants from the National Institutes of Health totalling
more than $3 million from 1981 to 1989.[20]  In 1989, the <I>Chicago
Tribune</I> reported that the National Institutes of Health launched
an investigation into "how millions of federal research grant
dollars were spent" by Reinisch.  In the case of one grant
for $658,307 from the National Institutes of Child Health and
Human Development, an NIH investigator found "no financial
illegalities" but did find that payments made to a subcontracted
researcher had been placed in a special bank account under the
names of the Kinsey Institute, Reinisch, and another Kinsey employee.[21]
 "This procedure is unconventional and highly questionable,"
the report stated.[22]  The bank account was closed "as a result
of the initial internal review conducted by the University."[23]
<P>
Another example of a federally-funded researcher under Kinsey
auspices is Howard B. Kaplan, co-author of a chapter in the Kinsey
Institute's 1990 book, <I>Homosexuality, Heterosexuality:  Concepts
of Sexual Orientation</I>.  Kaplan received a grant for this work
from the National Institute on Drug Abuse of the Centers for Disease
Control.[24]
<P>
In 1987, two federal agencies -- the National Institute of Allergy
and Infectious Diseases and the National Institute of Child Health
and Human Development -- sponsored The Fourth Kinsey Symposium,
titled, "AIDS and Sex:  An Integrated Biomedical and Biobehavioral
Approach."  The conference, which was also sponsored by the
host organization, the Kinsey Institute, was co-chaired by Bruce
Voeller, the late homosexual activist who was president of the
Mariposa Education and Research Foundation of Topanga, California.
 A conference statement describes Mariposa's purpose:  "to
foster a society more honest and at ease with its own sexuality.
. ."[25]  According to <I>Who's Who in America</I>, former
Kinsey Institute President June Reinisch is also affiliated with
Mariposa.[26]
<P>
<LI>  One of the most common myths derived from Kinsey's research
is the estimate that 10 percent of the population is homosexual.
 Until recently this figure has been accepted without question.
<P>
The overblown 10 percent figure is actually an exaggeration of
Kinsey's claim.  Kinsey said that 10 percent of males are homosexual
for at least three years during a portion of their lives.  For
females, Kinsey said, the figure was less than five percent. 
Homosexual activists along with the media repeatedly cited the
10 percent figure and it was generally accepted by the culture.
<P>
The figure has been used to lobby for homosexual affirmation programs,
the extension of family benefits to homosexual employees of corporations,
and to frighten elected officials and business leaders into believing
that they have to accommodate a sizable minority.
<P>
A huge body of evidence has emerged challenging the 10 percent
figure.  Studies from the U.S., Canada, Britain, France, Norway,
Denmark and other nations show a homosexuality prevalence of one
percent or less.[27]

<BR>SELECTED QUOTATIONS ON THE
<BR>SIGNIFICANCE OF GOALS 2000</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
&quot;The enactment of the Goals 2000: Educate America Act and
the School-to-Work Opportunities Act signaled the beginning of
a new era in education reform that <I>will over time touch all
schools</I>.&quot;
<UL><I>--Department of Education Justifications of Appropriation Estimates
to the Congress Fiscal Year 1996 Volume I</I></UL>
<P>
America 2000, President Bush's educational reform plan, was the
predecessor of Goals 2000.  &quot;It was a self-proclaimed conservative
Republican... who was advocating <I>a monumental movement away
from local control of education</I>.&quot;    
<UL><I>--John F. Jennings, Institute for Educational Leadership</I></UL>
<P>
&quot;When the legislative dust settles and future historians
examine the Clinton Administration, they will devote a major chapter
to the Goals 2000: Educate America Act.... Like President Lincoln's
Morrill Act of 1862 and President Johnson's Elementary and Secondary
Education Act of 1965, President Bill Clinton's Goals 2000 Act
will stand as an education beacon.&quot;
<UL><I>--Richard W. Riley, U.S. Secretary of Education</I></UL>
<P>
&quot;[Goals 2000 is] the most important education legislation
we've ever had.&quot;
<UL><I>--Albert Shanker, President, American Federation of Teachers</I></UL>
<P>
&quot;In the first three titles, Goals 2000 establishes overall
direction for a new local-state-federal partnership in education.&quot;
<UL><I>--Gordon M. Ambach, Executive Director, Council of Chief State
School Officers</I></UL>
<P>
&quot;Perhaps most important, Goals 2000 lays the conceptual groundwork
for other federal legislation, establishing a model for coherence
among federal and national endeavors in education that has never been seen before....&quot;
<UL><I>--Jennifer O'Day, Associate Director, Pew Forum on Education
Reform</I></UL>
<P>
&quot;Goals 2000 is a new way of doing business in America.  It
represents the direction our government must take in many problems
in the 21st century.&quot;    
<UL><I>--President Bill Clinton</I></UL>

<TITLE>NEW RESEARCH SHOWS ADOPTED CHILDREN FARE BETTER THAN
CHILDREN IN SINGLE PARENT HOUSEHOLDS</TITLE>

<P>
<H2>NEW RESEARCH SHOWS
<BR>ADOPTED CHILDREN FARE
<BR>BETTER THAN CHILDREN IN
<BR>SINGLE PARENT HOUSEHOLDS</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<CENTER><I>by</I>
<P>
<I>Gracie S. Hsu</I></CENTER>
<P>
New research data released by the National Center for Health Statistics
shows that adopted children fare better than children in single
parent households on a number of practical health indicators.
 The study, &quot;Health of Our Nation's Children,&quot; is based
on the 1988 National Health Interview Survey (NHIS).
<P>
Specifically, the study found that adopted children are far more
likely than fatherless children in single parent households to:
<UL>
<LI><B>Wear seatbelts</B> -- While 20.6 percent of adopted children
rarely or never wear seatbelts, nearly 40 percent of children
in single-mother homes do not wear seatbelts.  This disparity
is especially marked when the children are under the age of 12.
 Among fatherless children, 30.1 percent of 3- to 4-year-olds
and 44.6 percent of 5- to 11-year-olds rarely or never wear seatbelts;
only 12.3 percent of adopted children in either age range do not
wear seatbelts.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>See a dentist</B> -- Only 10.3 percent of  adopted children
aged 3-17 have not seen a dentist in the past 2 years, compared
with 19.7 percent of children living in single-mother homes.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Live in a smoke-free home</B> -- Less than 32 percent of
adopted children currently live or have lived during the past
year in a household with a smoker, but the percentage increases
to nearly 50 percent for children in single-mother households.
</UL>

<P>

<UL>
<LI><B>Have a regular bedtime</B> -- While 8.3 percent of adopted
children have a late or irregular bedtime, fully 22 percent of
their fatherless counterparts have a late or irregular bedtime.
</UL>


<P>
These data show that children from adoptive two-parent homes are
at significantly lower health risk than children in fatherless
homes.  Such practical measurements add a unique contribution
to the overwhelming empirical evidence which demonstrates that
children living with two continuously married parents, whether
biological or adoptive, are healthier than children in single-parent
or stepparent households.  In light of the current national debates
over welfare reform and the adoption tax credit, the NHIS findings
take on even more significance.

<P>
<CENTER><H3>WELFARE REFORM AND ILLEGITIMACY</H3></CENTER>
<P>
At a time when some are attempting to shift the emphasis of welfare
reform away from discouraging illegitimacy these new data show
just cause to squarely focus attention on combating illegitimacy.

<P>
The evidence regarding illegitimacy is clear:  there is nothing
&quot;healthy&quot; about the decay of families.  Children of
never-married mothers are at elevated risk in the long term: 
they are more likely to use drugs, to be promiscuous, and to engage
in violent crime, among other high-risk activities.  But even
in the immediate, concrete terms of everyday life, measured by
seatbelt use or living in a smoke-free home, illegitimacy places
children at increased risk.  These findings are reason enough
for the welfare system to halt the subsidizing of illegitimacy
by increasing benefits to mothers who bear additional illegitimate
children while on welfare.
<P>
<CENTER><H3>THE ADOPTION TAX CREDIT</H3></CENTER>
<P>
As an alternative to illegitimacy, adoption ranks as one of the
best options.  In fact, when presented with four options as the
best means to resolve out-of-wedlock pregnancies among teenagers,
Americans ranked adoption as the best alternative (33 percent),
followed by keeping the child and marrying the child's father
(25 percent), keeping the child and raising it by herself (13
percent), and having an abortion (10 percent), according to a
recent Family Research Council poll.
<P>
Adoption is indeed a good option, and the aforementioned NHIS
data only adds more weight to the large and growing body of evidence
which shows that <B>adoption benefits children</B>.  Adopted children
are not only very often the recipients of a loving, two-parent
home, but they also exhibit high levels of self-esteem and self-identity,
as a recent Search Institute study shows.
<P>
Thus, it is encouraging that the U.S. House of Representatives
recently passed a proposal to make adoption a more affordable
choice for prospective adoptive parents by allowing a tax credit
of up to $5,000 for qualified adoption expenses.  These expenses
could include adoption fees, court costs, attorney fees, and other
expenses which are directly related to the legal adoption of the
child.

<TITLE>RESTORE THE HYDE AMENDMENT</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>RESTORE THE HYDE AMENDMENT</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>
<P>
<CENTER><I>by
<P>Gracie S. Hsu, M.H.S.</I></CENTER>
<P>
Congress should restore the original intent of the Hyde Amendment, preserving
states' and voters' rights to set limitations on the use of taxpayer
funds to pay for certain abortions.  
<P>
<B>Background:</B>  Since 1976,
Congress has annually approved the Hyde Amendment, named for its
original sponsor, Rep. Henry Hyde (R-IL), which bans the use of
federal Medicaid funds for abortion except when the life of the
mother is endangered.  In 1993, Hyde's exception clause was expanded
to include cases of rape and incest.  The expansion was reluctantly
agreed upon by  many pro-lifers so that President Clinton's attempt
to repeal the Hyde Amendment altogether could be successfully
halted.  Also, House floor debate made it clear that these &quot;rape
and incest&quot; exceptions were only intended to be options for
states because many states' laws prohibit the taxpayer funding
of abortion.
<P>
However, in December 1993, the Clinton administration
issued a series of directives which &quot;interpreted&quot; the
revised Hyde Amendment as a mandate that states <B>must</B> provide and
co-fund Medicaid abortions in the cases of rape and incest.  Under
Clinton's  directive, the abortionist may simply make the unverifiable
assertion that a woman is the victim of rape or incest but is
unable, for physical or <I>psychological</I> reasons, to comply with
a reporting or documentation requirement.  Any state which refused
to comply, the directives said, would risk losing <B>all</B> federal
Medicaid funding.  At the time the directives were issued, 32
states had laws or regulations prohibiting public funding for
abortion except in cases where the life of the mother is endangered.
 Many of these states' laws were passed by public referendum (rather
than by state legislatures).  And yet, since that time, many states
have been forced to repeal or change their laws -- either through
legislative action or court order.
<P>
In fact, Arkansas' and Colorado's
constitutional amendments prohibiting state funding of abortion
except when the life of the mother is endangered -- an amendment
supported by then-Governor Clinton -- were struck down <B><I>in their
entirety</I></B> by a federal court, opening the door to state funding
of abortion on demand. 
<P>
<B>Bills and Sponsors:</B>  Several members of
Congress have sought to restore the pre-Clinton intent of the
Hyde Amendment to respect states' (and voters') rights.  Spearheaded
by Rep. Ernest Istook (R-Okla.) and Sen. James Exon (D-Neb.),
the Exon-Istook Amendment would preserve the rights of states
to opt for or against state taxpayer provision and funding of
abortion in cases of rape and incest, thereby rescinding the Clinton
administration's mandate to the states.
<P>
The first
attempt to include the Exon-Istook Amendment in the "Rescissions
Bill" earlier this year failed due to pro-abortion Republicans
threatening to vote against the important rescissions package
unless the Exon-Istook Amendment was dropped.  However, the Exon-Istook
Amendment will be re-introduced in Congress this summer as an
attachment to and clarification of the Hyde Amendment.  The Hyde
Amendment has been annually offered by Rep. Henry Hyde (R-Ill.)
as an amendment to the Labor/HHS Appropriations bill which comes
before Congress for a vote every summer.
<P>
<B>Prospects:</B>  The prospects
are hopeful that the Exon-Istook Amendment will be passed by both
Congressional houses if it is included with the Hyde Amendment
in the Labor/HHS Appropriations bill this summer.  But expect
the same pro-abortion Republicans as well as the heavy rhetoric
of the Clinton administration to try to thwart the passage of
the Exon-Istook Amendment.

<TITLE>STOP TAXPAYER FUNDING OF ABORTION</TITLE>

<P>
<H2>STOP TAXPAYER FUNDING OF
<BR>ABORTION THROUGH THE
<BR>FEDERAL EMPLOYEE 
<BR>HEALTH BENEFITS PROGRAM</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>

</CENTER>
<P>
Currently, federal taxpayer
dollars are being used to fund abortions for federal employees
through the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHBP).
 Congress should seek to end such funding by amending the Treasury/Postal
Service Appropriations Act.
<P>
<B>Background:</B>  The Federal Employee Health
Benefits Program covers about 9 million federal government employees
(including dependents and retirees).  It provides enrollees with
a broad selection of private health insurance plans, offering
a rich menu of between 18 and 35 individual benefit packages.
 Monies for the FEHBP are allocated through the Treasury and Postal
Service Appropriations Act, and the Office of Personnel Management
(OPM) administers the program as the sole negotiator of health
benefits for federal employees.
<P>
Federal taxpayer dollars fund the
greater portion of employee health benefits.  The government contributes
about 60 percent of the funds needed to purchase each employee's
health insurance.  In some plans, the federal contribution is
much higher (e.g., the government's share of the premium for Kaiser
HMO is 75 percent).
<P>
In 1980, before the Smith-Ashbrook Amendment
was instituted, the Office of Personnel Management reported that
an estimated $9 million in taxpayers' money was spent to pay for
17,000 abortions.
<P>
<B>Bills and Sponsors:</B>  In 1983, the Smith/Ashbrook
Amendment was passed in the Treasury/Postal Service Appropriations
bill, prohibiting the use of federal funds to pay for abortions
for federal employees enrolled in the FEHBP.
<P>
The Smith/Ashbrook
Amendment reads as follows: 
<UL>Sec. A:  &quot;No funds appropriated
by this Act shall be available to pay for an abortion, or the
administrative expenses in connection with any health plan under the federal employees health
benefit program
which provides any benefits or coverage for abortions.&quot; </UL>
<UL>Sec.
B:  &quot;The provision of section A shall not apply where the
life of the mother would be endangered if the fetus were carried
to term.&quot; </UL>
<P>
However, in 1993, through the urging of the Clinton
Administration, pro-abortion members in Congress proposed and
passed a bill which did not include the longtime restriction on
abortion coverage in federal employee health plans (207-206 in
the House, 73-27 in the Senate).  And on October 28, 1993, President
Clinton signed H.R. 2403 into law (P.L. 103-123), folding abortion
coverage into the Federal Employee Health Benefits Program (FEHBP).
<P>
<B>Prospects:</B>
 The FEHBP bill was able to pass in 1993 because it was introduced
in Congress almost simultaneously with the Clinton Administration's
proposal to repeal the Hyde Amendment.  As a result, most pro-lifers
concentrated their efforts to preserve Hyde.  The sole attempt
to counter FEHBP's expansion sought to permit abortion coverage
only through a separate rider to federal employee health benefit
plans.  This attempt, spearheaded by Sen. Don Nickles (R-Okla.),
was defeated by only three votes (48-51).
<P>
The makeup of Congress
today, however, is quite different from what it was in 1993. 
The current pro-life majorities in both Houses of Congress make
it possible to introduce and pass a Smith/Ashbrook-type of amendment
this summer when the Treasury/Postal Appropriations bill comes
up for a vote.

<TITLE>LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION'S WAR ON THE FAMILY</TITLE>
<BODY>
<CENTER><IMG SRC="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<P>
<H2>LEGAL SERVICES CORPORATION'S
<BR>WAR ON THE FAMILY</H2>
</CENTER>
<HR SIZE = 3 WIDTH = 50%>

</CENTER>
<P>
The Legal Service Corporation (LSC) is an independent, nonprofit
corporation funded by the federal government to the tune of $415
million a year.  LSC's purported purpose is to provide poor people
access to expensive legal services.  But, actually, LSC has become
a deep well for anti-family litigation.  By using carefully-selected
&quot;test cases&quot; in carefully selected courts, liberal activists
have used the LSC to litigate their agenda, sidestepping democracy
and the legislative process.
<P>
Since 1974, LSC has spent $5 billion working against the interests
of the family on many fronts.  Following are some examples:
<P>
<CENTER><H3>PROMOTING ABORTION AND DIVORCE</H3></CENTER>
<P>
The Legal Services Act, as amended in 1977 and in subsequent appropriations
acts, prohibited LSC from being involved in abortion related cases.
 Nonetheless, LSC has remained firmly committed to abortion on
demand and has worked around the law in an attempt to secure unlimited,
taxpayer-funded abortions.  In several cases throughout the country,
LSC has worked against waiting periods, parental consent, parental
notification and spousal notification.
<P>
In <I>Planned Parenthood Association, Inc. v. Department of Human
Resources, </I>Oregon Legal Services represented Planned Parenthood
in a challenge to a limitation on the number of elective abortions
that the state's medical assistance program would fund.  LSC argued
that poor women should have access to an unlimited number of taxpayer-funded
abortions.[1]  LSC took a similar line in a Pennsylvania case, arguing
that such limitations were an unconstitutional infringement of
a woman's right to have an unlimited number of abortions.[2]   In
another Pennsylvania case, LSC filed a class action suit to discard
parental consent for minors and spousal consent.[3]
<P>
In testimony on the reauthorization of LSC, Linda Jones of Concerned
Women for America of California testified that LSC has been involved
in most major abortion cases.  According to Jones, &quot;The list
reads like a virtual hall of fame for abortion rights litigation.&quot; [4]
<P>
LSC seems to be more interested in facilitating divorce in troubled
families than in helping to repair them.  An example of LSC's
lack of commitment to keeping families intact is their view on
mediation. The National Center on Women and Family Law, an LSC-funded
center, argues that mediation, one important means of resolving
domestic disputes, should be avoided because the woman is always
at a disadvantage.[5]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>EXPANDING WELFARE, SUBSIDIZING DESTRUCTIVE
BEHAVIOR</H3></CENTER>
<P>
LSC has also been active in blocking attempts to reform welfare
and in increasing the number of people dependent on public assistance
programs.  In the case of <I>C.K. v. Shalala,</I>[6] LSC joined the
ACLU and the National Organization of Women's Legal Defense Fund
in a class action suit to block New Jersey's law capping welfare
payments to mothers who have additional children while on welfare.
 LSC argued that such a law was an unconstitutional violation
of a woman's right to procreate at will.  LSC has filed similar
suits against California, Massachusetts, Maryland, Rhode Island,
Tennessee, Iowa, Kansas and Maine.
<P>
Lawsuits filed by LSC have also helped to subsidize the destructive
habits of alcoholics and drug addicts.  In recent years, LSC has
helped some 250,000 substance addicts obtain monthly disability
checks.[7]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>AIDING THE HOMOSEXUAL AGENDA</H3></CENTER>
<P>
In the case of <I>Rush v. Parham,</I>[8] the Atlanta Legal Aid Society,
an LSC grantee, tried to force the state of Georgia to pay for
a sex change operation.  The suit challenged the Georgia Department
of Health's prohibition on Medicaid reimbursement for such operations.
 
<P>
The Legal Aid Society of Kentucky, another LSC grantee, represented
a lesbian mother who contested the custody of a two-and-a-half-year-old
child to the father, who had remarried.  In the case of <I>S.
v S.,</I>[9]  LSC lawyers challenged the customary preference for
the traditional family as the best environment in which to raise
children.
<P>
In a  1986 New York Case involving a lease agreement,[10] LSC claimed
that a &quot;gay life partner&quot; should be treated as a family
member.  Arguing that equal protection required that the gay partner
be treated as a family member, attorneys from the Legal Aid Society
successfully argued the case in the New York Supreme Court, calling
into question laws that favor and protect the traditional family.
  
<P>
<CENTER><H3>PUSHING THE CHILDREN'S RIGHTS AGENDA</H3></CENTER>
<P>
&quot;Children's rights,&quot; is another area where LSC lawyers
have pursued an anti-family agenda.  The notion that children
have rights independent of their parents is a concept that undermines
parental authority and opens the door to state interference in
the raising of children.  In the case of <I>Nafzinger v. Blum</I>,[11]
LSC lawyers successfully argued that minors who no longer wanted
to live at home should get their own welfare benefits.  The Legal
Aid Society of Central Texas, an LSC grant recipient, filed a
suit to force public housing officials to rent apartments to minors.[12]
 In 1992, Legal Services of Greater Miami argued that children
should have standing to sue their parents.[13] 
<P>
<CENTER><H3>GOING SOFT ON CRIME AND AIDING CRIMINALS</H3></CENTER>
<P>
Criminals often find a friend in LSC.  In a bizarre and disturbing
case from Pennsylvania,  Lehigh Valley Legal Services represented
a convicted rapist in prison who was suing for custody of the
child he fathered by the rape of a 13 year old girl.  A psychologist
found the rapist unfit to be a parent and determined that any
child in his custody would be endangered.  After a three-day non-jury
trial the judge ruled that the rapist had no parental rights.[14]
 In cases like <I>Duran v. Elrod,</I>[15] LSC grantees have worked
hard to make sure that prisons look more like country clubs than
places to protect society from dangerous people. Such lawsuits
have had the additional consequence of increasing the costs of
incarcerating criminals, and putting many of them back on the
street, often in neighborhoods where the poor become their main
targets.[16]  LSC lawsuits have also made it difficult to evict drug
dealers from public housing units and to keep them out in the
first place.[17]
<P>
<CENTER><H3>CONCLUSION</H3></CENTER>
<P>
By advancing this radical, anti-family agenda, LSC has done far
more to hurt poor people than to help them.  The poor, as well
as the rest of the country, can't afford LSC.  In recent testimony
to a House Judiciary Sub-Committee Howard Phillips, former head
of the Office of Economic Opportunity,  said that the true cost
of LSC should include the impact of actual, threatened and feared
LSC-related suits as well as increased federal state and local
government spending.  According to Phillips, &quot;viewed in this
way, the LSC is properly seen as a central player in our current
national deficit and debt problem.&quot; [18] Attempts to reform LSC
have failed and the agency should be abolished.  The poor are
better served by state and local initiatives as well as private
foundations and bar associations.  These institutions have demonstrated
the ability to adequately meet the legitimate legal needs of the
poor.  Non-federal contributions to LSC-type programs amounted
to $255 million in 1994.[19]  At a time when Congress needs to carefully
assess budgetary priorities it makes no sense to continue funding
LSC.

<title>FRC RAISES STRONG OBJECTIONS TO THE U.N.CONFERENCE 
IN BEIJING</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<p>
<h2>FRC RAISES STRONG OBJECTIONS<br>
TO THE U.N.CONFERENCE IN<br>
BEIJING</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
The Family Research Council (FRC) is an organization dedicated
to preserving and strengthening the traditional family unit. 
As such, FRC is strongly opposed to major elements of the agenda
for the U.N. Fourth World Conference on Women which is to be held
in Beijing, China, from September 4-15, 1995.
<P>
FRC finds this conference objectionable not only because the conference
-- which claims to uphold women's rights -- is being hosted by
a country with a long track record of abuses against women (i.e.,
female infanticide, coerced abortion policies, involuntary sterilization,
the one-child-per-couple mandate, etc.), but also because the
platform document under consideration denigrates motherhood, undermines
the traditional family unit, and erodes the foundations of marriage
and family life while upholding abortion and the dissemination
of contraceptives to minors as positive alternatives.
<P>
Among its most egregious violations, the document:
<UL>
<LI><B>Denigrates the values of motherhood and traditional family
life.</B>  For example, the word &quot;mother&quot; has been bracketed
throughout the entire platform so that it might be changed to
the term &quot;caretaker.&quot;  Similarly, the word &quot;family&quot;
has been bracketed so that it might be changed to &quot;household.&quot;
 [Bracketed sections indicate that delegates could not agree on
the text.  These sections are to be discussed further, with each
alternative weighed equally.]  In addition, the word &quot;family&quot;
almost always appears in a negative context, i.e., in relation
to domestic violence or as a vehicle for female oppression.
</UL>
<p>
<UL>
<LI><B>Devalues the husband-wife relationship to a mere power
play. </B>  Consider paragraph 198 of the platform: &quot;Inequality
in the public arena can often start within the family when <I>power
relations</I> between men and women are unbalanced with discriminatory
attitudes and practices within the family.  The unequal division
of labour and responsibilities within households based on<I> unequal
power relations</I> also limits women's potential...for participation
in decision-making in wider public forums&quot; (emphasis added).
 Thus, rather than acknowledging marriage as a cooperative partnership,
the platform pits one mate against the other.  Notably, the words
&quot;wife&quot; and &quot;husband&quot; are nowhere to be found
in the document even though the populace of every country participating
in the conference honors the marital relationship.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Fails to uphold traditional morality by leaving the term
&quot;gender&quot; open for interpretation.</B>
While &quot;gender&quot; appears more than 200 times in the platform 
document, the U.N. fails to define the term.  During a preparatory
committee meeting for the conference, one of the delegates asked
that the term &quot;gender&quot; be defined as the traditional
biological classifications of &quot;male&quot; and &quot;female.&quot;
 Others, however, sought to define &quot;gender&quot; as &quot;the
socially-constructed roles which society assigns to men and women.&quot;
 This latter definition has been used in feminist literature to
mean that gender is subject to change and that there exists a
spectrum of genders, perhaps even five (e.g., male heterosexual,
female heterosexual, homosexual, bisexual, and transsexual). 
The U.N. rejected both definitions and decided that &quot;gender&quot;
was to be understood &quot;in its commonly accepted meaning.&quot;
  One can only hope the commonly accepted meaning of gender in
the United States remains that which acknowledges the biological
classifications of male and female.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Undermines parental authority in reproductive health decisions.</B>
 In various areas relating to sexuality, reproduction, and AIDS,
the document repeatedly states that governments should &quot;emphasize
the role and responsibility of adolescents in sexual and reproductive
behavior through the provision of appropriate services and counseling,
recognizing their rights to privacy, confidentiality, and informed
consent.&quot;  Only rarely does the document make mention of
the &quot;rights, duties, and responsibilities of parents,&quot;
but it seems to do so as a concession because parents are still
legally responsible for their children.  The document, however,
refuses to recognize parental <I>authority</I> in regards to their
children's reproductive health.
</UL>
<P>
<UL>
<LI><B>Promotes abortion and contraception as reproductive &quot;rights.&quot;</B>
 The efforts of the previous U.N. conferences in Cairo and Copenhagen
to promote abortion and unrestricted contraceptive availability
are well-known.  The Beijing document follows in this tradition.
 While the platform fails to recognize the role of men as husbands
and fathers, it does express the notion that women should be completely
autonomous in their reproductive decision-making.  Indeed, the
platform urges governments to &quot;take action to ensure that
women's sexual and reproductive rights are fully recognized and
respected&quot; (paragraph 232).  Furthermore, the platform seems
to elevate reproductive &quot;rights&quot; above all other rights,
stating that &quot;the ability of women to control their own fertility
forms an important basis for their enjoyment of other rights&quot;
(paragraph 98).

<title>CAPRICORN RECORDS GOES TO POT</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<p>
<h2>CAPRICORN RECORDS<br>
GOES TO POT</h2>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
<i>by</i>
<p>
<i>David J. Chamberlin and Robert L. Maginnis</i></center>
<p>
Unfazed by the hit that Time Warner has received in the last two
months for peddling sex, drugs, and violence, Capricorn Records
will soon release <I>Hempilation</I>, a benefit album with a portion
of the proceeds going to the National Organization for the Reform
of Marijuana Laws (NORML).
<P>
It is not surprising that pro-drug musicians support NORML  --
 at least 45 bands have declared their support for legalizing
marijuana.[1]  It is surprising however, that Capricorn Records'
president Phil Walden didn't learn from Time Warner's recent public
flogging over the promoting of music that glorifies drug use,
puts down women, promotes Satanism, or encourages violence.
<P>
Health and Human Services Secretary Donna Shalala recently emphasized
the dangers of marijuana, saying,  &quot;Young people must understand
that there is clear scientific evidence that marijuana is a dangerous
drug that can have acute and hazardous effects. . .Drug use --
 including marijuana. . .is unwise, unhealthful, illegal and wrong.&quot;[2]
<P>
The short-term effects of marijuana include impairment in learning
and memory, perception, judgment and complex motor skills.  Marijuana
can cause difficulty in speaking, listening effectively, thinking,
retaining knowledge, problem solving, and forming concepts.[3]
<P>
More than 10,500 published scientific papers show that marijuana
damages brain cells and the lungs, may adversely affect reproduction
in women and fertility in men, endangers the unborn baby and newborns
of pot-smoking women, and could damage the heart.[4]
<P>
The effects of unabated illicit drug use go beyond those already
outlined.  For example, illicit drug use correlates with crime.
 The Bureau of Justice Statistics found that 32 percent of inmates
have used cocaine and that half had used drugs in the month before
their offense.  Seventy-five percent reported having used marijuana
in the past.[5]
<P>
Drugs numb the conscience and lower inhibitions.  They contribute
to mood disorders, depression, and low self esteem.  A high proportion
of cocaine users admit the drug makes them feel violent at times.
<P>
Consider some recent examples of youth violence that involved
drug abuse.  
<UL>
<LI>Five Dodge City, Kansas teenagers, high on marijuana, killed
a stranger for no obvious reason.[6]
<P>
<LI>Three West Palm Beach, Florida teenagers mixed beer, rum,
marijuana and cocaine and then kidnapped and set ablaze a tourist
from Brooklyn.[7]
<P>
<LI>A New Scandia Township, Minnesota teen shot his mother and
stepfather to death.  He admitted to almost daily abuse of marijuana.[8]
<P>
<LI>Two Miami, Florida teenagers were smoking marijuana when one
accidentally shot and killed the other.[9]</UL>
<P>
Not all users become violent, but social scientists confirm the
relationship between drug use and juvenile delinquency.  A 1990
study published in the <I>Journal of Drug Issues</I> found the
strongest association between the severity of the crime and the
type of substance abused  --  the more intoxicating the substance,
the more serious the incident.[10]
<P>
A study in <I>Today's Delinquent</I> found alcohol and marijuana
users commit twice the number of delinquent acts as non-users,
and a study in <I>Adolescence</I> found that half of all polydrug
users had engaged in delinquent acts.[11]
<P>
Fortunately, Walden still has time before <I>Hempilation's</I>
Sept. 26 release to reverse his blatant pro-drug decision.  Capricorn
ought to follow Simon &amp; Schuster's example of five years ago,
when it canceled plans to publish <I>American Psycho</I>, a novel
by Bret Easton Ellis, after advance complaints about objectionable
passages detailing the sexual torture and mutilation of women.[12]
<P>
It's time that record companies meet their responsibility to distribute
music that doesn't glorify drug use.  It's time Capricorn Records
heeded the timely warning that Time Warner received from angry
parents.

<title>CAREERS: A MISSED OPPORTUNITY</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<p>
<h2>CAREERS:<br>
A MISSED OPPORTUNITY</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
On Sept. 19, 1995, the U.S. House of Representatives voted in
favor of the CAREERS Act (H.R. 2332), a bill which would consolidate
about 100 job training programs into three.  They call it a victory
because they've streamlined programs and saved money.  We call
it a failure to uproot key elements of the Goals 2000 agenda.
<p>
While sponsors of the bill accepted some of the changes suggested
by pro-family groups, they were unwilling to strike references
to the National Skill Standards Board (NSSB) and a requirement
that state skill standards be referenced to the national skill
standards to be developed by that board.  NSSB was a creation
of the National Skill Standards Act of 1994, a part of the same
public law as Goals 2000 (Pub. Law 103-227), and in keeping with
its philosophy.  NSSB would fund, oversee, and endorse the creation
of a national system of skill standards, certificates, and assessments;
it is to occupational skills what the National Education Goals
Panel is to academics.  Yet some conservative members of Congress
failed to see the flaws in such a system.
<p>
One small victory was the addition of language to prohibit any
requirement that a student meet federally funded or endorsed skill
standards or obtain a federally funded or endorsed skill certificate.
 Because this provision has the potential to undermine significantly
the influence of the National Skill Standards Board, this provision
could be a prime target as the bill goes to conference.
<p>
CAREERS will now go to a House-Senate Conference Committee to
work out differences between versions passed in the two houses.
 Unfortunately,  Sen. Nancy Kassebaum's (R-Kan.) job training
bill (S. 143) embraces the philosophy advanced in the liberal
School-to-Work Act of 1994 even more than CAREERS does.  This
may threaten even the minor improvements gained in the House bill.
<p>
The 104th Congress has unfinished business in education.   No
adequate proposal to repeal Goals 2000 has yet been advanced.
 Rep. Duke Cunningham (R-Calif.) claims his &quot;Education Reform
Consolidation Grant&quot;  would repeal Goals 2000,  but it does
so only in name.   Its core elements remain intact:  the National
Education Goals Panel, the National Education Goals, and bullying
the states on how to reform.  Does it make sense for a &quot;reformist&quot;
Congress to pass on the meddlesome, bureaucratic, centralizing
legacy of Goals 2000 and School-to-Work, rather than put an end
to it?

<title>BIRTHS TO UNMARRIED WOMEN: HOW THE STATES ARE MEASURING UP</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<p>
<h2>BIRTHS TO<br>
UNMARRIED WOMEN:<br>
HOW THE STATES ARE<br>
MEASURING UP</h2></center>
<p>
Thirty-one percent of all births in the United States are to unmarried
women, according to a September 1995 report issued by the National
Center for Health Statistics.  Only 10 states have an illegitimacy
ratio below 25 percent.
<p>
Of the 50 states and the District of Columbia, 10 states have
illegitimacy ratios at or above 35 percent.  All of these states,
with the exception of New York, are along the southern rim of
the 48 contiguous states.  Indeed, among the southern rim states,
only Alabama and Texas have illegitimacy ratios lower than 35
percent.
<p>
The state with the lowest percentage of births to unmarried women
is Utah, with 15.5 percent.  Like Utah, most other states with
low illegitimacy ratios are sparsely-populated states west of
the Mississippi River.  East of the Mississippi, only Vermont
and New Hampshire show a rate of less than 25 percent of births
to unmarried women.
<p>
There is a strong relationship between the percentage of births
to unmarried women and race.  Nationally, 68.7 percent of all
black births are out of wedlock, while 23.6 percent of white births
are to unmarried women.  Thus, states with high percentages of
births out of wedlock also tend to have relatively high percentages
of unmarried black women.
<p>
Between the years of 1991-1993, the proportion of all births to
unmarried women rose 3 percentage points.  During this same time
period, non-marital childbearing rose for white women, declined
slightly for black women, and remained essentially unchanged for
Hispanic women. Individual state percentages declined in only two states 
from 1992 to 1993:  Michigan by 0.8 percent and Texas by 0.5 percent.
<p>
Of the nation's 20 most populous states, only Minnesota (with
a ratio of 23.4 percent) and Texas (with a ratio of 17.0 percent)
rank among the few Top Ten states with the lowest percentage of
births to unmarried women.

<title>REINSTATE THE FAMILY CAP</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<p>
<h2>REINSTATE THE FAMILY CAP</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
<ul>
<li><b>Definition:  Denial of AFDC cash benefits to women who
have additional children while on welfare.  The family cap passed
by the House includes a state option to provide vouchers for goods
and services in lieu of cash benefits.</b>
<p>
<li>The family cap represents a minimum standard of acceptability
for new welfare legislation.  Because being born out-of-wedlock
increases the likelihood that an individual will live in poverty,
depend on welfare -- and parent another child out-of-wedlock --
we cannot begin to address welfare dependency until we address
illegitimacy.
<p>
<li>The problem is NOT that too many women are on welfare.  The
problem is that too many single women are bearing children they
are neither financially nor emotionally prepared to support --
and welfare has almost certainly played a role in increasing that
trend.
<p>
<li>The family cap simply asks women on welfare to meet the same
social expectations and live by the same rules that the rest of
us do.  By insisting that women on welfare are every bit as capable
of personal responsibility and rational decision-making, the family
cap accords much more dignity to welfare mothers than the current
system.
<p>
<li>The family cap is a question of simple justice.  The working
poor certainly don't receive an increase in their salary when
they add children to their families.  And is it really fair to
children to encourage a generation of irresponsible parents by
dispensing checks willy-nilly?
<p>
<li>The family cap is a responsibility issue -- not a constriction
of reproductive freedom.  It is the current welfare system that
is manipulating fertility rates.  The fact that we are now confusing
an end to social engineering with social engineering itself is
simply evidence of how far wrong we've gone in the past 30 years.
<p>
<li>The argument is NOT that women have additional children in
order to get the additional dollars.  The existence of the welfare
system shields women from the natural economic consequences of
irresponsible decisions -- and thereby encourages a lack of parental
responsibility, which in turn harms marriage and hurts children.
<p>
<li>The preliminary results from New Jersey (the first state to
implement a family cap) are a powerful demonstration that the
family cap is an effective and necessary reform.  In an initial
experiment, the birth rate dropped for women in <I>both</I> the
treatment and control groups.  Meanwhile, there has been no real
increase in abortions -- the slight rise in the raw numbers is
well within the expected range of random fluctuation.  And in
fact, the pre-cap monthly average abortion rate is slightly <I>higher
</I>than the post-cap monthly average abortion rate.
<p>
<li>The fact that the birth rate dropped in both the treatment
and control groups suggests that the cap has sent a powerful symbolic
message about personal responsibility that has reinforced the
impact of erasing the economic incentive.  The evidence suggests,
then, that we must work to reform the culture at the same time
that we are reversing the perverse economic incentives of the
welfare system.  The goal, in other words, is to instill moral
knowledge while eliminating the tension between morality and the
incentives of the current welfare system.
<p>
<li>We hope to instill morality by rebuilding strong families
and by shifting functions from the state and federal governments
to character-forming institutions in the local community -- families,
schools, churches, and voluntary organizations.  Rebuilding strong
families will require a concerted effort to reduce illegitimacy,
and rebuilding the moral-cultural sphere will require scaling
back government benefits so that local communities are once again
free and able to care for their own.

<title>SEX EDUCATION: WHAT WORKS?</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<p>
<h2>SEX EDUCATION: WHAT WORKS?</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
The institutionalization of &quot;family life&quot; or sex education
classes in public and private schools around the country has created
a demand for curricula on the subject.  Unfortunately, the broad
reach of organizations such as Planned Parenthood and SIECUS has
left many school boards and parents thinking that there is no
alternative except to teach &quot;safe sex.&quot;  But there <I>is</I>
an alternative that has shown to be even more effective than &quot;safe
sex&quot; in reducing teen pregnancy and sexually-transmitted
diseases -- abstinence.  This paper is designed to help concerned
school board members and parents choose a solid abstinence curriculum.
<p>
<center><h3>WHY ABSTINENCE EDUCATION?</h3></center>
<p>
Abstinence is the only strategy for preventing teenage pregnancy
and sexually-transmitted diseases that is 100 percent effective.
 According to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention,
it is &quot;the most effective solution&quot; to unwanted pregnancy
and sexual disease.[1]
<p>
Given the effectiveness of abstinence, a number of states -- including
Texas, California, Washington, Pennsylvania, Illinois, and Indiana -- have
passed laws in recent years stipulating that public school sex
education programs be abstinence-based.[2] Many of these programs
have produced promising results:
<p><ul>
<li>San Marcos Junior High in San Marcos, California, adopted
an abstinence-only curriculum developed by Teen-Aid, Inc., titled
<I>Sexuality, Commitment, and Family</I>.  The year before the
curriculum was implemented, 147 girls were reported pregnant.
 But two years after the program's adoption, only 20 girls became
pregnant.[3]
<p>
<li>Historically, the eighth-grade class at Nathan Hale Middle
School in the Chicago suburb of Crestwood included a number of
already pregnant girls. When the school decided to adopt an abstinence
program for the kids, many adults were skeptical.  But after three
years of quality sessions with the abstinence program <I>Project
Taking Charge</I>, the school graduated three pregnancy-free classes
in a row.[4]
<p>
<li>In the Washington, D.C. chapter of &quot;Best Friends,&quot;
only one out of 400 girls has become pregnant since the program
began.  Elayne Bennett, director of &quot;Best Friends,&quot; says that 
between 20 and 70 pregnancies are common
for the same-sized group of fifth- to ninth-grade girls in the
District of Columbia.  One &quot;Best Friends&quot; member explains,
&quot;I want to save my virginity for the man I marry....And I
want my child to have a daddy.&quot;[5]
<p>
<li>An evaluation of the abstinence-based program <I>Sex Respect:
 The Option of True Sexual Freedom</I> found that students participating
in the program had considerably lower pregnancy rates than those
in a comparison group.  Only 5 percent of the female program participants
and 9 percent of the non-program students became pregnant in the
two years following the program.[6]
<p>
<li>Emory University's abstinence-only curriculum, <I>Postponing
Sexual Involvement</I>, teaches kids about abstinence through
skill-building exercises on &quot;how to say no.&quot;  An evaluation
of the program showed that its participants were less likely to
become sexually active than those not involved in the program.[7]
<p>
<li><I>AANCHOR</I>, an alternative national curriculum on responsibility,
stresses the importance of family involvement and individual responsibility
to prevent adolescent pregnancy.  An evaluation of the curriculum
found three statistically significant differences between students
receiving the AANCHOR curriculum and students receiving the standard
school curriculum. The students participating in AANCHOR were
significantly more likely to report (1) higher family strengths,
i.e., loyalty, emotional support, cohesion, (2) greater discussions
with parents about sexual values and beliefs, and (3) more abstinent
attitudes regarding premarital sexual involvement.[8]
<p>
<li>Students who participated in the abstinence-based <I>FACTS</I>
curriculum showed significant pre-post effects occurring on the
measures of (1) affirmation of abstinence, (2) rejection of permissiveness,
and (3) future orientation and peer support for abstinence.  These
attitudinal data are important indicators of delaying sexual activity.[9]
</ul><p>
<center><h3>HOW TO CHOOSE A GOOD ABSTINENCE CURRICULUM</h3></center>
<p>
In order to choose an appropriate abstinence curriculum, parents
and school board members should study curricula for their focus,
methodologies, and content.
<p>
<b>Focus of Curricula:</b> The growing interest in abstinence
curriculum has caused many contraception programs to frame themselves
as &quot;abstinence-based,&quot; &quot;abstinence-plus&quot; or
&quot;comprehensive&quot; because they mention abstinence as one
of several options.  Such programs, however, communicate a mixed
message to students which thereby tremendously weakens the abstinence
message.  Some common characteristics of these &quot;comprehensive&quot;
or &quot;abstinence-plus&quot; programs are that they (1) assume
that teenagers are inevitably sexually active, (2) emphasize contraception
and abortion, and (3) include affective decision-making (presenting
abstinence as one of many options from which to choose).  Thus,
parents and school boards should choose a curriculum that avoids
these danger points, and instead upholds abstinence as the way
to handle teen sex issues.
<p>
<b>Methodology of Curricula:</b> The method used to deliver sex
education material heavily influences the way students will respond
to the abstinence message.  Effective abstinence programs are
directive in their approach.  Dr. Onalee McGraw provides a comparative
analysis of competing delivery models of sex education in her
book <i>Foundations for Family Life Education</i>:[10]

</pre>
<p><hr><p>
Directive abstinence education emphasizes the importance of values
and attitudes, which is consistent with a U.S. Department of Education
study, &quot;The Role of Responsibility and Knowledge in Reducing
Teenage Out-of-Wedlock Childbearing,&quot; which found that &quot;adolescents
with strong feelings of control over their lives, with higher
educational expectations, and with parents who show concern and
have higher educational expectations for their daughters have
lower chances of experiencing teenage childbirth.&quot;[11]
<p>
Furthermore, students want help in saying &quot;no&quot; to sexual
activity.  When Emory University surveyed 1,000 sexually active
girls and asked them what they would most like to learn to reduce
teen pregnancy, 84 percent responded, &quot;How to say no without
hurting the other person's feelings.&quot;[12]  Moreover, a recent
study done by Roper Starch in association with the Sex Information
and Education Council of the United States (SIECUS) found that,
of the teens who have had sex, 54 percent wish they would have
waited until they were older.[13]
<p>
<b>Content of Curricula:</b> Sex education curricula vary greatly
by content, and parents should be particularly concerned if the
curriculum contains information or pictures too explicit for the
intended audience.  Caution is recommended even in cases in which
a particular sex education curriculum is widely used or endorsed
by prominent organizations.  For example:
<ul><p>
<li>The two-million member National Education Association (NEA)
endorses sex education programs that promote birth control and
homosexuality.[14]
<p>
<li>The influential Sex Information and Education Council of the
United States (SIECUS) has published a widely used set of goals
for sex education curricula entitled, &quot;<U>Guidelines for
Comprehensive Sexuality Education:  Kindergarten - 12th Grade</U>&quot;.
 The report promotes abortion, unmarried couples living together,
and homosexual relationships as equal to heterosexual relationships.[15]

<title>COMPUTER PORNOGRAPHY QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<p>
<h2>COMPUTER PORNOGRAPHY<br>
QUESTIONS AND ANSWERS</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
<center><h4>WHAT TYPES OF PORNOGRAPHY ARE FREELY AVAILABLE TO ANYONE ON
THE INTERNET?</h4></center>
<p>
The entire spectrum of pornographic material is available on computer
networks including images of soft-core nudity, hard-core sex acts,
anal sex, bestiality, bondage &amp; dominion, sado-masochism (including
actual torture and mutilation, usually of women, for sexual pleasure),
scatological acts (defecating and urinating, usually on women,
for sexual pleasure), fetishes, and child pornography.  Additionally,
there is textual pornography including detailed text stories of
the rape, mutilation, and torture of women, sexual abuse of children,
graphic incest, etc.
<p>
<center><h4>WHO CAN ACCESS PORNOGRAPHY ON THE INTERNET?</h4></center>
<p>
Virtually anyone with an account or access to the Internet can
access pornography.  Once &quot;on-line&quot; there are no truly
effective safety measures to prevent children from accessing all
of the pornography described above.  This unlimited access to
pornography, with no accurate, enforceable age check and no verification
procedures, has never occurred in the print, broadcast, satellite
or cable media before.  Cyberspace is currently the free speech
absolutist's dream world.
<p>
<center><h4>WHERE DO CHILDREN AND ADULTS FIND PORNOGRAPHIC MATERIAL ON
THE INTERNET?</h4></center>
<p>
Pornography is publicly available through the Internet by accessing
sections in the hierarchies of the Usenet and at a number of sites
on the World-Wide-Web.  It is also traded daily via Internet e-mail
and sites set up for the exchange of pornography.
<p>
<center><h4>ARE THESE SITES POPULAR OR IS THIS REALLY A SMALL PROBLEM?</h4>
</center>
<p>
Although surveys done by on-line administrators indicate that
pornographic sites are among the most often used on the Internet,
the relative percentage of pornographic sites is not certain.
 Regardless of the actual number of sites, which is on the rise, the 
problem of pornography continues to be a very serious one.  Like drugs, 
pornography's destructive effects are felt far beyond the &quot;pusher&quot;
and &quot;user.&quot;
<p>
<center><h4>DON'T WE NEED FURTHER STUDY BEFORE WE TAKE ACTION ON AN ISSUE 
THAT AFFECTS THE FUTURE OF CYBERSPACE?</h4></center>
<p>
Proposals to &quot;study&quot; the issue of computer pornography
are attempts by the ACLU and other ideological groups to delay legislative 
action on this problem.  They fight virtually any legislative restriction on
materials distributed on-line,  and want to dump all responsibility
for action into the laps of parents, many of whom are far less
technologically capable than their children.
<p>
<center><h4>ISN'T THE ON-LINE COMMUNITY AGAINST PROPOSALS FOR &QUOT;DECENCY&QUOT;
ON THE INTERNET?</h4></center>
<p>
Some of the on-line community and many of the media are opposed
to any proposals to regulate the Internet or children's access
to pornography.  However, out of an estimated 20 million predominately
male users of various on-line networks, fewer than 2 percent have
opposed the proposals.
<p>
<center><h4>WHAT IS THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN OBSCENITY AND INDECENCY?</h4>
</center>
<p>
<I>Obscenity</I> is hard-core sexual material so graphic and unredeeming
that it meets the Supreme Court's three-part test: (1) it appeals
to an abnormal or excessive interest in sex; (2) it depicts or
describes sexually explicit conduct in a patently offensive way;
and (3) it lacks serious literary artistic, political, or scientific
value. <i>Miller v. California</i> (1973). <I>Indecency</I> is
a pattern of patently offensive depictions or descriptions of
sexual or excretory activities or organs.  <i>Pacifica v. F.C.C.</i>
(1978).  This material is legal for consenting adults, but can
be regulated so that it is kept from children.
<p>
<center><h4>WON'T THE BANNING OF &QUOT;INDECENT&QUOT; MATERIALS JEOPARDIZE
SERIOUS WORKS OF LITERATURE OR LIBRARY ART?</h4></center>
<p>
No.  This argument is no more credible now than it was when used
against indecency laws in other contexts.  No serious literary
or artistic works would be banned by an indecency law.  Society
has long embraced the principle that those who peddle harmful
material have the obligation to keep the material from children.
 Computer indecency should be no exception.
<p>
<center><h4>AREN'T THERE &QUOT;TECHNICAL FIXES&QUOT; THAT ARE LESS INTRUSIVE
THAN A REGULATORY OR CRIMINAL LAW APPROACH?</h4></center>
<p>
No.  To date, only a few software programs have been released
to regulate children's access to pornography, such as SurfWatch
and NetNanny.  Also, these programs can be bypassed by users with
a good knowledge of the Internet and some technical sophistication.
 Even if better technical solutions become available, this approach
is inadequate in and of itself because:
<ul>
<li>children can walk down the street to another computer
<li>parents' technical ability often pales in comparison to their
children's expertise
<li>pornographers aren't legally discouraged from peddling their
materials to children
</ul>
<p>
<I>The above material includes excerpts adapted from &quot;Children,
Pornography and Cyberspace: The Problem, Solutions &amp; the Current
Congressional Debate&quot; published by the National Coalition
for the Protection of Children &amp; Families.</I>

<title>WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING ABOUT ADOPTION</title>
<body>
<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">
<p>
<h2>WHAT PEOPLE ARE SAYING<br>
ABOUT ADOPTION</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
<ul>
<li>&quot;I hope that we will reach out across the country
and create an environment in which every couple who wants to have
a child -- or several children -- and is capable emotionally and
financially to adopt, has the opportunity to adopt.  And I hope
every child who finds himself in a situation without a permanent
relationship with adults who care will have an opportunity for
a permanent legal family; and that we will work together to make
adoption as easy as possible, as practical as possible, and as
supported as possible.&quot;  -- Speaker of the House of Representatives
Newt Gingrich at the National Council for Adoption's Adoption
Hall of Fame Banquet, 1995.
<p>
<li>&quot;Even if pro-choice and pro-life advocates can never agree 
philosophically on the question of abortion, we can agree on adoption. 
I have long been a proponent of adoption and will continue to support 
it. Both pro-choice and pro-life advocates can and should come together 
to promote adoption. Too many children desperately need families and 
homes.&quot; -- Syndicated columnist Cal Thomas, 1995.
<p>
<li>&quot;I'm particularly pleased that this house will serve
as a place from which children will be adopted under the responsibility
of Catholic Charities, and I would personally plead that everyone
who knows of this house, everyone who knows of other places like
it, will do all that can be done to promote adoption of the children
here in our own country.  We have more than 400,000 children languishing
in foster care in America.&quot; -- First Lady Hillary Rodham
Clinton at Mother Teresa's Home for Infant Children in Washington,
D.C., 1995.
<p>
<li>&quot;The fact is that with adoption comes joy and challenges
and, always, blessings.  If you're thinking of starting a family,
or adding another member to your present family, please consider
adopting a child who has been waiting -- sometimes a long time
-- for someone to love them and provide a happy home.  You'll
be giving a precious gift -- the special love of a family -- to
a child who desperately needs it.&quot;  -- Dave Thomas, founder
of Wendy's Old Fashioned Hamburgers restaurants in a publication
entitled &quot;Adoption Works...For Everyone:  A Beginner's Guide
To Adoption.&quot;

<title>STATE-BY-STATE DIVORCE RATES</title>
<body>

<p>
<h2>STATE-BY-STATE<br>
DIVORCE RATES:<br>
MASSACHUSETTS LOWEST;<br>
NEVADA HIGHEST</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
Massachusetts and Connecticut rank first and second, respectively,
for having the lowest divorce rates in the nation, according to
new 1994 divorce data from the National Center for Health Statistics.
Both states experienced a moderate drop in divorce rates between
1992 and 1994 to remain at the top of the list. Massachusetts
fell from 2.8 in 1992 to 2.4 in 1994, while Connecticut fell from
3.1 to 2.8.
<p>
Nevada once again had the highest divorce rate in the country,
even though it experienced the most marked drop in divorce rates
during the two-year period. Nevada fell from 11.4 in 1992 to 9.0
in 1994.
<p>
The divorce rate per 1,000 population for the entire United States
was 4.6 in 1994, down from 4.8 in 1992. Generally, rates were
lower in the Northeast and Midwest and higher in the West and
Southeast.
<p>
Only four states (New York, South Dakota, Missouri, and Mississippi)
experienced a rise in divorce rates between 1992 and 1994. Eight
other states held the same rate during 1992 and 1994. Vermont,
with a drop in the divorce rate from 5.2 to 4.0, rose in rank
from 27th to a tie for 15th position.

<title>WHAT IS GOALS 2000?</title>

<p>
<h2>WHAT IS GOALS 2000?</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
Remove all the frills and Goals 2000 is essentially an application
process.  These are the terms:  a state agrees to report to the
federal government on its standards and assessments in exchange
for federal grant money.  Signing on the dotted line means a state
will submit its plan for improvement -- standards, assessments
and all -- for federal critique.  There are strings attached to
the Goals 2000 money, and they cannot be avoided unless a state
refuses to participate.
<p>
The only way Goals 2000 can rightly be termed &quot;voluntary&quot;
is that states currently have the option not to participate in
the program.  However, the Goals 2000 application process can
be attached to any piece of federal legislation.  As its requirements
are added to more and more legislation, there will be no way for
states to get federal money for education without submitting to
Goals 2000.
<p>
What's wrong with the terms of the Goals 2000 application agreement?
Never before have states had to submit their &quot;lesson plans&quot;
to get federal money.  American tradition and law have held that
education is a matter of state and local concern.  As the federal
government began to usurp the control of education, curriculum
was still set apart as an issue reserved for state and local decisionmakers.
The U.S. Education Department was specifically prohibited from
dealing with curricular issues when it was created in 1980.  Yet
Goals 2000 ignores the prohibition.  It calls for federal involvement
in the funding, development and approval of standards and assessments.
These are curricular issues in which the federal government should
not be involved.  Thus, the Goals 2000 application requires a
state to submit to an inappropriate role for the federal government.

<title>CAN GOALS 2000 BE FIXED?</title>

<p>
<h2>CAN GOALS 2000 BE FIXED?</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>
Goals 2000 proponents are conceding flaws in their prized program.
President Bill Clinton himself recently confided to writer Ben
Wattenberg that his education program wasn't what he had hoped
it would be.
<p>
Nevertheless, Goals 2000 spin doctors are now suggesting that,
with the right makeover, the program will emerge irresistible
even to those who previously spurned it.  So they're willing to
undergo an utterly painless procedure:  removal of two controversial
surface elements of Goals 2000 -- the National Education Standards
and Improvement Council (NESIC), and opportunity-to-learn standards.
<p>
<h4>Leaders in the U.S. Congress, governors' offices and state
legislatures should understand that lifts and tucks aren't enough.
The core elements of Goals 2000 are unacceptable:</h4>
<p><ul>
<li>National Education Goals written as federal law (Public Law
103-227); 
<li>a federally funded National Education Goals Panel;
<li>a federally funded National Education Standards and Improvement
Council (NESIC);
<li>a new formula for reform:  federally funded standards and
assessments; and
<li>a prescription that states use this formula for reform and
submit their standards and assessments to the federal government
for approval.
</ul><p>
Never before have states had to submit their &quot;lesson plans&quot;
to get federal money.  When the U.S. Education Department was
created back in 1979, it was prohibited from dealing with curricular
issues.  Standards and assessments are curricular matters, and
the federal government has no business formulating or reviewing
them.
<p>
<h4>New Twist:  A Dangerous Liaison</h4>
<p>
Some officials, however, have no problem with federal review of
state plans -- in fact, they extend the offer to local districts
as well.  They propose that the federal government disregard the
authority of states like Virginia, New Hampshire, Montana and
Alabama, which have chosen not to participate in Goals 2000, and
go straight to the local districts interested in making a few
bucks by hitching up with Goals 2000.  What better way to invite
federal intrusion into local schools than to have local districts
bypass state authority and submit their plans directly to the
federal government for approval?
<p>
Goals 2000 is built on the flawed thesis that a greater federal
role in the education system will improve schools.  It hasn't
and it won't.  The program and the systems it spawned should be
discontinued immediately.  The money freed up will be spent more
effectively on real education needs -- not systems management
-- if left in the hands of parents and teachers closest to the
student.

<title>MANY COUPLES STILL WAITING TO ADOPT CHILDREN</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">

<p>
<h2>MANY COUPLES STILL WAITING<br>
TO ADOPT CHILDREN</h2></center>
<hr size = 3 width = 50%>
<p>

The National Council for Adoption (NCFA) conservatively estimates
that there are at least one million infertile and fertile couples
who are waiting to adopt children.[1] For every one adoptable infant
available, there are at least 40 couples hoping to adopt.[2] Today,
it is not unusual to pick up a local newspaper and find an advertisement
placed by a married couple searching for a child to adopt.
<p>
What is causing this high &quot;adoption demand&quot;? While the
answer is no doubt multi-faceted and complex, the following factors
have contributed to this phenomenon:
<p><ul>
<li><b>Plummeting adoption rates among unwed mothers --</b> Despite
the four-fold increase in the number of births to unmarried women
since 1967, the number of these unwed mothers choosing to place
their children for adoption declined by one-third during that
same time period.[3] Thus, while about one in five premarital births
to white women was placed for adoption in the late 1960s, by 1988,
this proportion had shrunk to one in 30.[4]
<p>
<li><b>Abortion</b> -- Approximately 1.5 million abortions take
place in the United States every year. About one-quarter of these
abortions are to teenagers, and more than four-fifths are to unmarried
mothers.[5] Each of these aborted pregnancies represents a potential
adoption; and if adoption rather than abortion were chosen in
these instances, the high adoption demand could be greatly alleviated.
<p>
<li><b>Infertility</b> -- The demand for adoptable babies remains
high due to continued infertility. Two sources of infertility
are examined below:
<p>
<b>Sexually-Transmitted Diseases (STDs)</b> -- The Alan Guttmacher
Institute estimates that between 100,000 and 150,000 women become
infertile each year as a result of an STD that has resulted in
pelvic inflammatory disease. Thus, of the 2.3 million U.S. couples
who are infertile, 15 to 30 percent are infertile or unable to
conceive as a result of an STD.[6] Furthermore, while the rate of
infertility remained about the same from 1967 to 1982 at 2.4 million
couples (or one couple in every seven), infertility among couples
aged 20-24 increased from 4 percent in 1965 to 11 percent in 1982.[7]
It is likely that a good portion of this increase in early-age
infertility is directly attributable to sexually-transmitted diseases.
<p>
<b>Delayed Marriage and/or Childbearing</b> -- Data shows that
more people are delaying marriage and postponing childbearing
until older ages. For example, the proportion of first-time brides
who were between 25 and 39 years of age rose from 11 percent in
1970 to 41 percent in 1990.[8] In addition, the percentage of women
reaching age 35 who were still childless increased from 15 percent
in 1980 to 21 percent in 1991.[9] These statistics are significant
because age is positively associated with elevated risks of infertility
and miscarriage.[10]
<p></ul>
Because prospective adoptive couples greatly outnumber available
adoptable children, there exist long waiting lists for children,
regardless of age, race, or &quot;special needs.&quot; Consider
the following:
<ul><p>
<li>Of the 51,157 American children who were adopted in 1986 (the
latest available published data on domestic adoptions by the NCFA),
approximately one-half (24,589) were adoptions of healthy infants
(under 2 years of age) of all races and ethnic backgrounds. The
remainder were adoptions of older children or children with &quot;special
needs&quot; (physical, mental or emotional disabilities, being
part of a sibling group, etc.).[11]
<p>
<li>Babies, regardless of medical problems, are in particularly
high demand. There are waiting lists of couples who would like
to adopt infants with Downs Syndrome or spina bifida. The National
Downs Syndrome Adoption Exchange reports they have more than 100
approved families waiting to adopt children with Downs Syndrome.
There are also a large number of couples who would like to adopt
terminally-ill babies, including babies with AIDS.[12]
<p>
<li>In addition to the 50,000 domestic adoptions each year, American
couples or individuals adopt several thousand foreign-born children.
Begun first as a solution to emergency situations in foreign countries,
these adoptions have now become an important adoption alternative.
</ul><p>
<center><h4>Number of foreign adoptions by year, 1973-1994:[13]</h4>
<pre width=132>
<b>1973   1974   1975   1976    1977   1978   1979   1980   1981   1982   1983</b>  
4,323  5,446  6,290   7,051  6,854  5,652  4,864  5,139  4,868  5,749  7,127  
<p>
<b>1984   1985   1986   1987    1988   1989   1990   1991   1992   1993   1994</b>  
8,327  9,286  9,945  10,097  9,120  7,948  7,093  9,008  6,536  7,348  8,195  
</pre></center>
<p>
The numbers of foreign adoptions per year does not follow a recognizable
trend because intercountry adoptions are driven by supply. For
example, the Korean government has been on the front lines in
facilitating adoption. As a result, thousands of Korean children
were adopted by American citizens, accounting for the swell in
intercountry adoptions during the mid-1980s.[14] But even when foreign
governments fail to facilitate adoption, the demand for children
remains high. For example, after it aired a story on abandoned
Romanian infants, ABC-TV's &quot;20/20&quot; reported that it
received over 25,000 self-addressed stamped envelopes from individuals
wanting to adopt Romanian orphans.[15]
<p>
The &quot;adoption demand,&quot; though a large problem, could
<I>theoretically</I> be erased or at least drastically reduced
if more pregnant women chose to adoption rather than abortion
or if more unwed mothers chose adoption rather than single parenting.
However, until the adoption option is chosen by more of these
mothers in <I>reality</I>, many of these couples' desires to adopt
children will remain unfulfilled.

<title>FAMILY TIME: WOMEN IN THE WORK FORCE</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">

<p>

<h2>FAMILY TIME:<br>
WOMEN IN THE WORK FORCE</h2></center>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<ul>

<li>A poll conducted by Louis Harris and Associates for the Families
and Work Institute and the Whirlpool Foundation indicates that
56 percent of all women want more flexibility in their job structures
and work hours without losing their benefits. Similarly, about
one-third of women would work part-time if they could afford to
do so.[1]

<p>

<li>According to this same poll, more than one-fourth of all women
cited the lack of family time as their greatest concern, surpassing
even concerns about neighborhood crime and safety.[2]

<p>

<li>A 1994 University of Connecticut-Storrs study of young mothers
found widespread &quot;ambivalence about returning to work&quot;
and a widespread concern about &quot;loss of time and experience
with their infants.&quot;[3]

<p>

<li>A 1995 poll entitled &quot;Women: The New Providers&quot;
found that 88 percent of women say they are pressed for time and
that their greatest concern is not having enough time together
as a family.[4]

<p>

<li>This same poll found that if money were not a consideration,
33 percent would like to work part time, 31 percent would choose
to work at home caring for the family, 20 percent would select
volunteer work while only 15 percent would choose to work full
time.[5]

<p>

<li>Forty-four percent of women would prefer more family time
over higher pay in their jobs, according to the <I>Los Angeles
Times</I>.[6]

<p>

<li>A 1992 <I>ABC News</I> poll found that while 59 percent of
adult women nationally believe that &quot;the changes in American
life caused by more women working outside the home have been worth
making,&quot; but 58 percent sometimes long for the days in which
women didn't work outside the home.[7]

<p>

<li>Women who work are &quot;spending less time being married
and having children,&quot; according to researcher John Robinson,
in order to cope with the time constraints created by employment.[8]

<p>

<li>In 1994, 41.6 percent of all women were not in the labor force.
Thirty-nine percent of all women were employed full-time.[9]

<title>FAMILY TIME: WHAT PARENTS WANT</title>

<body>

<p>

<h2>FAMILY TIME:<br>
WHAT PARENTS WANT</h2></center>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<ul>

<li>A 1993 Families and Work Institute study found that 66 percent
of the 3,381 adults surveyed nationwide wanted more time with
their children.[1]

<p>

<li>Parents today spend only 17 hours per week with their children,
40 percent less than in 1965, according to a University of Maryland
study.[2]

<p>

<li>A recent <I>Newsweek</I> poll found that one half of all parents
feel that they don't spend enough time with their children.[3]

<p>

<li>Sixty-six percent of employed parents with children ages 18
and under indicated that they did not have enough time with their
children, and another 50 percent indicated that they did not have
enough time with their spouses.[4]

<p>

<li>Thirty-five percent of all workers with children would be
willing to change jobs in order to receive flexible scheduling
around their home concerns.[5]

<p>

<li>The 44 percent of parents who do not feel that they spend
enough time with their children cite work as the most frequent
culprit.[6]

<p>

<li>Half of America's moms have said no to job advancement compared
with only 29 percent of dads. This trend is more prevalent in
younger mothers, where 62 percent have turned down promotions
in favor of spending more time with their children. However, two
out of three dads say they have not turned down a job promotion
in favor of spending more time with their kids.[7]

<p>

<li>Half of all fathers feel that they do not spend enough time
with their children.[8]

<p>

<li>A 1995 Gallup poll found that nearly half of all parents feel
that they spend too little time with their children. Fewer than
one-third of these respondents ate dinner together on a regular
basis.[9]

<p>

<li>The overwhelming choice for weekend family activities seems
to be spending time with children. Parents' top four choices for
weekend activities were &quot;talking with children,&quot; taking 
&quot;care of children,&quot; going on &quot;trips with children,&quot; 
and playing &quot;games with children.&quot; Unfortunately, by 1986 
parents actually had 10 fewer hours per week to spend with their 
children then they did in 1960.[10]

<title>FAMILY TIME: WHAT AMERICANS WANT</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">

<p>

<h2>FAMILY TIME:<br>
WHAT AMERICANS WANT</h2></center>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<ul>

<li>A 1993 study conducted by the Families and Work Institute
found that 66 percent of the 3,381 adults surveyed nationwide
wanted more time with their children.[1]

<p>

<li>&quot;The Changing Workforce,&quot; a national study conducted
by the Families and Work Institute, found that 66 percent of employed
parents with children ages 18 and under indicated that they did
not have enough time with their children, and another 50 percent
indicated that they did not have enough time with their spouses.[2]

<p>

<li>A 1991 Gallup poll found that when asked what was most important
to them, Americans ranked family life and betterment of society
above &quot;having a nice home, car, and other belongings.&quot;[3]

<p>

<li>On average, parents today spend only 17 hours per week with
their children, according to a University of Maryland study.[4] This
is roughly 40 percent less than in 1965.

<p>

<li>A recent <I>Newsweek</I> poll found that one half of all parents
feel that they don't spend enough time with their children.[5]

<p>

<li>Sixty percent of all employees consider their jobs effect
on their personal or family life to be a &quot;very important&quot;
factor in their decision to take the job. This is not surprising,
as 42 percent of all U.S. workers have children under 18 years
of age living at home. Furthermore, 32 percent of all U.S. workers
have children under 13 years of age at home, and in 66 percent
of these families both parents work (18 percent for kids under
6 years of age).[6]

<p>

<li>According to a survey commissioned by the Massachusetts Mutual
Life Insurance Company, half of all fathers feel that they do
not spend enough time with their children.[7]

<p>

<li>Forty-four percent of women would prefer more family time
over higher pay in their jobs, while 48 percent of men would prefer
more time than money.[8]

<p>

<li>Most workers (57 percent) would trade early retirement in
favor of family time, according to a survey commissioned by the
Family Research Council. Roughly a third (36 percent) said they
prefer to work longer hours now and retire sooner.[9]

<p>

<li>The overwhelming choice for weekend family activities seems
to be spending time with children. Parents top four choices for
weekend activities were &quot;talking with children,&quot; taking
&quot;care of children,&quot; going on &quot;trips with children,&quot;
and playing &quot;games with children.&quot; Unfortunately, by
1986 parents actually had 10 fewer hours per week to spend with
their children than they did in 1960.[10]

<p>

<li>A 1995 Wharton School study found that people who placed high
importance on finding the right spouse and creating a good family
life actually ended up earning more money than those who were
willing to sacrifice home life for their careers. Peter Capelli,
a management professor at the Wharton School, explains that building
a good family life is particularly important early in careers
as &quot;that's where the serious mistakes get made. People who
didn't take time for their families spend a lot of time putting
Band-Aids on family problems&quot; later on, which hurts work
performance and commitment.[11]

<p>

<li>Seventy-eight percent of Americans feel that a father should
choose to spend more time with his children if given the choice
between that and earning more money for his family, and 75 percent
felt that a mother should choose to spend more time with her children
if given the same choice.[12]

<title>FAMILY TIME: WHAT CHILDREN WANT</title>

<body>

<center><img src="/townhall/FRC/infocus/infocus.gif">

<p>

<h2>FAMILY TIME:<br>
WHAT CHILDREN WANT</h2></center>

<hr size = 3 width = 50%>

<p>

<ul>

<li>Half of all children watch more than two hours of television
a day, but three-fourths of these children say that if they could
choose between spending time with their families and watching
television they would choose family time.[1]

<p>

<li>Among children ages 8 to 12, 31 percent say that they do not
spend enough time with their fathers.[2]

<p>

<li>On any given day, nearly 400,000 children -- none of them
eligible for adoption -- can be found in government foster homes,
group homes, and shelters.[3] As one child says, &quot;I'm all 
wrapped up in programs....What I need is a mom.&quot;

<p>

<li>According to the American Public Welfare Association, the
population of children in substitute care is growing 33 times
faster than the U.S. child population in general. During each
of the past 10 years, more children have entered the system than
exited.[4]

<p>

<li>Every year, 15,000 children &quot;graduate&quot; from foster
care by turning 18 with no permanent family. Forty percent of
all foster children leaving the system end up on welfare, according
to the American Civil Liberties Union.[5]

<p>

<li>Judith S. Wallerstein conducted a study of 60 families who
experienced divorce between 1971 and 1981. Ten years after the
divorce, the children affected felt &quot;less protected, less
cared for, less comforted...these children [had] vivid, gut-wrenching
memories of their parents' separation.&quot;[6]

<p>

<li>In the same study by Wallerstein, many 5- to 8-year-old boys
showed &quot;an intense longing for their fathers&quot; after
the divorce -- a longing that seemed physically painful.<B> </B>Not
only did the children's need for their father continue, but it
also tended to recur with new intensity at adolescence, especially
when it was time for the children to leave home.[7]

<p>

<li>Almost 20 percent of sixth- through 12th-graders have not
had a good conversation lasting for at least 10 minutes with at
least one of their parents in more than a month.[8]

<p>

<li>More than one-half of all children who don't live with their
father have never been in their father's current home.[9]

<p>

<li>&quot;Father hunger&quot; often afflicts boys age one and
two whose fathers are suddenly and permanently absent. Sleep disturbances,
such as trouble falling asleep, nightmares, and night terrors
frequently begin within one to three months after the father leaves
home.[10]

<p>

<li>The National Commission on Children reported that children
from step-families were more likely to say they often felt lonely
or blue than children from either single-parent or intact families.[11]

<p>
National Minority Politics is published monthly by Richberg Communications, Inc.  The magazine and this World Wide Web site are founded on the following principles:<p>
 




<ol>
  <b><li>Strong Families.</b> The foundation of any stable society is -- first and foremost -- strong families in every community.  We should stress to our youth the importance of marriage and keeping families together.<p>

  <b><li>Individual responsibility.</b> Almost every human being is endowed with the necessary means to be successful -- a sound mind and the ability to think, reason and make choices.  These natural gifts are accompanied with the equal obligation to take responsibility for one's actions.<p>

  <b><li>Free enterprise.</b> Our nation has been the most successful on earth in fostering and promoting a free enterprise system with opportunity for all.  Strengthening this system is our best hope for a thriving economy in the future.
<p>
  <b><li>Less government.</b> The size and influence of government at all levels must be minimized in order to guarantee a free society.  Government should play a role in performing certain functions, like maintaining a strong defense, but we should not expect government to solve all our problems.<p>

  <b><li>Strong Defense.</b> While it is not America's role to be the world's policeman, there are sometimes threats to American lives and interests which we cannot tolerate.<p>

  <b><li>Community-based problem solving</b> Rather than looking to the federal government to solve local problems, such as crime and education, we can and should develop solutions in our local communities.<p>

  <b><li>Good taste and common sense in popular culture.</b> The level of violence, promiscuous sex and immoral behavior on television, in movies and in music lyrics should be reduced as it has adverse effects on society, especially our children.<p>

  <b><li>Compassionate conservatism.</b> While stressing the importance of free enterprise and less government, we must recognize our responsibility as a society to help those who help themselves, or who are unable to help themselves through no fault of their own.<p>

The freshman congressman, a former all-American college football star at the University of Oklahoma, said Apr. 23 that the party would never become the majority party unless it developed a strategy to get more black and minority voters.<P>
Blacks have overwhelmingly been supporting Democrats in modern elections.<P>
"I do believe to this day, that the Republican Party will never become the majority party until we regain our legacy as a party for minority Americans," Watts said.<P>
Watts, a congressman from Oklahoma, told the conservative Heritage Foundation in a speech and question and answer period, that the party is not doing enough on an "outreach" program to get minority voters.<P>
"There has to be a long-term, orchestrated, organized effort to say where do we want to be two years from now, where do we want to be four years ago, five years ago, ten years ago," he said.<P>
He said "we must have an organized outreach strategy by the RNC (Republican National Committee), and even the think tanks," he said.<P>
Watts said the party often presents "white papers" and other ideas on attracting minorities. "But we put forth no organized effort on outreach, none."<P>
Watts, who has one of the most conservative voting records in Congress, said the Republican Party reaches out to small business people even though some differ with the party.<P>
"Should we not do the same with the black community?" he said.<P>
He suggested a Republican outreach program should stress that Republican policies in Congress such as welfare reform and a balanced budget would help black Americans.<P>
The party should act now to get more blacks into the party, he said.  He estimated that only eight to 12 percent of blacks voted Republican in 1992 and said the goal should be improved to 15 to 18 percent this year, 19 to 25 percent in the year 2000 and 30 percent in eight years.<P>
There was no immediate response from a Republican Party spokesman to the speech from Watts, one of about one dozen co-chairmen of the Dole campaign.<P>

<li><a name="florida"></a>A federal court threw out Florida's 23 congressional boundaries Apr. 17, ruling that an Orlando-area district was illegally drawn to elect a black lawmaker.  The decision shook the state's political landscape and could threaten the only three black members of Congress elected from Florida this century.  <P>
"It took us 127 years for Florida to elect an African-American member of Congress, so this is just the beginning, not the end," said Rep. Corrine Brown (D).  In nullifying Brown's horseshoe-shaped, 14-county congressional district, the judges discarded Florida's entire congressional map.  <P>
In the majority decision, U.S. District Judges Maurice Paul and Roger Vinson concluded the 3rd congressional district cannot survive the present constitutional equal protection challenge.  But they cautioned, "This decision should not be interpreted as  turning back the clock' on the gains made by African-American voters."  The panel's only black judge, Joseph Hatchett, was the lone dissenter. <P>
The ruling ordered the Florida Legislature to draw new congressional districts by May 22, or the federal panel will create a new map for the 1996 elections.  Particularly difficult will be redrawing the 3rd congressional district, which touches six others.  The Central Florida Republicans who will will inherit part of Brown's district are Reps. Fowler (4th District), Stearns (6th District), Mica (7th District) and McCollum (8th District).  Brown will serve the remainder of her term, but will have to run in a new congressional district in November.  <P>
The ruling could force legislators to address the racial balance in at least two other districts.  The other congressional districts are currently represented by Alcee Hastings (D-23) and Carrie Meek (D-17). <P>

<li><a name="franks"></a>In a new book about his life and experiences on Capitol Hill, Rep. Gary Franks of Connecticut, who in 1990 became the first black Republican elected to the House in 58 years, writes, "For too long, the African-American community has been focused on how  we have been done wrong."<P>
But current and former Congressional Black Caucus members are furious at Franks' focus in his book on how he has "been done wrong" by black House Democrats allegedly angry with his conservative views, the Hartford Courant reported April 28.  "I was absolutely shocked and dismayed when I read the mischaracterizations," former Con-gressional Black Caucus Chairman Kweisi Mfume, D-Md., now the NAACP president, told the Courant after reading excerpts of the book.<P>
Rep. Earl Hilliard (D-Ala.) called Franks a "liar," and current CBC Chairman Donald Payne (D-N.J.) said, "I never saw any organized conspiracy against him."<P>
Throughout his book, Searching for the Promised Land: An African-American's Optimistic Odyssey, which is scheduled for publication in June, Franks offers a litany of slights by black House Democrats, even saying he was "shunned" and "blacklisted."<P>
Rep. Corrine Brown (D-Fla.) frequently moved away from him at CBC lunches, Franks contended, while Rep. Ronald Dellums (D-Calif.) once shouted insults in his face while they were on the House floor.  And on a bus ride to the Capitol from the White House, where the caucus had just met with President Clinton, Franks told how alone he felt.  "I truly felt like the invisible man of the old Jim Crow South," Franks wrote.  "I sat amidst a bus full of people who literally wished I would just disappear."<P>
Franks wrote that he positioned himself in the middle of the bus and "sure enough, when everybody had settled down, there was a cordon of empty seats around me."  Franks thought to himself, "How many black people had sat like this, shunned by their own people?"<P>
Mfume and Payne remembered no such shunning.  "I remember Gary getting on the bus and engaging in a give-and-take with other members, joking with them," Mfume told the Courant.  "It's hard to imagine he sat alone; we had 40 members and the bus was not that big."<P>
Franks also charged Mfume and other caucus members attempted to silence him during the meeting with Clinton.<P>
When he arrived to the House in 1991, Franks was an important ambassador from the CBC to then-President Bush, he wrote.  But CBC members' moods changed after the 1992 election, when more blacks were elected, and at the same time, the shape of some majority-black districts came under legal fire.<P>
Franks later testified in favor of challenges to the majority-black districts that were drawn to help elect several members of the CBC.  When he arrived to testify, Franks said Brown "turned and stared coldly into my eyes."<P>
Encounters with CBC members are a small part of Franks' book, which chronicles the 43-year-old's life.<P>
Franks has received a $100,000 advance, and under House rules can keep any royalties from the book's sale.  But he said he intends to give a portion of any royalties to nonprofit groups in Meriden and Waterbury, Conn.<P>
The Courant reported that many mentioned in the book disputed the accuracy of Franks' recollections. Franks, meanwhile, said he did not want to discuss his book at this time.  "He was never treated the way he said," said Rep. John Conyers (D-Mich.), the senior CBC member.  Payne added, "Gary thinks people pay more attention to him than they really did."<P>
But Brown, whom Franks had accused of shunning him at the luncheons, said Franks was not too far off.  "I didn't want to sit by him," she said.  "I like to sit by people of kindred spirits."<P>

<li><a name="sex"></a>A bill backed by three Republican lawmakers would keep same-sex marriage from becoming legal whatever the outcome of a controversial gay-rights case in Hawaii.<P>
A draft of the bill being circulated among members of Congress would outlaw any future gay marriages by defining marriage as a "legal union between one man and one women" in federal law.<P>
The bill, titled the "Defense of Marriage Act," sponsored by Rep. Bob Barr (R-Ga.) also would give states the authority to reject the legality of same-sex marriages performed in any other state.  Rep. Steven Largent (R-Okla.) and Rep. F. James Sensenbrenner (R-Wis.) are listed as co-sponsors of the bill.<P>
"Is America willing to require businesses to have family benefits for homosexual couples," said Largent in a May 8 statement, "to have children taught in school that homosexual relationships are the moral equivalent of traditional marriage, and to endorse the adoption of children by homosexual couples?  Is America willing to go down that road?"<P>
The Rev. Lou Sheldon, chairman of the Anaheim, Calif.-based Traditional Values Coalition, said he helped draft the bill in response to a court case that could make Hawaii the first state to recognize gay marriages.<P>
"This is the beginning of a cultural meltdown if you have homosexual marriage sanctioned by the court," Sheldon said May 7.  "When the federal government says homosexuality is valid enough for marriage, then you are sending a message to the children, you're sending a message to the culture and you are about ready to move yourself into a serious cultural meltdown."<P>
Gary Bauer, President of the Family Research Council, agreed.  The Defense of Marriage Act "is one of the most crucial pieces of legislation to be considered in this or any year.  This is a cultural watershed," said Gary Bauer.  "Will America move to protect marriage--the foundation of civilization--or will America become the first nation to destroy marriage?  At stake is nothing less than the future of the nation and the well being of our children."<P>
The Hawaii Supreme Court ruled in May 1993 that the denial of marriage licenses to three same-sex couples was discriminatory under the state's Equal Rights Amendment.  Limiting the right of marriage to heterosexuals can be justified only if the state can prove a "compelling government interest," the Hawaii court said.<P>
The state Supreme Court remanded the case to a lower court for a trial at which the state will try to show a compelling interest.<P>
This legally and politically explosive question has touched off legislative efforts in more than half the states to counter any Hawaiian sanction of same-sex marriages.<P>
Thirty-three state legislatures have taken up bills prohibiting same-sex marriage, and eight states have passed those measures into law.<P>
The bills have been defeated, withdrawn or killed in 17 states, and measures are still pending in eight more.<P>
"The heart of family life is marriage," Bauer said.  "It brings the two sexes together in a unique legal, social, economic and spiritual union--no other relationship provides society with the benefits that marriage does.  As we have drifted from the defense of marriage, we have experienced severe social and economic problems, and now, marriage is under attack as never before.  If the one-man, one-woman definition of marriage is broken, there is no logical stopping point for continuing the assault on marriage.  No civilization has ever introduced a counterfeit definition of marriage, and those who have allowed the family to be weakened have not survived.<P>

<ul>
<P>
<LI><A NAME="colin"></A>During the past month, family members of Colin 
Powell, who is often touted as a potential running mate 
for the presumptive GOP nominee, Senator Robert Dole, 
have been vocal about their feelings concerning the 
retired general being on the Republican ticket.<P>
Alma Powell says she was frightened by the attention 
generated when her husband was considering a run for the 
presidency--including hate mail and strangers ringing 
the doorbell.<P>
"A black man running for president is going to be in 
a dangerous position," she told Ladies Home Journal in 
its May issue.  "I did not want him to run," she said.  
"I told him that from the very beginning."
"I dont want to describe the hate mail weve 
gotten," Mrs. Powell added.<P>
"You think everybody loves Colin Powell.  Everybody 
doesnt like Colin Powell.  One day I got two letters--
one telling me what a wonderful man I was married to and 
how much the country needed him; the other said Colin 
Powell is a scum bag and proceeded to list all his 
evils."<P>
She added: "Im a very private person and it was all 
a little scary.  Strangers would ring the doorbell and 
ask for Colin."<P>
One man who showed up "said he had driven all the way 
from Florida to beg him to run for president," Mrs. 
Powell recalled.  When asked how he knew their address, 
"the man said hes read that we lived in McLean, Va., so 
he had just poked around the neighborhood, asking 
questions.  That makes you very vulnerable."
She said her husband could accomplish more as a 
private person than as a government official.<P>
A few weeks earlier, Michael Powell, Colins son 
said: "If he didnt want the top job, why should anyone 
think he would want the second job when, in my opinion, 
he could have had it all.  Why would he want to play 
second fiddle?. . .He firmly believes he does not want 
to do this now."<P>
For his part, the retired general has said repeatedly 
that he is not interested in the number two slot.
But some old political hands have said that "if Dole 
presses, Powell could resist only so long."  But Mickey 
Edwards, an Oklahoma Republican and former member of 
Congress, said:  "The point will come when he cant say 
no because he is a man who responds to duty."  But 
sources close to the family said that there was still no 
compelling reason for Powell to run for vice president.<P>
One family friend reportedly said:  "I dont think 
its sufficient to say for Republicans to fail to regain 
the White House [it] is a national disaster. . . Whats 
in it for him?  He doesnt need money; he doesnt need 
any of them.  They have nothing to give him, nothing to 
offer him.  Any decision he makes is based on pure 
conviction."<P><A NAME="tenn"></A>
<LI>Saying he wants "to go out on top," Democratic 
Congressman Harold Ford announced Apr. 11 he would not 
seek re-election to a 12th term.
The Tennessee Democrat joins 27 other House Democrats 
and 17 Re-publicans who have decided to retire from the 
House while a record 13 senators, including five 
Republicans and eight Democrats, are making an exodus 
from the Senate.  <P>
Fords departure creates an open seat and clears the 
way for his Republican challenger, Rod DeBerry, to pick 
up where he left off in the 1994 election.  DeBerry 
received 42 percent against Ford in 1994 and is running 
for the seat again this year.  Tennessees 9th 
Congressional District includes most of Memphis and a 
small part of suburban Shelby County.<P>
"I want to go out on top.  I think the public opinion 
polls show Im stronger than ever in my career," said 
Ford when he announced his retirement.<P>
But Ford, 50, said that after 22 years in Washington, 
it was time for a new face to represent Tennessees 
ninth district and that it was time for him to return to 
Memphis and be a part of that city.<P>
Ford has rarely faced a serious challenge for re-
election.  He was indicted on federal bank fraud charges 
in 1987 and was re-elected three times before he was 
acquitted at trial in 1993.<P>
The Democratic congressmans attempt to pick his 
successor--his 26-year-old son, Harold Jr.--has placed 
him at odds with Mayor W. W. Herenton, who says the 
younger Ford lacks the experience to represent Memphis 
in Congress.  Ford Jr. is about to graduate from the 
University of Michigan law school.<P>
Herenton has accused Ford of using "his political 
clout to exploit the economically downtrodden and divide 
the city for his political gain."  The Memphis mayor is 
organizing a committee to find an alternative candidate 
for the Democratic primary in August.<P>
While nepotism is practiced regularly in politics, it 
has had limited success in Congress as far as electing a 
retiring Congressmembers spouse or children.  Most 
recently, the Rev. Jesse Jackson, who has never held 
elected office, helped his son, Jesse Jackson, Jr., get 
elected to Congress from Illinois.  But Rep. Walter 
Tucker III (D-Calif.), who resigned in December rather 
than face expulsion after his conviction on extortion 
and tax evasion charges, failed in getting his wife 
elected to his seat, even after he endorsed her as his 
successor.<P>
<A NAME="SJC"></A>
<LI>The Supreme Court handed the Republican Party of 
Virginia defeat March 27, ruling that it must get 
clearance under the Voting Rights Act to charge a fee to 
delegates who want to attend a nominating convention. 
The 5-4 decision also allowed three former University of 
Virginia law students to file suit in federal court on 
the grounds that the $45 fee charged for the 1994 
convention which nominated Oliver North amounted to a 
poll tax.  <P>
Two of the students who challenged the fee refused to 
pay and did not attend the convention; one was given 
money by the North campaign and did attend.  E. Duncan 
Getchell, Jr., an attorney for the Virginia GOP, said he 
hopes that as the law continues to develop in this area 
that the views of the dissenters will prevail. <P>
The high court overturned an earlier decision made in 
federal court, which held that the federal clearance 
only applied to primaries, not nominating conventions; 
the court found the convention to be tantamount to a 
primary.  Justice John Paul Stevens, joined by Ruth 
Bader Ginsburg, wrote one majority opinion, while 
Justices Stephen Breyer, Sandra Day OConnor and David 
Souter joined in separate opinions to complete the 
majority.  Dissenting were Chief Justice William 
Rehnquist and Justices Anthony Kennedy, Antonin Scalia 
and Clarence Thomas. <P>
Thomas and Scalia accused the majority of trampling 
political parties freedom of association.  But the 
practical impact of the decision may be limited because 
only Virginia and Alabama, among states subject to pre-
clearance, authorize party conventions for choosing 
nominees. <P>
This year the Virginia GOP is scheduled to have a 
primary.  The choice of whether to hold a primary or 
convention is given to the incumbent in Virginia, and 
Sen. John Warner (R) chose a primary, a choice widely 
regarded as one that enhances his chances of getting the 
nomination against the opposition of more conservative 
party leaders.<P>
<A NAME="church"></A>
<LI>As a result of the efforts of Edmund Peterson, 
chairman of Project 21, a Washington, D.C.-based public 
policy group promoting conservative black leadership, 
several Republican members of Congress have signed and 
forwarded a letter to U.S. Attorney General Janet Reno 
urging her to investigate the bombings of black churches 
in the South which have occurred over the past few 
years.<P>
"We are gravely concerned over news reports of a wave 
of church burnings in several southern states," began 
the letter, which was dated Mar. 1.  "Eleven churches 
have been vic-timized by arson since last December 22, 
and a total of nineteen churches have been burned since 
the beginning of 1995."<P>
"We urge you to mobilize the resources of the Justice 
Department, to the extent possible under the law, to 
help state and local law enforcement agencies apprehend 
and convict the perpetrators of these acts," the letter 
continued.<P>
The letter was signed by several GOP Congressmen from 
Southern states, including Reps. Sue Myrick of North 
Carolina, Curt Weldon of Florida, Lindsey Graham of 
South Carolina and Charlie Norwood of Georgia.  Others 
signing the letter included Reps. J.C. Watts and Steve 
Largent of Oklahoma, Helen Chenoweth of Idaho and James 
Talent of Missouri.<P>
Peterson, who has been pleased with the response of 
the legislators to his request thus far, said action by 
Congress is imperative.  "We must not forget that 
churches are more than buildings; when churches burn, a 
piece of our freedom is also extinguished in flames of 
hatred."<P>
<A NAME="perot"></A>
<LI> The most recent USA Today/CNN/Gallup poll showed 
Ross Perots current support is younger, poorer and less 
educated than they were in 1992--and that could be bad 
news.  The poll shows he is losing support among those 
most likely to vote: older, wealthier and more-educated. 
Perots support is down to 16 percent from the 19 
percent he received in 1992, but is growing among women 
and minorities, which his supporters argue indicates 
Perots message is resonating among a broader spectrum 
of the electorate.  Perots recent speeches on college 
campuses in Texas and Florida are part of an effort to 
attract younger voters who seem to be gravitating more 
towards Perot than they did in 1992. <P>
Reform Party Director Russ Verney called college 
campuses "fertile territory," because they are populated 
by first-time voters with no party allegiance.  Young 
voters also tend to be most frustrated with Congress 
failure to pass a balanced budget amendment, reform 
Medicare and Medicaid and approve term limits.  Young 
voters are also concerned about corporate downsizing and 
international trade deals they fear have shifted jobs 
abroad.<P>
Democrat pollster Peter Hart said:  "All I would 
simply tell you is it is a very different electorate 
that is going to be with Ross Perot in 1996 than was 
there in 1992 and a lot of these new voters would be in 
Bill Clintons column if Ross Perot were not on the 
ballot."  <P><A NAME="cc"></A>
<LI>Nationally syndicated radio talk show host and 
outspoken urban activist Rev. Earl Jackson has been 
named National Liaison of Christian Coalitions Urban 
Development Program.  Jackson will play a lead role in 
explaining the mission of the pro-life, pro-family group 
to minority voters and will work to expand the 
distribution of the Christian Coalitions non-partisan 
voter education material in African-American churches 
across the country.<P>
"We have been working for years to carry our message 
into minority churches," said Ralph Reed, Executive 
Director of the Christian Coalition.  "With Rev. Earl 
Jackson on the team, our urban development program will 
reach even greater numbers."<P>
Jackson, a Baptist minister, Harvard Law School 
graduate and host of the nationally syndicated radio 
talk show, "Earl Jackson Across America," started work 
with the Christian Coalitions Urban Development Project 
at the end of March.<P>
Presently, there are 250,000 churches distributing 
Christian Coalitions non-partisan voter education 
literature.  Approximately 10 percent of those churches 
are minority houses of worship.<P>

WASHINGTON REPORT

<ul><li>GOP presidential contender Alan Keyes finally got the national television exposure he has been working for throughout his campaign, although not exactly the kind he might have hoped for.  After twice trying to force his entry into the studios of WSB in Atlanta to crash the candidates' Mar. 3 debate, Keyes appeared on several national talk shows the following morning, including ABC's "Good Morning America," and said, "This is a disgrace to American democracy, but it's also a threat to the freedom of this country.  Party bosses or media bosses should not be allowed to select candidates in America."<p>
     Keyes added:  "This was an effort to manipulate the outcome and force the people. . .to vote for certain candidates by refusing to allow them to vote for others."<p>
     Keyes, who, along with other Republican candidates including Senator Richard Lugar, was not invited by the television station to debate, was taken into custody by police when he attempted to enter the studio a half-hour before the debate was set to begin.  Throughout the day, the former United Nations ambassador and a group of supporters had staged an extended fast in five pup tents set up on the studio's front lawn.
     <p>As Keyes was taken away by police, his supporters shouted, "Let him speak.  Let him speak."  Keyes was not arrested; rather, he was driven a short distance and released, whereupon Atlanta Mayor Bill Campbell picked him up in his Lincoln Town Car.
    <p> Bill Nigut, WSB-TV political reporter and debate panelist, noted that other GOP candidates also weren't invited.  He said the station had no intention of reconsidering its decision not to invite Keyes.  In a written statement issued later, WSB-TV said inviting the top four vote getters offered Georgia voters "the most substantive debate."
    <p> However, in the future, the station and other organizations sponsoring debates would do well to establish the criteria before hand--and make the specifications public.
    <p> Despite single-digit support in nearly every state and an accumula-tion of less than 10 delegates, Keyes has vowed to stay in the race until the San Diego convention in August.  "Our commitment is to get out our message and spread our moral agenda," he said.
<p>
  <li>Elijah Cummings, the candidate with the most political experience, television ads and money, easily beat 26 other Democrats in the primary race to succeed Kweisi Mfume.  Republicans selected Kenneth Kondner, a dental technician.
   <p>  Cummings, a lawyer who has spent the past 13 years in the state House of Delegates, becomes a virtual shoo-in for election in Maryland's 7th District, where 83 percent of voters are registered Democrats.
   <p>  Though some had thought the Democratic race was up for grabs because of the crowded field, just two candidates split more than 60 percent of the vote in the Mar. 5 election.
   <p>  Cummings got 37 percent while the Rev. Frank Reid III, stepbrother of Mayor Kurt Schmoke, was second with 24 percent.  State Sen. Delores Kelley was next with 10 percent.
    <p> Knodner, 57, who ran unsuccessfully against Mfume three times, won the Republican nomination with 45 percent.
    <p> The voting, held in conjunction with the state's presidential primary, was the first congressional primary of the 1996 season.
    <p> Cummings, 44, raised more than $220,000--twice that of Reid--and spent it on a last-minute TV advertising blitz.  He promised to make crime fighting his top priority if he wins the general election.  Actually, the 7th District nominees will run in two elections--April 16 to serve the remainder of Mfume's term, and one Nov. 5 for the regular two-year term.
     <p>"We have a situation where people are afraid to come out of their houses," Cummings said.  "Eighty-five percent of all our crime problems stem from drugs."
     <p>In Maryland's seven other congressional districts, incumbents breezed to renomination.
     <p>Mfume, former head of the Congressional Black Caucus, was in the middle of his fifth term when he announced in December that he was taking over the presidency of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People, based in Baltimore.
    <p> Mfume is one of 43 House members--27 of them Democrats--who are not seeking reelection this year.  Democrats would need to take 23 seats away from the GOP to regain control of the House.
Benjamin Chavis, national director of the Million Man March and ousted executive director of the NAACP, is asking local organizers of the march to raise an additional $150,000 to cover unpaid bills incurred by the march's national office.
     <p>According to a report in the Chicago Tribune, the appeal was included in a Feb. 2 letter from Chavis to local march organizers in some 350 cities inviting them to a meeting in Chicago.  It asked each city's local organizing committee to "make a minimum contribution of $1,000" by Feb. 24 "National Meeting of LOCs," or to bring the money with them.
     <p>The request came as a shock to many who helped raise money before the Oct. 16 event and then contributed what some thought to be millions more at the march.
     <p>Some local leaders were especially surprised that Chavis would expect them to donate more money or solicit contributions when national organizers have yet to produce a promised audit on march expenses.  "Until we get an accounting, we can't talk about any money--period," said Earl Hollis, a member of Chicago's local organizing committee.
     <p>Chavis said march organizers have paid $1.4 million in expenses for the march, though he would not specify what they were.  He said that the $150,000 debt comes from bills that didn't arrive until after the first of the year.
     <p>"The letter was an upbeat letter because we're pleased that we were able to meet 95 percent of the bills from money raised at the march and prior to the march and since the march," Chavis said in a Tribune interview.
     pHe said the audit has been delayed partly because of the late-coming bills.
     <p>Rev. James Demus, a co-chairman of Chicago's organizing committee, said he is prepared to launch a local fundraising campaign that may include letters to the 50,000 or more men who attended the march from the Chicago area.
    <p> But there clearly is resistance on the part of some march participants to bail out the national office.
    <p> Much of it is because the small-scale local efforts across the country that have carried out the work inspired by the march have virtually no ties to the national office and do not feel beholden to it.
    <p> "If they don't have enough money, let them worry about the money," said Bob Wilburn, president of Million Man Ministries, a group that has started at the Chicago-area Park Manor Christian Church.  "We've gotten together now a group of men that are doing something."
    <p> That attitude violates the spirit of the march, said Earl King, the Midwest Director of Chavis' National African-American Leadership Summit. "This is the first time ever a march has been paid for (solely) by African-American people," King said.  "This is about self-respect.  We have to be together in unity."
     <p>Despite the financial controversy surrounding the march, Nation of Islam Minister Louis Farrakhan continues to receive credit for his role in spearheading the march.  Farrakhan was in Washington, D.C. Mar. 14 to receive the 1995 Newsmaker of the Year Award from the National Newspaper Publishers Association at the National Press Club.  The association, representing about 200 black-owned newspapers, said Farrakhan was selected primarily for the vision he showed in putting together his Million Man March on the Washington Mall last year.
     <p>But Farrakhan received a letter recently from the U.S. government, which did not include good news.  The Treasury Department's Foreign Assets Control Office sent a letter in February advising the Nation of Islam minister that presidential orders under the International Emergency Economic Powers Act prohibit U.S. citizens from spending U.S. currency in several countries, including Libya and Iran among those visited by Farrakhan.
<p>
   <li>The forgotten patriots of the Revolutionary War, black men both free and slave who fought for liberty, may finally be remembered in a memorial on the National Mall--unless time runs out.
    <p> The nonprofit group raising funds for the memorial trumpeted its largest contribution ever on Feb. 29, a $1.5 million corporate commitment, and promised to get the rest, reported the Associated Press.
    <p> The decade-old project still needs $5 million more by October, or it risks losing congressional approval and its coveted site on the Mall, between the monuments to Washington and Lincoln.
     <p>In past years, the effort has been plagued by missteps and internal dissension.  Architect Marshall E. Purnell, who has been working on the plans from the beginning, said several times he feared the project would collapse.
     <p>"I've thought that on and off a lot," Purnell said, "but I refused to accept it.  It's too important an idea."
     <p>Approved by Congress in 1986, the monument would honor more than 5,000 black soldiers and sailors who fought in the Revolutionary War, as well as black men, women and children who helped build the colonies.
    <p> An escaped slave, Crispus Attucks, was the first American to die in the Revolution.  But organizers say many Americans have no idea that black soldiers fought alongside whites for independence.
    <p> A combination of two curved walls and sculpted figures by artist Ed Dwight, it would be the nation's second-largest bronze artwork, after the Statue of Liberty.
     <p>General Motors Corp., an early supporter of the project, donated $400,000 on Feb. 29 and pledged to raise $1.5 million more.
    <p> To meet its Oct. 27 deadline, the foundation must raise all the needed money and obtain final design approval, an expensive and time-consuming process.  The foundation missed two earlier deadlines and was granted extensions by Congress.  There is no guarantee of yet another extension.
     <p>Donations are accepted by telephone at 1-800-888-9811, or can be mailed to the Black Patriots Foundation, 1612 K St., N.W., Suite 1104, Washington, DC 20006.

WASHINGTON REPORT

<ul><li>Black conservative groups said January 15 they are working closely with Congress to develop legislation that brings back traditional family values and improves the government's approach to 
helping the poor.<p>
&quot;The year 1996 has the potential to go down in history as the year of real change in government policy,&quot; said Star Parker, president of the Coalition on Urban Affairs, at a press conference in downtown Los Angeles.<p>
In response to a Black Contract with America sent to Congress by black conservatives in early 1995, House Speaker Newt Gingrich appointed a Minority Issues Task Force to organize hearings and policy development on minority issues.<p>
The task force developed the Project for American Renewal, which outlines several family and community empowerment bills scheduled for congressional votes by mid-spring.<p>
One example is the Family Reconciliation Act, which requires counseling and a waiting period for divorces involving children under 12 years old, and eliminates public funding for divorce except in cases of abuse.  The government-funded Legal Services Corp. provides help to the poor for divorces.<p>
Jesse Peterson, founder of the Brotherhood Organization of a New Destiny, said the black community needs to focus on the family and teach children to work and be self-reliant, not depend on government programs like welfare.<p>
&quot;People who are on welfare should be required to work--we need to move away from having government do everything, since it rarely does anything well,&quot; Peterson said.<p>
Peterson said conservatives in Congress realize the current system is &quot;a miserable failure&quot; and are suggesting a more grassroots effort to help single parents through their family, church and community.<p>
Another bill would allow low-income families to receive vouchers that enables them to send their child to the public or private school of their choice, instead of forcing them to attend academically poor inner-city schools.<p>
&quot;Granting parents the ability to choose the best school for their children is the best measure we can take to improve the quality of education in the public schools,&quot; said Americans for Family Values founder Ezola Foster.<p>
&quot;It is the first and most important step to take,&quot; said Foster, who is also a Los Angeles public school teacher.  &quot;Not surprisingly, it is not the liberals but conservatives in Congress who are proposing we take this step.&quot;<p>
Edmund Peterson (not related to Jesse Peterson), chairman of the black leadership group Project 21, said he and the other black conservative leaders chose Martin Luther King, Jr.'s birthday to discuss their political agenda to encourage people to reflect on issues of family 
values.<p>

<li>The Justice Department said Feb. 7 that it is investigating whether fires set to black churches in Alabama, Tennessee and unspecified other states were racially motivated.  &quot;We take these matters very seriously,&quot; says the department's Myron Marlin.<p>
Arsonists have damaged at least 17 churches in Alabama, Louisiana, South Carolina, Tennessee and Texas since January 1995.<p>
Pro football star Reggie White is an associate pastor of Inner City Baptist Church in east Knoxville, Tenn., which was destroyed Jan. 8.  Arsonists left racist messages at the scene.  The 124-year-old Salem Baptist Church near Fruitland, Tenn., had been set ablaze a week earlier.<p>
Edmund Peterson, chairman of Project 21, a Washington, D.C.-based public policy group  promoting con-servative black leadership, addressed a letter to Republican members of Congress asking them to speak out as public servants against &quot;this threat to the religious rights of millions of Americans.&quot;<p>
 	&quot;In the past, the press has portrayed Republicans as uncaring of minorities and their concerns,&quot; the letter continued.  &quot;This is an opportunity for Republicans to prove them wrong once again.&quot;<p>

 <li>	As Washington policymakers struggle to find solutions to America's major social problems, they should consider the enormous contribution religion can make toward solving them, according to a Heritage Foundation analyst.<p>
In a paper released January 25, Patrick Fagan, an expert in family and social issues at Heritage, says nearly every major study on the impact of religion demonstrates its positive impact on a host of social problems.  Religion, the majority of studies onclude, &quot;is the resource 
that most powerfully addresses the major social problems confronting the nation,&quot; according to Fagan, the William H.G. FitzGerald fellow.<p>
Fagan presents a summary of the social science literature, which reveals that religious practice strengthens the family and brings satisfaction to marriage; helps poor people move out of poverty; aids substantially in the formation of personal moral judgement; and inoculates individuals against such social problems such as suicide, drug abuse, out-of-wedlock births, 
crime and divorce.<p>
&quot;Renowned historians and philosophers have always known that the character of a social order is, in larger part, determined by its religious roots.  Social science cannot prove that religion, or religion in any varying expressions, is true. But the professional literature of the modern social sciences has shown religious practice to have positive social consequences,&quot; Fagan says.<p>
Another important study of strong families, conducted in the 1970s and 1980s by a pair of University of Nebraska professors, found that &quot;84 percent of these families identified religion as an important contributor to the strength of their families.&quot;  The same study also indicated that 
&quot;parents who attended church frequently cited the significance of religion in rearing their children and in providing moral guidance.&quot;<p>
Ongoing studies by Arizona State University West demonstrate that religious belief and practice encourage optimism among socially at-risk children.  Among the findings: Students who attend church weekly or more frequently are more optimistic about their futures; have better relationships with their parents; are more likely to dismiss racism as an obstacle to reaching their goals; and are more likely to see themselves in control of their own futures, not as victims of oppression.<p>
Armed with such evidence about the positive benefits of religious practice, Fagan says it is time for policymakers to stop ignoring the role religion plays in the welfare of the nation.  &quot;Given the growing crisis in out-of-wedlock births and their resultant effects, such as huge social 
and economic costs, this research should be of major interest to policymakers,&quot; he says.<p>

<li> The House voted Jan. 31 on a bill that would create a $5 million private school choice program in Washington, D.C.<p>
Low-income students would be eligible for private school scholarships of up to $3,000 a year for tuition and $1,500 for after-school activities "to enhance their achievement," according to a summary of the deal finalized by House and Senate negotiators.<p>
One key change from the House bill would give Washington's city council veto power over the parameters for allocating scholarships, the summary said.<p>
Students whose family income is below the poverty level would qualify for $3,000 scholarships, and students whose family income is 85 percent above the poverty level could get up to $1,500 for tuition.<p>
&quot;It will give these kids and their parents a choice that they've never had. This will also, in my opinion, be the catalyst to transform the district's public schools into better educational institutions,&quot; said Rep. James Walsh (R-N.Y.) chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on 
the District.<p>
But Rep. David Obey of Wisconsin, ranking Democrat on the Appropriations Committee, said he was concerned the bill would set a national precedent.  &quot;As soon as this bill is passed, you are then going to see organizations with an ideological agenda who will begin to pressure each and every school district in the country to follow the same model.&quot;<p>
The 2,000 vouchers are a small element of a 14-point reform package that is designed to arrest the appalling deterioration of the District's public schools.  Despite annual expenditures of $9,549 a year on each student, more than 50 percent of the district's high school seniors are 
functionally illiterate when they graduate.  Several local officials, including three city council members and the superintendent of schools, support the vouchers as a last-ditch effort to save some students.  Other reforms in the bill include the creation of 10 independent charter schools 
and a public boarding school, along with a requirement that students not be promoted to the next grade if they aren't prepared.<p>
But the voucher provision has attracted the ire of the National Education Association, which views the concept of parental choice with disdain.  Its favorite Senate Republican, Jim Jeffords of Vermont, grimly refused up until recently to let the entire D.C. appropriations bill out 
of a committee unless vouchers were stripped out and put to a separate vote.  But Senator Jeffords didn't count on the determination of D.C. parents and choice supporters.<p>
The D.C.-based Center for New Black Leadership noted that Senator Jeffords supported an existing voucher program in Vermont at the same time he was blocking similar opportunities for District children.<p>  
Two black parents, Karen Walker and Zaneta Simms, traveled to Vermont to accuse the Senator of &quot;standing in the schoolhouse door and telling black children they can't get in.&quot;  A group called the Coalition to Educate America flooded Vermont airwaves with radio ads featuring a plea from the two D.C. parents.<p>
Senator Jeffords called the ads &quot;garbage&quot; and said they had no effect on him.  But shortly after they began hitting the airwaves he accepted a compromise that gives the D.C. city council veto power over whether any money can be used for vouchers.  An attempt to strip vouchers 
from the bill failed in the House on a vote of 232 to 180.<p>
The Senate will vote on this measure on or around Feb. 27.  &quot;Now it is up to Senate Majority Leader Robert Dole to ensure there are enough votes for the bill,&quot; says Kevin Teasley of the Coalition to Educate America.</ul><p>

<P><ul>
<li>Democrats could pick up at least
two U.S. House seats in Georgia under a new electoral map that
increases the number of black voters in several congressional
districts now held by Republicans, party officials said Dec. 15.
<P>
But before they can erase a current
8-to-3 Republican majority in Georgia's congressional delegation,
Democratic leaders will have to overcome two obstacles, including
a potential backlash among black voters.
<P>
In addition, the American Civil
Liberties Union and the Justice Department are expected to appeal
the court-mandated district lines to the U.S. Supreme Court on
the grounds that the plan flies in the face of the 1965 Voting
Rights Act.
<P>
Black politicians, irate over
the loss of two black-majority districts, are threatening to revolt
against white Democratic leaders who they say are trying to negate
minority participation in the political process.
<P>
&quot;Overall, we now have excellent
opportunities to win several new seats,&quot; said Bill Florence,
communications director for the Georgia Democratic Party.
<P>
&quot;As much as I'd like to see
the delegation reversed to 8-3 for the Democrats, I really think
it's going to wind up 6-5. Who will have the majority, I don't
know. But it should break out to be pretty much even,&quot; he
said.
<P>
In the first judicial interpretation
of a new Supreme Court standard on redistricting, a federal court
in Augusta, Georgia, Dec. 13 broke up a concentration of black
voters that put two black members of Congress in office, Cynthia
McKinney in the 11th district and Sanford Bishop in the 2nd.
<P>
The ruling by a three-member judicial
panel pitted two Democrat-appointed judges who signed the plan
against a dissenting Republican. According to the panel's map,
districts represented by Republicans Jack Kingston, John Linder
and Charlie Norwood would have substantial black populations,
opening the door to potential Democratic gains.
<P>
&quot;That would be a kind of
classic white Democratic district of the 1970s and 1980s,&quot;
said Earl Black, a political science professor at Rice University.
<P>
Democrats also believe Bishop
can win reelection in his newly constituted district. The addition
of Macon, Ga., a Democratic stronghold, to the state's 8th district
could tip the balance in their favor there.
<P>
But Republicans and black politicians
say the strategy could backfire if black voters, who make up about
a third of the state's electorate, refuse to vote. The emergence
of black pri-mary candidates also could aid Republicans by leading
to racially polarized campaigns in the general election.
<P>
Linder, who expects to be reelected
in a new Republican 11th district, believes disenchantment among
blacks will be strong enough for his party to pick up new support
from the black community.
<P>
&quot;The blacks, seeing what
the Democrats are doing to them by taking away their seats, are
going to start looking around, I'm convinced,&quot; the Republican
congressman said. &quot;We're going to go aggressively into the
black churches in just the same way black candidates have done
for years.&quot;
<P>
State Representative Tyrone Brooks,
who heads the Georgia Association of Black Elected Officials,
said: &quot;The Democratic leaders and those two Democrat-appointed
judges think: 'Well, we'll realign these districts and these black
folks--they're ignorant--they're just going to go out and vote
for the Democrat on the ballot.' That is simply not going to happen.&quot;
<P>
Meanwhile, a group of Georgia
voters will appeal the court-mandated elimination of the two black-majority
voting districts.
<P>
But state officials appeared unlikely
to join the fight. A spokesman for Gov. Zell Miller said the governor
did not favor an appeal, saying the case already has cost Georgia
$1 million in legal fees.
<P>
There was no immediate word from
the lieutenant governor and speaker of the state House, both parties
to the case.
<P>
Laughlin McDonald, regional director
of the American Civil Liberties Union, said he will ask the same
judicial panel to stay the ruling on behalf of district voters,
black and white. But he expects to have to appeal the judge's
decision to the U.S. Supreme Court.
<P>
&quot;The plan offends basic fairness
and justice,&quot; said McDonald. &quot;We cannot predict the
future, of course, but we think we've got very strong arguments
to present to the Supreme Court.&quot;
<P>
McDonald called the panel's decision
&quot;retrogressive&quot; under the 1965 Voting Rights Act because
it leaves blacks worse off. He said the panel exceeded its judicial
power by drawing up a new electoral map rather than modifying
the former version.<BR>

<P>
<li>
The success of the Million Man March has inspired organizers to
plan an international Million Family March, the Rev. Benjamin
Chavis said.
<P>
&quot;The Million Man March brought
out a spirit of unity in the black community that was unequaled,&quot;
Chavis, former director of the NAACP, said in December after giving
a sermon at First Iconium Baptist Church in Atlanta. &quot;It
was natural that we try to build on that success.&quot;
<P>
The event, planned for Oct. 16,
1996, will include simultaneous, satellite-linked gatherings of
black families around the world. 
<P>
Chavis has said previously that
the anniversary of October's Million Man March on Washington will
be observed internationally.
<P>
Chavis, who helped organize this
year's march with Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan, said
the Nation of Islam will also be involved in next year's project.
<BR>

<P>
<li>
Longtime Texas Rep. E. &quot;Kika&quot; de la Garza announced
Dec. 18 he will not run for a 15th term in the House next year,
saying he felt it was time to serve the public from a different
venue.
<P>
&quot; I feel I can continue outside
of elective office to make a contribution,&quot; de la Garza told
a crowd assembled at the Mission, Tex., Chamber of Commerce building.
<P>
&quot;Helping people is in my
blood and this will never change,&quot; he said. &quot;There are
many more things I would like to do and I want to do them while
I am in good health and young enough--so now is the time.&quot;
<P>
De la Garza, who was first elected
to Congress in 1964, is the ranking Democrat on the House Agriculture
Committee.
<P>
He joined several other House
Democrats who have this year stated their intentions to beat a
path to retirement as the party adjusts to minority status in
the House and Senate for the first time in 40 years.
<P>
De la Garza told the crowd he
believed 1996 would likely be a watershed in the Congress, as
the battle over the balanced budget is likely to continue well
into this year.
<P>
The congressman, now 68, estimated
it would take all his effort and energy to join that fight.
<P>
&quot;We will work to reduce the
deficit, balance the budget, and at the same time protect Medicare,
Medicaid, health, education, and basic programs for the poor and
elderly,&quot; he said about what will be his last year in Congress.
<P>
&quot;I feel I have to devote
all my energies to this effort and cannot let a campaign detract
from it,&quot; de la Garza said.
<P>
The Republicans now enjoy a 236-197
advantage in the House, with the chamber's one independent, Rep.
Bernie Sanders of Vermont, frequently voting with the Democrats.
<BR>

<P>
<li>
Rep. Walter Tucker III resigned rather than face expulsion after
his conviction on extortion and tax evasion charges, but he admitted
no wrongdoing.
<P>
The second-term Democrat said
in a Dec. 12 letter to several officials that he &quot;unfortunately
was not judged by a jury of my peers and in my opinion, did not
receive a just verdict.&quot;
<P>
However, Tucker said, &quot;itwas never my intention to put the Congress through a vote on expulsion
if I were convicted.&quot;
<P>
Tucker, 38, said his resignation
was effective Dec. 15. Gov. Pete Wilson has called for a special
election on March 26 (same day as the primary elections).
<P>
After announcing his resignation,
Tucker endorsed his wife Robin as his successor. He called his
wife the &quot;person who I know will help this community unify&quot;
and said she has the &quot;heart of the community.&quot; 
<P>
Robin Tucker said her agenda would
include &quot;intensifying efforts to make the 37th District's
streets safer; protecting Medicare, Medicaid and Social Security
benefits, and improving economic conditions.&quot; She said, &quot;I
am ready to fight for this community, I am ready to stand for
this community, because I know there is something better for this
community.&quot; 
<P>
But Royce Esters, head of the
Compton branch of the NAACP, &quot;dismissed the announcement&quot;:
&quot;We need to get people who are qualified to run for these
offices. They are trying to keep it in the family. Is that the
answer to Compton's problems?&quot;
<P>
Tucker was elected in 1992 to
represent the working-class communities of Compton, Watts, Carson
and part of Long Beach in southern Los Angeles County.
<P>
He was convicted of extorting
$30,000 in bribes while mayor of Compton to support a proposed
$250 million waste-to-energy project. Tucker, who is black and
a nondenominational minister, has claimed he was entrapped by
the government because of his race and his Christian beliefs.
<P>
He is expected to be sentenced
March 18 to a few years in prison, although he faces a maximum
of 146 years and $1.9 million in fines.<BR>

<P>
<li>
A record 32 candidates--28 Democrats and four Republicans--filed
by the Dec. 26 deadline to succeed Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D), who
is resigning effective Feb. 15 to head up the NAACP.
<P>
The field includes state Sens.
Delores Kelley (D) and Nathaniel McFadden (D); Dels. Clarence
Davis (D), Elijah Cummings (D), Salima Mariott (D) and Kenneth
Montague Jr. (D), plus several clergy members, including Baltimore
City Register of Wills Mary Conaway (D) and Rev. Frank Reid III
(D), who leads a 10,000-member church and is the brother-in-law
of Baltimore Mayor Kurt Schmoke (D). 
<P>
The seat has historically been
held by a resident of West Baltimore City, but with a large field
and redistricting that extended the congressional district further
into East Baltimore and Baltimore Co., nothing is certain. 
<P>
The only major candidate with
ties to Baltimore Co.--where nearly a third of the vote lies--is
Kelly. Mfume said he did not think he would make an endorsement.
The special primary is scheduled for Mar. 5.<BR>

<P>
<li>
Freshman state Sen. Henry Stallings II (D) will run for the seat
held by embattled Rep. Barbara-Rose Collins (D-Mich.). Collins,
a former state House representative and Detroit City Council member
who replaced labor activist George Crockett in Congress, has served
Michigan's 15th Congressional District since 1990.
<P>
Detroit analyst Mario Morrow said
the 56-year-old Collins may be ripe for defeat, noting a House
Ethnics Committee investigation into how she has spent office,
campaign and scholarship funds.
<P>
The Aug. 6 primary is tantamount
to winning election in the heavily Democrat district. Other announced
Democrats include Detroit attorney Godfrey Dillard. The filing
deadline is May 13. </ul>

<a name="mfume"></a>
<LI>Rep. Kweisi Mfume was chosen Dec. 9 to head the NAACP, after
15 months during which the nation's oldest civil rights organization
became better known for controversy than activism.
<P>
The Maryland Democrat, who said he will leave Congress in mid-February,
said his first order of business would be to address the organization's
$3.2 million debt and change the group's administrative structure.
<P>
&quot;We're not going to sit by and watch the world change,&quot;
the former head of the Congressional Black Caucus said. &quot;We
are going to change.&quot; Mfume also said that, under his leadership,
the group would begin to place more emphasis on &quot;personal
responsibility.&quot;
<P>
Elected by the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People's board in a unanimous vote, Mfume said he would seek to
cut the size of the board.
<P>
The board has been criticized for being too large and too politicized
and the organization now has more board members than staff members.
<P>
In the past, executive directors have clashed with the 64-member
board over the extent of their power, and potential candidates
for the position have blamed the board for scaring them away.
<P>
But Mfume said one of the conditions he had demanded when he agreed
to take the job was that he report to the board's 17-member executive
committee rather than the entire panel.
<P>
&quot;It is easier to assemble 17 than 64 on any given day,&quot;
Mfume said. His title will be president and chief executive officer,
reflecting his desire for more autonomy.
<P>
Mfume said he would meet with Chairwoman Myrlie Evers-Williams
to come up with a short-term and long-term financial plan.
<P>
He said that plan would include reopening the stream of donations
from corporate donors, approaching potential
<P>
individual donors such as athletes and actors for support, and
trying to increased the ranks of the NAACP's 500,000 members.
<P>
Mfume's broad-minded yet principled style could breathe much needed
life and energy into this 90-year-old group.
<P>
Mfume said he hoped his decision to leave a safe seat in Congress
for the leadership of the NAACP would encourage people to return
to the organization.
<P>
&quot;That example might say to other people that it's all right
to come back home,&quot; he said.
<P>
Many of the organization's larger donors withdrew their support
last year after allegations of financial impropriety were leveled
at former executive director Benjamin Chavis and former chairman
William Gibson.
<P>
Chavis was fired in August 1994 for committing more than $330,000
in NAACP funds without the board's approval to settle a sex discrimination
suit filed against him.
<P>
Gibson, a South Carolina dentist, was ousted in February after
accusations he double-dipped on expenses. An audit released this
summer questioned more than $112,000 in expenses he charged to
the NAACP.
<P>
The resulting drop in donations worsened the NAACP's financial
situation and forced the temporary layoff of most of the national
staff.
<P>
The NAACP now has only 50 national employees, less than half what
it had when Chavis took office.
<P>
Critics had said the search for Chavis' replacement took so long
because of a lack of qualified candidates interested in the job.
<P>
But Evers-Williams, the widow of slain civil rights leader Medgar
Evers, denied that, saying the search was not initiated in earnest
until last May when the search committee was appointed.
<P>
&quot;A search process, if it's done well, tends to take time,&quot;
she said.
<P>
The appointment will allow Evers-Williams a chance to withdraw
from the day-to-day running of the organization.
<P>
The chairmanship is a volunteer position and Evers-Williams has
performed many of the duties Mfume will assume since her appointment
in February, just three days before the death of her second husband,
Walter Williams.
<P>
&quot;I haven't had a chance to mourn my husband,&quot; she said.
&quot;I haven't stopped and it's been very difficult&quot;
<a name="jackson"></a>
<LI>Jesse Jackson, Jr. won a special congessional election Dec.
12 in Chicago to fill the seat vacated by Mel Reynolds, who quit
after being convicted of having sex with an underage campaign
worker. His victory followed his win of the Democratic nomination
Nov. 28.
<P>
The younger Jackson has tried to avoid comparisons with his famous
father during his run for Congress, insisting his campaign is
based on the issues and concerns of Illinois' 2nd District
<P>
But he acknowledged his lineage during a victory speech following
the Nov. 28 special primary election, saying his path to Washington
was paved by his father's life work.
<P>
Jackson said when he was born March 11, 1965, his father was marching
in Selma, AL.
<P>
&quot;He nearly named me Selma. He was caught up in the history
of the moment,&quot; Jackson told an amused throng. &quot;Thank
God for Mama.&quot;
<P>
 He said his early experiences in the areas of voting, public
policy, education and religion became a &quot;part of the foundation
of my being.&quot;
<P>
&quot;Dad never stopped registering voters. . .he never stopped
lifting the hopes of the people.&quot;
<P>
Jackson, 30, beat political veteran Emil Jones, 60, in the Democratic
primary to win the nomination. Voter turnout was a scant 20 percent.
<P>
Before the candidate made his remarks, an uncharacteristically
restrained Rev. Jesse Jackson Sr. praised God for his son's nomination
and led a prayer session.
<P>
Jackson Jr. then took the podium to chants of &quot;Jesse Jr.&quot;
from hundreds of supporters and read a prayer in both English
and Spanish. He then pledged to work for the well-being of the
district's youth.
<P>
Jackson said he ran a forthright campaign, adhering to his lessons
from the Scripture.
<P>
Jackson, a lawyer and field director for the National Rainbow
Coalition, based his campaign on bringing jobs to the area, getting
behind Republican Gov. Jim Edgar's effort to build a third Chicago
area airport at Peotone, about 40 miles southwest of downtown
Chicago.
<P>
Jones, president of the Illinois Senate, urged voters to select
him because of his political experience despite voter sentiment,
nationwide, against career politicians.
<P>
Jones, who relied heavily on Democratic precinct workers in conducting
his campaign, said Jackson's name recognition was an obstacle
that could not be overcome.
<P>
Jackson acknowledged the criticism surrounding his lack of experience
and relative youth.
<P>
Jackson will spend only three months in Congress before facing
voters again in a March primary prior to the fall 1996 election.
<a name="schr"></a>
<LI>After 23 years of challenging the power structure in the House,
Rep. Patricia Schroeder (D-Colo.) announced Nov. 29 she will retire
at the end of this term, in part because she was afraid of becoming
one of the House members who are carried out in a &quot;box.&quot;
<P>
Schroeder said she first thought about retiring from the House
in 1994, but is glad she struck it out for another term because
&quot;it's been important to see the Democratic Party come alive
again. I felt I was needed this year.&quot;
<P>
The former pilot, who was elected to the House at age 32, said
she has not decided what she will do in the future, but it involved
teaching, writing or working for a foundation.
<P>
Schroeder said she anticipates a Democrat can win the liberal-leaning
district covering most of eastern Denver. &quot;If I thought the
Democrats could not hold that seat, believe me, I would not be
here today. Democrats can clearly hold that seat,&quot; she said.
Denver attorney Joe Rogers, a 31-year-old black Republican who
supports abortion rights and affirmative action, announced this
month he would challenge Schroeder in the district, which gave
President Clinton 55 percent of the vote in 1992, and former President
Bush only 39 percent.
<P>
But even without Schroeder as a target, Rogers said in an interview
that the theme of his campaign will be a &quot;new generation
of leadership.&quot; He said he already has an organization of
more than 800 volunteers and expects his campaign war chest to
top $150,000 by the end of this year. &quot;This is going to be
a good fight,&quot; said Rogers, who happened to be across the
street from the U.S. Capitol at the National Republican Congressional
Campaign committee when the word came over CNN that Schroeder
was retiring. &quot;I was totally surprised,&quot; he said. Thus
far, two Democrats have said they would definitely enter the race:
State Rep. Glinda Swanson Lyle and Peter Groff, an official in
Denver Mayor Wellington Webb's administration.
<P>
Three other state representatives, all attorneys, have expressed
interest in the seat: Ken Gordon, Doug Friednash and Diana DeGette.
<P>
Denver City Councilwoman Ramona Martinez, who is currently running
for the open Colorado Senate seat in a crowded field of Democrats,
may jump into the House race as well.
<P>
<a name="tx"></a>
<LI>The state of Texas and the Clinton administration argued before
the Supreme Court Dec. 5 that the majority-black and majority
Hispanic congressional districts in Houston and Dallas are constitutional
because the primary consideration in drawing those districts was
to protect incumbent House members--not to elect blacks or Hispanics
to Congress. At issue are the majority-black seats of Democratic
Reps. Sheila Jackson Lee and Eddie Bernice Johnson, and the majority
Hispanic seat of Democratic Rep. Gene Green. While a 1995 Supreme
Court decision on the Georgia congressional district map said that race
cannot be the predominant factor in drawing districts, the court
was reviewing two more congressional maps--Texas and North Carolina-to
more clearly define the standards.
<P>
The potential stakes are enormous. Justice Stephen G. Breyer said
thousands of federal, state and local elections could some day
be affected by the court's decision, expected by July.
<P>
The 1965 Voting Rights Act says election districts can be unlawful
if they deny minorities the opportunity to elect candidates of
their choice.
<P>
But in 1993, the Supreme Court ruled in a North Carolina case
that districts designed to help minority voters may violate white
voters' rights. Last June, the court ruled in a Georgia case that
such election districts must be presumed unlawful if race was
the main factor in creating them.
<P>
Lower courts struck down three urban congressional districts in
Texas but upheld North Carolina's 12-district map.
<P>
Now, the justices must decide whether race was the predominant
factor in creating those districts, and if so, whether such consideration
was justified by an overwhelmingly important reason.
<P>
Texas Assistant Attorney General Javier Aguilar argued the Texas
districts are constitutional because the lines were motivated
by a state legislature wanting to protect incumbents. Aguilar
said that if political considerations were the core motive or
predominant factor in drawing the lines, then racial considerations
by default could not be the predominant factor--thus making the
districts constitutional, even though race was used as a consideration
when drawing the lines.
<P>
Justice Sandra Day O'Connor, who held the swing vote in the Georgia
case, asked Aguilar if his argument meant the state legislature
could exclude blacks from majority-white districts in order to
protect a white incumbent who told the mapmakers that blacks would
not vote for him. Deputy Solicitor-General Paul Bender, representing
the administration, later told O'Connor that Democratic map drawers
&quot;weren't looking for black voters--they were looking for
Democratic voters,&quot; and that type of political gerrymandering
is constitutional. But since these districts are labeled &quot;black&quot;
districts or &quot;Hispanic&quot; districts, it appears that the
incumbent argument holds little weight.

<ul>
<a name="powell"></a><li> Colin Powell's Nov. 8 decision not to run-for president closes
one chapter of the 1996 presidential sweepstakes, but opens many
others. Although the former chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff
ruled it out, there is still a possibility that he may be asked
to join the Republican ticket in the vice presidential slot. And
his name is already being touted as a presidential candidate in
the year 2000
<P>
Let's analyze some of the reaction to the potential Powell campaign,
before <I>and</I> after Nov. 8.
<P>
<B>Before.</B>  Several, days before Powell's announcement, leaders
of 10 conservative groups held a press conference warning the
retired general not to run and vowing to oppose him if he did
&quot;Any candidacy by Colin Powell must be stopped. He will be
stopped,&quot; said Morton Blackwell, the Republican National
Committeman from Virginia.
<P>
Blackwell also went as far to suggest that some conservatives
were promoting Powell only because he is black &quot;If General
Powell were a white general holding these views, they would not
consider for a moment supporting him for our party's nomination,&quot;
he said.
<P>
Others attending the press conference and supporting this view
included Paul Weyrich of the Free Congress Foundation and National
Empowerment Television, David Keane of the Conservative Political
Action Comrnittee, Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform,
and Gary Bauer of the Family Research Council.
<P>
This move by some party conservatives was the most hypocritical
and preposterous in recent memory. First, for people who like
to tout their pro-America credentials, it is exceptionally un-American
and undemocratic to suggest that any American is barred from seeking
public office. If he or she is unacceptable, it's up to the voters
to decide, not for a self-appointed band of litmus testers to
try to scare people out of running.
<P>
Several black conservatives were asked to participate in this
charade, including the publisher and editor of <I>National Minority
Politics</I>. 
<P>
But the response and receptiveness (or lack thereof) to Powell's
potential candidacy helped smoke out some of the elements in the
Republican Party who are most strident and resistant to expanding
the party's base. This was one positive outcome of otherwise deplorable
behavior on the part of some patty activists.
<P>
Time magazine reports that House Speaker Newt Gingrich met privately
with Powell Nov. 2 and encouraged him to run, saying &quot;a campaign
would succeed-but only if Powell wanted it very badly.&quot; Without
endorsing Powell Gingrich encouraged him and told him they could
work as a team Powell also had conversations with former Presidents
Ford, Bush and Carter prior to making his final decision. The
broad range of support Powell received, from former Presidents
to lay persons, demonstrates his appeal across party and ideological
lines.
<P>
<B>After.</B>  One newspaper, the <I>Concord (N.H.) Monitor</I>,
said of the Powell decision: &quot;Powell made the right decision
for the right reason. . . If we were President Clinton, we would
seize the chance and call on him to lead a bipartisan, broadly
representative commission on race relations.&quot;
<P>
It is an indication of how far we have to go concerning stereotypes
and pigeon-holing of our nation's black citizens that a major
American newspaper would even suggest reducing a four-star general
to the status of race merchant.
<P>
In response to Powell's announcement that he was joining the Republican
Party, the Rev. Jesse Jackson said the general took a &quot;step
backward&quot; by aligning with the GOP. Noting GOP plans to cut
popular federal programs for the poor, Jackson said Powell will
have to do &quot;some very heavy lifting to meet his goal of making
the party more attractive to black voters.&quot;
<P>
Jackson's reaction reveals two important things about his approach
to politics. One, his view that it is a a step backward&quot;
for a man of Powell's stature to work toward two-party participation
by black Americans demonstrates the Reverend's idea of &quot;progress&quot;
is for all blacks to walk in lock step behind Democratic leaders.
<P>
Two, his view that Powell will have to change the GOP by himself
places an unreasonable expectation on the retired general's shoulders.
After all, Jackson has been in the Democratic Party for years
and they Still refuse to accept him as their standard bearer.
Perhaps he should do some &quot;heavy lifting&quot; of his own
in the Democratic Party.
<P>
Powell's son Michael, in an interview with Time magazine following
Powell's Nov. 8 press conference, said the retired general might
be persuaded to accept a spot on the GOP ticket if asked by the
nominee. &quot;I wouldn't be surprised one bit if he was in government
again as a secretary of something or even vice president,&quot;
said the younger Powell.
<P>
And some of Powell's supporters have not yet thrown in the towel.
Some Powell partisans are organizing a massive write-in campaign
and pinning their hopes on a win in New Hampshire to coax Powell
to join the Republican field.
<P>
California Citizens for Powell Chair Emmett Cash III said, &quot;If
the people of New Hampshire write him in great numbers, he will
be the next President of the United States. New Hampshire is the
key to this election for Colin Powell.&quot; But it might be best
to respect Powell's wishes--for now. He doesn't want to be a candidate
this year. After 35 years of service to his country, he deserves
a break.
<P>
<a name="collins"></a><li> In a surprise announcement, Rep. Cardiss Collins (D-Il.), the
longest serving black woman in Congress and a Chicago political
power, said she will retire. Since being elected to succeed her
late husband in 1973, Collins has handily won election after election.
Collins, in a Washington, D.C. press conference, said, &quot;The
main factor in stepping down is I'D be 65 years old next year.
I believe you know in your life when its time to make a change.&quot;
<P>
Collins said she considered retiring in 1994. The 7th Congressional
District which she represents contains the Loop and most of the
North Michigan corridor and the Near North Side, with the infamous
Cabrini-Green housing project. It also goes south, past the Century
Prairie Avenue mansions to the Taylor homes and takes in a few
heavily black South Side neighborhoods.
<P>
Collins played a pivotal role in remapping Illinois' congressional
districts after the 1990 census, demanding that her district retain
the Loop. &quot;It has been frustrating moving from the majority
to the minority, but that's not the reason I'm leaving,&quot;
said Collins. &quot;I've enjoyed fighting the Republicans, quite
frankly.&quot;
<P>
Her retirement set off a stampede of would-be successors.
<P>
<a name="jj"></a><li> Two-time presidential candidate Jesse Jackson said Nov. 9 he's
thinking anew about running in 1996 now that retired Gen. Colin
Powell has ruled out a potential White House bid.
<P>
The Associated Press reported that less than 24 hours after Powell
announced he would not run, Jackson said at a news conference
that he has met with his advisers over the past few days to ''assess
the landscape.&quot;
<P>
&quot;I still have the fire in my belly and clear vision in my
head about what a president ought to do to make the nation better,&quot;
said the founder of the National Rainbow Coalition and presidential
candidate of 1984 and 1988.
<P>
Jackson said it was premature to say when he would reach a decision.
<P>
But while criticizing what he said was Clinton's inattention to
urban issues, Jackson suggested he would stay on the political
sidelines if the president begins to pay more attention to cities
and racial inequities.
<P>
&quot;I feel that Clinton, if he focuses on the covenant, honors
it and addresses those people who elected him, he could be elected
again. But if he abandons that base then that base has no allegiance
to him,&quot; he said.
<P>
Jackson said it would be difficult for him to run in the Democratic
primaries and that an independent candidacy would be the only
way to &quot;open the process up.&quot;
<P>
<a name="cv"></a><li> President Clinton emerged the clear winner in CityVote, the
presidential preference balloting that lumped together declared
and potential candidates, independents and party members on Election
Day.
<P>
210,000 votes were cast in 13 cities, including Tucson, Ariz.
and Fayette, Mo. In the Nov. 7 non-binding urban primary, Clinton
drew 43.7 percent. Colin Powell came in second with 18.2 percent
and Sen. Bob Dole finished third with 11.9 percent.
<P>
The rest received votes in this order: Steve Forbes, Ross Perot,
Pat Buchanan, Phil Gramm and Jesse Jackson. Republican presidential
hopefuls Lamar Alexander, Sen. Arlen Specter and Sen. Dick Lugar
rarely, if at all, exceeded 1 percent.
<P>
Twenty-one names in all appeared on the ballot. Legal challenges
prevented several bigger cities, including Boston, Baltimore and
Newark, from participating. CityVote also was plagued by pressures
from the
<P>
Democratic National Committee, which sought to have Clinton's
name struck from the ballot.
<P>
<a name="banks"></a><li> Banks may have lost a defense against redlining charges.
<P>
Two economists with the Federal National Mortgage Association
said earlier studies erred in supporting a reason often given
for lender avoidance of low-income neighborhoods, according to
a report in American Banker.
<P>
The idea that home values in such neighborhoods tend to fall is
mistaken, the researchers found. In fact, they said, home values
in poorer areas have actually gone up, while those in affluent
areas have slipped.
<P>
Their study indicates that bankers, in avoiding low-income neighborhoods,
lack an economic justification they could cite before to counter
fair-lending charges. Now they must focus on the credit histories
and incomes of particular applicants--rather than the area in
which they live. That is much harder to do.
<P>
The economists, Eric Rosenblat and Ying Li, in a paper presented
Oct. 24 to the Society of Government Economists, said the flaw
in earlier studies was a reliance on demographic information that
wound up having no correlation to housing values.
<P>
The earlier studies looked at the number of welfare recipients
and the number of vacant homes in an area to explain why bankers
did not lend in certain communities.
<P>
Many economists have questioned the validity of those studies,
arguing that bankers consider only the borrower and the house
when making loans. Community characteristics such as the number
of welfare recipients don't matter, they said.
<P>
The Fannie Mae study is the first research project to formally
rebut the prior findings.
<P>
The researchers based their conclusion on data collected by Fannie
Mae and the Federal Home Mortgage Corp. that covered housing purchases
in California--including Los Angeles, Anaheim and Oakland. They
limited their review to homes that changed hands at least twice
between 1986 and 1994.</ul>

<p><a name="mmm"></a>
<a href="#table">Table of Contents</a><p><ul><li>The Million Man March spearheaded by Nation of Islam
Minister Louis Farrakhan and Benjamin Chavis, former executive
director of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored
People, is now in the history books.
<P>
According to U.S. Park Police, a throng of 400,000 mostly black
men filled the Capitol lawn and beyond on Oct. 16, making it the
fourth-largest demonstration in Washington, D.C. history. March
organizers, however, dispute the government's figures, and plan
to file a lawsuit to get the figures corrected to, what they believe,
is closer to one million.
<P>
It is always difficult to gauge large crowd figures such as these,
but, from appearances, it seems that the march organizers are
probably correct that the figure was underestimated.
<P>
At any rate, the massive showing of black men who attended for
various reasons--nearly all of them positive--heartened supporters
and convinced many skeptics that, even with the presence of Farrakhan,
much more was gained than lost.
<P>
Most black conservatives did not support the march initially,
precisely because of the controversial Muslim leader's involvement
and the potential for increased racial division as a result of
the march. But, it appears that most of them were swayed, not
by Farrakhan, but by the sincerity and purpose of the men who
participated in the historical event.
<P>
&quot;You can denounce Farrakhan until the cows come home, but
you cannot argue with the fact of how he has improved the quality
of lives of men in these inner cities--something that the churches
have not done for quite some time,&quot; said syndicated radio
talk showhost Armstrong Williams during a FOX Morning News interview the
morning
following the march. &quot;We all can be better people as a result
of what happened, because it was very peaceful--and I think it
will make a difference in this country.&quot;
<P>
The real test of the march's success, however, will be what takes
place in communities across the country in coming weeks and months.
March participants vowed to go back to their neighborhoods as
more responsible and committed citizens, registering their friends
and families to vote and being more determined to give something
back.
<P>
If they do, indeed, get more involved in uplifting their communities,
it will be reflected in decreased crime figures, increased education
rates and the formation of more intact families.
<P>
Interestingly, since the march, the mainstream media has been
scratching their collective heads to determine whether Farrakhan
is now the leader of black Americans. As has been the rule in
the past, they appear obsessed with selecting one individual as
the leader of all black people, perhaps because this means they
only have to interview one person when they want to know what
&quot;black America thinks.&quot;
<P>
They just don't get it. Blacks are just as diverse in their opinions
as are other groups and one single leader will not suffice.
<P>
<p><a name="comm"></a>
<a href="#table">Table of Contents</a><p><LI>Before the ink was dry on stories concerning the march,
liberals were quick to call for yet another presidential commission on race
relations. The request, which was in the form of a letter to President
Clinton, was signed by a well-meaning, but misguided, bipartisan
cast: Democrats Charles Schumer and Charles Rangel of New York,
John Lewis of Georgia, and Eleanor Holmes Norton of the District
of Columbia, and Republicans James Leach of Iowa and Bill McCollum
of Florida.
<P>
Many references have been made to the Kerner Commission report
which revealed (surprise, surprise!) that the nation was moving
toward two separate, unequal white and black societies. The commission
was created by President Lyndon Johnson after several urban riots
in 1968.
<P>
Politicians tend to call for commissions on subjects with which
they prefer not to handle directly. By getting a commission to
study the problem, they can appear to be doing something without
actually doing anything.
<P>
In the 1960s, liberals spent federal funds to find out what any
thinking person on the street could have told them: Our country
began as two separate nations-one based on slavery and the other
based on ownership. To have an expensive government study tell
us the obvious is not only wasteful, but absurd. What we need
to find out is how do we pull it all together, and neither a study
nor a poll can give us the answers.
<P>
As is typical of liberal ideology, rather than deal with the problem,
let's spend the taxpayers' money to find out what we already know.
What America needs is not more studies, but better national leadership
that can not only facilitate a national discussion, but can do
so without scapegoating or patronizing blacks, and without making
whites feel guilt-ridden about a past they cannot change.
<P>
The only thing any of us can change are the present and the future.
As we examine the cast of potential presidents, the ability to
unify the nation should be at or near the top of the list of qualifications.
<P>
Before the establishment of such a commission is even considered,
the American public has the right to know: Who will conduct the
study and what will be their premise? And, more important, how
much will it cost?

<LI>Colin Powell's potential presidential candidacy may be
impacted by the not-guilty verdict in the O.J. Simpson trial,
but analysts differ as to whether that impact will be positive
or negative. Commenting on the verdict shortly after it was announced,
Powell said &quot;The trial showed the judicial system works.&quot;
<P>
He prefaced his remarks by saying, &quot;I don't know that we
should go into a huge national debate about this. We've got to
move on.&quot;
<P>
But he went on tot say &quot;that the different reactions to the
trial from blacks and whites is something 'we should not walk
away and forget about.'&quot;
<P>
&quot;It should be troubling not to me but to all America that
there is still polarization,&quot; said Powell. &quot;The same
America that gave 'an incredible opportunity to me as a black'
still leaves many citizens trapped by their circumstance.&quot;
<P>
GOP consultant Eddie Mahe says, &quot;It will increase the great
healer-a role that is exquisitely difficult for him or anyone
else to fill.&quot; And Democratic consultant Tad Devine says
&quot;this could be a golden chance for Powell.&quot; &quot;Voting
for a black candidate can be a tremendous act of self-affirmation
for white voters, if there is a black candidate whose values they
share,&quot; said Devine.
<P>
A GOP strategist, however, was reportedly spreading the idea that
this undermines the case for Powell candidacy since whites will
now be less likely to vote for a black candidate. Some black analysts
were also skeptical.
<P>
&quot;Whatever he says-even if he splits the difference-he's going
to lose something on both sides. . .This may be a
defining moment for him,&quot; said Howard University political
science chairman Ronald Walters, on Powell and the verdict.
<P>
Washington Post columnist Mary McGrory wrote that &quot;one of
the many consequences of the earthquake verdict is that people
talk of beseeching [Powell] to lead them over the chasm.&quot;
But CNN political analyst Bill Schneider disagreed: &quot;When
racial polarization intensifies, it hurts Democrats and it helps
Republicans, unless Republicans are seen as creating it or exploiting
it.&quot;

<LI> With former Rep. Mel Reynolds (D-Il.) beginning a five-year
sentence for sexual misconduct, 14 candidates--10 Democrats and
4 Republicans--met the OCL 9 filing deadline in preparation for
the Nov. 28 special primary and Dec. 12 general election.
<P>
As for the primary, Senate Minority Leader Emil Jones is viewed
by many as an early favorite. Jones has the backing of Chicago's
infamous Democratic machine and, thus, his name will appear atop
the Democratic ballot. Jones has been endorsed by local party
officials and has long ties to Mayor Richard Daley.
<P>
However, State Sen. Alice Palmer is giving Jones a run for his
money (see &quot;Featured Politico&quot; interview ). She has
received the endorsement of a group of African-American men of
various religious, social, economic and political backgrounds.
They stated that the 2nd Congressional District will be &quot;politically
safe under her leadership,&quot; and urged all prospective candidates
to join them in supporting Palmer.
<P>
All the leading Democratic candidates appeared at an Oct. 9 debate.
Calling himself the &quot;voice of a new generation,&quot; attorney
Jesse Jackson, Jr. reportedly displayed some of the rhetorical
flair of his famous father.
<P>
&quot;I'm tired of Monty Hall politics: Let's make a deal,&quot;
said the younger Jackson. &quot;We can't stop the importation
of $200 billion worth of drugs into our country, but we can stop
one cigar coming in from Cuba.&quot;
<P>
But it will take more than homilies and witticisms for Jackson
to break out of the pack. He carries both the baggage and the
connections of his father, who, despite having a genius for espousingcolorful rhetoric, has yet to be elected to any post other than
that of the largely symbolic D.C. &quot;shadow&quot; senator.
<P>
During the debate, Palmer spoke out against casino gambling and
reductions in Medicaid funding, while stressing that her campaign
is about mobilizing people.
<P>
State Rep. Monique Davis promised to hold regular town meetings.
She was endorsed by former Rep. Gus Savage, whom Reynolds defeated
in 1992. Savage's 12-year career in the House was riddled with
charges of absenteeism, blatant incomplete campaign finance disclosure
statements, nepotism, sexual harassment and bigotry against whites
generally and Jews specifically.
<P>
No Republican has won the seat since 1950.
<P>
The 2nd Congressional District includes much of Chicago's old
South Side industrial area plus many suburbs to the south. About
two-thirds of its people live in Chicago, in widely separated
neighborhoods. Two-thirds of the district's voters are black,
and most are middle-class.

<LI>Rep. Bill Jefferson (D-La.) quit the Louisiana governor's
race Sept. 19 and threw his support to fellow Rep. Cleo Fields
(D-La.) In return, Fields pledged to support Jefferson in next
year's open Senate race to succeed retiring Sen. Bennett Johnston
(D).
<P>
Jefferson's decision was seen as a big step toward solidifying
the state's black vote-about 28 percent of Louisiana's registered
voters-and thereby increase the chances of a black candidate making
the gubernatorial runoff.
<P>
The field for the Oct. 21 governor's election drops to 16 candidates,
all of whom appear on the same ballot, regardless of party. Should
no candidate win a majority, there will be a Nov. 18 runoff between
the two top finishers. What will be the effect of Jefferson's
pullout? Here's a look at the most
 recent poll of the governor's race:
<P><PRE>
 Ex. Gov. Buddy Roemer 		(R)	33%
 Treasurer Mary Landrieu 	(D)	13%
 Lt. Gov. Melinda Schwegmann 	(D)	12%
 Rep. Cleo Fields 		(D)	8%
 State Sen. Mike Foster 	(R)	6%	
 Rep. Bill Jefferson 		(D)	5%
 Undecided/Other			23%

<p><a name="general"></a><br><p>
<a href="#table">Table of Contents</a><p>
<ul><li>	General Colin Powell is clearly in the throes of a media lovefest regarding his potential presidential candidacy.  His autobiography, My American Journey, was released Sept. 15 with an initial print run of 800,000 copies.  It is expected to shoot to the top of the bestsellers' lists almost immediately.
	<P>About 3,000 fans jammed into a large bookstore and lined up for blocks as Powell launched his book-promotion tour in McLean, Va., a wealthy Washington, D.C. suburb, by appearing to sign his autobiography.
	<P>In a new CNN/Time poll released Sept. 15, 53 percent said they wanted to see Powell run for president.  He ran ahead of President Clinton in a two-way match up and was in a statistical dead heat with Clinton in a hypothetical Dole-Clinton-Powell race.
	<P>An in-depth profile/interview with Barbara Walters on ABC's "20/20" aired the same day the poll was released.  Other television interviews with the major networks will follow.  Powell has been on the cover of Time, Newsweek and U.S. News & World Report in the last few weeks.  And, as he embarks on his multi-city book tour that runs through October, the media hype will continue.
	<P>But don't expect it to last.  Remember 1992 and Ross Perot's budding presidential bid?  Perot's potential candidacy was touted as the second coming--until he actually got into the race.  In particular, the poll showing Powell would best both Clinton and Dole is eerily reminiscent of a similar poll in 1992 showing Perot leading both Clinton and then President Bush.  Then the negative media barrage ensued with charges of "inspector Perot" and innuendos that the Texas businessman's elevator didn't go all the way to the top.  <P>
	Granted, Perot didn't help his cause with his on-again/off-again campaign.  But the media frenzy damaged his reputation, perhaps irreparably.
	<P>We did learn a few things about Powell that we didn't know, however, from the Walters interview.  For starters, Powell appears to be comfortable with the economic conservatives of the Republican Party, but not quite as comfortable with some of the more strident social conservatives.  Although, in the rush to judgment, his positions on the issues have already been mischaracterized by some conservatives and members of the press, Powell appears to be:
<ul><LI>Pro-choice, but not pro-abortion;
<li>Against quotas and racial preferences, but favors reaching out to economically and socially disadvantaged individuals, regardless of race;
<LI>Solidly for 2nd Amendment rights of gun ownership, but willing to be slightly incon-venienced with registration and/or waiting periods;
<LI>Supportive of a private moment in school for prayer at the students' choosing, but would not support mandatory school prayer; and
<LI>Uncomfortable with the Clinton administration's vacillations on foreign policy issues.
</ul>	<P>Powell has a commanding presidential presence.  He dwarfs the other candidates, both in terms of his life's achievements and the charisma he possesses.  
	<P>At least one of the other GOP presidential candidates has commented on Powell's chances to get the party nomination.  "Despite the political yearnings of pro-abortion Republicans and much of the national news media, retired Army Gen. Colin Powell has not a prayer of winning the GOP nomination," Alan Keyes told USA Today in an interview.  
	<P>Keyes concluded that Powell has a "good background and he's accomplished a lot in his life, but he doesn't seem to have thought through the public policy issues.  Being a good man and being a good president are not necessarily the same thing."
<p>	But it is likely, if Keyes had his druthers, he'd prefer to have poll numbers like Powell, than the 1 to 2 percent national support which the two-time U.S. Senate candidate currently garners.
	<P>Nevertheless, Powell should think long and hard before entering the race.  The media, in their rush to make mere mortals of men, have so tarnished the character of our political leaders that we have few, if any, heroes remaining--living or dead.  The former Chairman of the Joint Chiefs of Staff, with his reputation intact on the sidelines, may serve as much of a purpose for Americans as he would after being sullied by the whole campaign process.
<P>

<LI>  Advisers to the Rev. Jesse Jackson disclosed recently that he has submitted his name to be included as a presidential candidate in a nonbinding urban presidential primary called City Vote, to be held in November, according to a report in the Wall Street Journal.
	<P>Jackson is contemplating a challenge to President Clinton from within the Democratic Party, but is giving more serious thought to running as an independent.  City Vote is a privately financed effort to give greater prominence to the urban issues Jackson advocates by allowing voters in some 20 cities to cast a nonbinding vote for presidential preference at the time they vote in local elections this November.
	<P>Jackson's aides said he is putting his name on the City Vote ballot both to raise the profile of urban problems and as a way to keep his personal political options open.
	<P>The head of the National Rainbow Coalition announced Sept. 9 that he had raised the $150,000 he owed the FEC from his 1988 presidential campaign, removing one of the obstacles to a potential return to the presidential trail next year.  Had he not paid the settlement, Jackson would not be eligible to receive federal matching campaign funds in future races.
<P>	"All options are alive," said Jackson at a press conference.  He outlined three possible political courses of action for himself in 1996--to stay out of the race, to challenge Clinton in the Democratic primaries or to run as an independent.  
	<P>He noted, however, that he second option was "remote" and that he would wait until the spring to decide on an independent run.  Jackson said that part of his decision would be based on whether Clinton "embraces an activist agenda" for urban development, education and health, as well as enforcement of affirmative action laws.

<a href="#table">Table of Contents</a><p>
<Li>   Efforts by the Georgia legislature to redraw the state's congressional district map collapsed Sept. 12, leaving the task to a three-judge federal panel.
	After overwhelmingly rejecting two proposed compromise redistricting plans during that week, both houses of the General Assembly voted to adjourn, following a five-week special session that cost the taxpayers at least $500,000.  "I hate to admit failure, but I don't know anything else to do," state House Speaker Tom Murphy, a Democrat, was quoted as saying by the Associated Press.  And state House Reapportionment Committee Chairman Tommy Smith said earlier, "I see absolutely no hope of the conferees passing any plan out on this congressional exercise."
	<P>The special session was called Aug. 14 after the U.S. Supreme Court in late June ruled that the majority-black 11th District of Democratic Rep. Cynthia McKinney was unconstitutional.
	<P>The justices said the legislature had relied too heavily on race in creating the seat following the 1990 census.  The 11th District stretches 250 miles from Savannah to Atlanta in an effort to pick up black voters.
<P>	But, during the special session, the legislature found itself badly split among competing demands from white Democrats, black Democrats and Republicans.
	<P>The black Democrats wanted to retain at least two of the state's current three majority-black House districts.  The Republicans, who now control the other eight districts in the state, feared dilution of their numbers.
	<P>The latest compromise plan, rejected Sept. 11 by a 122-22 vote in the state House and 44-8 in the state Senate, would have left Democratic Rep. John Lewis as the only one of the state's three black incumbents with a majority-black district.
<P>	Republicans disliked the plan because it would have placed House Speaker Gingrich and GOP Rep. Bob Barr in the same Atlanta-area district.  And black legislators objected because it failed to keep McKinney's district from intruding on the 5th District represented by Democratic Rep. John Lewis, and because it removed a key part of the majority-black district of Democratic Rep. Sanford Bishop.
	<P>The new congressional map will now be drawn by the same three-judge federal panel that originally threw out the 11th District.
<P>
   
<a name="welfare"></a><br>
<P>
<a href="#table">Table of Contents</a><P>
<LI>The prospects for ending welfare as we know it were dashed with the caving in of moderate Senate Republicans, joining with liberal Democrats, to fundamental changes in the current system.  Nearly everyone agrees that the welfare system has been a disaster.  
	<P>It has been particularly devastating for black communities throughout the U.S.  As late as 1958, 78 percent of black children were living with two-parent families.  That figure is now at 45 percent--and falling.  But the reverberations of the disastrous welfare system can be felt throughout virtually every segment of society.
	<P>The two most important aspects of welfare reform--denying additional benefits to women who have more children while on the welfare rolls and denying cash benefits to teen-agers who have children out of wedlock--should have been easy to implement.  Any idiot can see that if you pay women to have children without marrying and you set up house for teen-agers who have already shown that they are irresponsible and pay them to continue to make the same mistakes, you'll end up with what we've got right now.  After all, do women who are married and work receive a raise every time they have a baby?  And, if people are paid to have babies, why is anyone surprised when they do?<P>
	<P>But the battle was actually lost in the spring when the debate on welfare shifted from making parents responsible for their children to punishing children for their parents' mistakes.  Once the liberals took the latter argument and ran with it, moderates caved.  Although versions of those elements remain in the version passed March 24 by the House, which has generally been far more conservative in its approach to welfare, senior administration officials have made clear that the President would veto the House measure.
<P>	The Senate bill seeks to save $70 billion in welfare spending over seven years and, by the year 2000, would require that 50 percent of parents receiving welfare work for their benefits.  It would also impose a five-year limit on drawing welfare benefits, although states could offer hardship exemptions to a limited pool of recipients.  
	<P>These are good first steps, but they miss the point.  Welfare should not be an entitlement, but a contract between the recipient and his or her country that, in exchange for assistance during hard times, he or she will do the following: 1) Work and/or attend school; 2) Change irresponsible behavior; 3) Vow to make better decisions in the future.
	<P>The President and others will, however, claim victory for reforming the welfare system.  The Republicans have extolled the concept of block granting the welfare payments to the states in the form of lump sums.  This will allow the states more flexibility to see what works and what doesn't.  
	<P>But, politicians have a tendency, when given lump sum payments, to transfer those sums to areas where the politically powerful have exerted pressure.  And, with a lack of vision as to the principles upon which we would like our national welfare system administered, we'll end up with 50 different hybrids.
	<P>Five years from now, we'll look back on this period and say, "We should have done something in 1995.  The problem has gotten worse."

   In a speech some hailed as courageous and others said was classic Clinton, the President said July 19 that race
and gender preferences are fair, and have lived up to their purpose of removing obstacles blocking opportunities for
minorities and women. He issued a directive to federal departments and a 100-page report advocating reforms to
ensure that programs benefit those who need help the most.<p>
     The President ordered the elimination or overhaul of any program that "creates a quota, creates preferences
for unqualified individuals, creates reverse discrimination or continues even after its equal opportunity purposes
have been achieved."<P>
     Clinton also called for a new federal set-aside program to target federal contracts to businesses in poor
areas even if they are owned by whites.  Currently, set-asides are reserved for women and minorities.<P>
     The president's remarks cheered leaders of women's groups and minorities, who are an instrumental part
of his political base.  Myrlie Evers-Williams, head of the NAACP, praised Clinton for "his bold, decisive
statement."<P>
     But Rep. Gary Franks, a black Republican from Connecticut, said Clinton's proposals could only add to
"the stigma of any person of color" who must repeatedly proved his or her qualifications. Franks sought,
unsuccessfully, to attach an amendment to a defense spending bill that would wipe out race-and gender-based
preferences for future federal contracts.  The House delayed consideration of the FY96 defense appropriations
measure until after the August recess and, thus, scuttled Franks' amendment in the process.<P>
     In sharp attack at the House leadership, Franks said House Speaker Newt Gingrich (R-Ga.) And others
indicated they supported his proposal and would back his effort to attach the measure to the defense spending bill. 
Instead, the Rules Committee did not even vote on whether to grant Franks a waiver.  It approved by unanimous
voice vote a rule government floor debate under which Franks' proposal could be easily killed.<P>
     "I was lied to for seven weeks," Franks said in a telephone interview with the Associated Press, adding that
it left "a bitter taste in [his] mouth."  According to Franks, House leaders lost their nerve after members of the
Congressional Black Caucus threatened to use parliamentary tactics to tie up the House to block the Franks
amendment.<P>
     Gingrich has been criticized within his party recently for saying the GOP should go a bit slower on the
affirmative action front until the party has a positive agenda to promote to potential black voters.  The House
Speaker is wise in this regard and is on the right track, despite what some conservatives say.<P>  
     Since the party does not have a record of defending civil rights in the recent past, it lacks the moral
authority at this time to simply do away with those measures which have offered some protections to minorities and
women.  The GOP must present an alternative approach.  Simply saying society should now be color-blind, when it
is clearly not, is either naive or cynical.<P>
     Along with Gingrich, presidential candidate Lamar Alexander has perhaps made the most sensible
suggestion regarding the GOP's approach to affirmative action.  "We need to be talking about equal opportunity,"
he said on CNN's "Inside Politics" program on Aug. 2.  "When we talk about racial preferences, we need to also say
we're against racial discrimination.  We have to be very careful concerning this issue," he added.<P>
     Alexander is right.  Affirmative action is a delicate, emotionally charged issue and all politicians would do
well to handle it in a thoughtful manner.<p>
<a name="democratic"></a><hr>
<a href="#quick">(Back to QuickLinks)</a><p>

   The Democratic Party has targeted two Congressional seats currently held by black Republicans for defeat in
1996.  Republican Rep. Gary Franks of Connecticut and Rep. J.C. Watts of Oklahoma were both listed in a directive
called "Majority  96," in which the Democrats indicated the seats by state they'd like to regain in order to have a
majority in the U.S. House and Senate.<P>
     The directive says Franks "won with only 52% of the vote in 1994.  Bush won the district, but it can be
easily claimed by the Democrats in 1996."<P>
     Regarding Watts, the edict described him as the freshman who "won seat vacated by Dave McCurdy with a
low 51% of the vote" (actually, Watts received 52%).  "This charismatic quarterback led the Oklahoma University
Sooners in the early  80s and won over his Democratic district in 1994," the document continued.  "While
consistently a Democratic area, the district nevertheless favored Bush by 9 points in 1992."<P>
     Other districts targeted included the 9th District of Texas, currently represented by Steve Stockman; the
22nd District of California, represented by freshman Andrea Seastrand who narrowly won Michael Huffington's
open seat with 49% of the vote; and the 1st District of Idaho, represented by Helen Chenoweth.<p>

<a name="memo"></a><hr>
<a href="#quick">(Back to QuickLinks)</a><p>
Democrats often accuse Republicans of playing the race card, but an internal memo sent to President Clinton
from his pollster, Stanley Greenberg, demonstrates that while Democrats claim to be "color-blind" in public, they
play racial politics behind the scenes.<P>
     The memo, dated July 5, 1995, is addressed to the Clintons and Gores, White House Chief of Staff Leon
Panetta, Deputy Chiefs of Staff Harold Ickes and Erskine Bowles, and the President's Senior Advisor George
Stephanopoulos.  The contents were revealed in a CNN "Inside Politics" broadcast in August.<P>
     "The President is fundamentally mispositioned for 1996, and. . .white downscale voters question whether
Mr. Clinton's initiatives matter to them and whether he understands and identifies with their lives and daily
struggles," said Greenberg's memo.  The memo cites specific groups the President needs to win over or win back
next year: White working class women, union members, older working class men and rural Latinos."<p>

   A principal operative for the Alan Keyes presidential campaign has resigned and signed on with Pat Buchanan's
campaign team.<P>
     Arthur Rocker, former finance director for candidate Keyes, agreed to join Buchanan as a national co-chairman, he said in an interview.  Rocker officially accepted the position Aug. 8.<P>
     Rocker recruited Keyes to run for president last fall and played a major role in the formation of the
exploratory committee.  After helping Keyes raise more than $300,000 during the first six months of the year,
Rocker left the campaign, saying, "I'm disgusted with his [Keyes'] organizational skills and question his leadership
ability."<P>
     For its part, the Keyes campaign said Rocker had been the source of "still-unresolved discrepancies in the
finances" of the exploratory committee.  However, the Keyes organization is the only one among the Republican
presidential candidates which has failed to file a Federal Elections Commission financial disclosure report or
requested an extension.  Keyes says he was "too busy to do it," according to a Baltimore Sun report.<P>
     The fundraising specialist said that, as a Buchanan operative, he would do whatever was asked of him.  "I
admire Buchanan's commitment to conservative values.  He's been consistent in his positions over the years," said
Rocker.<p>

   House Speaker Newt Gingrich dropped into unfamiliar surroundings the evening of Aug. 2 as he listened for
more than an hour to residents of Washington asking--and sometimes begging--him to help their city out of its
morass of problems.<P>
     Billed as a discussion in town-meeting style, as part of the House Republicans' effort to find solutions to
decades of urban ills, it quickly became something much more.  Nearly 1,000 people attended the forum and
hundreds more were unable to get into the packed high school auditorium.  This meeting was the first of several the
speaker has planned to address the city's budget crisis and deteriorating public schools.<P>
     But this may have been part of the problem.  There was an obvious mood filled with unrealistic
expectations as audience participants asked the speaker questions as varied as how to get parents more involved
with their children's educational process to how to get rid of the current school superintendent.<P>
     Gingrich was booed when introduced, but the questioners were, for the most part, respectful.<P>
     Sharing the stage with top local Democrats--Mayor Marion Barry and congressional delegate Eleanor
Holmes Norton, plus Jesse Jackson--Gingrich acknowledged the improbable grouping.<P>
     He joked that months ago, the odds that he and Barry would be on the same platform and working together
were "probably as good as some folks would have given against my being speaker or (Barry) being mayor again."<P>
     Both Barry and Jackson sat in silence as Gingrich spoke.<P>
     Even though the previous Speaker, Thomas S. Foley, a Democrat, lived on Capitol Hill during his final
years in office, he never engaged city residents in the style that Gingrich did.  The gathering is supposed to be the
first such session for Gingrich, who has said he will attend them.<P>
     "Tonight is a beginning," Gingrich told a woman who asked about the quality of Washington's public
schools now and in the future.  "I can't assure you that as a group we'll make a big difference.  I can't give you a
date or even guarantee that it will happen.  But we will reach out and do everything we can to improve resources
and safety to have a healthy Washington."<P>
     Barry, the popular four-term mayor who managed a comeback after leaving office in disgrace because of a
cocaine conviction, said he and Gingrich were putting political differences aside to collaborate on making
Washington "the finest capital anywhere in the world."<P>
     Team play was the evening's official theme and Norton warmly credited Gingrich with garnering some
$200 million in federal highway funds for city road repairs.  Norton, who has tried hard to insure that city residents
are not excluded from the exchange of ideas for saving their city, was largely responsible for the speaker's
appearance.<P>
     In the face of periodic insults, Gingrich stood at the lectern taking copious notes, nodding in agreement and
responding only occasionally to questions asked.  He won applause when he promised residents "significant" tax
relief and world-class schools.<P>
     "We do not have the right to micromanage the lives of the people who live in this city," he assured the
attendees.  Congress earlier this year established a federal board to control the city's finances.<P>
     In August, the speaker's task force on the D.C. economy recommended a federal income tax credit and
other tax breaks--totaling between $1.3 billion and $2.7 billion--to attract and keep residents and businesses in the
city.<P>
     Gingrich and Wisconsin Rep. Steve Gunderson also unveiled a plan to raise private-sector funds for
equipment, maintenance and repairs in the public schools, which opened nearly a week late last September because
of thousands of fire code violations.<P>
     A second fund-raising drive would establish a scholarship fund for low-income families who would prefer
to send their children to private schools, said Gunderson, leader of the House Republicans' task force on D.C.
schools.<P>
     Later that day, at a brief news conference, he pronounced the meeting a success.
     "What surprised me the most, and pleased me the most," he said, "was the calm intensity" of people in the
audience.  "Here were people who were frustrated, who felt Congress had dealt with them unfairly in the past.  But
they were back one more time."<P>

Shaken by Supreme Court decisions they consider hostile,
civil rights activists spelled out a strategy June 30 for
fighting back.  A main goal: Energizing jaded masses of black
people to act in what civil rights leaders say is their own
interest.
<p>     
The NAACP is staging a "national voter empowerment campaign"
that seeks to mobilize black constituents in political districts
where they comprise at least 15 percent of eligible voters but
less than a majority.
<p>     
The effort, approved in advance, is the first grassroots
response to Thursday's Supreme Court decision that using race as
an overriding concern when drawing minority districts is
unconstitutional.
<p>     
"We have to turn this pain around," said NAACP lobbyist Ed
Hailes Jr.  "Our participation in democracy is being denied."  
<p>
     
The Supreme Court's ruling was the latest in a series by the
high court this year that black activists say have chipped away
at the hard-won gains of the 1960s civil rights movement.
<p>       
Earlier, the court also jeopardized many federal affirmative
action programs by saying Congress must abide by the same strict
anti-bias standards as state and local governments.  And the
justices made it easier for school systems to get out from under
federal supervision of school desegregation.
<p>     
"I can assure you, we won't go back," said Rep. Eddie
Bernice Johnson, a Democrat whose Texas district is under
challenge.  "We know how to vote.  And we will vote.  We do it
best when we have a reason to."
<p>     
As the redistricting decision came down, the National Urban
League canceled plans to hold its 1996 convention in Los Angeles. 
It is protesting California Gov. Pete Wilson's executive order
ending state affirmative action programs.
<p>     
The league, alarmed by the high court's affirmative action
decision, has made protecting such programs its rallying cry.  By
canceling the conference--and the revenue it would have generated
for the area--the league hopes to discourage other states from
following Wilson's lead, particularly in light of the court's
decision.
<p>     
"We're not going to just express our dismay.  We're going to
do something about it," said league president Hugh B. Price.
<p>     
The NAACP campaign, set to begin in mid-July, targets
congressional seats, mostly in Southern states where majority
black districts are in peril.  Black Democrats are being asked to
lobby their representatives and state legislators about
redistricting, Supreme Court appointments and endorsements in the
1996 presidential election.
<p>    
 According to the NAACP Legal Defense and Educational Fund,
12 million blacks live in 113 majority-white congressional
districts in 11 Southern states.  And they've pumped up their
rhetoric too. 
<p>     
"With that kind of concentration and ratio of voters, we can
have great influence," said Washington NAACP director Wade
Henderson, coordinator of the campaign.  "It's open season on
black Americans.  We've got to start rewarding our friends and
punishing our enemies."
<p>     
The program will act in concert with efforts by the
Congressional Black Caucus and civil rights groups to add up to 7
million blacks to voting rolls.  The caucus' campaign is an
"immediate response" to the Supreme Court's decision, said Rep.
Kweisi Mfume (D-Md.).
<p>     
The goal is to "register every unregistered person in this
country, state by state, district by district, neighborhood by
neighborhood," Mfume said.  "In no way should those persons on
the other side of this (Supreme Court) decision think they have a
safe haven."
<p>     
In addition to registering voters, the caucus is working
with Democratic Party officials to ensure that black Democratic
incumbents will have their party's backing.
<p>     
"We will fight so that justice will reign in this country in
spite of the Supreme Court," said Rep. Donald Payne, (D-N.J.),
chairman of the caucus.
<p>     
But blacks who share a more conservative view say they also
have something to prove.  If conservatives say blacks can get
elected without the benefit of specially-carved out seats, they
must demonstrate this can, in fact, become a reality by getting
more mainstream minority candidates elected in 1996.  Thus, the
crucial work to be to recruit attractive conservative candidates
to run between now and then, probably as Republicans, but not
necessarily exclusively.

<a name="Fletcher"></a>
<a href="#quick">(Back to QuickLinks)</a><p>
Arthur Fletcher, a Republican member of the U.S. Civil Rights
Commission, joined the 1996 presidential race July 7 urging his
party not to abandon minorities and the working class.  He is the
second black candidate to enter the race for the GOP nomination.
<p>
Fletcher, a strong advocate of affirmative action, said, "My
party has designed a top-down strategy, which says the wealthy,
the rich, the affluent belong to this party.  Anybody that
doesn't earn $35,000 a year is out of the equation."
<p>     
"It's time to stop that and say there's room for anybody who
wants to participate in the Republican Party."
<p>     
He announced his candidacy at a news conference in the
economically depressed Anacostia area of Washington.
Fletcher, who is black, has been promoting affirmative action
programs since the Nixon administration when he was a Labor
Department official.  Since then, three Republican presidents--Ford, Reagan and Bush--have appointed him to the U.S. Commission
of Civil Rights, which he chaired from 1990 to 1993.  He is 70
years old.
<p>     
He opined that GOP presidential candidates already in the
race must pander to the right wing in ways that threaten gains
made in civil rights since the 1960s.
<p>     
"There's not a ghost of a chance of their being nominated. 
Unless they engage in the race-baiting, gender-bashing tactics of
the moment," Fletcher said.
<p>     
"My concern, more than anything else, is to see to it that
the party doesn't completely end up abandoning the middle, where
the majority of the voters live, in pursuit of the nomination,"
he added.
<p>     
Fletcher first entered Republican politics in Kansas and was
vice chairman of the state GOP from 1955-57.
<p>     
In 1969, while working in Nixon's Labor Department, he
helped implement the "revised Philadelphia plan" that set and
enforced equal opportunity employment standards for companies
with federal contracts.
<p>     
He said he would finance his campaign largely by appealing
to minorities and women to send $5 contributions to his
headquarters in Kansas City, KS.
<p>     
His slogan: "Send five and keep affirmative action alive." 
With that money, Fletcher said he intends to lease a bus to
recreate the "Freedom Rides" of the 1960s to get his message out.
<p>     
"I will not be a high-flying, expensive candidate.  I'm
going to make sure the small people know I am their candidate,"
Fletcher said. 
<p>     
The former commissioner will likely have a tough time
getting press coverage and support from his fellow Republicans. 
The constituency for Fletcher's pet issues is so small within the
GOP that his candidacy is merely symbolic, at best.

A new think tank recently opened in the nation's capitol to
promote self-help initiatives among black Americans.  The Center
for New Black Leadership commenced operation in Washington, D.C.
on May 1, 1995.  The Center is a nonprofit, nonpartisan think
tank devoted to reviving and encouraging traditionally effective
solutions to social and economic problems confronting the black
community.  The Center will work to encourage the development of
sound ideas and institutions consistent with the black
community's long-held commitments to individual initiative and
personal responsibility.
<p>     
The leadership of the Center consists of Directors Peter
Bell of TCF Financial Corp. in Minneapolis; Glenn Loury of Boston
University; Roy Innis of the Congress for Racial Equality;
Phyllis Berry Myers of Black America's PAC; and Shelby Steele of
the Hoover Institution.  The President of the Center is Brian W.
Jones.
<p>     
Jones is hopeful that the Center's work will perform a
function complementary to the work of the many conservative
grassroots and political organizations laboring in the black
community.  "Our goal," says Jones, "is to provide an
intellectual framework for the work of these other organizations. 
By providing a thoughtful defense of conservative ideas in the
black community, we can ensure the long-term viability of the
essential grassroots efforts already under way."
<p>    
Inquiries about the Center for New Black Leadership should
be directed to Brian W. Jones at 733 15th Street, N.W., Suite
700, Washington, D.C. 20005.  The Center's telephone number is
(202) 638-0651.

Congress can fight racial discrimination in the construction
industry and save billions of tax dollars by repealing the Davis-Bacon Act, according to a Heritage Foundation analyst.
<p>
"This Depression-era law protects racial discrimination in
the construction industry, needlessly costs taxpayers billions of
dollars each year, stifles productivity, and subsidizes special
interests," says Mark Wilson, Heritage's Rebecca Lukens fellow in
labor policy.
<p>     
The 1931 law requires contractors working on federally
funded construction projects to pay workers "prevailing wages"
that are defined by the U.S. Department of Labor.  Through Davis-Bacon, the Labor Department also imposes costly and inflexible
job classification and apprenticeship regulations on contractors
seeking federal construction projects.
<p>     
"Ever since its adoption, Davis-Bacon has led to
discrimination against minorities in the construction industry,"
Wilson says.  The law has thus protected unions against
competition from outside non-unionized contractors using lower-cost itinerant labor, typically black workers from the South and
immigrants," says the former Labor Department economist.
<p>     
The result: Despite three decades of federally required
reverse discrimination and minority set-asides, black workers
still make up only 6.4 percent of the workers in the construction
industry.  By comparison, blacks make up 10.4 percent of the
total workforce.
<p>     
Black-owned firms are also kept out of federal construction
projects by Davis-Bacon, Wilson says.  "Few minority-owned firms
win Davis-Bacon contracts, and many give up trying because they
are less able to pay Davis-Bacon prevailing wage rates," he says.
<p>
Citing Congressional Budget Office estimates, Wilson says
Davis-Bacon costs taxpayers as much as $5.3 billion annually by
inflating labor costs on federally financed building projects. 
In Oakland, Calif., for example, carpenters are paid $28 per hour
on federally funded projects, compared to $15 per hour in that
city's private sector, Wilson says.
<p>     
Davis-Bacon repeal would also "free up an estimated 5
million labor hours per year that contractors now must spend
completing weekly payroll requirements that Labor Department
bureaucrats admit they ignore," Wilson says.  The cost of this
needless federal paperwork is passed on to taxpayers by the
contractor, he says.
<p>     
The only groups supporting Davis-Bacon are "building and
construction trade unions and their allies in Congress and the
Clinton administration," Wilson says.  "But Congress should be
looking out for the interests of taxpayers and all workers, not
just those who gain from the restrictive law," he says.

Some black Republican leaders want a hand in writing their party's 1996
platform, and one suggested May 19 he's prepared to demonstrate at the
national convention to make his point.<p>
     	
Leaders of the National Black Republican Empowerment Task Force, which met in Washington to write its own version of a platform, also took issue with GOP lawmakers over affirmative action and the budget.<p>
     	
"We need to be sitting at the table when the decisions are made and when
the pie is cut," said task force co-chairman Maurice Dawkins, who also is chairman of the Florida Republican Black Caucus.  "We'll get there, even if we have to demonstrate outside the convention hall" when the Republican National Convention meets in San Diego, he said.<p>
     
Maintaining affirmative action programs and business set-aside for minorities will be priorities in the
blacks' platform, said Dawkins, declining to outline specifics.<p>
     
The task force, not an official party organization, is comprised of some 30 state and local party officials, many of them veterans of the Nixon administration.  This group differs markedly from that of many of today's younger, more conservative Republicans who emphasize self-reliance and
entrepreneurship, and shun affirmative action programs.<p>
     
Haley Barbour, chairman of the Republican National Committee, has promised blacks a voice in platform discussions.  But the task force's hopes on affirmative action are not echoed by the GOP's congressional leaders.<p>
     
Senate Majority Leader Bob Dole, a presidential hopeful, already has asked Senate committees to schedule hearings on affirmative action.  Another GOP candidate, Texas Sen. Phil Gramm, has
pledged, if elected, to issue an executive order ending federal hiring and contract preferences based solely on race or gender.<p>
     
"A lot of people are misled in terms of what affirmative action means," said James L. Denson, a task force member who is a New Orleans businessman.<p>
     
"We all are opposed to quotas, as such, but we're not opposed to the results of an affirmative-type program," he said.<p>
     
On the budget, Denson criticized GOP proposals to eliminate the Small Business Administration.<p>
    
"They think the SBA only helps women and minorities, but if they did their homework...they'd find that small business is the backbone of the economy," he said.<p>
     
Presidential candidate Alan Keyes and Oklahoma Rep. J.C. Watts, both of whom are black, participated in discussions on the black empowerment platform.  Dole and Indiana Sen. Richard Lugar, another presidential hopeful, sent staff members.<p>

The task force hopes to meet personally with each of the would-be presidents before submitting its
recommendations to the RNC platform committee, Dawkins said.<p>

Dawkins, a Washington-area lobbyist, opposed Democrat Charles Robb in Virginia's 1988 Senate race, but lost with 29 percent of the vote.<p>

Benjamin Chavis has fashioned a new civil rights organization from the hodgepodge of grassroots groups that participated in the "unity" summits he convened after being fired from the NAACP.<p>
     
The National African-American Leadership Summit (NAALS) has been created in response to "an eagerness" to formalize the summit meetings, Chavis said.  It plans to draw members from those outside mainstream civil rights groups.<p>
     
"I'm not trying to pull the rug out from under another organization.  I'm just saying the black community is out there in need of mobilization," Chavis said.  "We need to connect these grassroots brothers and sisters who have not been touched by these other organizations."<p>
     
The new group provides Chavis with a high-profile platform for his quasi-nationalist agenda, something he has lacked since the NAACP fired him last August for using NAACP money to
settle a sex discrimination claim without telling the board of directors.<p>
     
One of the new group's first objectives is to mobilize black men for a Million Man March on Washington,
to be held Oct. 16.  It also plans to focus on fighting to preserve affirmative action programs, black economic and political empowerment and federal aid to Africa--all elements of Chavis'
NAACP agenda.<p>
     
NAALS convened at Texas Southern University in Houston on June 9-11 to approve a constitution and
bylaws and establish rules for membership, said Chavis, who is the group's national spokesman.  It was the first summit at which the new group will operate as an official entity.<p>
     
At the Houston meeting, Chavis stressed the need for self-sufficiency, and vowed that the NAALS would not just talk the talk, but would walk the walk.<p>
     
"The summit will be economically dependent upon support from the African-American community, almost exclusively," Chavis said.<p>
     
Chavis originally said he wouldn't create another organization to continue the work he stared at the NAACP.  But he steadily took steps in that direction by convening two informal summits, one in
Baltimore the day after his firing and the other in Chicago last December.  After losing his status in such a high-profile position, it is not surprising that Chavis would try to stay in the public eye.<p>
     
"I am not at the same place I was last year on that question, obviously," Chavis said.  "There has been evolving enthusiasm and support.  I now believe that NAALS needs to be a permanent organization."<p>
     
The new group is emerging at a time of severe weakness at the National Association of the Advancement of Colored People.   The NAACP is $3.8 million in debt and is struggling to hang onto its
corporate donors.  It also is hobbled by a split between its 86-year-old integrationist mission and younger potential members who are drawn to black nationalism.<p>

<hr><a name="affirmative"></a>
<a href="#quick">(Back to QuickLinks)</a><p>

While vowing to battle GOP attempts to gut affirmative action policies, Rep. Kweisi Mfume (D-Md.) also warned June 5 that White House efforts to date on the contentious issue have left black members
of Congress concerned, and suggested that uneasiness could erode much of President Clinton's base heading into the  96 presidential campaign.<p>
     
"The pres-ident runs the risk of per-manently los-ing large seg-ments of his
base," Mfume contended at a press con-ference.  He said he tele-phoned the White House and told senior Clinton adviser George Stephanopoulos that CBC members "believe that we need bold
presidential leadership.  And bold presidential leadership is not a polite tap on the shoulder."<p>
     
Mfume, formerly head of the Congressional Black Caucus, now heads a caucus task force on affirmative action.  He referred to a recent New York Times story that said the White House is drafting
an affirmative action policy that, as Mfume phrased it, would put minority contracting jobs up for review as "some sort of sacrificial first step."  Mfume also said he expressed alarm that the White House has not consulted CBC members, despite the group's persistent requests for dialogue.  However, Mfume said Stephanopoulos told him White House officials will meet with CBC members to brief them on the administration's preliminary policy outline.<p>
     
But Clinton's foot-dragging may be part of a broader strategy to ease the fears of many white male constituents the Democrats lost in the 1994 elections.  A Clinton administration official said there might be some political benefit if black business executives criticized the administration's 
eventual proposals.<p>
     
"We want black businessmen to scream enough to let angry white males understand that we've done something for them," said the official, who made his comments to a New York Times reporter on the condition that he not be named.<p>
     
Mfume said the caucus also is prepared to fight GOP attempts to revise or repeal affirmative action programs, including a proposal by Rep. Charles Canady (R-Fl.), who is circulating a "Dear Colleague" letter to gather support for his "Civil Rights Act of 1995."<p>
     
Canady's bill, which was introduced in mid-June, would repeal all federal laws and programs that give preferences to racial minorities and women.  In a recent report prepared for Senate Majority
Leader Dole, the Congressional Research Service determined there are 160 such affirmative action programs.<p>
     
Canady's bill also would prohibit preferences for federal contracting jobs.<p>
     
In his "Dear Colleague," which he began circulating a few weeks ago, Canady declared:  "Full compensation and redress will still be available to those who prove they are victims of illegal
discrimination.  But there will be no preferring of individuals based on their membership in a group where they themselves have not been actual victims of discrimination."<p>
     
Mfume, who indicated the CBC task force will propose its own alternative legislation, said he and other black members are prepared to negotiate with congressional Republican leaders.<p>
     
Mfume told Republican leaders that CBC members are "prepared to negotiate," but stressed "we will not have policy imposed upon us without any input."<p>
     
He also warned that protests could come in the form of economic boycotts and "demonstrations in the street."<p>

Senator Bob Dole's blistering attack on the entertainment industry is seen by analysts as a carefully planned strategy with four political goals:  Appeal to skeptical GOP conservatives; swipe at Senator Phil Gramm, who has been embarrassed by the revelation that in the 1970s his brother-in-law convinced him to invest $7,500 in an R-rated film; contrast himself with President Clinton, who has long been enamored with Hollywood stars; and identify with an issue that crosses party lines and appeals
to everyday Americans who feel the nation's moral moorings are coming loose.<p>  
     
"A lot of parents don't want their children exposed to this...trash," said GOP strategist Bill Kristol.<p>
     
Clinton strategist James Carville said Dole's strategy smacks of hypocrisy.  "He [Dole] sure is brave with people he doesn't get money from, like Hollywood," said Carville, "but very cowardly with people he does get money from, like the NRA."<p>
     
And Clinton, in his Montana town-meeting June 1 took a veiled swipe at Dole, accusing him of criticizing popular culture but not conservative extremists.  "There are some public officials in our
country who are only too happy to criticize the culture of violence being promoted by the media," said Clinton, "but are stone silent when these other folks are talking and making violence seem 
like it's OK."<p>
     
For the GOP presidential stakes, Dole's speech appeared to complete the process of converting the skepticism of his bid among leaders of the religious right to more enthusiastically consider supporting
him.<p>
     
"In every campaign, there is what Lee Atwater would say was a defining moment," said Christian Coalition executive director Ralph Reed.  "You can make a very strong case that Dole's Hollywood speech is such a defining moment for his candidacy.  He clearly recognizes the importance of the appeal that can be gained by making themes about the culture a centerpiece of his
campaign."<p>

The Supreme Court heard arguments in two cases-one in Georgia and one in Louisiana in which
the configuration of congressional districts designed to elect African-Americans is being
challenged.  Georgia's I 1th congressional district, represented by Rep. Cynthia McKinney (D),
and Louisiana's 4th congressional district, represented by Rep. Gleo Fields (D), were-both
"drawn to concentrate black voters."<p>

Three-judge panels  in both states ruled last t year that the 11 district-drawing state legislators
"had effectively disenfranchised whites." critics of the districts also claim that they isolate black
voters and result in the creation of other districts more likely to elect Republicans.<p>

"At some point, it's a violadon of the US. Constitution to design (political districts) . . . based on
race," said Judge Anthony Kennedy. The districts were drawn specificaily to be "safe" for black
candidates.<p>

Georgia's 11th District stretches 250 miles, "with finger-like hooks scooping up black voters in
Atlanta, Augusta and Savannah" It is 64 percent black. The <i>Monroe (La.) News Star</i>
described Louisiana's 4th District as "a racial seat-belt, slashing diagonally from the state's
northwest corner to the 'waist' where the state line leaves the Mississippi River." It is about 61
percent black.<p>

"It is not an overstatement to say that the Supreme Court's decision in the cases argued today will
likely determine the shape of AmeAcan politics into the 21st century," said National Public
Radio's Nina Totenberg.  For the court's decision in these cases will likely determine the rules for
redistricting all over the country and not just at the federal level, but at the state and local level
too."<p>

An Atlanta Journal editorial also included comments on the Supreme Court's deliberations. "Our
hope is that it will send the case back to the states and require them to redraw lines on a basis
other than race. It should also insist that the Justice Department reaffirrn the original intent of the
Voting Rights Act: Guarantee the right to vote to all, but guarantee a racial outcome to
none."<p>

House Speaker Newt Gingrich is researching a plan that gives District of Columbia residents full
voting representation in Congress as Marylanders. The plan, which still is in the "idea" stage,
would make the District of Columbia Maryland's 9th congressional district for federal voting
purposes only.<p>

District of Columbia residents would vote to elect a "full-fledged" congress member and would
cast votes for Maryland'stwosenators. D.C. would retain its own mayor and council, and would
not vote for governor or any other state offices in Maryland.<p>

"It's a great idea as an interim step to full statehood," said D.C. Mayor Marion Barry (D), on
Gingrich's proposal. But Maryland Republicans oppose the plan because "it would bring an
influx of Dernocrats into the race for U.S. Senate seats."<p>

Maryland GOP Chair Joyce Terhes said, "Our chances of getting a Republican senator would be
almost nil. That's a general concern . . . It's more a question of the mechanics of how to make it
work: That they would participate in congressional elections but not other elections to me just
doesn't make sense."<p>

Registered Democrats outnumber registered Republicans "by more than 10 to 1 in the city, which
has 367,013 voters, 289,353 of whom are Democrat" Maryland House Minority Leader Robert
Kittleman (R): "Our last race for governor was almost a tie, and we might have a chance in the
Senate next time. Hang that noose around our neck and everyone will just give up."<p>

"What the speaker is proposing would take a constitudonal amendment," said D.C. Delegate
Eleanor Holmes Norton through a spokesperson. "What he could do now is return the delegate's
right to vote on the basis of residents of the District of Columbia paying federal income
taxes."<p>

But Gingrich's proposal is just one of several ideas being brandied about on Capitol Hill to give
the District a voice in Congress. Maryland Democrat Senators Barbara Mikulski and Paul
Sarbanes support full statehood for District of Columbia.<p>

In the midst of its review of affirmative action programs, the Clinton administration defended the use of blacks-only scholarships at the University of Maryland.<p>

In a brief filed the first week of May with the Supreme Court, the administration argued in
support of racebased scholarships used to correct previous segregation at the university's College
Park campus.<p>

It did not address the larger issue of using such scholarships to diversify a school if
discrimination had not been proven.<p>

 The administration's action suggests that scholarships similar to the one in question would
survive the sweeping White House review of affirmadve action. Administration officials
caudoned against such speculations, however.<p>

"The Jusdce Department's decision to enter into the University of Maryland case is completely
separate from the internal and ongoing review that the White House is conducdng on affinnadve
action programs," Ginny Terzano, a White House spokeswoman, said May 3.<p>

The brief filed by Solicitor General Drew S. lVays on May I supports the university's appeal of a
decision by the U.S. Court of Appeals for the Fourth Circuit in Richmond, Va.<p>

The court ruled in favor of a Hispanic student who said the university violated his constitutional
rights when it denied him a scholarship limited to black students.<p>

The appeals court said the university had failed to prove the scholarship was necessary to correct
lingering effects of segregation When the lawsuit was filed in 1990, the campus' snzdent body
was 11.2 percent black.<p>

The Clinton administration argued that the court should have presumed the racial disparity was
the result of the campus's long history of segregation. The burden would then be on the student,
Daniel J. Podberesky, to prove otherwise.<p>

The university created the Benjamin Banneker Scholarship Program under pressure from the
federal government, which sought to compel desegregation of the College Park campus.<p>

The campus was limited to whites only by law until the mid-19SOs. Segregadon lingered there
unofficially into the late 1970s.<p>

The  university also had scholarships to attract white students to its traditionally black campuses,
and scholarships open to students of all races.<p>

The campus usually awards at least 20 Banneker scholarships each year, covering fouryears of
tuition, room and board They account for about I percent of the College Park campus' annual
financial aid budget.<p>

 Although former Pennsylvania Governor Robert Casey has bowed out of the 1996 presidendal race, he will "continue to hound" President Clinton and other fellow
Democrats by setting up a group to elect pro-life candidates.<p>

Casey adviser Jeffrey Bell said the ex-governor is establishing a political action committee, a
private foundadon and a lobbying organizadon, "all dedicated to furthering family issues." He
added that the orl anizations are expeckd to receive funding from some of the political donors
who pledged Casey $500,000 for his presidendal race.<p>

The Casey polidcal action committee will help fund the candidacies of federal and state
Democrats who are at odds with the party's pro-choice posidons.<p>

"There's no cessadon in the game plan," said Casey. "It's going to be executed exactly as before,
except instead of being a candidate, I'm going to be pushing all three buttons." Bell noted that
while Republicans have their own organizations for promoting prolife candidates, "pro life
Democrats feel excluded from the party."<p>

<hr><a name="pac"></a>
<a href="#quick">(Back to QuickLinks)</a><p>
 A group of black business executives said May 10 that they were forming a political action committee and hiring a lobbyist to fight efforls to eliminate or modify affirmative action
programs, including those that set aside a percentage of government contracts for
minority-owned companies, according to a report in The New York Times.<p>

"Undl now, the voice of black business has been largdy silent on the twin issues of affirmative
action and minority set asides," said Earl G. Graves, publisher and founder of Black Enterprise
magazine, at a news conference.<p>

Graves, who was joined by other black executives, said that the group was "drawing a line in the
sand" and that there would be "no retreat" on affirmative action. The gnup is made up of the
Black Enterprise 100, the largest blackowned companies in the U.S.<p>

"Until we get to the point in this country where there is truly a level playing field," said Maceo
Sloan, head of the Sloan Financial Group, "where a black business can go to a bank, for example,
and be judged, in terms of loans, on the same basis that the majority businesses in this county are
judged; where we have the same access to capital that they have and where there truly is a level playing field, we will very vigorously oppose the effort that is going on right now to
eliminate all the affirmadve action programs."<p>

Earlier this year, Congress voted to end a tax break for companies that sell television stations and
cable systems to minorities. The program came under intense criticism as a result of a proposed
sale by Viacom Inc., a New Yorkbased media giant, to a group of investors headed by Frank
Washington, a black entrepreneur from California.<p>

Critics of the sale said it was an affirmative action program intended to help minority
millionaires.<p>

But at the news conference the black executdves said that such criticism reflected a double
standard because there are several federal programs, like farm subsidies, that help wealthy
individuals and businesses.<p>

"What about all the thousands of millionaires who are majority business owners, and no one
raises the issue of that being un-American?" Graves said. UWhen we start to do it, all of a
sudden, let's change the rules."<p>

Graves said the 100 largest blackowned companies had combined sales of about $11.7 billion
last year and employed about 47,000 people, indicating that if the group could muster its
financial resources, it could have significant political impact.<p>

The executives said they had not yet solicited all the top black businesses to contribute to the
political action committee, which will be called Mobilizadon for Economic Opportunity. But
Graves said he did not think it would be difficult to persuade them to reach into their
pockets.<p>

Whether you talk about L.A or San Francisco, or Chicago, or Detroit, or Atlanta or New York,
the issues are the same," he said. "It would seem to me we're not going to have a very hard
selling point to push here."<p>

Still, with the Republican-controlled Congress aiming for cuts in the federal deficit and a
balanced budget, all programs including farm subsidies, Medicare and what some call "welfare
for the rich" are on the table and subject to reduction or elimination. This may not be the right
year to lobby for maintaining programs which do not have broad-based support among the  American electorate.

<html><head><title>National Minority Politics - From the Publisher - October 1995</title></head><body><h2>From the Publisher</h2><p><h3>NOVEMBER 1995</h3><p><img src="red-line.gif"><p>	Other than political pundits and political junkies, most Americans have not yet turned their attention to the 1996 presidential race. President Clinton will apparently be the Democratic nominee and has shored up his base during the last few months.
<P>
The re-entry of Ross Perot into the election equation with his newly-formed third party--the Independence Party (the Reform Party in some states where there is a name conflict)-has heartened Democrats because it is perceived that Perot takes more potential votes from the political right than he does the political left.
<P>
In polls taken earlier this year, Clinton was losing to a then unnamed Republican presidential opponent. Now he beats the front-runner among GOP candidates, Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas, by several percentage points. Clinton's opponents usually make the mistake of underestimating his political tenacity and dexterity--at their peril. Remember: Former President George Bush was receiving 90 percent approval ratings a year-and-a-half before the 1992 general election.
<P>
There is an obvious yearning among the electorate for a president with leadership abilities, who inspires and presents a vision for the next millennium. Clinton has described the public mood as that of being in a "funk." Some have compared this description to that of President Carter's "malaise" speech during the year leading up to his re-election defeat. But the state of the public's mood runs much deeper. In many ways, Americans are depressed about their future. Media constantly bombard them with bad news--conflict, controversy and grim statistics.
<P>
The political process, including incessant media frenzies, has resulted in the denigration of nearly every American hero, living or dead. They want to tighten their fiscal belts, but depressed wages often keep them from doing the right thing The two major parties often appear to be more interested in making each other look bad, than explaining to voters exactly what is going on.
<P>
What the existing crop of Republican contenders are faced with is high expectations from a cynical public which has been disillusioned by its political leaders in recent years. Dole, et al, are campaigning in this complex environment and do not appear to making much headway.
<P>
Dole, the only candidate who has a significant amount of support from likely Republican primary voters, does not seem to be generating much enthusiasm. His support, at best, is sot The other candidates are registering in single digits with voters in most polls. The only people who seem to be benefiting from the GOP primary process are political consultants, who get paid to spend a candidate's money until it runs out.
<P>
Enter General Colin Powell. So far, he maintains high name identification and respect among the public, the media hasn't yet bloodied him up with stories about past mistakes, and he has not been forced to be about many of the pressing issues of the day. Some people see him as a savior for what ails America; some are not so sure.
<P>
But it is clear from the current political climate that voters are not going to settle for someone who doesn't make them optimistic about the future, someone they can trust, someone they can be proud to call "Mr. President."

<HEAD><title>Headway - From the Publisher - January 96</title>
<META NAME="GENERATOR" CONTENT="Internet Assistant for Word 1.0Z">
</HEAD>

<BODY>
<h2>From the Publisher</h2><p>
<h3>January 1996</h3>
<p><img src="red-line.gif"><p>      
<P>

<P>
This edition of <I>Headway</I> launches a new beginning for our
publication. As our readers know, since its inception in 1988
as a newsletter, our publication has been titled <I>National Minority
Politics</I>. Several months ago, our corporate board of directors,
including the publisher and editor, decided that, as a move toward
expanding the magazine's base and ensuring future growth, we would
change the Publication's name.
<P>
Why a name change and why now, some might ask. The reasons are
varied and numerous. First our name was simply too long for a
magazine title. One-word or two-word titles in the magazine industry
are the general rule, and we wanted to bring our publication in
line with industry standards.
<P>
Second, our name became too much of an issue for some potential
subscribers and advertisers. The term &quot;minority&quot; has
many connotations, most of which, for our purposes, carried more
cons than pros. For example, &quot;minority&quot; usually means
a member of a racial minority, but in today's era of micro-classification,
now almost everyone qualifies as a minority. From a political
standpoint, the term &quot;minority&quot; also implies a liberal,
big government ideology. Because of this, many potential readers
also mistakenly presumed that our publication has a liberal slant,
which it clearly does not.
<P>
Others thought we were a political organization, rather than a
magazine. Still others thought that the magazine was only for
minorities, which is certainly not the case. Our readership is
racially and ethnically diverse, and we have made an effort to
see that it remains so. Without discourse across racial and ethnic
lines, we have no hope of ever solving any of the problems our
nation faces.
<P>
Third, our name was too narrow and confining. Yes, we do primarily
discuss political issues, but not exclusively. Yes, the majority
of our writers are black or Hispanic, but, more importantly, they
are excellent, deliberative thinkers. Labeling them as merely
&quot;minority&quot; writers somehow seemed to diminish their
credentials.
<P>
Finally, we wanted a name which implied that we were looking toward
the future, that we were winning the philosophical battle, that
we were ahead of the curve in presenting ideas on the nation's
most vital issues, that ours is not a racial magazine, but an
ideas magazine. We believe the name <I>Headway</I> does just that.
<P>
But for those who have expressed their preference for our current
format and content, not to worry. There will be no substantial
changes in the format or content. We will be adding a few new
writers and sections, but our approach to the issues--and our
promotion of the ideals of strong families, individual responsibility,
free enterprise and limited government--will remain constant.
<P>
We would like to express our thanks to our staff and writers,
many of whom have been with us since our expansion to a magazine
format. We would also like to thank our committed readers for
their support and for spreading the word about <I>National Minority
Politics</I>. We hope you will continue to be ambassadors for
<I>Headway</I> as well.
<P>
We're looking forward to a successful 1996, and extend the same
wishes to all our readers.
<P>

<h2>Editor's Roundup</h2><P>
<h3>February 1996</h3><p>
<img src="red-line.gif">
<P>

<P>
EDITOR'S PAGE<BR>

<P>
As our cover design illustrates,
the Republican Party presently has a serious public relations
problem. It is viewed as being too heavily weighted toward balancing
budgets and too light on compassion; in other words, out of balance.
<P>
Regarding the current budget debate,
polls show the largest share of the public--about 44 percent--blames
the Republican-controlled Congress for the paralyzing federal
government shutdown, a third blame President Clinton and about
half as many blame both.
<P>
In many regions once hostile to
Clinton, bumper stickers proclaiming, &quot;Clinton! At Least
He Cares,&quot; have replaced the more familiar, &quot;Impeach
Clinton.&quot;
<P>
&quot;The difficulty the Republican
Party faces,&quot; says Rob Mosbacher, a GOP activist in Texas
and son of the former Secretary of Commerce, &quot;is convincing
the American people that it is equally as enthusiastic about helping
people solve their problems as it is about cutting spending.&quot;
<P>
Author James Pinkerton agrees:
&quot;What the Republicans haven't done,&quot; says Pinkerton,
a former aide to President Bush, &quot;is convince the people
at the bottom half of the economy that there's something there
for them. I think they made a vision mistake by not going after
corporate welfare more energetically.&quot;
<P>
But rather than shore up their
credentials as good fiscal managers, the negotiations and subsequent
shutdown have instead made them look irresponsible and inept.
According to <I>U.S. News &amp; World Report</I>, preliminary
estimates suggest that the three-week episode cost at least $1
billion--on top of the estimated $700 million price tag for the
more extensive shutdown that lasted four working days last November.
<P>
The lack of balance in the GOP
message may explain the recent surge of Malcolm &quot;Steve&quot;
Forbes in Iowa and New Hampshire presidential polls. Although
Forbes has seemingly insurmountable political liabilities--being
the son of a wealthy man, having inherited hundreds of millions
of dollars, and possessing no elective experience--voters long
for a positive, upbeat message, which the millionaire publisher
provides along with his controversial flat tax proposal.
<P>
The remainder of the GOP presidential
field, including front-runner Sen. Robert Dole of Kansas, would
hardly be called an inspirational bunch. With the exceptions of
Lamar Alexander and Sen. Richard Lugar, they seem to be driven
more by the politics of fear, blame and resentment, than by optimism,
idealism or vision.
<P>
But there are some bright spots
on the Republican horizon. There are some GOP pols who understand
that perception is indeed reality. Freshman Rep. Sam Brownback
of Kansas blunted some voter outrage in his district by giving
back his pay during the first shutdown and setting up an escrow
account for it during the second.
<P>
Republican Sen. Dan Coats of Indiana
has authored a 19-part legislative agenda called the Project for
American Renewal, which includes a $500 tax credit for charitable
gifts. &quot;We need to reorient people back to what effective
compassion really means.&quot;
<P>
And Empower America founder Jack
Kemp recently unveiled recommendations for a single, low tax rate
for all Americans. Kemp and 13 others formed the National Commission
on Economic Growth and Tax Reform last year, at the behest of
Dole and House Speaker Newt Gingrich to unify Republicans on the
question of taxes.
<P>
In his comments at the Jan. 17
press conference where the commission's report was released, Kemp
stressed the importance of relieving the tax burden on the poor
and on working men and women. The former Secretary of Housing
and Urban Development is widely known--and is sometimes criticized--for
his ability to empathize with Americans at all income levels.
<P>
To turn around the public perception
that Republicans are mean-spirited, party leaders need to secure
more media exposure for spokespersons like Brownback, Coats, Kemp
and others who understand that, to become a majority party, they
must get votes not only from avowed conservatives, but from moderates
and independents as well.
<P>
Our three contributors to this
discussion of the GOP are all members of the party themselves.
Lynn Martin is a former congress member and was Secretary of Labor
during the Bush administration. Martin expresses confidence that
the GOP is aware of its errors and is working to correct them.
<P>
Walley Naylor is executive director
of the Mississippi Christian Coalition. In his piece, Naylor writes
that the party once represented a beacon of hope, but today &quot;that
beacon has burned out.&quot;
<P>
Jerry T. Burley ran unsuccessfully
in 1994 as the Republican nominee for Texas' 18th Congressional
District. Burley posits that the public's perception of party
members as a whole takes a toll on the prospects of those who
run for office championing the GOP banner.
<P>
Interestingly, all three link
the Republican Party's image of being insensitive toward the poor
to its failure to attract a significant portion of black votes.

<TITLE>Just What Is This Ball And Triangle Thing?  -- PFF</TITLE>

</HEAD>

<BODY bgcolor="#FFFFFF" background="notebook.gif" LINK="#8C1717" VLINK="#545454" ALINK="#FF0000"> <ul><blockquote><a href="/pff"><img src="pffdoc.gif" align="right" border="0"></a>

<h2>Just What Is This Ball And Triangle Thing?</h2>
<P>
<img src="bi.gif"><P>

We're always being asked what our logo represents, so we thought
we'd explain (but, believing in competition as we do, we thought
we'd offer a couple of alternatives -- each one has its own champions
internally).
<P>
<B>It's From the Story of Sisyphus</B>
<ul>
The Greek myth of Sisyphus, who was king of Corinth, holds that
he saw the god Zeus carry off the beautiful maiden Aegina.  Sisyphus
then told Aegina's father what he had witnessed. Enraged with
Sisyphus, Zeus condemned him to Tartarus, where he was compelled
for eternity to roll to the top of a steep hill a stone that always
rolled down again.(1) The struggle for both progress and freedom
is this -- never-ending, difficult, sometimes torturous.  Absent
inspired action, progress is replaced by atrophy.
</ul>
<B>It's From the 1939 World's Fair</B>
<ul>
Dominating the landscape at the New York World's Fair of 1939-1940
were a white obelisk and globe -- the Trylon and Perisphere --
that came to symbolize the meaning of the fair. For a nation just
coming out of a depression, the fair presented its overall theme
-- The World of Tomorrow -- as a very bright one,  through ever
inventive technology, brilliance of industrial and architectural
design, comprehensive planning, scientific progress and the democratic
ideology.  The fair presented a compelling and cohesive vision
of the world that the New Dealers told us they would make -- a
world based in an industrial planning model that now needs replacing.(2)
</ul>
<B>It's From an Economist's Graph</B> 
<ul>
The idea of progress is for obvious reasons associated with the
idea of change, but the two ideas are different.  Things never
stand still but always move ahead.  Yet the world being the way
it is, things rarely stay constant as they move, but progress
or decay, as in the graph below.<br>
<img src="arrows.gif">
<br>
The nature of progress being what it is, you must have a vision
and sense of right and wrong to know where you should be heading.
 From your starting point you must set out to build a better world,
or else you accept decay.  Thus, you must always be pushing to
ensure progress.(3)<br>

<H4>Introduction</H4>
<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<DD>In an attempt to keep Java, Netscape, Windows 95, the Communications Decency Act, the debate over encryption, Pat Buchanan and the rise of the "New Luddites" in perspective, The Progress & Freedom Foundation convened its Aspen Summit '96:  Cyberspace and the American Dream Conference August 4-6.
More than 150 people gathered in Aspen, Colorado, to explore the promise and peril of the Digital Revolution.  "We want to remind ourselves that America's continued progress in the Digital Revolution is not something to take for granted.  Great civilizations sometimes choose paths leading to decay  even, or perhaps especially, in a digital world," said Foundation President Jeffrey A. Eisenach.
<P>
<a name="first">
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<H4>First Panel</H4>
<P><IMG SRC="/pff/asp-pics/society.gif" ALIGN="left">
<DD>David Gergen of U.S. News & World Report moderated a panel discussion on "Shaping American Society for the Digital Age" that featured Philip Burgess of the Center for the New West, Esther Dyson of EDventure Holdings, David Gelernter of Yale University and Heather Higgins of PFF.
<DD>Dyson described how in the digital world people may need to distinguish between public and private persons.  A private person, using encryption technology as a defense mechanism to protect themselves, is ensured of confidentiality in one-to-one communications like e-mail.  However, when one posts information on the Internet for all to see, offers something to sell, or asks for credit to pay bills, that part of their activity becomes public and will require more disclosure and verification.
Gelernter, a Yale University computer scientist and author of 1939:  The Lost World of the Fair, said that America's biggest problems, our failing education system and struggling families, are things computers cannot deal with.  Basically, Gelernter said, we use computers for word processing, data manipulation, information storage and communication.  However, he asked, "compared to Americans in 1939, are we better writers?  More informed?  Better educated?  Richer communicators?"
After the discussion, Senator Bill Bradley (D-NJ) offered "a practical view" on the how the digital revolution is affecting American society.  "When I walk into a labor hall and a union member tells me that he just lost his manufacturing job, what am I supposed to say? 'Great, now you can go get a knowledge job.'"
<P>
<a name="second">
<BR>
<H4>Second Panel</H4>
<P>
<DD>A second panel discussion at the Summit, moderated by Peter Huber of the Manhattan Institute, featured author George Gilder, Jerry Jasinowski of the National Association of Manufacturers, Rich Karlgaard of Forbes ASAP and Jay Keyworth of PFF.  Les Vadasz of Intel offered the "practical view" of the technologies creating the new economy.
<DD>After a series of working group sessions on Education, Regulatory Convergence, Intellectual Property, and Privacy and Censorship, the Summit concluded with a debate on if the "Growth of the Internet is a 'Leading Cultural Indicator' of Progress."
<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<BR>
<a name="toffler">
<BR>
<H4>Toffler Explores Political Flexibility</H4>
<P>
<BR>
<DD>"What do Hillary Clinton and Newt Gingrich have in common?" asked author Alvin Toffler as he opened PFF's Aspen Summit '96.  "They both promised revolutionary change  Hillary in health care and Newt more broadly  and both were slapped down," he concluded.
<DD>Toffler's speech, titled "Future Shock in the Present Tense," described how Americans feel battered by the very acceleration of the Information Revolution.  "They want a chance to slow down and <IMG SRC="/pff/asp-pics/toffle.gif" ALIGN="left">catch their breath.  People, including companies, are disoriented and grasp after anything" that seems to offer reassurance.
<DD>The American political system, its very structure, Toffler said, is ultra stable and resists change.  "It punishes change makers like Hillary Clinton and Newt Gingrich."  Toffler explored whether Americans want a political system that is more flexible and thus might better adjust to the changes in society being engendered by the Information Revolution.  With too many alienated people, Toffler wondered if more flexibility in America's political structure might be needed to avoid violence.
<DD>Toffler also spoke about the importance of no longer discussing "the future of the economy" because it implies a continuation of the industrial age, but instead to focus on "the economy of the future," which will compel a redefinition of basic economic fundamentals.
<DD>In conclusion, Toffler said that the Information Age is shattering existing cultures around the world, and while we can "remain American, we cannot remain Americans of the past but will be Americans of the future."

<P>
<H4>Making Public Policy for Cyberspace</H4>
<P>
<BR>
<BR>
<DD>Representative Rick White (R-WA), co-chair of the bi-cameral and bi-partisan <IMG SRC="/pff/asp-pics/bradley.gif" ALT="Rep. Rick White and Sen. Bill Bradley at Aspen Summit '96"  ALIGN="right">Congressional Internet Caucus, addressed the Chairman's Dinner at PFF's Aspen Summit '96.  White urged the high-tech audience to learn how to effectively deal with Congress.  Until recently, the computer industry did not need to interact much with Washington, White said, but with their success has come increased government involvement in the industry.
<P>
<BR>
<a name="pull">
<P>
<BR>
<H4>It's Time to Pull the Plug on Federal Power</H4>
<P>
<BR>
<DD>Declaring that federally owned power facilities created during the New Deal have accomplished their mission, PFF released a white paper urging their privatization.  The <IMG SRC="/pff/asp-pics/1.gif" ALT="Rep. John Shadegg"  ALIGN=right>paper, co-authored by Representative John Shadegg (R-AZ) and Foundation Senior Fellow Michael Block, proposes a privatization method modeled on Czech experience, where consumers receive a portion of the money from privatization.
<DD>Power Marketing Administrations (PMA's) were designed to provide a supply of inexpensive power to impoverished rural areas; today, many of the once underdeveloped areas are affluent.   "PMAs' assets are of significant value to the private electric energy industry and, if sold by the government, would increase operating efficiency, eliminate market distortions, advance competition in electricity markets, and generate significant revenue for federal deficit reduction," argues the paper.
<DD>The paper  Lights Out on Federal Power:  Privatization for the   21st Century  outlines how the federal government should sell three PMA's, generating nearly $4.5 billion to reduce the budget deficit. 
<P>
<a name="telecom">
<P>
<H4>PFF Releases Telecom Book, The Innovation Age</H4>
<P>
<BR>
<DD>Peter K. Pitsch, PFF Adjunct Fellow and former Chief of Staff and Research Director at the FCC, authored the newly released Innovation Age:  A New Perspective on the Telecom Revolution.
<DD>Advancements in computer and digital information technologies have created an era of rapid economic, technological and social change that Pitsch calls the "Innovation Age."  Economic growth in this realm, argues Pitsch, depends on constant innovation and competition; therefore, government efforts to regulate these new technologies should adapt to reflect this new paradigm.
<DD>"Today's complexity and change make Hayek's 'spontaneous order' and Schumpeter's 'creative destruction' more compelling than ever before.  Peter Pitsch combines these concepts in a new economics of innovation that provides an illuminating view of telecom  both how to understand it and why market forces will regulate it best," says author George Gilder about The Innovation Age.
<P>
<a name="clean">
<P>
<H4>For Cleaner Air,  PFF Says Think Globally, Act Locally</H4>
<P>
<BR>
<DD>A new PFF white paper urges the creation of local Environmental Innovation Areas (EIAs) that recognize the variation in environmental conditions across America and thus will serve to solve regional pollution problems.  The paper calls for using EIAs as a means of promoting alternative fuel vehicles to meet clean air requirements and petroleum import reduction goals.
<DD>"Different regions face different pollution problems, and thus they must be given the flexibility to meet clean air requirements in ways best suited for their region," said Bruce Yandle, a co-author of the white paper, titled Clean Air and Emerging Alternative Fuel Vehicles:  A Time for Environmental Innovation Areas. 
<DD>"Alternative fuel  or non petroleum-based  vehicles pollute less and should serve as an important component of many regions' strategies for meeting clean air goals," says the paper.
<P>
<a name="forston">
<P>
<H4>Fortson Joins District Council</H4>
<P>
<BR>
<DD>Senior Fellow Jane Fortson, director of PFF's Social and Cultural Studies, continues her involvement in urban issues and the District of Columbia.  She recently joined other District leaders as a founding board member of the DC Agenda Support Corporation, an organization modeled after the highly successful Fund for the City of New York.  Additionally, she is participating in an advisory group examining revenue issues for the District, sponsored by the Brookings Institution.

<DD>"Kakumei:  Renewing rules and order.  It is a more comforting concept, to be sure, than 'revolution,' But it also more accurate.  Kakumei, not 'revolution' is the next challenge of the digital age."

<table>
<tr>
<td valign="top" width="20%">PFF is working to describe what a Transformation of American Life
driven by the new technologies of the information revolution really
means.  How will it change our fundamental values and beliefs?
 Society's elemental relationships?   The organization and workings
of our economy?  And our political compact with ourselves [or
is it, after all, between us and the state]?
<P>
If we can describe what is to come, we can show what is to be
done.  In addition, policy change is taking place in Washington,
in state legislatures, indeed, in governments around the world,
as policymakers attempt to understand the consequences of the
move from an analog to a digital world and its impact on regulatory
policy.  PFF is actively involved in the telecommunications debate,
focusing on the next generation of deregulation.
